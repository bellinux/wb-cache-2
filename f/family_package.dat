Maloney believes that [...] "some women already working were probably increasing their hours worked in order to qualify for family assistance payments". The authors class the results as preliminary - given the relatively recent introduction of the Working for <b>Families</b> <b>package.</b>|$|R
40|$|During the 1987 federal {{election}} campaign, the Prime Minister made the pledge that 'by 1990 no child {{will need to}} live in poverty'. As a first step towards that goal a <b>family</b> <b>package</b> was announced during the election and spelt out in greater detail in the 1987 - 88 Budget in September. This report analyses {{the impact of the}} <b>family</b> <b>package</b> on children living below the poverty line. The report begins by noting that financial poverty among dependent children has increased from around 6 per cent in the mid-sixties to 20 per cent by the mid-eighties. This corresponds to a rise in the total number of children in poverty from 233 thousand in 1966 to over 800 thousand in 1985 - 86. International comparisons of the incidence of child poverty {{at the turn of the}} decade also show Australia in a very poor light. Using standardised definitions, the incidence of. child poverty in Australia far exceeds that in a number of other industrialised economies with the exception of the United States. The report follows earlier research by using the poverty line developed by the Poverty Commission - the Henderson poverty line - to base its assessment of, the impact of the <b>family</b> <b>package.</b> It is argued that the incidence of poverty - the proportion of the population below the poverty line - is an insensitive measure against which to assess the impact of the <b>family</b> <b>package.</b> This is because poverty incidence only changes when families are moved from below the poverty line to above it. The report discusses an alternative measure, based on the concept of the poverty gap, and applies this to assess the <b>family</b> <b>package.</b> After describing the main elements in the <b>family</b> <b>package,</b> the report discusses the assumptions on which the assessment of its impact is based. In analysing the impact of the <b>family</b> <b>package</b> on child poverty, account is taken of housing costs, using projections derived from the 1981 - 82 Income and Housing Survey. The results indicate that about 100 thousand of the 540 thousand children in. pensioner and beneficiary families will be moved out of poverty by the <b>family</b> <b>package.</b> However, all such families with children will receive increased incomes, and it is estimated that the poverty gap is reduced by $ 160 million, from $ 350 million to $ 190 million. It is concluded that although the <b>family</b> <b>package</b> represents a significant improvement in the incomes of poor families, more will be required if the child poverty pledge is to be achieved. While additional income support measures are warranted, these need to be part of a co-ordinated, multidimensional policy approach. The report stresses the need for housing and employment policies which would help to ensure that families do not need to be so reliant on income support in the first place...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the appropriate value of the per child increment in the <b>Family</b> <b>Package</b> of income support measures for families with children. The assessment is carried out by comparing the proposed structure of payments with the results of research on the 'costs of children'. Aspects considered include the average cost of each child, the changing costs of children with age, economies of scale, and the distinction between income and expenditure patterns. It is concluded that despite the significant increases in relative payments to families with children further increases are still warranted, both to the basic rates of child payment and to the relative value of Mothers-Guardians' Allowance. Other features of the package such as the constant per child increment, whilst in conflict with the results of research on the costs of children, can be justified as compensation for the additional demands on savings and other resources faced by larger families...|$|E

40|$|The bacteriophages of the Cystoviridae <b>family</b> <b>package</b> their single {{stranded}} RNA genomic precursors into empty capsid (procapsids) using a hexameric packaging ATPase motor (P 4). This {{molecular motor}} shares sequence and structural similarity with RecA-like hexameric helicases. A concerted structural, mutational and kinetic analysis helped {{to define the}} mechanical reaction coordinate, i. e. the conformational changes associated with RNA translocation. The results also allowed us to propose a possible scheme of coupling between ATP hydrolysis and translocation which requires the cooperative action of three consecutive subunits. Here, we first test this model by preparing hexamers with defined proportions of wild type and mutant subunits and measuring their activity. Then, we develop a stochastic kinetic model which accounts for the catalytic cooperativity of the P 4 hexamer. Finally, we use the available structural information to construct a quantum-chemical model of the chemical reaction coordinate and obtain {{a detailed description of}} the electron density changes during ATP hydrolysis. The model explains the results of the mutational analyses and yields new insights into the role of several conserved residues within the ATP binding pocket. These hypotheses will guide future experimental work...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, green hybrid silicon {{semiconductor}} (HSS) {{laser driver}} is designed using voltage scaling techniques. Voltage scaling {{is very popular}} approach for reducing total power of integrated circuits. The HSS laser driver is designed using current mode logic (CML) technique, which is widely used technique for designing optical components. CML technique provides the strength to the laser driver for high frequencies mid-range infrared range. The HSS laser driver firstly, is developed in Matlab that consume very high power. After that, the HSS laser driver design is implemented on FPGA virtex- 6 <b>family,</b> <b>package</b> FF 784, XC 6 VCX 75 T device at speed of - 2 using voltage scaling technique. The HSS laser driver is operated at different mid infrared range frequencies on Matlab based model and FPGA model. It is concluded that using voltage scale technique on FPGA, power optimization is performed for the HSS laser driver. In results for different mid-range infrared frequencies more than 95 % power is saved by comparing the power consumption of Matlab based model and poweroptimized model using voltage scaling on FPGA. This energy efficient design of semiconductor laser can be integrated with other optical components to make optical communication system green...|$|E
40|$|Immediately upon taking office, the new Austrian {{government}} {{was forced to}} take action to narrow the growing gap in the financing of the national budget which was caused by the 2000 tax reform and the <b>family</b> <b>package.</b> In doing so it not only complied with its commitments under the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, but it also took advantage of the good economic situation which made prompt action advisable. At the same time this meant cancelling most of the benefits granted to the population on the expenditure and revenue side of the budget. The target for the 2002 budget deficit was reduced from – 1. 3 percent to 0 percent of GDP in just a few months. In view of this rapidly accelerated pace of consolidation, the distributive structures were naturally affected as well. The effect of the many individual measures on social groups and income strata can best be gauged when we look at income and consumption taxes and pensions. Here we find that cuts were greatest, in relative terms, at the medium and lower income levels, but not {{at the bottom of the}} income hierarchy. This applies most particularly to above-average pensions, which will suffer a greater loss from wage tax changes in 2001 than they gained by the tax reform of 2000. In assessing measures that affect company revenues we are confronted with complex issues of impact incidence, and we frequently need to consider second-round effects due to the shifting potential. The consolidation measures taken by the Federal Government in 2000 show signs of a refocus in the government's distribution policy. Nevertheless no ultimate concept has so far emerged, neither with regard to basic tax and pension reforms, nor in family policy, in the treatment of gainfully employed women and housewives, nor in the fiscal equalisation scheme for the federal and provincial governments.
