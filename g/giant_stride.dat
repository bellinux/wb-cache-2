6000|$|It wasn't, one felt, a fresh {{step forward}} in the matter {{so much as a}} <b>giant</b> <b>stride,</b> a leap. Mr. Butteridge {{remained}} in the air altogether for about nine hours, and during that time he flew with the ease and assurance of a bird. His machine was, however neither bird-like nor butterfly-like, nor had it the wide, lateral expansion of the ordinary aeroplane. The effect upon the observer was rather something in the nature of a bee or wasp. Parts of the apparatus were spinning very rapidly, and gave one a hazy effect of transparent wings; but parts, including two peculiarly curved [...] "wing-cases"--if one may borrow a figure from the flying beetles--remained expanded stiffly. In the middle was a long rounded body like the body of a moth, and on this Mr. Butteridge could be seen sitting astride, much as a man bestrides a horse.

60|$|He took a <b>giant</b> <b>stride,</b> a stride {{which was}} more like the spring of a maddened bull, towards Philip. The veneer of a {{spurious}} civilisation seemed to have fallen from him. He was the great and splendid animal, transformed with an overmastering passion. There was murder in his eyes. His great right arm, with its long, hairy fingers and its single massive ring, was like the limb of some prehistoric creature. Philip's brain and his feet, however, were alike nimble. He sprang a little on one side, and though that first blow caught him just {{on the edge of}} the shoulder and sent him spinning round and round, he saved himself by clutching at the desk. Fortunately, it was his left arm that hung helpless by his side. His fingers groped feverishly in the cavernous folds of his overcoat pocket. Power, who had dashed against the wall, smashing the glass of one of the pictures, had already recovered his balance and turned around. The little revolver, with whose use Philip was barely acquainted, flashed suddenly out in the lamplight. Even in that lurid moment he kept his nerve. He aimed at the right arm outstretched to strike him, and pulled the trigger. Through the little mist of smoke he saw a spasm of pain in his assailant's face, felt the thundering crash of his other arm, striking him on the side of the head. The room spun round. There was a second almost of unconsciousness.... When he came to, he was lying with his finger pressed against the electric bell. Power was clutching the desk for support, and gasping. The sober person in black, with a couple of footmen behind, were already in the room.... Their master turned to them.|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{the more}} one {{explored}} Mr. Smith's holiday luggage, the less one could make anything of it. One peculiarity {{of it was}} that almost everything seemed to be there for the wrong reason; what is secondary with every one else was primary with him. He would wrap up a pot or pan in brown paper; and the unthinking assistant would discover that the pot was valueless or even unnecessary, and that it was the brown paper that was truly precious. He produced two or three boxes of cigars, and explained with plain and perplexing sincerity that he was no smoker, but that cigar-box wood was by far the best for fretwork. He also exhibited about six small bottles of wine, white and red, and Inglewood, happening to note a Volnay which he knew to be excellent, supposed at first that the stranger was an epicure in vintages. He was therefore surprised to find that the next bottle was a vile sham claret from the colonies, which even colonials (to do them justice) do not drink. It was only then that he observed that all six bottles had those bright metallic seals of various tints, and seemed to have been chosen solely because they have the three primary and three secondary colours: red, blue, and yellow; green, violet and orange. There grew upon Inglewood an almost creepy sense of the real childishness of this creature. For Smith was really, so far as human psychology can be, innocent. He had the sensualities of innocence: he loved the stickiness of gum, and he cut white wood greedily as if he were cutting a cake. To this man wine was not a doubtful thing to be defended or denounced; it was a quaintly coloured syrup, such as a child sees in a shop window. He talked dominantly and rushed the social situation; but he was not asserting himself, like a superman in a modern play. He was simply forgetting himself, like a little boy at a party. He had somehow made the <b>giant</b> <b>stride</b> from babyhood to manhood, and missed that crisis in youth when most of us grow old.|$|E

6000|$|From time to {{time during}} and after lunch the high, insistent ring had summoned the Professor. He gave us the news as it came through {{to him in a}} few curt sentences. Such terrific items had never been {{registered}} in the world's history before. The great shadow was creeping up from the south like a rising tide of death. Egypt had gone through its delirium and was now comatose. Spain and Portugal, after a wild frenzy in which the Clericals and the Anarchists had fought most desperately, were now fallen silent. No cable messages were received any longer from South America. In North America the southern states, after some terrible racial rioting, had succumbed to the poison. North of Maryland the effect was not yet marked, and in Canada it was hardly perceptible. Belgium, Holland, and Denmark had each in turn been affected. Despairing messages were flashing from every quarter to the great centres of learning, to the chemists and the doctors of world-wide repute, imploring their advice. The astronomers too were deluged with inquiries. Nothing could be done. The thing was universal and beyond our human knowledge or control. It was death--painless but inevitable--death for young and old, for weak and strong, for rich and poor, without hope or possibility of escape. Such was the news which, in scattered, distracted messages, the telephone had brought us. The great cities already knew their fate and so far as we could gather were preparing to meet it with dignity and resignation. Yet here were our golfers and laborers like the lambs who gambol under the shadow of the knife. It seemed amazing. And yet how could they know? It had all come upon us in one <b>giant</b> <b>stride.</b> What was there in the morning paper to alarm them? And now it was but three in the afternoon. Even as we looked some rumour seemed to have spread, for we saw the reapers hurrying from the fields. Some of the golfers were returning to the club-house. They were running as if taking refuge from a shower. Their little caddies trailed behind them. Others were continuing their game. The nurse had turned and was pushing her perambulator hurriedly up the hill again. I noticed that she had her hand to her brow. The cab had stopped and the tired horse, with his head sunk to his knees, was resting. Above there was a perfect summer sky--one huge vault of unbroken blue, save for a few fleecy white clouds over the distant downs. If the human race must die to-day, it was at least upon a glorious death-bed. And yet all that gentle loveliness of nature made this terrific and wholesale destruction the more pitiable and awful. Surely it was too goodly a residence that we should be so swiftly, so ruthlessly, evicted from it! ...|$|E

In 1917 Platt exhibited at the International Society of Sculptors and at the Arts and Craft Society. Two of his best known prints, Snow in Springtime (1919) and The <b>Giant</b> <b>Stride</b> (1918) are from this period. Towards the end of World War I, he served in the Royal Army Service Corps.|$|E

He was also to train the requisite teaching force, and afterwards superintend their work. The salary of the new “Oberstudien Assessor” was fixed at 2000 gulden. Lessons were immediately begun with classes in two secondary schools for boys (the Gymnasium and the Realschule) and in the higher school for girls (Mädchen- or Töchterschule).

5000|$|The {{playground}} {{created in}} Paddington utilised {{the site of}} an early Brisbane cemetery which served the free settlers here from 1843 until 1875. The Paddington Cemeteries Act 1911 was passed to allow the land to be used for recreation purposes. The land on the southern side of Caxton Street became Lang Park and the land on the northern side was set aside as a reserve for the Ithaca Baths. On 13 June 1914 the remaining land on the northern side of Caxton Street was reserved for use as a children's playground. The original trusteeship lay with the Ithaca Shire Council, although the Brisbane City Council assumed the role on 15 April 1922. The land comprising the playground was twice increased in size; firstly in 1921 when the southern part of Moreton Street was closed and incorporated into the playground and secondly in 1934 when further land was adjacent to the first resumption was acquired for the playground. When the Inner North-West Ring Road (Hale Street [...] ) development occurred in the early 1990s, further land, previously unallocated state land, was given to the playground.The Ithaca Playground, as the Neal Macrossan Playground was first known, was the first playground with which the Playground Association of Queensland was involved. The siting of the Ithaca Playground {{in the midst of a}} dense working class suburb on a previously disused publicly owned site reflects one of the fundamental aims of the Playground Association - to facilitate the full development of all children and to provide aid to those children who may not otherwise fulfil their potential. The designer of the Ithaca Playground is thought to have been Robert Black, an authorised surveyor and town engineer whose name appears on plans of the original planned site. The official catalogue of the Second Annual Town Planning Conference and Exhibition in 1918 included this plan which was titled, 'Plan of Children's Playground together with the Creche Kindergarten Free Library and Swimming Baths, Town of Ithaca' dated July 1918. It is interesting that the plan incorporates all of these elements which, though run by different organisations, were obviously components of a large public facility aimed at family welfare. The plan of the playground was not realised as fully as the drawing suggests. The proposed plan incorporated many elements formally laid out using axial lines, symmetry and focal points. Included on the lower terrace of the plan, allocated for boys' play was an oval for football, cricket and sports; a <b>giant</b> <b>stride,</b> open space, shelter shed with storage and an area for playing marbles and tops, appliances (equipment) for senior boys, appliance for junior boys; playing area for junior boys, a wading pool and a sand pit. The upper terrace, closer to the Creche and Kindergarten and allocated for the play of girls and infants, was a children's free library, appliances for senior girls, games area, appliances for junior girls, sand pit, concreted area for ball games, basket ball court, central shelter, and appliances for kindergarten children with separate sand pit and wading pool. The plan suggests that these elements should all be divided, by garden beds, pathways and screens. The Ithaca Swimming Pool was at the southern end of the site near adjacent to the boys playing area. The land tapered toward the south, meaning supervisors housed in the administrative room provided in the free library would have all areas of the playground in view. The playground resulting from this planning was apparently less substantially built up, but the zoning and terracing was recognisable.|$|E

30|$|For a start, {{the concept}} of human {{grouping}} which {{has emerged as a}} way to simplify the process of understanding and utilising socioeconomic factors in selecting an appropriate incentive is yet to be fully explored in the context of mobile crowdsensing [1]. The idea behind human grouping, for purpose of designing effective incentive mechanisms, is that participants in each group will share similar social and economic goals, different from other groups and hence would be motivated differently. The importance of incorporating human grouping into mobile crowdsensing, a process described by Lane [122] as community-aware sensing, has been emphasised in several studies, including [123, 124]. GroupMe, proposed in [124] is a <b>giant</b> <b>stride</b> in this direction to help facilitate the discovery of groups within mobile crowdsensing systems. However, several research challenges still need to be adequately addressed in order to fully maximise the potential of using human grouping to improve the outcomes of decision making related to appropriateness of incentive mechanism. A typical example is how to accurately design robust solutions to automatically identify and characterize mobile users into virtual communities and social networks {{in a way that is}} both dynamic and privacy-friendly.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{we tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that P. tuber-regium will protect and reduce lipid peroxidation in the testes of CCl 4 intoxicated Sprague Dawley rats. P. tuber-regium possesses active phytochemicals that, when present in the diet of rats, can supply exogenous antioxidant capacity to ameliorate oxidative stress [13]. Oxidative stress {{appears to be a}} major contributor in male infertility and development of effective antioxidants to combat it will be a <b>giant</b> <b>stride</b> in the prevention and management of male sexual dysfunction [28, 29]. Administration of CCl 4 increased significantly both the absolute and relative organ weights of the testes. This increase may be due to increase in lipid peroxidation induced by the highly reactive metabolites of CCl 4 that may possibly activate the inflammatory pathway leading to edema [5, 30]. CCl 4 metabolites react with poly unsaturated fatty acids and form covalent adducts with lipids and proteins that lead to lipid peroxide formation and destruction of cell membranes and consequently testis injury [31]. Amelioration of this effect was seen in the groups that were treated with P. tuber-regium suggesting its abilities to mop up free radicals generated by CCl 4 [32]. The protective effects of P. tuber-regium against oxidative stress in rat testis that we observed in this study are consistent with those reported for medicinal plants with known antioxidant properties, such as Launaea procumbens [5].|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examined}} Nigeria's effort {{towards the}} development of its human resources to realize the achievement of vision 20 : 2020. It was noted that Nigeria focused on use of education as a yardstick to {{the development of}} its citizenry. Hence, series of educational reforms were made to uplift the standard of education in order to produce skilful manpower that will fit into the labour market, to grow the economy of the nation. Efforts made seem to have been affected by numerous challenges that the educational system has not really realized its intended objectives in terms of developing its skilful manpower. In an attempt to develop the wealth of the nation, a <b>giant</b> <b>stride</b> was the introduction of vision 20 : 2020.

Perhaps, an effective sectoral manpower development and utilization planning cycle might be a panacea to human resource development strategies for effective development of the nation. This will reflect attempts to eradicate poverty and develop wealth creation where employment opportunities might be available for its educated manpower to grow its economy. Recommendations were made on how to improve efforts made for realizing vision 20 : 2020. One of the recommendations is that government should develop and improve the quality of education in order to produce skilful manpower that will fit into the labour market to raise the economy of the nation...|$|E
