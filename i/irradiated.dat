5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were <b>irradiated</b> for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was {{extracted}} and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs <b>irradiated</b> both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In many {{cropping}} systems {{most of the}} light <b>irradiates</b> the adaxial side of leaves. However, in {{cropping systems}} with intra canopy lighting a reasonable fraction of light may <b>irradiate</b> even the abaxial side of the leaves. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of <b>irradiating</b> the abaxial leaf side compared to <b>irradiating</b> the adaxial side, in rose plants grown in glasshouse with the bending technique. The instantaneous effects on the optical properties and the light response of photosynthesis were analysed in intact leaves. Results demonstrated that the rate of net photosynthesis was higher when leaves were lighted from the adaxial side compared to the abaxial side. This was the consequence of both a higher light absorption and higher quantum yield (photosynthesis per unit absorbed light) in adaxial-lighted leaves...|$|R
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing <b>irradiated</b> uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of <b>irradiated</b> slugs had been processed.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was <b>irradiated</b> and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The Fat Man implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|That the {{metallurgy}} {{of plutonium}} was completely unknown {{came as no}} surprise at all, for it had only recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium <b>irradiated</b> in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.|$|E

By this time, 299 batches of <b>irradiated</b> slugs had been processed. A radioisotope building, a steam plant, and other structures were added in April 1946 to support the laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. All work was completed by December 1946, adding another $1,009,000 to the cost of construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000. Operational costs added another $22,250,000.|$|E

5|$|Uranium has {{the highest}} number (25) of both natural and {{synthetic}} isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217–242, and three of them, 234U, 235U and 238U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, {{the most important is}} 233U, which is a final product of transformations of 232Th <b>irradiated</b> by slow neutrons. 233U has a much higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with 235U.

5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are <b>irradiated</b> by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

25|$|Australia banned <b>irradiated</b> {{cat food}} after a {{national}} scare where cats suffered from paralyzation after eating a specific brand of highly <b>irradiated</b> catfood {{for an extended}} period of time. The suspected culprit was malnutrition from consuming food depleted of Vitamin A by the irradiation process. The incident was linked only to a single batch of one brand's product and no illness was linked to any of that brand's other <b>irradiated</b> batches of the same product or to any other brand of <b>irradiated</b> cat food. This, along with incomplete evidence indicating that the cat food was not sufficiently depleted of Vitamin A makes irradiation a less likely cause. Further research has been able to experimentally induce the paralyzation of cats by via Vitamin A deficiency by feeding highly <b>irradiated</b> food.
