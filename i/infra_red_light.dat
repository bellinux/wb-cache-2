An electronic sensor device that has the capability to measure physiological signs of saturation of arterial oxygen (SpO 2) and heart beat rate {{of the human body}} has been developed in this study. The hardware design of the sensor device consists of a microcontroller PIC 18 F 452, an external flash memory, and a transceiver unit. The most suitable sensors of <b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> LEDs are installed on the arms of the plastic clip and functioned with the right resistor values. The <b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are detected by the photo diode and converted to digital numbers by the Assembly Language software program embedded into the microcontroller PIC 18 LF 452. Those digital numbers are converted to SpO 2 value in percentage level. A low power dual operational amplifier LM 358 is used to amplify the current signal of the two lights, which depends on the intensity and visibility of the two lights. The output signals are displayed in 16 characters and 2 lines on Hitachi HD 44870 compatible liquid crystal display (LCD). In order to display this data on personal computer (PC) monitor, the data is also transmitted via Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) ports of microcontroller to a PC. A Visual Basic 6 programming language is installed in the PC to display the wave forms, the percentage of the SpO 2 level, and the pulse rate. Pulse oximetry has a promising future in the healthcare industry. This research enables a more efficient and economical means for managing the healthcare of the growing population...|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{measurement}} of oxygen {{level and pulse}} rate {{is very important for}} aged people, pregnant women and in many other critical situations. This is commonly monitored by a pulse oxymeter. This paper presents a low-cost and a miniaturized pulse oxymeter to continuously measure patient‟s blood-oxygen saturation level (SpO 2) and pulse rate. Change in intensity of light transmitted through tissue due to arterial blood pulse can be measured as a voltage signal called the photoplethysmographm (PPG). Oxygenated blood has different light absorption characteristics than deoxygenated blood under <b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> wavelengths. So the hardware implementation is included placing of two LEDs (<b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red)</b> on the patient‟s finger and a photo detector on opposite side of the LEDs to get the corresponding PPG signals which are used to estimate the SpO 2 by comparing the absorption characteristics of the two different colored <b>light</b> (<b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red).</b> As the PPG signal is mostly corrupted by patient‟s hand movement, it is given to LabView window by DAQ card for further signal processing. In this paper a low pass filter is used for removing motion artifacts and a moving average algorithm is applied to remove high frequency noise content. The SpO 2 is calculated by computing the AC and DC components of both the <b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> LEDs corresponding PPG signals.

40|$|A {{fibre optic}} sensor for methane gas using the "differential absorption" {{referencing}} technique {{has been designed}} and constructed. <b>Infra</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> in the 1. 66 pm spectral region is absorbed by methane {{and this is the}} operating principle of the sensor. The system employs a novel LED, manufactured by GEC Marconi Ltd., as an <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> source. The LED couples more power into single mode fibre than any other device of its type which is commercially available. The light is transmitted to a gas cell via single mode fibres and a fibre optic coupler, where some of it is absorbed according to the concentration of methane present. Two optical interference filters with transmissions at absorbing and non-absorbing spectral regions, respectively, are used in dual wavelength referencing mode to remove any interferences from non gas dependent parameters (e. g. dust in the cell). A calibration curve for the sensor is determined by plotting the values of the attenuated light signals against the corresponding concentrations of methane in the gas cell. A full characterisation of each component of the system was undertaken and the systems overall performance determined. The system has a limit of detection of 0. 077 % CH 4. This is a factor of 18 below the specification requirement for the project, which is 1. 25 % CH 4 in air (i. e. 25 % of the Lower Explosive Limit). The= system has a resolution of 0. 025 % CH 4 and shows both good repeatability and reproducibility. The main problem associated with the system is the critical temperature dependence of the optical interference filters, whose transmissions vary with temperature changes of 0. 1 °C and therefore affect the system stability...|$|E
30|$|TOF cameras {{illuminate}} the scene by <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> emitting diodes. The optical {{power of this}} modulated light source has to be chosen based on a compromise between image quality and eye safety; the larger the optical power, the more photoelectrons per pixel will be generated, and hence the higher the signal-to-noise ratio and therefore {{the accuracy of the}} range measurements. On the other hand, the power has to be limited to meet safety requirements. Due to the limited optical power, TOF depth images are rather noisy and therefore relatively inaccurate. Equally important is the influence of the different reflectivity of objects in the scene, which reduce the reflected optical power and increase the level of noise in the depth image. Interferences can also be caused by external sources of light and multiple reflections from different surfaces.|$|E

However most people around the world like to cook large meals at night, when the sun is not shining.

The final battery design was a large block of concrete with a system of copper fins running though it. Three main tests were conducted. The first two utilized an array of <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> bulbs to heat up the array, and did store enough energy to cook with.

40|$|A {{scanning}} microscope utilizing two-photon excitation {{in combination}} with fluorescence lifetime contrast is presented. The microscope makes use of a tunable femtosecond titanium:sapphire laser enabling the two-photon excitation of {{a broad range of}} fluorescent molecules, including UV probes. Importantly, the penetration depth of the two-photon exciting (<b>infra)</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> is substantially greater than for the corresponding single-photon wavelength while photobleaching is significantly reduced. The time structure of the Ti:Sa laser can be employed in a straightforward way for the realization of fluorescence lifetime imaging. The fluorescence lifetime is sensitive to the local environment of the fluorescent molecule. This behaviour can be used for example to quantify concentrations of ions, such as pH and Ca 2 +, or pO 2 and pCO 2. In the set-up presented here the fluorescence lifetime imaging is accomplished by time-gated single photon counting. The performance and optical properties of the microscope are investigated by a number of test measurements on fluorescent test beads. Point-spread functions calculated from measurements on 230 -nm beads using an iterative restoration procedure compare well with theoretical expectations. Lifetime imaging experiments on a test target containing two different types of test bead in a fluorescent buffer all with different lifetimes (2. 15 ns, 2. 56 ns and 3. 34 ns) show excellent quantitative agreement with reference values obtained from time correlated single photon counting measurements. Moreover, the standard deviation in the results can be wholly ascribed to the photon statistics. Measurements of acridine orange stained biofilms are presented {{as an example of the}} potential of two-photon excitation combined with fluorescence lifetime contrast. Fluorescence lifetime and intensity images were recorded over the whole sample depth of 100 μm. Fluorescence intensity imaging is seriously hampered by the rapid decrease of the fluorescence signal as a function of the depth into the sample.
