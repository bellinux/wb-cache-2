40|$|Reports {{from the}} 2000 and 2001 seed corn crop {{indicated}} quality problems after the seed was sized, conditioned and then planted. These problems were not {{predicted by the}} traditional measures of warm and cold germination. We suspect that damage to the seed, especially that of newer, more fragile hybrids, was occurring in the sizing of the corn seed, and that a different sizing method would result in less damage. A seed corn sizing method utilizing a flat screen sizing system was compared to conventional round <b>cylinder</b> precision <b>graders,</b> using production sized machines operating at their rated capacities. Test results showed the flat screen sizing method caused less damage to the seed, {{as measured by the}} fast green dye test, than did cylinder sizing. There were no significant trends between the two in terms of warm and cold germination. This may explain why warm and cold germination tests did not predict quality problems when the seed was planted—seed damaged in the commonly used <b>cylinder</b> <b>graders</b> was more susceptible to conditions that affected actual field germination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper, we {{consider}} a two-dimensional contact {{problem of a}} rigid <b>cylinder</b> <b>indenting</b> on an elastic half space with surface tension. Based on the solution of a point force acting on a substrate with surface tension, we derive the singular integral equation of this problem. By using the Guass–Chebyshev quadrature formula, the integral equation is solved numerically to illuminate the influence of surface tension on the contact response. It is found that when the contact width is comparable with the ratio of surface tension to elastic modulus, surface tension significantly alters the pressure distribution in the contact region and the contact width. Compared {{to that of the}} classical Hertzian contact, the existence of surface tension decreases the displacements on the half plane and yields a continuous slope of normal stress and displacements across the contact fringe. In addition, it predicts the increase of hardness as the radius of <b>indent</b> <b>cylinder</b> decreasing. The obtained results are useful for the measurement of mechanical properties of materials based on the indentation technique...|$|R

This paper describes {{the research}} conducted on the crops Calendula officinalis and Dimorphotheca pluvialis, using three harvesting methods: combining (New Holland 8070), combining after chemical desiccation and combining after windrowing. Gross yield, moisture content of harvested seeds and foliage, seed losses and impurities of the seeds were measured. It was found that both crops could best be harvested with a combine harvester after chemical desiccation. Timely harvest seemed to be important to avoid weather damage and excessive seed shedding.

Due to its characteristics FIMEC test is usefully employed to measure the mechanical properties of semifinished and finished products (pin squeeze casting process, extrusion, welding, compaction etc.).

In order to obtain a local mechanical characterization of dentin, FIMEC (Flat-top <b>cylinder</b> <b>Indenter</b> for mechanical characterization), 1 an instrumented indentation technique, has been employed. FIMEC uses a cylindrical punch and permits local measurements of Young’s modulus E, yield stress Y, stress-relaxation and creep. The punch diameter (Φ = 0. 5 mm) is {{much larger than the}} tubule size thus data are not so largely scattered as in micro- and nano-indentation tests but, at the same time, is small enough to guarantee a good resolution in mapping the mechanical properties in different tooth positions.

40|$|Contact {{between two}} {{surfaces}} occurs when mechanical components work. These contact {{can be categorized}} as static contact, sliding contact, or rolling contact. For an example, the sliding contact occurs when ring piston slide over a cylinder liner on motorcycle engine. One of the contact theory, developed by Hertz analytically, is valid only for elastic contact. In this study the formulation of Hertz is used as initial validation of the present model simulation. This project studies a case of static contact between the <b>cylinder</b> (<b>indenter)</b> and the flat plate (target surface). The displacement which is used as an input on the contact between a cylinder on a flat surface, play the important {{role in determining the}} resulted von Mises stress and contact area. In addition to the static contact, sliding contact simulation is also studied in this project with the variation of friction coefficient as input.

Results regarding different materials, {{most of them}} of fusion interest, show the general validity of the method. Moreover, indication on the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of martensitic steels has been drawn by performing tests at different temperatures. FIMEC offers the possibility to perform several tests on a small volume of material, e. g. {{it has been estimated}} that 18 indentations can be made on a single disk (Phi = 25 mm, h = 5 mm), For this reason, its application is of interest to characterize materials irradiated in the future IFMIF or in other sources. with a limited irradiation volume.

40|$|The {{effect of}} soft elasticity, i. e., a {{relatively}} small value of the ratio of Young's modulus to yield strength and plastic compressibility on the indentation of isotropically hardening elastic-viscoplastic solids is investigated. Calculations are carried out for indentation of a perfectly sticking rigid sharp <b>indenter</b> into a <b>cylinder</b> modeling indentation of a half space. The material {{is characterized by a}} finite strain elastic-viscoplastic constitutive relation that allows for plastic as well as elastic compressibility. Both soft elasticity and plastic compressibility significantly reduce the ratio of nominal indentation hardness to yield strength. A linear relation is found between the nominal indentation hardness and the logarithm of the ratio of Young's modulus to yield strength, but with a different coefficient than reported in previous studies. The nominal indentation hardness decreases rapidly for small deviations from plastic incompressibility and then decreases rather slowly for values of the plastic Poisson's ratio less than 0. 25. For both soft elasticity and plastic compressibility, the main reason for the lower values of indentation hardness is related to the reduction in the hydrostatic stress level in the material below the indenter...|$|R
40|$|Quasi static {{indentation}} test {{is a method}} consist of applying a compressive axial load using head of <b>indenter</b> to moulded <b>cylinders</b> at a rate which is within a prescribe range until failure occurs. The behaviour of foamed concrete under {{indentation test}} should behave like cellular material behavior. The Stress-strain behavior {{can be divided into}} three regimes, elastic regime, plateau regime and densification regime. There is still less research conducted toward foamed concrete under indentation test. It is stated that the standard method to obtain the compressive strength of foamed concrete based on ASTM C 39 standard or BS 1881 : Part 116 : 1983 is not captured the true compressive strength of foamed concrete. The compressive strength typically achieved low compressive strength and not behaves like a cellular material behavior. This result is due brittle collapse of the sample. Previous study has shows the compressive strength under indentation test is higher and created a localized deformation. Besides, there is a densified zone created below the indenter region which is end with hemi-spherical shape.. Tear line occur because of exrended in front of the indenter and perpendicular to the indenter surface. This study aims to investigate further about the behavior of foamed concrete. This study was look about effect of densities and size of indenter on behavior of foamed concrete under indentation test. The density used is low density, medium density and high density. Size of indenter used is 20 mm, 30 mm, 50 mm and 70. 5 mm. Under indentation test, the higher densities, the higher compressive strength and the bigger size of indenter used, the strength is decreased due to the early crack initiation and propagation. It is important to know the ratio used to make sure indentation test is captured the true strength. </p...|$|R
