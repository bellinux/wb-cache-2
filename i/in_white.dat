40|$|Background-The genetic {{background}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> and African Americans is largely unknown. Genes in cardiovascular pathways {{have not been}} systematically investigated. Methods and Results-We examined a panel of approximately 50 000 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2095 cardiovascular candidate genes and AF in 3 cohorts with participants of European (n = 18 524; 2260 cases) or African American descent (n = 3662; 263 cases) in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Candidate Gene Association Resource. Results <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> were followed up in the German Competence Network for AF (n = 906, 468 cases). The top result was assessed in relation to incident ischemic stroke in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Stroke Consortium (n = 19 602 whites, 1544 incident strokes). SNP rs 4845625 in the IL 6 R gene was associated with AF (relative risk [RR] C allele, 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 85 - 0. 95; P = 0. 0005) <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> but did not reach statistical significance in African Americans (RR, 0. 86; 95 % CI, 0. 72 - 1. 03; P = 0. 09). The results were comparable in the German AF Network replication, (RR, 0. 71; 95 % CI, 0. 57 - 0. 89; P = 0. 003). No association between rs 4845625 and stroke was observed <b>in</b> <b>whites.</b> The known chromosome 4 locus near PITX 2 <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> also was associated with AF in African Americans (rs 4611994; hazard ratio, 1. 40; 95 % CI, 1. 16 - 1. 69; P = 0. 0005). Conclusions-In a community-based cohort meta-analysis, we identified genetic association in IL 6 R with AF <b>in</b> <b>whites.</b> Additionally, we demonstrated that the chromosome 4 locus known from recent genome-wide association studies <b>in</b> <b>whites</b> is associated with AF in African Americans.

5|$|Symphony <b>in</b> <b>White,</b> No. 3, is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows two women dressed <b>in</b> <b>white,</b> one sitting on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony <b>in</b> <b>White,</b> No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of Stropharia caerulea {{feature a}} greenish-blue cap sparsely covered <b>in</b> <b>white</b> flecks of veil at the margin, and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. Gills on the cap {{underside}} have an adnate or sinuate {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered <b>in</b> <b>white</b> scales up to a thin, transient ring. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on the cap, and darker gills with white edges.|$|E
5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony <b>in</b> <b>White,</b> No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also {{an expression of the}} theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies became more and more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony <b>in</b> <b>White,</b> No. 1 and Symphony <b>in</b> <b>White,</b> No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E
