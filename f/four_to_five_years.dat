5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow {{in a range of}} soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} is gregarious in nature. No {{distinct}} leader or any hierarchy is {{noted in the}} social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, {{at the age of}} <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four or five bulls may share the same home range. Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E

In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and allegories.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> The birds are colonial nesters, {{excavating}} burrows on grassy clifftops or reusing existing holes, and may also nest in crevices and amongst rocks and scree on occasion. It is in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. It can excavate its own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit and has been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin's living quarters resulting in the loss of the egg. They are monogamous (they mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding the chick.|$|E

40|$|Protocol: The study {{reported}} information from case records of 17 new {{mothers and their}} children who received an agency's services. Mother's expectations about their child's accomplishment of four developmental tasks (controlled crying, walking, toilet training and accepting discipline) were compared with mother's practices over a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> period. Participants: Seventeen adult women (currently 18 years and older) who were mothers of newborns and who received continuous agency services during a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> period agreed <b>to</b> participate in the case record review. Information Handling: When mother's signed release form was returned, the agency made the mother's case record available for selecting information pertinent to the study questions. The investigator focused on the caseworker's anecdotal notes of home visits, written narrative interviews, biannual goal-setting forms, and the Denver Developmental Screening Tests (Denver II) related to the mother and baby. Analysis: Information was grouped around two major themes. One theme was the mothers' expectation statements and mothers' practices about their child's development. The other major theme was {{the description of the}} caseworker's informal educational techniques and role modeling of appropriate behaviors. Conclusions: The most common developmental patterns were: Eleven of 17 mothers held expectations about their behaviors related to controlled crying; seven of 17 mothers' expectations matched their child's age for walking; nine of 17 mothers' behaviors didn't match their expectations related to toilet training their child; and seven of 17 mothers' behaviors matched their expectations with regard to accepting discipline. The most common pattern was that the case worker provided appropriate amounts of literature; discussed development, both general and focused, at numerous home visits; administered and discussed developmental testing approximately every six months; referred and coordinated developmental delay treatments; and assist the mother in providing the treatment plans.
