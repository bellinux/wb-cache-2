5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated <b>glucosamine</b> precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of <b>glucosamine,</b> which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of <b>glucosamine</b> that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar <b>glucosamine</b> (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>glucosamine</b> is controversial. Reviews {{have found it}} to be equal to or slightly better than placebo.

When comparing <b>glucosamines</b> of different metals, the influence {{of the nature of the}} metal on the activity is not very strong. The most active complex was CoGlit-R. The oxidation peak was used to determine melatonin in the concentration range of 10 (- 8) - 10 (- 5) M with a detection limit of 2. 15 x 10 (- 7) M (LOD). Our results indicate that the current peak is under mass transport control and probably suggest that chemical reactions coupled with electrochemical steps are involved.

40|$|Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are {{essential}} for growth and survival of all cells. When polyamine biosynthesis is inhibited, there is up-regulation of import. The mammalian polyamine transport system is unknown. We have previously shown that the heparan sulfate (HS) side chains of recycling glypican- 1 (Gpc- 1) can sequester spermine, that intracellular polyamine depletion increases the number of NO-sensitive N-unsubstituted <b>glucosamines</b> in HS, and that NO-dependent cleavage of HS at these sites is required for spermine uptake. The NO is derived from S-nitroso groups in the Gpc- 1 protein. Using RNA interference technology as well as biochemical and microscopic techniques applied to both normal and uptake-deficient cells, we demonstrate that inhibition of Gpc- 1 expression abrogates spermine uptake and intracellular delivery. In unperturbed cells, spermine and recycling Gpc- 1 carrying HS chains rich in N-unsubstituted <b>glucosamines</b> were co-localized. By exposing cells to ascorbate, we induced release of NO from the S-nitroso groups, resulting in HS degradation and unloading of the sequestered polyamines as well as nuclear targeting of the deglycanated Gpc- 1 protein. Polyamine uptake-deficient cells {{appear to have a}} defect in the NO release mechanism. We have managed to restore spermine uptake partially in these cells by providing spermine NONOate and ascorbate. The former bound to the HS chains of recycling Gpc- 1 and S-nitrosylated the core protein. Ascorbate released NO, which degraded HS and liberated the bound spermine.

40|$|Heparan sulfates (HS) bind a {{diversity}} of protein ligands on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix and thus can modulate cell signaling. The state of sulfation in <b>glucosamines</b> and uronic acids within the chains strongly influences their binding. We have previously cloned and characterized two human extracellular endoglucosamine 6 -sulfatases, HSulf- 1 and HSulf- 2, which selectively liberate the 6 -O sulfate groups on <b>glucosamines</b> present in N, 6 -O, and 2 -O trisulfated disaccharides of intact HS and heparins. These enzymes serve important roles in development and are upregulated {{in a number of}} cancers. To determine whether the Sulfs act on the trisulfated disaccharides that exist on the cell surface, we expressed HSulfs in cultured cells and performed a flow cytometric analysis with the RB 4 CD 12, an anti-HS antibody that recognizes N- and O-sulfated HS saccharides. The endogenously expressed level of the cell surface RB 4 CD 12 epitope was greatly diminished in CHO, HEK 293, and HeLa cells transfected with HSulf- 1 or HSulf- 2 cDNA. In correspondence with the RB 4 CD 12 finding, the N, 6 -O, and 2 -O trisulfated disaccharides of the HS isolated from the cell surface/extracellular matrix were dramatically reduced in the Sulf-expressed HEK 293 cells. We then developed an ELISA and confirmed that the RB 4 CD 12 epitope in immobilized heparin was degraded by purified recombinant HSulf- 1 and HSulf- 2, and conditioned medium (CM) of MCF- 7 breast carcinoma cells, which contain a native form of HSulf- 2. Furthermore, HSulf- 1 and HSulf- 2 exerted activity against the epitope expressed on microvessels of mouse brains. Both HSulf activities were potently inhibited by PI- 88, a sulfated heparin mimetic with anti-cancer activities.

40|$|Oxidative {{degradation}} of biological substrates by hypochlorous acid has been examined under reaction {{conditions similar to}} those found in active phagosomes. Iron sulfur proteins are bleached extremely rapidly, followed in decreasing order by beta-carotene, nucleotides, porphyrins, and heme proteins.

Other compounds, including <b>glucosamines,</b> quinones, riboflavin, and, except for N-chlorination, phospholipids, are unreactive. Rapid irreversible oxidation of cytochromes, adenine nucleotides, and carotene pigments occurs when bacterial cells are exposed to exogenous hypochlorous acid; with Escherichia coli, titrimetric oxidation of cytochrome was found to coincide with loss of aerobic respiration. The occurrence of these cellular reactions implicates hypochlorous acid as a primary microbicide in myeloperoxidase-containing leukocytes; the reactivity patterns observed are consistent with the view that bactericidal action results primarily from loss of energy-linked respiration due to destruction of cellular electron transport chains and the adenine nucleotide pool...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fibroblast Growth Factor- 2 (FGF 2) {{is a major}} inducer of neovascularization (angiogenesis). Heparin {{activates}} FGF 2 by favoring {{formation of}} ternary complexes with its cellular receptors (FGFRs).

The structure of the prevalent sequences of the novel heparin derivative has been confirmed by mono- and two-dimensional NMR analysis. NMR spin-lattice relaxation times (T 2) and nuclear Overhauser effects suggest that the sU residues act as flexible joints between the PST sequences and cause a marked distortion of the chain conformation of heparin required for formation of ternary complexes. Since the splitting reaction also occurs {{at the level of the}} essential glucuronic acid residue of the active site for antithrombin, the heparin derivative has no anticoagulant activity. However, it fully retains the FGF 2 -binding ability of the original heparin, as shown by its capacity to protect FGF 2 from trypsin cleavage and to prevent the formation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) /FGF 2 /FGFR 1 ternary complexes.

Our previous studies have reported the cloning, characterization, recombinant expression, and structure-function analysis in Escherichia coli of the Flavobacterium heparinum 2 -O-sulfatase and 6 -O-sulfatase enzymes that cleave O-sulfate groups from specific locations of the HSGAG polymer. Building on these preceding studies, we report here the molecular cloning and recombinant expression in Escherichia coli of an N-sulfamidase, specific for HSGAGs.

When S-nitrosylated glypican- 1 is then exposed to an appropriate reducing agent, such as ascorbate, nitric oxide is released and autocatalyzes deaminative cleavage of the glypican- 1 heparan sulfate side chains at sites where the <b>glucosamines</b> are N-unsubstituted. These processes {{take place in a}} stepwise manner, whereas glypican- 1 recycles via a caveolin- 1 -associated pathway where copper ions could be provided by the prion protein. Here we show, by using both biochemical and microscopic techniques, that (a) the glypican- 1 core protein binds copper(II) ions, reduces them to copper(I) when the thiols are nitrosylated and reoxidizes copper(I) to copper(II) when ascorbate releases nitric oxide; (b) maximally S-nitrosylated glypican- 1 can cleave its own heparan sulfate chains at all available sites in a nitroxyl ion-dependent reaction; (c) free zinc(II) ions, which are redox inert, also support autocleavage of glypican- 1 heparan sulfate, probably via transnitrosation, whereas they inhibit copper(II) -supported degradation; and (d) copper(II) -loaded but not zinc(II) -loaded prion protein or amyloid beta peptide support heparan sulfate degradation. As glypican- 1 in prion null cells is poorly S-nitrosylated and as ectopic expression of cellular prion protein restores S-nitrosylation of glypican- 1 in these cells, we propose that one function of the cellular prion protein is to deliver copper(II) for the S-nitrosylation of recycling glypican- 1...|$|R

When NO-catalyzed degradation of HS was depressed in mouse neuroblastoma cell line (N 2 a) by using 3 -beta[2 (diethylamino) ethoxy]androst- 5 -en- 17 -one (U 18666 A), both ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid restored formation of anMan-positive products that colocalized with Rab 7. In T 24 cells, constitutively generated anMan-positive products colocalized with both Rab 7 and Rab 9, whereas Gpc- 1 colocalized with Rab 9, a marker for transporting endosomes. Inhibition of endosomal acidification, which blocks transfer from early (Rab 5) to late (Rab 7) endosomes, abrogated deaminative degradation of HS.
