5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{not part of the}} organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

In May 2014, {{a member of the}} ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year.|$|E

25|$|Shelter {{employees}} are sometimes {{at risk from}} violence perpetrated by the clients they are serving. In order to address problems faced by employees {{who are trying to}} help the homeless in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015. While many employees of shelters {{know that there is a}} risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters because they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> performing a public service akin to the police or firefighters.|$|E
25|$|While {{ecotourism}} agencies {{claim to}} help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people {{do not see the}} tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive commercialization and commodification of their culture.|$|E
25|$|Shyness {{may involve}} the {{discomfort}} of difficulty in {{knowing what to}} say in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves {{a combination of both}} symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E

25|$|From the {{research}} that has been conducted on TCKs, {{it has been found}} that subjects are generally more tolerant of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments. Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either fluent in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventions}} {{for professional}} artists working in private {{are much less}} defined, especially as the models are often friends or family. However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards {{in order to make}} models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be something as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.|$|E
25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E

500|$|The Scout uniform is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} characteristic of Scouting. In the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, it [...] "hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality; but, more important still, it covers differences of country and race and creed, and makes all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> members with one another of the one great brotherhood". The original uniform, still widely recognized, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed campaign hat. Baden-Powell also wore shorts, because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age-imposed distance between adult and youth. Uniform shirts are now frequently blue, orange, red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather.|$|E

500|$|Poets in the Romantic Era recast {{the myth}} and adapted {{the image of}} the {{nightingale}} with its song to be a poet and “master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet”. For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. John Keats (1795–1821), in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] (1819) idealizes the nightingale as a poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats himself longs to write. [...] Keats directly employs the Philomel myth in [...] "The Eve of St. Agnes" [...] (1820) where the rape of Madeline by Porphyro mirrors the rape of Philomela by Tereus. Keats' contemporary, poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) invoked a similar image of the nightingale, writing in his A Defence of Poetry that [...] "a poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.” ...|$|E

[...] Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, [...] "I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our Sgt. Pepper. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down. We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs?" [...] The Edge said that he did not think the songs were [...] "potent", further stating, [...] "I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting." [...] Clayton said, [...] "It's an odd record and a favourite of mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The American Youth Congress {{was formed}} in 1935 to {{advocate}} for youth rights in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that [...] "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E
