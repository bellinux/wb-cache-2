When Bava's films were being released on DVD and Blu-ray, The Evil-Eye edit of the film became more difficult to find as Bava's original Italian version of the film was used. This led to audiences knowing the film under its translated Italian title, The Girl Who Knew Too Much.|$|E
5000|$|The {{knowledge}} that is the highest knowledge as far as Kierkegaard is concerned is the {{knowledge that}} he had a soul that could relate to God. This was [...] "the one thing needful" [...] He says, [...] "His soul belongs to the world as its illegitimate possession; it belongs to God as his legitimate possession; it belongs to the person himself as his possession, as a possession that is to be gained. Consequently he gains-if he actually does gain-his soul from God, away from the world, through himself." [...] The fight for the soul takes place in the inner being, not in externalities where everything changes from one moment to the next, its a [...] "work of patience". Here was Kierkegaard's Either/Or; either the single individual gains his soul from the world and presents it to God {{at the end of life}} or he loses his soul to the world and has nothing to present to God at the end of life. Kierkegaard puts it this way in August 1944: [...] But if he nevertheless is unwilling to be an instrument of war in the service of inexplicable drives, indeed, in the service of the world, because the world itself, the object of his craving, stimulates the drive; if he nevertheless does not want to be like a stringed instrument in the hands of inexplicable moods or, rather, in the hands of the world, because the movement of the soul is in accord with the way the world plucks its strings; if he does not want to be like a mirror in which he intercepts the world or, rather, the world reflects itself; if he does not want this, if he himself, even before the eye aims at something to make a conquest, wants to capture the eye so that it may belong to him and not he to the eye; if he grasps the hand before it grasps for the external, so that it may belong to him and not he to the hand; if he wants this so earnestly that he is not afraid of tearing out the <b>eye,</b> <b>cutting</b> off the hand, shutting the window of the senses if necessary-well, then everything is changed: the power is taken away from him, and the glory. He struggles not with the world but with himself. Observe him now; his powerful figure is held embraced by another figure, and they hold each other so firmly interlocked and are so equally matched in suppleness and strength that the wrestling cannot even begin, because in that moment that other figure would overwhelm him-but that other figure is he himself. Thus he is capable of nothing; even the weakest person who is not tried in this struggle is capable of far more than he.

40|$|ABSTRACT Excitatory {{properties}} of visual {{cells in the}} lateral eye of Limulus, investigated by optic nerve recordings in situ, differ significantly from the {{properties of}} cells in the classical, excised eye preparation. The differences suggest the possibility that two receptor mechanisms function in the eye in situ: one mechanism encodes low light intensities and the other responds to high intensifies. The two mechanisms enable each ommatidium to respond over an intensity range of approximately 10 log units. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the increment threshold and the spectral sensitivity, by studying light and dark adaptation, and by analyzing the variability of the impulse discharge. Although the results do not conclusively identify two receptor mechanisms, they indicate that a process or {{a part of a}} process that functions in the eye in situ is abolished by excising the <b>eye</b> or <b>cutting</b> off its blood supply...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE:: To study retinal {{function}} after vitrectomy. METHODS:: Core vitrectomy {{was performed}} in 12 rabbits under standardized conditions using a vitreous cutting rate of either 600 or 1200 cuts/min. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) were performed pre- and postoperatively. Morphologic change was monitored by immunohistochemistry directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). RESULTS:: Three days postoperatively, the b-wave amplitudes of all cone and rod responses of the ERG were significantly reduced in all vitrectomized eyes. At 28 days, the rod response was still reduced, but returned to normal by 58 days. No correlation was found between vitreous cutting speed and ERG findings. No reduction in the central cone function was detected in the mfERG. GFAP upregulation {{was found in the}} entire retina of vitrectomized eyes 3 days after surgery. GFAP expression was present after 28 and 58 days in eyes in which the vitreous cutting rate had been set to 600 cuts/min, but not in the 1200 cuts/min eyes. CONCLUSION:: Pars plana vitrectomy transiently affects retinal function in rabbit <b>eyes.</b> Vitreous <b>cutting</b> speed is not related to the reduced function but appears inversely correlated to Müller cell activation, indicating that high-speed vitreous cutters are more lenient to the retina...|$|R

It was at this time that Benoît de Boigne proposed to Sindhia the creation of a brigade of 10,000 men in order to consolidate his conquest of India. Sindhia refused because his treasury could not afford it, but also because he had doubts about the superiority of the artillery-infantry combination, as opposed to the cavalry that had been the main weapon of the Maratha armies. This refusal caused a new dispute between the two men, and Benoît de Boigne resigned. Once more unemployed, he returned to Lucknow.|$|R

Thus, as Rem died while protecting Misa, her natural lifespan was extended. This is coupled on top of the fact that another shinigami, Gelus, already gave her his life span when he saved her from being killed by a stalker a few years prior, so even after the trades it is likely she still has a substantial lifespan remaining.|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 İş sağlığı ve güvenliği kavramı çalışanların, işletmenin ve üretimin her türlü tehlikelerden korunması ve risklerin öngörülmesi, değerlendirilmesi, bu risklerin ortadan kaldırılması amacı ile ortaya çıkmıştır. Ancak bu üç faktörde tam olarak iş güvenliği sağlanırsa çalışanların güvenliği sağlanmaktadır. Bu nedenle devlete, işverenlere ve çalışanlara büyük görevler düşmektedir. Yapılan işin özelliğine ve kapsamına göre işyerleri çevre, sağlık ve güvenlik açısından çeşitli tehlikelerle karşı karşıyadır. Artan sanayileşme, üretimin hızlanması, tüketime cevap verebilme telaşı vb. sebeplerle çalışanların maruz kaldıkları iş kazası ve meslek hastalıklarında çok ciddi artışlar olmaktadır. Ulusal mevzuatlar konunun önemine vurgu yapmış ve birçok ülke mevzuatında İSG ile ilgili düzenlemelerin yer almasını sağlamıştır. Hem Dünya’da hem de Türkiye’de sağlık ve güvenlik tehlikelerinden ve bunların yarattığı risklerden arındırılmış çalışma ortamlarının sağlanması bilinci etkin bir biçimde artmaya başlamıştır. Kaza olmadan önlemeye çalışmak, tedbirler almak doğacak olumsuz sonuçları da en aza indirmektedir. Birçok insan zamanının önemli bir kısmını işyerinde geçirmektedir. Bu nedenle işyerleri çalışanlara uygun olarak düzenlenmelidir. Çalışma ortamlarının düzeni sağlanamaması beraberinde birçok sorunu da getirir. İşyeri düzensizliği, çalışanların malzeme arama ile vakit kaybetmelerine, eksik ya da fazla hammadde siparişlerinin verilmesine, fabrika alanının verimsiz kullanılmasına ve iş kazalarının meydana gelmesine neden olur. Tesisler, tertip, düzen ve temizliği sağlarken, maliyetlerini azaltabilir, verimliliklerini arttırabilir, kayıp ve israfı azaltabilir bu sayede iş güvenliği ve motivasyonu geliştirebilirler. 5 S sistematiği çalışma alanının temiz ve düzenli tutulmasını sağlar. Bu kapsamda işyerini {{organize}} ve standardize eder. 5 S sistematiği tesislerde iş güvenliğine, prosese, ürün kalitesine, stok yönetimine ve çalışılan alanın kontrolüne önemli katkılar sağlar.

The occupational health and safety main goal is prediction evaluation and elimination of risks. The workplaces are faced with variety of hazards in environment, health and safety. The occupational accident and occupational diseases are seriously increasing due to rapidly growing industrialization, production rate, flurry of response to the consumption, etc. It has emphasized the importance of this issue led to the inclusion of national legislation and regulations relating to occupational health and safety in many countries. Due to the fact that occupational accident is the most important problem in work life all over the world. The awareness of creating work environment without health and security hazards and risks that they may be occur is start to growing effectively in both World and Turkey. The negative results would be minimum with trying to avoid the accident and taking precautions. Due to these reasons, an important tasks fall to government, employers and employees. The occupational accident and diseases rates are increasing day by day. Occupational accidents and occupational diseases in the facilities have required taking legal precautions. Importance of risk assessment becomes even more important because of increasing awareness of occupational health safety and some legal enforcements. In Turkey, Occupational Safety and Health law No. 6331 was come out in the Official Gazette on June 30 in 2012. The law includes some important points such as to prevent workers from accidents, to protect the health of workers from occupational diseases and to layout of the workplace. The most important point in this law is about risk assessment. According to law, risk assessment implications are required in all businesses and facilities. By applying risk assessment in the facilities occupational accidents and diseases can be reduced minimum. People are required to comply with the rule of law in concept of occupational health and safety. Despite this legislation aiming to prevent work accidents have been introduced in facilities, there is a noticeable {{decrease in the number of}} occupational accidents and disease. Companies have to use the right risk assessment technique. Thus, the goal is more easily attainable. Occupational accidents and diseases can be reduced and preventable. Legal regulations force facilities to complete their risk assessments considering their danger class in certain time periods. Process changes, new machines and new legislations are forcing facilities to do their risk assessments before its due time. The aim of risk assessment is to describe preparations, precaution and checks which will be able to respond to hazards in facilities. The internal and external physical condition of the workplace is one of the most important factors that affect the job security. Many people spend essential part of time in their workplace. Therefore, workplaces should be regulated according to the employees. The lack of organization of the workplace brings a lot of problems. Messy workplace cause wasting time with searching materials, ordering more or less raw material, and using factory area unproductive and occurance of occupational accidents. Facilities can reduce the cost, increase the productivity, reduce the losses and waste and develop the motivation of occupational health and safety with creating neater, more ordinate and cleaner working area. 5 S systematic is a systematic approach for making clean, neat working area properly, organize and standardized workplace. 5 S systematic in facilities, contribute to occupational safety, process, product quality, inventory management and increasing the control efficiency of working area. The 5 S systematic is a basic approach that works in companies all over the world. 5 S systematic consists of five steps. These are sorting, set in order, shine, standardize and sustain. Sort means that removal of all equipments from the workplace that are not needed for production. Thus, irregularity is eliminated. Set in order means that you arranging the items and equipment. Shine is removing dust from the work area and machines. Thus, both employees health and machine can be prevented. Standardize and sustain are used for going on these three steps and keep improving workplace organization. In this study, a comprehensive research has made at the company which produce natural-gas meter in terms of occupational health and safety and also environmental according to the Occupational Health and Safety law no. 6331 and all regulations accordingly with this law. The method of Fine Kinney has used while doing risk assessment. The 5 S systematic which implemented in the facility is shown to how risk assessment impressed since before and after. The main goal of this thesis is to show the positive impressions of the 5 S systematic for risk assessment. The evaluation was done in the facility by using a control list. The list consists of many questions about occupational health and safety. Thus, the status of facility was detected in terms of occupational health and safety. Risk assessment was done for the production line of natural gas meter. Process specific hazards were identified before 5 S systematic not implemented. First hazards and their sources, their risks and risk scores were detected in risk assessment. While these scores were determining, Fine Kinney method was established. Frequency and intensity values were determined by using some charts in Fine Kinney method. These three value was multiplied with each other and the risk values were obtained. In the natural gas meter production line, there are more than one hazard with the same risk point. Thus, hazards were put in a list from highest value to lowest value. 5 S systematic was implemented in the facility. All employees in natural gas meter production department were educated about 5 S methodology. 5 S systematic implementation started from the sorting step. Necessary and unnecessary materials have been identified. Useless materials removed from the work area. Due to the fact that unnecessary materials and equipment can cause various problems after a period of time. Also, materials in the wrong places were put on the right places. 5 S systematic implementation continue with the set in order step in the natural gas meter production department. All materials organized according to their usages areas. Thus materials and equipment needed can be found in a short time and easily. Shine is one the most important step in the facilities. Due to the fact that cleaning is useful both employees and machine and equipment. Facilities can use clean equipment long term. In this way, lost time for maintenance and repair can reduced. Occupational accident reports of the last three years in the facilities show 28 accident occurred and 22 of the counter of the natural gas meter production process. These accident results are Minor scrapes, cuts, and bruising. Materials from the assembly line they had moved into the basket or cardboard box material with the shape as a result of improper handling during transport handshake event has occurred. During maintenance disassembly of the substance splashes to the <b>eye</b> when <b>cutting</b> plastic parts with side cutter counter parts in the section have occurred. In natural gas meter production line 13 hazard sources were identifed in the risk assessment. From these 13 hazard sources cauese 17 hazard. Before starting implementation of 5 S systematic in the facility, in risk assessment 13 very high risk, 3 high risk and 1 susbstantial risk were identified. Then, 5 S systematic was implemented. First three steps of 5 S systematşc were applied to the natural gas meter production line. After implementation of 5 S systematic while calculating risk values, the values of probablity and frequency decreased owing to positive effects of 5 S systematic. According to this stuation, in risk assessment 3 very high risk, 7 high risk and 7 substatial risk were identified. The values of 5 S systematic before and after show that the positive effects of 5 S systematic in the facilities. Only sorting, set in order and shine steps faclities can reduce the risk values easily. Due to the fact that tidiness, many risk can be prevented. Risk values are reduced and hazards are prevented without any cost. Cleaner and safer working areas bring safety. When a work area is clean and organized thazards sources and other dangers are eliminated. Employees like to work in a well-organized and clean work areas. People feel better about their work environment. Also, risk assesment was done for entire facility before 5 S systematic implementation. In this risk assessment consist of all facilities, common areas and natural gas meter production line. Some hazards cannot be solved with the application of 5 S systematic. In this risk assessment hazards resources, hazards, risks and how to prevent risk are examined and explained. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|Greece {{is one of}} the {{countries}} which like to apply its plans on the lands of the Ottoman Empire after the signing of theTreaty of Mudros. Greece commenced an intensive activity in Marmara region as it had various plans on the cities of the regionwhich is under the reign of the Ottoman Empire. In order to realise their aim for the Marmara region, that is the great aim called asMegali Idea, they collaborated with the Rum Patriarchate. The aim of the Greece is to found an Istanbul centred great Greece. Toachieve this, The Ottoman Empire must be eliminated and the Allies must be persuaded. In this respect, Greece carried outpropaganda activities among the Allies and claimed that Rum population was the dominant population in Marmara Region. At thispoint, Venizelos, the Prime Minister of Greece, had the population statistical of the region based mostly on the records of thePatriarchy and claimed firmly that this region must belong to the Rums according to this statistical. The English also supported these activities of Greece for the Marmara significantly. As a result of the Greece and RumPatriarchy collaboration {{and with the help of}} the great countries mainly of the English, many Rum irregulars emerged in theMarmara region. In the emergence of these irregulars, the role of the communities and committees, acting such as Mavri Mira,Etnik-i Eterya, Yardım, Trakya and Kordus as result of the Greece and Rum Patriarchy binary, is great. For instance, Mavri MiraCommunity formed irregulars in terms of Megali Idea and had operations in order to have the Turkish people migrate and replaceRum immigrants for the vacant places by causing chaos in the region. The activities of Mavri Mira Community were supported bythe Greece Red Cross. The Greece Red Cross provided dispatching of arms and ammunition to Anatolia under the guise ofhygienic and medical material. Etnik-i Eterya Community, an Istanbul centred community, endeavoured for a great revolt in Istanbul and its vicinity. Itopened agents in many places where the Rums live and tormented Turkish people by forming irregulars. Rums in Thrace wererationalized by means of Yardım (Help) and Thracian committees. Rum irregulars were formed in Thrace and these iregularsstruggled to eliminate the Turkish population systematically in the region. Some of the the Rum irregulars emerged/wereemerged during the truce in Marmara region are: Todori, Bahari, Kommit, Apostol and Apostolidis, Kirman and Kırçaki, PaşaköylüKaraoğlan, Panayot, İstelyanus, Yeniköylü Yorgi, Pandeli, Andon, Karabıyık Dimitri, Vangel and Vangelos, Çakır Yorgi, Anesti Kaplan(Kaptan),Kör Vasil, Milto, Hrisantos, Zafiri and Milki (Milti) Kaptan Çetesi. These Rum irregulars caused terrorist activities by making use of thepublic order problems of the Ottoman Empire. They despoiled many villages and killed many Moslem Turks. They even joinedamong the soldiers of Greece, and struggled against the army of the Ottoman Empire, and also National Forces (Kuvâ-yı Milliye) and Regular Army. Rum irregulars dared to oppose detective forces of the Ottoman Empire in themselves saying “we don’t wantgovernment and gendarme, you either abdicate or we compel you to leave here” in Kemerburgaz. That is, these irregulars worked hard in theregion to realize Megali Idea in the region. For example, Rum irregulars tormented Moslem people, killed many men before thefolk by scratching their <b>eyes</b> out and <b>cutting</b> their noses in villages of Kandıra, Mantarcılar, Kışla, Karasakal, Karakiraz, Çerkezler,Cebecioğlu, Vareman, Dökiren, Hacı İsmail, Bişkin and İnanlar, and Seyhler town. They raped women collectively and killed themby torture later on. They seized jewellery of the women. They attacked the official institutions. They took thousands of animalsand invaluable carpets they had stolen from the mosques with them while they were drawing back to Izmit. Armenian irregulars also took place within the activities of the irregulars in Marmara region. In the chaos atmosphere of thearmistice, Fener Rum Patriarchy and Armenian Patriarchy acted together against the Ottoman Empire which they regard as“common enemy” and supported each other in every case. Rum and Armenian Patriarchy stated that the curator of lack of publicorder in the Ottoman Empire was the Turks. Zaven Efendi, the Armenian Patriarch, tried to depict his collaboration with theRum Patriarchy frankly by joining their meetings. Both Armenian and Rum press supported each other and consider each other’sland demand as rightful. Rum and Armenian collaboration continued till the conclusion of the National Struggle. Because,Armenians thought the necessity of an absolute Greece achievement in Anatolia in order to found a Armenia in West Anatolia. That is, the thought of the way of “Great Armenia” passes through the “Great Greece” hold by the Armenians. Therefore,Armenians contributed to the process by forming Armenian irregulars so that the Greeks could succeed in absolutely. The role ofHınçak and Taşnak communities who returned back to Istanbul after the treaty of armistice is great in forming of Armenianirregulars. For example, the members of Taşnak committee took the Armenians under their control after the armistice and startedto interfere in the patriarchy. They initiated the irregular activities immediately later on. Armenian irregulars were also supportedby the states like Greece and the English. Armenians, like Rums, formed scout organizations and young Armenians between theage of 14 - 22 were trained by Greek officers in these scout organizations. Some of the emerged/were emerged irregulars byArmenians are: Yuvacıklı Vahan, Donik (Antranik), Hayzakor, Onnik, Dikran and Ardaş. These irregulars, just as the Rumirregulars, caused chaos in Marmara region, despoiled a lot of villages, killed many Moslem Turks as well. The authorities of the Ottoman Empire tried to take some precautions to preclude the activities of the irregulars while Rumand Armenian irregulars having operations in Marmara region. For instance, a surveillance network of talented civil servants wasformed around the patriarchy according to the decision taken as a precaution to sustain public order. The patriarchy and itsvicinity were taken under firm control; it was closed for entry and exit when confusion occurs during the times for the highpossibility of violation of public order. The armaments of Rums hereabouts were prevented and studies were done to seize theirarms and ammunition. The authorities of the Ottoman Empire chose alliance with irregulars in some places to prevent irregularactivities. For example, an advisory commission was sent for Yeniköy Rums who were on rebellion to the Ottoman in 1919. Thecommission declared that Islam and Rum people were under the fair guaranty of the Ottoman and the Entente States. It is alsostated that equivalents of the possessions of Rum people lost or seized by Moslems will be paid back by Ziraat Bank. A agreementwith Yeniköy Rums were signed and a charity forest close to the region given out to the people of Yeniköylü. But, YenikoöyRums did not forsake irregular activities despite this agreement, kept on invading villages killing women, girl and children withoutany hesitation. The Ottoman Empire was unable to take firm precautions to prevent irregular’s activities as it was a state which is undermilitary occupation by the Entente Powers. A state’s chance, who lands under military occupation, is not so high to apply thedecisions it had made to prevent the irregulars. Because it was not easy to initiate a work without the “approval” of the EntentePowers and these states were supporting Rum and Armenian irregulars having operations in Marmara region in terms of weapon,ammunition and subsistence. In the chaos atmosphere of the armistice period, Rum and Armenian irregulars which were formed to found Great Greece andGreat Armenia had operations in Marmara Region between 1918 - 1922, despoiled many villages, killed a lot of Moslem Turkwithout caring whether they are women, girl or child. These irregular activities continued till the National Struggle succeeds...|$|R
