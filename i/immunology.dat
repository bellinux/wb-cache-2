5|$|At the time, <b>immunology</b> was {{becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} <b>immunology</b> was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to <b>immunology.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Immunology</b> {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular <b>immunology,</b> Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on <b>immunology.</b> Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of <b>immunology,</b> immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Physiology is {{the study}} the {{interaction}} of how, for example, the nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such medically oriented disciplines as neurology and <b>immunology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} affiliated to {{the university}} are Sócrates Herrera Valencia, head of the <b>Immunology</b> Research Institute of the university and creator of a synthetic vaccine against malaria; and Raúl Cuero, a researcher in biotechnology at the Texas A University and an employee at NASA.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, <b>immunology,</b> {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In <b>immunology,</b> self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{served as}} first chair for the Commonwealth Foundation (1966–69), a Commonwealth {{initiative}} to foster {{interaction between the}} member countries' elite, {{and he was also}} active in the World Health Organization, serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on <b>Immunology</b> between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine {{also offers}} the Doctor of Philosophy degree to train {{students}} as biomedical researchers and scientists. The PhD {{is available in}} six fields offered by the basic science departments: pharmacology and toxicology, molecular and cell biology, <b>immunology,</b> molecular pathogenesis, systems biology, and experimental and molecular medicine. Research and teaching positions at DMS and its centers and institutes are available to PhD candidates.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including <b>immunology,</b> ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular <b>Immunology,</b> considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
5|$|In {{clinical}} <b>immunology,</b> {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|She {{then worked}} {{for five years}} in the Metropolitan Police {{forensic}} science laboratory as a forensic scientist. After studying for her degree in <b>immunology</b> part-time, Carey decided to continue academic research and returned to the University of Edinburgh to pursue doctoral studies. Carey was awarded her Doctorate (PhD) by research thesis on the virology of the maedi-visna virus which affects sheep, in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} to the study of molecular and cell biology as they provide simple systems {{that can be used to}} manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology. For example, viruses have been useful in the study of genetics and helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein transport, and <b>immunology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{received}} his Doctor of Medicine {{degree from the}} University of Melbourne in 1924, and his PhD from the University of London in 1928. He went on to conduct pioneering research in microbiology and <b>immunology</b> at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, and served {{as director of the}} Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, Burnet worked at the University of Melbourne. Throughout his career he played {{an active role in the}} development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. <b>Immunology</b> covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two schools}} of {{education}} in the Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine: the GKT School of Medical Education is responsible for the medical education and training of students on the MBBS programme, and the School of Bioscience Education is responsible for the biomedical and health professions education and training. The faculty is divided into 7 schools, including Basic & Medical Biosciences, Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Cancer & Pharmaceutical Science, Cardiovascular Medicine & Sciences, <b>Immunology</b> & Microbial Sciences, Life Course Sciences and Population Health Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on <b>immunology,</b> and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} Cheirogaleidae, fork-marked lemurs {{are the most}} phylogenetically distinct, {{although}} their placement remained uncertain until recently. One uniting characteristic (synapomorphy) among all cheirogaleids, {{to the exclusion of}} other lemurs, is the branching of the carotid artery along with how it enters the skull—a trait which is shared by fork-marked lemurs. Analyses based on morphology, <b>immunology,</b> and repetitive DNA have given contradictory placements of Phaner, while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded poor resolution of their placement.|$|E
5|$|Woodruff {{retired from}} the University of Edinburgh in 1976, his role then being filled by Prof Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm, and joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent {{the next ten years}} there, engaged in cancer {{research}} with an emphasis on tumor <b>immunology</b> using Corynebacterium parva. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five papers and two books. After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally, until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|<b>Immunology</b> is {{a science}} that {{examines}} the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, {{for which he was}} awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of <b>immunology,</b> and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Moser was {{promoted}} to Associate University Professor in 1964. Two years later, the Faculty of Science of the University of Innsbruck recommended that a chair of microbiology should be created at the Botanical Institute in Innsbruck. The Federal Ministry of Education accepted the recommendation. Moser was the only candidate for the position, and was unanimously named {{by a number of}} leading European botanists and mycologists for the post in 1967. Subsequently, in 1968, Moser {{was promoted}} to full professor, and, in 1972, Moser became the head of the newly established Institute of Microbiology, {{the first of its kind}} in Austria. He remained in charge of the Institute until his retirement. He taught on a wide range of subjects, including the taxonomy of fungi, ecology of fungi, mycogeography, bacteria, viruses, chemotaxonomy, molecular genetics, microbial toxicology, <b>immunology</b> and symbiosis. During his career at the university, he oversaw over 60 doctoral theses, in addition to a number of diploma theses. In 1970, Moser became the president of the Austrian Mycological Society, taking over after the death of the previous post-holder, Kurt Lohwag. Lohwag, in turn, had taken up the position after the death of his predecessor, Thirring, earlier that year. Moser remained the society's president for 21 years.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are used}} widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for {{research}} in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and <b>immunology.</b> Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States {{for research in}} the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.|$|E
25|$|Coley's daughter, Helen Coley Nauts (1907–2001) {{established}} the nonprofit Cancer Research Institute in 1953 to study her father's work.

25|$|In academia, {{computational}} <b>immunology</b> is a {{field of}} science that encompasses high-throughput genomic and bioinformatics approaches to <b>immunology.</b> The field's main aim is to convert immunological data into computational problems, solve these problems using mathematical and computational approaches and then convert these results into immunologically meaningful interpretations.|$|E
25|$|The {{immune system}} is a complex system {{of the human body}} and {{understanding}} {{it is one of the}} most challenging topics in biology. <b>Immunology</b> research is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the defense of human body and to develop drugs for immunological diseases and maintain health. Recent findings in genomic and proteomic technologies have transformed the <b>immunology</b> research drastically. Sequencing of the human and other model organism genomes has produced increasingly large volumes of data relevant to <b>immunology</b> research and at the same time huge amounts of functional and clinical data are being reported in the scientific literature and stored in clinical records. Recent advances in bioinformatics or computational biology were helpful to understand and organize these large scale data and gave rise to new area that is called Computational <b>immunology</b> or immunoinformatics.|$|E
25|$|Computational <b>immunology</b> is {{a branch}} of {{bioinformatics}} and {{it is based on}} similar concepts and tools, such as sequence alignment and protein structure prediction tools. Immunomics is a discipline like genomics and proteomics. It is a science, which specifically combines <b>Immunology</b> with computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and biochemistry for large-scale analysis of immune system functions. It aims to study the complex protein–protein interactions and networks and allows a better understanding of immune responses and their role during normal, diseased and reconstitution states. Computational <b>immunology</b> is a part of immunomics, which is focused on analyzing large scale experimental data.|$|E
