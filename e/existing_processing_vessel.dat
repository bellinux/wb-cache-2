40|$|Wastewater minimisation {{in batch}} {{processes}} is becoming evermore important as environmental legislation becomes more stringent and fresh water sources are becoming scarce. Added to this, {{is the need}} for batch plants to occupy the least amount of space. Therefore, one would like to minimise any storage in a batch process, since storage takes up a large amount of space with relatively low economic return. Generally, in any batch process there are <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> that are idle at some point during a given time horizon. In essence, any <b>processing</b> <b>vessel</b> standing idle {{can be used as a}} storage vessel. Under correct conditions, the idle <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> can be used as storage for wastewater. This would mean that the size of dedicated wastewater storage is reduced and in some cases not even required. Furthermore, the capital utilisation of the installed <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> is greatly increased. Past wastewater minimisation methodologies in batch processes (Wang & Smith, 1995, Kim & Smith, 2004, Foo et al., 2005; Majozi, 2005) have generally accepted that there will always be storage vessels dedicated to the storage of wastewater. The usage of wastewater storage allows for greater reuse opportunities since it enables the inherent time constraint o...|$|R

Moreover, we observed the smallest uncertainties and the smoothest behavior for the electric phase tensor.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to model {{logistics}} for the downstream aquaculture supply chain interaction for increased production of salmon in the future. We employed a quantitative approach using discrete-event simulation, where we developed a model, replicating the real-world supply chain in MATLAB s add-on software Simulink. The output was basis for evaluations regarding system dynamics and flexibility, based on composition and throughput. Project limitations excluded human influence, {{as well as all}} commercial aspects, from the analyses. The motivation for the thesis was the Norwegian governments goal to increase aquaculture production by five-fold within 2050. Following this increase comes the development of farm sizes and locations, as well as an adapted supply chain. Such an expansion may include the introduction of additional transportation modes, like <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> and seaborne transportation of products to market. As a multimodal system, the challenge lies in coordinating the various modes, pursuing seamless integration between them. This is effectively assessed using discrete-event simulation, modelling the continuous movement of entities. The model was run several times with different system compositions and scenarios. These served to verify the model, establish a benchmarking fleet and test system robustness against external influence. Two crash scenarios, simulating emergency slaughter and waiting cage ban, were imposed. The results showed that delivery to market using the current day trucking system is efficient and reliable. However, a simulated expansion required a large fleet, which the introduction of cargo <b>vessels</b> could relieve. <b>Processing</b> <b>vessels</b> withheld transit-time to a minimum regardless of imposed scenarios, and were a contribution to continuity in operation. In conclusion, we showed that any system upgrade must be supported by equivalent infrastructure to increase system performance. Collaboration and redundancy through parallel nodes were key factors in ensuring system up-time. Further work should include evaluations on commercial competitiveness...|$|R

The catcher/processor fishery evolved from an Olympic-style [...] "race for fish" [...] into a fish harvesting cooperative that emphasizes resource conservation and efficient production. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Pacific Council) provided the needed regulatory framework for the change when it formally divided the annual total allowable catch of Pacific whiting among three fishery sectors: vessels delivering to shoreside processors (shoreside sector - 42%); <b>vessels</b> delivering to <b>processing</b> <b>vessels</b> (mothership sector - 24%); and vessels that both catch and process (catcher/processor sector - 34%). During this same period, the Pacific Council also imposed a license limitation program for the West Coast groundfish fishery, which limited participation in the fishery to qualified vessels.|$|R
