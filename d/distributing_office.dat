He would distinguish, too, between a library and a news-room, and would find no great attraction in the prospect of supplying the national youth with free but thumby copies of the sixpenny magazines. He would consider that all that was needed for his library was, first, easily accessible fireproof shelving for his collection, with ample space for his additions, an efficient <b>distributing</b> <b>office,</b> a cloak-room, and so forth, and eight or nine not too large, well lit, well carpeted, well warmed and well ventilated rooms radiating from that office, in which the guides and so forth could be consulted, and where those who had no convenient, quiet room at home could read.|$|E

This is the case, for instance, at the University of Illinois, where different campus units have both distinct offices and different unofficial retention and resolution policies (rules for how long to keep items {{and what to do}} with them once that period has expired). Some organisations now use online programs like www.itsfound.com.au for lost property data storage.

This paper reports on an analysis of two exploratory experiments dating from 2004 and 2005. Ad-hoc collaboration requires specific skills for process facilitation, communication, planning, media usage, multi-tasking, as well as specific social skills. Those skills need to be different in their characteristic than those skills necessary for traditional face-to-face and distributed meetings. A fast action and reaction cycle leads to raised excitement and motivation despite the difficulties the group has in organizing their work. ...|$|R

A thin client device {{is a computer}} with low hardware resources; his embedded operating system that works as an interface to a remote desktop. On the other hand, the use of virtual technologies permits to create and administrate dynamically remote desktops. From physically <b>distributed</b> <b>offices,</b> users can connect to remote desktops as locally. So {{there is no need}} to send the IT crowd to the foreign offices and corrupted thin client devices can be changed sending new ones by express mail.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system to}} manage objects in a distributed environment. The basic configuration consists {{of a set of}} loosely interconnected object repositories storing strongly typed objects. Objects are collections of data and associated operations and can have complex, nested structures. They can be accessed remotely and can move dynamically between repositories. Objects and object classes are only shared in a limited way, i. e. we do not require a global schema as in the distributed database model. We present several alternative mechanisms to locate mobile objects, and to implement object mobility. Both aspects are shown to be closely related. Finally, we illustrate the application-level functionality of our approach by describing a <b>distributed</b> <b>office</b> procedure facility on top of the basic system...|$|R

40|$|Groupware {{applications}} used in <b>distributed</b> <b>office</b> environments {{are characterized}} by several users accessing and manipulating a shared document pool in a collaborative context. Supporting such application with relational database persistence and object technology requires two main features: (1) a sound and generic mapping from the object-oriented application schema to the relational data model, and (2) update notification, i. e., means to notify users easily about changes in the shared document pool. In this paper we present a lightweight object manager that implements (1) an object-relational mapping that allows for efficient persistency of application classes, and (2) group-awareness by update notification combining database triggers with client polling and object notification services.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} a two-order spatiotemporal autoregressive model with a Bayesian heteroskedasticity robust procedure in modeling strata-titled Singapore office unit transaction prices and in constructing transaction-based disaggregate office price indexes. The model reduces the problems caused by the infrequent trading of individual commercial properties. However, for those office properties that are located outside the CBD and also for those less frequently transacted, {{the power of the}} model in capturing these particular office buildings' price dynamics is limited. The significant differences of the office prices across the various office buildings and submarkets show that the model can capture the variation in office prices and track the timing of capital gains and losses that investors may accrue on spatially <b>distributed</b> <b>office</b> properties more accurately than hedonic or weighted least squares estimates.
