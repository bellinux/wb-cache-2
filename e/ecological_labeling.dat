40|$|Ideally a new {{reform of}} the EU trade regime for bananas (COMB) should be {{equipped}} {{in a way that}} it makes a long-term contribution to the realisation of sustainable goals, or at least does not prevent them. From a point of view of sustainable development, a trade restriction measure has to fulfill at least the following requirements: it should support those producers/market operators by preferential market access who internalise the real costs of production in their price structure and make sure that the specific trade measures do not contradict efforts on sustainability in exporting countries. Against this background we introduce an innovative model – auctioning producers' offers in the EU. Issues concerning the auction design and its GATT/WTO compatibility are also discussed. In sum, the auctioning of direct producers' offers seems to be a practicable solution for fair trade with agricultural produce from developing countries. However, to enforce the position of sustainable banana production, the EU should also introduce - in addition to an auction of producers' offers - social and <b>ecological</b> <b>labels</b> in the banana market...|$|R

Recently, business stewardship, a sustainable business framework, aims at supporting humans’ well-being and preventing harm effects on the environment (Chapin et al. 2009) by employing CSR drives and <b>ecological</b> <b>labels</b> and indices. Business stewardships of Edun, Stella McCartney, Katherine Hamnett, Noir, and American Apparel have increased public awareness (Holgar et al. 2009) based on their sustainable education and market positioning strategies. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) drives are an evocative business stewardship focusing on labor standards, human rights, and the environment (Husted and Allen 2000). For instance, So-Me and EDUN raised awareness for the causes of solidarity and pacifism through their fashion products (Poldner 2010). Business stewardship by means of eco-labeling/indices convey the specific information regarding the environmental impacts of a product (Bruce and Laroiya 2006). H&M, Gap and Marks & Spencer have launched a universally-recognized product labeling which informs the environmental impact (DiCamillo 2009). However, these business efforts of business stewardship are often fragmented, and this leaves consumers and companies in doubt as to whether the current stewardship efforts are useful to society, business and consumers.|$|R

30|$|Taking {{into account}} the United Nations Environment Program (2011) study, we can think that tourism {{promotes}} and supports environmentally friendly practices thus driving increases {{in the use of}} renewable energy because of the following reasons: (i) energy efficiency and a more intensive use of renewable resources are primordial for the sustainability and competitiveness of the tourism sector; (ii) sustainability considerations have an increasing influence on tourist choices. A survey conducted by Trip Advisor in 2007 on worldwide travelers concluded that 38 % had stayed at an environmentally friendly hotel, while 34 % were willing to pay more to stay in environmentally friendly hotels (Pollock 2007). In addition, a study conducted by SNV (2009) indicates that some 58.5 million US travelers would “pay more” for travel companies that strive to protect and preserve the environment. This pushed leading airlines to explore alternative fuel strategies; (iii) there is a growing trend within the tourism industry of investing in sustainability. These investments could be in energy efficient features and services, photovoltaic electricity, waste water re-use and rainwater recovery, and energy efficiency in sustainable construction and renovation projects. Such investments are driven mainly by increasing fossil fuel energy costs, possible pollution surcharges, increasing expectations of customers (particularly from Europe and North America) and, thus, those of operators and the entire supply chain, decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies, low-carbon technological advances, government incentives, <b>ecological</b> <b>labels</b> and/or standards, regulations and legislation on energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings; (iv) customers demand for clean destination and the pressure from major tour operators is likely to push local governments to improved solid waste management and the investment in sanitary landfills and solid waste recycling capacity which can enhance the consumption of renewable energy coming from solid waste.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of defining benchmarks {{in order to}} give a sure interpretation of the results of LCA, consistent with international development, {{this is an issue that}} must be addressed in a broad and from a general point of view, at the same time, specific for the different identifiable sectors (agri-food, building, packaging, …). Therefore, it is considered appropriate an international organized collaboration among research institutions, governments and industries that will bring together in a single “container” all the rules, the principles and the improvement prospects that will concur in determining the levels of environmental performances, that are going to represent a starting point to define benchmarks. In this way, we propose the idea of preparing an international LCA (web) portal, characterized by geographic area, that could filed under different parameters the results of the LCA applications, which come from different sources (industry, research projects, pilot projects). The classification is going to be done according to the following tree diagram: geographic area – sector – product – environmental indicator. By this scheme, it is possible to classify under quantitatively, from which it could be possible to define the average performances, above and below the average, that will respectively represent the value 0 (zero), the positive value (+) and negative (-) one. It could be also possible to define weights related to different indicators, depending on collected data. At this point, in according with an appropriate rating attribution system, we are going to combine weights and benchmark values {{in order to give}} a single indicator that could be interpreted in a “maximum-minimum” range of values. Therefore, it would be necessary to introduce a set of positive values (1, 2, 3, …) to define increasing levels of environmental performances, considering type I <b>ecological</b> <b>label</b> (like Ecolabel) too. According with us, this can be a possible step to certificate products or services by Life Cycle Thinking criteria...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{concept of}} CSR {{is getting more}} {{attention}} among various fields {{but there has been}} a lack of research in enhancing the awareness of CSR within the field of retailing. In order to fill this gap, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the significance of CSR and green marketing (<b>ecological</b> <b>labels)</b> in the business of retailing while evaluating the affect of it on consumer behavior.   Method: Case study research method is opted for this study to answer “why” and “how” questions. Furthermore, quantitative data has been collected through in store and online customer interview. The research data is analysed by using Microsoft Office Excel.   Result & Conclusions: The result shows that CSR is well incorporated and practiced by ICA Kvantum, AB. Their business philosophy is focused on customer, product, environment, diversity and community. They provide environmental and organic products by abiding the rules and law of goods production that also protects the environment. Moreover, the quantitative study reveals that Swedish female consumer between the ages of 26 - 35 are more responsible towards environment. It also shows that most of the consumers are still buying conventional (non-ecological) products and majority of them don’t check eco-labels before purchasing but they are willing to pay more for ecological and organic foods. Thus, CSR and green marketing affects consumer buying behavior through different ways.   Suggestions for future research: The similar research can be performed by adopting qualitative data from company’s experts to record their perspective about CSR and green marketing. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate multiple retail companies operating in different cities. Furthermore, it could give innovative results, if the study investigates the link of trust and loyalty on consumer behavior, as they are the key components in consumer purchase decision.   Contribution of the study: This study identifies and explains the concept of CSR and the important elements of CSR in grocery retailing. The novel concept of green marketing and ecological products has been studied in relation to consumer behavior. The investigation of CSR and green marketing on consumer behavior is a unique combination which has not investigated extensively within the field of grocery retailing...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{issues are}} current topics which {{consumers}} face in every-day life. The growing awareness by the consumers {{that they can}} have an impact on protection of the environment, animals and their own health is the reason of the growing market of ecological products (Kinnear, Talor and Ahmed, 1974; Polonsky, 1994). According to the Swedish consumer agency the agricultural sector had increased highly since the 1990 s. Hence the companies had increased its market activities significant under the last decade (Konsumentverket, 2007). It appears more and more that the most important aspect for competitive positioning of companies providing ecological food is to understand the factors which drive consumers to purchase ecological food products. The KRAV label appears as an essential part of market ecological food. In this context it is very interesting to identify in which degree the consumer is affected by the third-party label KRAV. The purpose of the paper is to identify information about the ecological consumer as well as the factors that influence consumers to buy ecological food products and in this context examine the awareness and importance of <b>ecological</b> <b>labels,</b> in Jönköping County. The thesis is limited in its geographical area because the consumer survey is done in several cities in Jönköping County. The thesis considers general the ecological food industry and does not include other ecological industries such as clothes or furniture. By studying former surveys and conducting a previous study a survey questionnaire was developed. 102 respondents from Jönköpings County were asked to fill in this questionnaire. The collected data were evaluated with the statistical program SPSS. Analysis of variance, correlation analysis and descriptive analysis were used. The authors have got the impression that the ecological consumer in Jönköping County is mostly female and higher educated. The most important factors that influence the consumer positively to choose the ecological products are healthiness, environmental friendliness and better taste. If products do not include pesticides and are produced “animal friendly” it also influence the consumer positive. Negative factors that influence consumers are still a too high price, unavailability and bad/no information. ...|$|R

The requirements within such schemes are often flexible and open to interpretation, and generally less controversial than the eco-labelling schemes. As compared to the certification schemes, the eco-labels attributed to the tourist services emphasise the impact over the environment of the services of tourist companies, on the basis of certain European criteria. These criteria refer to the whole life cycle of these tourist services. ...|$|R

The question considered in this chapter is, to what extent these disjointed initiatives also contribute to building the much-needed ecological city of the future. Ecological initiatives can be undertaken at three levels – city level, neighbourhood level and individual initiatives – spontaneously, triggered by incentives or price increases. This chapter will first review the reasons behind the concern about more ecological cities (ecocities). Subsequently, we introduce the approach of the Switch project, which embodies an increased ecological attitude towards water and environmental issues. 2 This will also mean a discussion about sustainability and following an integrated approach to the problems mentioned. Kenworthy (2006) mentions ten dimensions for sustainable city development in the developing world.

40|$|The {{basis of}} life of any society is a safe {{environment}} {{that is not only}} the guarantee of welfare and quality of life, but also the guarantee of the further development of human civilization. That is why in the modern world the issue of the preservation of the natural environment is of special actuality. The gradual awareness by humanity of new threats (high degree of concentration of harmful industries; high level of resource and energy consumption; lack of modern environmental technologies; slow but inevitable degradation of the gene pool of a population due to the consumption of poor quality and in most cases harmful products, etc.) forced the society to seek new approaches to socio-economic development and environmental management. One of such approaches is the introduction of <b>ecological</b> and organic <b>labeling.</b> Marking is a source of information about the purity, safety and quality of the products offered in the market; effective information mechanism, which is a kind of quality mark for the offered products. The current practice of <b>ecological</b> and organic <b>labeling</b> aimed at the increase of level consumer's awareness and the changing models of purchasing behavior in the direction of environmental protection. The feature of most marking systems of environmentally friendly and safe products is the obligation of compliance with the established requirements used by producers of raw materials and technologies taking into account their potential environmental impact. Labeling of ecologically clean and safe products is reducing the negative impact on the environment and on the human's health. It is the consequence of changes in the economic environment, namely: the improvement of socio-ethical requirements to production; the increasing level of integration of producers and service providers; the customer's satisfaction in varieties of products; globalization of economic space; reduction of time for development, standardization and production. Labeling {{is a step in the}} direction of European Integration and the legal adjustment of relations between the buyer and manufacturer. All these activities will assist for the implementation of innovative technologies for cleaner production, rational use of material and energy resources, balancing economy development, the production of safe products for human health and the environment, improving the competitiveness of domestic producers in the international market, enhancing export potential, reducing investment risks from ecological factors. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Despite {{research}} studies indicating {{strong support for}} labelling information, uncertainty remains with respect to how labels influence consumers. This paper attempts to empirically investigate how consumers who differ in terms of environmentalism respond to labels. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected on an Australian sample using a structured questionnaire administered on the phone using quantum research (CATI) data collection services. A total of 155 questionnaires were completed and used for data analysis. The data were analysed using both descriptive measures and correlations between variables. Findings - There {{appears to be a}} proportion of consumers that find product labels hard to understand. The research found that there are consumers who will buy green products even if they are lower in quality in comparison to alternative products, but would look for environmental information on labels. With respect to price sensitive green consumers, {{there appears to be a}} relationship between price sensitivity and 2 ̆ 7 always 2 ̆ 7 reading labels as well as indicating that there is 2 ̆ 7 sufficient 2 ̆ 7 information on product labels to make informed purchase decisions. Research limitations/implications - It was beyond the scope of the research to account for some of the utilitarian approaches to interpretation or in-depth comprehension of label information. The sample size of 155, although selected using a probability method, may, to some extent, limit the overall accuracy of the results. Practical implications - Offers some important information on different green consumer segments that would alert managers on how best to position environmental labels. Findings such as 2 ̆ 7 Satisfied with labels 2 ̆ 7 correlates with 2 ̆ 7 Labels are accurate 2 ̆ 7, which suggests that businesses need to provide a clear, accurate and easily legible label design to encourage satisfaction with the accuracy of content and the communication aspects of a label.

40|$|The {{function}} of environmental monitoring and information in governing {{the environment has}} changed considerably in recent times. Traditionally, environmental monitoring was geared towards governments and producers; it provided them with the information required to formulate environmental policies and environmental management strategies. More recently, environmental monitoring has come to serve an additional and different function. In line with the increasing popularity of notions such as accountability, transparency and availability of information, environmental monitoring is now also used {{as a tool to}} gather information for, and disseminate it to, ordinary citizen-consumers. This is illustrated by for example the upsurge of labelling schemes and various websites on which information about the environment and risks can be retrieved. The aim of this thesis is to analyse how this change in environmental monitoring affects the role of citizen-consumers in environmental governance. To achieve this goal, I develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of new forms of environmental monitoring which is applied in three case-studies. The theoretical framework is based on ecological modernisation theory since {{it is one of the}} most influential social theories on environmental issues and because it has addressed both the importance of monitoring and the role of citizen-consumers (yet the two have never been combined). Various stages can be identified in the development of <b>ecological</b> modernisation theory, <b>labelled</b> EcoMod 1 to EcoMod 3, in which different critical issues and concerns are discussed. The recent transformation towards EcoMod 3 is instigated by debates on the impact on globalisation and the emergent sociology of flows on ecological modernisation theory. Through this study on the changing functionality of environmental monitoring, I aim to contribute to this debate. A first issue addressed is how environmental monitoring can be analysed from a sociological perspective. Drawing upon the work of Foucault and Giddens, I argue that monitoring enables actors to watch over others and thus is an instrument to exert power. However, I also argue that it is important to recognize that the ways in which monitoring functions is not determined on forehand. Monitoring does not always lead to top-down control and surveillance, it can also empower citizen-consumers and civil society organisation vis-à-vis large institutional actors. This is what we are witnessing in the domain of environmental governance. Because the nation-state changes shape and draws upon new policy instruments, because it becomes apparent that under conditions of reflexive modernisation some environmental issues cannot be dealt with by traditional instruments, and because citizen-consumers are increasingly considered as 'agents of change', environmental monitoring is increasingly used to provide citizen-consumers with information that enables them to exert power in informational governance arrangements. This theoretical argument on environmental monitoring brings forth four topics to be analysed in the empirical section. First, I am concerned with the question what kind of power relations emerge in relation to these informational governance arrangements. Secondly, I am concerned with the issue of access defined as the extent to which these arrangements enable or disable citizen-consumers to be involved in environmental governance. Thirdly, I discuss the role of the nation-state in developing these informational governance arrangements and making them work. Lastly, I am concerned with the role of citizen-consumers and their potential to act as 'agent of change'. In the empirical section, three relevant categories of informational governance arrangements are distinguished. Each of these is represented by a case-study. The first category consists of those monitoring arrangements which aim to provide citizen-consumers with information on domestic energy consumption levels. By means of a unique case-study, I discuss the potential of these forms of monitoring to strengthen the position of the citizen-consumer in the organization of the energy-related infrastructures of consumption. In the second category, monitoring the chain, informational governance arrangements seek to influence consumption choices by providing information about the quality and/or performance of products. The case of fuel efficiency labelling is considered a typical case here. Finally, I am concerned with those instances in which information about public space, and its environmental quality, is provided to citizen-consumers. I analyse these arrangements by means of a multiple case-study, comparing developments in Netherlands with North-American experiences. The cases show that citizen-consumers can nowadays more easily gather information on the environmental performance of companies and governments and on the environmental quality of products and public space. Environmental monitoring is not only about top-down surveillance and control. Environmental monitoring arrangements and newly established flows of environmental information increasingly enable forms of counter-surveillance where ordinary citizen-consumers come to scrutinize corporations and governments. The cases illustrate that these forms of counter-surveillance are no formality; they are real in their existence and in their influence. When it comes to the issue of access, it is concluded that the traditional concern here (the Digital Divide) is generally considered to be of little importance. What is of greater importance is how flows of information are given shape and how they are linked to actual opportunities to take action. This is determined by the decisions made by governments, corporations and civil society actors to be (or not be) involved in the organisation of consumer-oriented information flows. The degree to which citizen-consumers can access environmental information, and act consequently, should thus not be discussed by reference to general numeric data on computer ownership and Internet connections. It is as much dependent on the decisions made by various involved actors, and on their view what kind of information citizen-consumers want to have, need to have, and can understand. This conclusion leads us to reconsider the role of the nation-state in the development of informational governance arrangements. Regulating by means of informational governance arrangements does not mean that the nation-state is rendered obsolete. By referring to the 're-invention of the nation-state' I emphasize two aspects; while nation-state can use these arrangements to achieve their formulated goals, the emergence of such arrangements also challenges the nation-state to reconsider issues of responsibility and transparency and balance different interests (such as freedom of information and homeland security). Finally, I conclude on the role of citizen-consumers as agents of change. Overall, the scope and impact of consumer-oriented informational governance arrangements does justify the claim that the citizen-consumer becomes more important in environmental governance. However, to understand this change fully, one cannot focus solely on the actual behaviour of citizen-consumers. The citizen-consumer exerts influence through multiple identities as governments and/or civil society groups seek to represent (and thus speak on behalf of) the citizen-consumers and as business leaders and politicians imagine how imaginary citizen-consumers might respond to incoming information and take action in anticipation. In the final section, I relate these conclusions to the debate on EcoMod 3 and assess what can be learnt from the case-studies, concluding with four theoretical guidelines to contribute to the development of EcoMod 3. I argue that to analyse the impact of environmental monitoring and surveillance, the instrumental and top-down view on surveillance must be replaced by the notion of 'networked' surveillance. Since informational governance arrangements come in different configurations in which the roles played by state- and non-state actors varies, the analysis of flows of information needs to take the activities of all societal actors into account. There is thus no reason to privilege the nation-state in the analysis. To understand the role that citizen-consumers (can) play in the development and functioning of informational governance arrangements, one is required to study access to information in relation to the provisioning of opportunities to act. Finally, the influence of citizen-consumers in informational governance arrangements must be assessed by taking the various identities of the citizen-consumers into account...|$|R
