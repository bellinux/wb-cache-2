5|$|In other articles, more {{focus was}} placed on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Sun Bowl {{officials}} reached out to other schools of interest upon receiving Lafayette College’s original rejection of the bid. As seen in the article by Amarillo Daily News on November 24, 1948, rather than calling out Lafayette's claim as a fallacy, the paper focused on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no further arrangements could be made with Lafayette College once Texas Miners officials had already reached out to the other schools.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} greeted warmly by the {{majority}} of the boxing community, with many experts believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of the sport and that the boxing scenes were the most realistic of any film.

5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World.

The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad.

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird {{may have had a}} protracted development period. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
