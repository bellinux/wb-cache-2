5|$|Since {{the total}} closure of urban {{landfills}} in 1986, rubbish from Lam Tin {{is first transferred}} to a treatment plant in Kowloon Bay where it is compressed, and then to South East New Territories Landfill (新界東南堆填區) where it <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> of.|$|E
5|$|The unsold PFA is sent by {{conveyor}} belt to the Barlow ash mound, {{which is used}} for disposal and temporary stockpile. Three conveyors feed the mound, with a total capacity of 750 tonnes an hour. FGD gypsum <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> of on the mound {{if it is not}} of a high enough grade to be sold. The mound has won a number of awards for its nature conservation work.|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} {{producer}} of food {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes account for the largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year are thrown away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. Bread slices account for the second food type most disposed of (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year). Salad <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> of in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten.|$|E

5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid waste <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E

25|$|Electricity {{services}} {{are provided by}} Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). Peppara and Aruvikkara dams are the main sources of water {{for the city and}} a new project plan for improving the water supply with Japanese aid was launched in 2011. The sewage <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> at the Muttathara Sewage Treatment Plant, which handles 32 million liters per day. The city area is divided into seven blocks for the execution of the sewage system, two commissioned in the 1990s and two after 2000. The sewerage was pumped to a stilling chamber at the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Valiyathura and <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> through sewage farms.|$|E

40|$|In this research, three {{anaerobic}} filters were operated with a 9 hour hydraulic detention time, and its effluent <b>was</b> <b>disposed</b> on four sand filters' bed {{in different}} application rates. On the first sand filter, 50 L. m- 2 <b>were</b> <b>disposed</b> once a day. On the second, {{the third and}} the fourth filters, the same load <b>was</b> <b>disposed</b> in twice, three and four times a day, distributed between 9 am and 4 pm, corresponding to rates of 100, 150 and 200 L. m- 2. d- 1. After the sand filter, the effluent was conducted to the denitrification reactors filled up with grit. As result, the sand filters have shown a great nitrification capacity and, after the external carbon adding, the denitrification reactor, where 50 L. m- 2 <b>was</b> <b>disposed</b> a day, showed a decrease of 43. 5 % in N-total concentration...|$|R
25|$|Raw {{natural gas}} is {{commonly}} collected {{from a group of}} adjacent wells and is first processed at that collection point for removal of free liquid water and natural gas condensate.

25|$|Since {{nail polish}} remover is a solvent, it will {{dissolve}} in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere {{will increase the}} concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover <b>is</b> <b>disposed,</b> it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.|$|E
25|$|Other {{work has}} been {{reported}} concerning tanning in S. bullata with the age pigment lipofuscin. Lipofuscin accumulation in larvae is a linear function of time. Some of the pigment <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> of at the pupal stage and then linear accumulation resumes in adults. Many projects have focused on an assay of this pigment as it could hold a rather accurate technique for aging S. bullata and other forensically important insects.|$|E

25|$|In the past, fly ash {{produced}} from coal combustion was simply entrained in flue gases and dispersed into the atmosphere. This created environmental and health concerns that prompted laws that have reduced fly ash emissions {{to less than}} 1% of ash produced. Worldwide, more than 65% of fly ash {{produced from}} coal power stations <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> of in landfills and ash ponds, although companies such as Duke Energy are starting initiatives to excavate coal ash basins due to the negative environmental impact involved.|$|E
25|$|Transuranic waste (TRUW) {{as defined}} by U.S. {{regulations}} is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100nCi/g (3.7MBq/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic ("beyond uranium"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW <b>is</b> <b>disposed</b> more cautiously than either low- or intermediate-level waste. In the U.S., it arises mainly from weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).|$|E
25|$|The {{main library}} for the city's public library system, in a severe classicizing style, has an oval central {{pavilion}} surrounded by four light courts.

A projecting three-bay central block, like a pared-down triumphal arch, provides a monumental entrance. At the rear the Central Library faced a sunken garden. The interiors feature some light-transmitting glass floors. The {{ceiling of the}} Periodicals Room is modified from Michelangelo's ceiling in the Laurentian Library.|$|E
