25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government. Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained {{a reputation as a}} hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. God I fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.|$|E

25|$|The last contact Tobares {{had with}} someone was at 12:32p.m. on June 5, 2013, {{the day he}} disappeared. He was {{speaking}} to Verónica Román, a friend from Argentina. While on the phone, Tobares {{explained that he was}} doing Gerardo a favor by driving a vehicle from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara and exchanging it for another of his boss' preference. He told Verónica that they were guiding him along the way, but {{said he did not know}} where he was, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared,</b> and that the whole situation seemed strange to him. That was the last thing Tobares said to Verónica.|$|E
25|$|He {{has been}} {{mentioned}} to being a hard working Toad with a strong loyalty to his Princess and friends. In many games, such as Super Mario 64, Toad is helpful to Mario and his crew on their search for Peach, despite the fact Toad is portrayed as quite a shy character. In Luigi's Mansion, he is seen crying in certain places because he cares so much about Mario getting kidnapped by ghosts, {{he was sent to}} the mansion to look for Mario in commands of Princess Peach. He was extremely loyal because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> and feared that he could get captured too. In , five colored Toads are trapped in paintings by King Boo.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared,</b> and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told him to ask those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> {{by the way}} he liked the episode despite it {{focusing}} on Wesley. He noticed the similarity between the [...] "legendary" [...] planets of Aldea in the episode and Magrathea in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a reference Handlen considered possibly deliberate. He thought that the child-heavy episode wasn't [...] "as bad as it could've been", and gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] grade. Michelle Erica Green in her review for TrekNation, described [...] "When the Bough Breaks" [...] as [...] "tedious, plodding and didactic" [...] with a [...] "preposterous" [...] ending. She thought that the plot element of ozone damage was not optimal and that the quality of the episode was typical of the first season.|$|E
500|$|Newell was {{the person}} to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was {{probably}} over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas {{and told him that}} if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of Sports Illustrated (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills. The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, [...] "Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates." ...|$|E
500|$|By July 30, the 24th Infantry had {{withdrawn}} {{to the last}} defensible high ground west of Sangju, [...] from the town. The North Korean troops hit the regiment with heavy attacks beginning at 05:00 that morning, targeting the 3rd Battalion's forward positions. Overstretched, lacking reserves and plagued by stragglers, the regiment began to come apart and senior commanders had to personally move into the front lines to help resist the Korean advance with their sidearms. The regiment had deteriorated so badly by this time that General Kean recalled the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, {{and placed it in}} defensive positions behind the 24th Infantry, to hold the line when the 24th withdrew. The next day North Koreans again pressed against the regiment's forward line of resistance. First Lieutenant Leon A. Gilbert, commanding A Company, and about 15 men then quit the forward line. White and other ranking officers ordered Gilbert back into position, but he refused to go, saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared.</b> The senior noncommissioned officer returned to the forward position with the men. After regimental commanders pleaded unsuccessfully with Gilbert to return to his position, he was arrested and tried for desertion under fire, a capital offense, and sentenced to death. His sentence was later reduced to 17 years in prison, but he served only five of them.|$|E

500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

They finished the first song and no applause.

And I said to myself at that moment, [...] "This I wanna be involved in" ... because that's the kind of balls you have to have to do anything.|$|E

2500|$|The {{likelihood}} of Panesar playing against Australia in the 2006–07 Ashes series led to media commentary by some Australian players, who {{indicated that they}} would take an aggressive approach towards him. Australian captain Ricky Ponting said, [...] "We'll try to make some sort of impact on him early on, and we won't let him get on top. The way our left-handers, especially Justin Langer and Matty Hayden, play spin is to be fairly aggressive." [...] However, he was also praised by Ponting. Ponting told the Sunday Age, [...] "He (Panesar) didn't look like <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> to throw the ball up a little bit and actually try to get you out. He's got good, subtle changes of pace and, watching the other night (against Pakistan), a really good arm ball as well.".|$|E

[...] Pet Sounds was released on May 16, debuting on the Billboard charts at 106. Compared to their previous albums in the US, Pet Sounds achieved dramatically less commercial success; it peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard LP chart, with sales estimated at around 500,000 units. Pet Sounds initial release was not awarded gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In February 2000, Pet Sounds was presented with gold and platinum awards based on sales that could be documented, although Capitol Records estimated it may have sold over two million copies.|$|E
2500|$|Director Kevin Macdonald {{had long}} been {{attached}} to the project, though an early report suggested screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan was set to make the film his directorial debut. Macdonald was {{a fan of the}} original mini-series, and said it would be a [...] "hard act to follow". He said it was the blend of fiction and the topical subjects of journalism and politics that attracted him to the project, adding that he wanted to examine the ways in which American and European societies learn {{what is going on in}} the world, and to what degree newspapers and the nightly news could be trusted. He said that in an age when people read fewer newspapers, he wanted to explore the necessity for reliable information and the threat to the journalistic profession from collusion between reporters and politicians, and that the film would [...] " [...] questions of how independent the press is, how much real investigating is conducted, and how much is taken on faith from lobbyists or PR sheets." [...] Macdonald cited the films of the 1970s, All the President's Men in particular, as major influences, saying that while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> of comparisons with the film account of the Watergate scandal, State of Play would primarily be a piece of entertainment.|$|E
