40|$|Background: Joint {{attention}} {{in young children}} is important to later developmental outcomes. Differences in engagement in joint attention are reported for young children with autism, with less joint {{attention in}}itiating and response behaviours found in staged research situations. Greater understanding of entry into joint attention, and <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> characteristics of joint attention in young children with autism in naturalistic situations could inform early intervention and support for individuals on the autism spectrum. Objectives: This study analysed early joint attention characteristics in two monozygotic twins, one of whom has a diagnosis of autism, in videoed family situations {{in the first two}} years of the children's life. By comparing the joint attention episodes of the two twins in naturalistic situations, the study aimed to reveal possible differences in successful initiation characteristics as well as <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> patterns for the twins. Methods: Home videotapes of first and second birthday events for the two siblings were analysed retrospectively using specialised software for recording, coding and analysing sequences, frequencies and durations of observed events. Characteristics of initiation, <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of joint attention episodes between the mother and each child were coded and examined. Results: A greater number of joint attention bids per minute were made by the mother to the twin with autism in the first year events, although a higher proportion of initiation bids were successful with the child without autism. The most successful types of initiation with the twin with autism were tapping and showing, however, the most successful types of initiation with the twin without autism were verbalization and giving. Overall, a greater number of joint attention episodes were established between the mother and the twin with autism, however, these were of markedly shorter duration than the episodes between the mother and child without autism, with the duration of joint attention episodes for the mother and child with autism being half of that found for the mother and twin without autism. Noticeably, in the first year events, joint attention was always terminated by the child with autism and not the mother, whereas both the mother and the child without autism terminated their joint attention episodes. By the second birthday the mother terminated joint attention with both twins and both twins also terminated their joint attention episodes. Conclusions: The frequency, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of joint attention episodes were found to be different for the two twins in this small study, one of whom has a diagnosis of autism. This develops the findings of previous studies, by highlighting that joint attention in natural situations can be frequently engaged in by a child with autism, but that the characteristics of these joint attention episodes differ from those with a child without autism, being initiated differently, considerably shorter and terminated by the child. It is argued that understanding of the differences in characteristics of the successful initiation, <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> patterns of joint attention episodes for these infants will help in informing supportive approaches to engaging and sustaining joint attention with young children with autism...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows that consumers are often subject to a projection bias,such as they exaggerate {{the degree to which}} their future tastes will resemble theircurrent ones. Such biases are particularly acute when consumers commit to a longtermcontract. This paper aims at assessing the consequences of projection bias andat defining when a legal intervention is relevant. In this perspective, we comparethe situation of naive and sophisticated agents, both with and without regulationregarding contract <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> early <b>termination</b> fees. The demand side of themarket consists either of sophisticated agents, who perfectly anticipate their futurewillingness to pay (WTP); or of naive consumers, who exhibit a projection bias. The supply side is a monopoly offering long- and short-term contracts. Our maincontribution consists in showing that naive consumers are not always worse off thansophisticated agents. The key parameter is how willingness to pay varies over time. If consumers have an increasing WTP for a given service or product, naive agentscan actually be better off than sophisticated ones. We argue that naivete protectsconsumers against a price increase. However, naivete also leads to less exchanges onthe market, thus generating a deadweight loss. Hence, the overall effect of naiveteon social welfare is ambiguous. As far as public policy is concerned, we concludethat regulating contract duration is only relevant in some circumstances, dependingon the market characteristics and on the bias...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of temporalities {{in a process}} of territorial development is approached based on the experience of an accompanying structure of territorial actors and the totality of an urban workshop created within the framework of a study on urban renewal of the industrial valley of Seraing (closure of the hot phase of the Liège steel industry). This example illustrates certain aspects linked to the confrontation of different temporalities forming part of varied <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> dates. Confrontation which stands out between a respect for a process and the need for a result, often very strong in a situation of crisis or profound change in the territory and therefore its identity. A link is made between the breadth of the anticipated changes and the need to negotiate these changes with the different categories of territorial players. The creation of an urban workshop represents a moment of participative procedure permitting one to cross in a transversal and creative manner the support of the technicians {{and at the same time}} various categories of territorial users. It is a support to the construction of a strategic vision, a negotiated City plan, inscribed in the long term and which forms a link with the past. It approaches questions of investment over time according to the degree of involvement or adhesion expected from the players, up to the notion of acceptance. To accompany this type of procedure, the creation of temporal mechanisms of animation, of consultation and of networking of territorial players, encourages the construction of a common knowledge of the territory, coherence, and the {{management of}} the process itself, even rehabilitated the idea of a community of interest or common good. The relevance, the feasibility and viability of a territorial development plan demand an adaptation between the mobilization and the allocation of financial, human resources and time. Il s'agit ici d'illustrer la gestion des temporalités dans un processus de développement territorial en se basant sur un cas concret, à partir de l'expérience d'une structure qui accompagne des projets de développement territorial. Une structure dont les interventions varient par la durée et par les dimensions abordées par rapport aux différentes étapes du cycle d'un projet (du diagnostic initial, jusqu'à l'évaluation et la capitalisation).

R. hill country research station in the lower North Island of New Zealand from April 1990 to February 1991. The primary aim {{of the study was}} to describe the mother-offspring relationship over the first three months of the kid's life and to investigate sex differences in maternal investment. There was no significant sex difference in the mother-offspring spatial relationship, however, it was found that twins remained closer to their mothers during the first three months. There were small sex differences in the frequency of suckling in single kids only, but other variables of suckling behaviour including total time spent suckling, <b>and</b> the <b>duration,</b> initiation <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of suckling were not significantly different between the sexes. Total suckling time, suckling <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> frequency, mother initiation <b>and</b> kid <b>termination</b> all decreased with kid maturation. There were significant differences in all suckling variables between single and twin kids. Sexual differences in kid birth weight, and growth rate, were also highly significant. Discrepancy in the proximate measures of parental investment made it difficult to conclude whether sex-biased maternal investment occurs in feral goats. Further investigation is required to determine the accuracy of suckling behaviour as a measure of maternal investment. The second part of the study involved the construction of diurnal activity budgets for adults and for kids over the period 0830 to 1630 hours. The percentage of time spent grazing was greatest during the mating season whereas in the gestation and kidding season a larger portion of time was devoted to rest. Female kids spent more time grazing and less time playing and resting than male kids up to the age of three month. Time spent grazing was greater in single than in twin kids. The time allocated to different activities changed significantly over the first three months of age. In the third part of the study, the social events following the introduction of a new entrant to the herd was investigated. Exploration was the most common action of herd members toward the new entrant. A peak of agonism occurred within the first hour following the introduction of each new entrant then decreased rapidly.

40|$|Side {{switching}} {{by armed}} groups is a prominent feature of many civil wars. Shifts in alignment have far-reaching consequences, influencing key outcomes such as civil war <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination,</b> military effectiveness, levels of civilian victimization, and state-building prospects.

Recent explanations highlighting the role of territorial control, factional infighting, or relative power considerations also have limited value. In many wars fought in weak states characterized by low barriers to side switching, two mechanisms explain patterns of collaboration and defection: first, political rivalries that lead actors to collaborate in exchange for military support in localized struggles; and second, patronage-based incentives that induce collaboration for material gain. A nested analysis drawing on original data from wars in southern Sudan and Darfur supports this argument. The findings have implications for understanding alignments in civil wars, the role of weak states in counterinsurgency, and ethnic politics more generally, as well as policy relevance for factionalized civil wars...|$|E

Analysis of drought index and precipitation data revealed that meteorological drought is, on average, more severe in northern Delaware than in coastal and southern regions of the state. Through the analysis of the 500 hPa height anomalies present during each respective drought, several synoptic patterns were found to be associated with the onset, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of droughts in Delaware.

PARP- 1 {{is known to}} functionally interact with PARP- 2 in the nucleus and the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) can remove poly(ADP-ribose) chains from target proteins. Here we aimed at analyzing possible cooperation between PARP- 1, PARP- 2 and PARG in regulation of TGFb signaling. Methods: A robust cell model of TGFb signaling, i. e. human HaCaT keratinocytes, was used. Endogenous Smad 3 ADP-ribosylation and protein complexes between Smads and PARPs were studied using proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays, which were complemented by in vitro ADP-ribosylation assays using recombinant proteins. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels and promoter-reporter assays provided quantitative analysis of gene expression in response to TGFb stimulation and after genetic perturbations of PARP- 1 /- 2 and PARG based on RNA interference.

Computational models of this process suggest that it involves the accumulation of information over time, but {{little is known about}} the temporal course of valuation in the brain. To examine this, we manipulated the available decision time and observed the consequences in the brain and behavioral correlates of choice. Participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they chose to eat or not eat basic food items, in two conditions differing in the amount of time provided for choice. After identifying valuation-related regions with unbiased whole-brain general linear models, we analyzed two regions of interest: ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Finite impulse response models of the upsampled estimated neural activity from those regions allowed us to examine the onset, <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of decision value signals, and to compare across regions.

Consequently, we use qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to reveal the perspectives, preferences, and aims of dairy CEOs and milk producers in Austria. The surveys follow a case study approach. We have selected eight dairies based on distinct criteria to conduct face to face interviews as well as a standard questionnaire procedure. Furthermore, a stratified sample of 1, 500 corresponding milk producers has been drawn to perform a standard questionnaire procedure as well. A main part of the surveys focuses on the design of contracts between dairies and milk producers.

A {{complete understanding of}} pathological conditions as well as normal brain function, therefore, hinges on elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these mostly interdependent variations. In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD) -the electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> of SD caused by K+ perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling {{plays a key role}} in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD.

The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts. Accordingly, we claim that our approach can be used as a future guide to investigate the role of glutamate, ion concentrations, and dynamics cell volume in other brain pathologies and normal brain function...|$|E

The purpose of this qualitative descriptive {{study was to determine the}} influence of mentors on the career development of Illinois community college presidents, and the extent those presidents were now mentoring others. Using a constant comparative method of data analysis the material obtained through 20 in-depth personal interviews was analyzed. The sample consisted of 20 male Illinois community college presidents selected through a stratified random sampling process. Data collected through these in-depth interviews led to findings conceptualized into four categories. The first category, mentoring characteristics, discusses that all presidents had multiple mentors; that mentors could be other persons or take inanimate forms such as books and institutions; and that the mentors functioned as teachers, facilitators, modelers, and encouragers. The second category, mentoring cycle, consists of initiation, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>termination</b> periods, and a post-presidency phase where due to an interaction of position and age a president no longer had mentors. The third category, mentoring impact, discusses the tangible and intangible learnings which affected the president's career development. An analysis of presidents as mentors comprised the fourth and final category. The extent of mentoring that these presidents are engaged in bodes well for future leadership in higher education. Several of the findings are congruent with the previous research on mentoring, while the presence of an inanimate mentor, the uniqueness of the first mentor, and positive learning through negative mentors, in addition to the post-presidency findings, emerged as new insights obtained from this study. From these findings seven conclusions were drawn about the importance and nature of mentoring with regard to career development.

Thus, dysfunction of these enzymes might contribute to pathologies of the inner ear. Objective: The mechanisms underlying endolymphatic hydrops, a hallmark of inner ear dysfunction, are not known in detail; however, altered balance in cAMP and cGMP signaling systems appears to be involved. Key components of these systems are PDEs, enzymes that modulate the amplitude, <b>duration,</b> <b>termination,</b> <b>and</b> specificity of cAMP and cGMP signaling. Method: To evaluate the role of PDE 3, 4, and 5 and associated cAMP and cGMP pools in inner ear function, the effect of cilostamide (PDE 3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE 4 inhibitor), and sildenafil (PDE 5 inhibitor), administrated via mini-osmotic pumps, on mouse inner ear fluid homeostasis was evaluated using 9. 4 T in vivo MRI in combination with intraperitoneally administered Gadolinium contrast. Also, using human saccule as a model, the expression of PDEs and related signaling molecules and targets was studied using immunohistochemistry. Results: PDE 3, PDE 4, as well as PDE 5 inhibitors resulted {{in the development of}} endolymphatic hydrops. Furthermore, PDE 3 B, PDE 4 D, and some related signaling components were shown to be expressed in the human saccule...|$|R
