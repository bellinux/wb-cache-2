However, one of the best historical sources of organs for research, the bodies of executed criminals, had not been available {{during the early years of}} his research as the Weimar government made very minimal use of the death penalty, and did not execute any women. In a 1931 letter Stieve complained that it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> set of ovaries from a healthy woman.|$|E

25|$|The Kinsey reports {{rated the}} {{percentage}} of people who had sexual interaction with animals {{at some point in their}} lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms, but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing sampling bias. Martin Duberman has written that it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> random sample in sexual research, and that even when Paul Gebhard, Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.|$|E
25|$|The waiver, {{which can}} be granted after the {{completion}} of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, the number of patients each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275. Still, due to this patient limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients can find it very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the {{intention}} is to glance or cut {{the ball to the}} backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one could argue that the resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E

25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E
25|$|Co-ownership co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting {{share in the}} corporation that owns the building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E

500|$|Partly {{because of}} this controversy, Joyce found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{publisher}} to accept the book, but {{it was published in}} 1922 by Sylvia Beach from her well-known Rive Gauche bookshop, Shakespeare and Company. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, John Rodker produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at Folkestone. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of [...] "bootleg" [...] versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher Samuel Roth. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.|$|E
500|$|One {{complaint}} {{many customers}} have with Schwa {{is that it}} is exceedingly <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> reservation. GQ magazine describes a typical customer as having spent weeks trying to get past the always full answering machine that serves as Schwa's primary reservation system. [...] The restaurant attracts an estimated 60 requests for its 26 seats each day, and is notoriously slow at returning phone calls. One couple got so frustrated with the system that they drove down to the restaurant to make a reservation in person. Upon arrival, they were told they had to call it in. Despite their frustration, the couple kept trying and when they finally got in they remarked, [...] "You know what? It was worth it." [...] According to Carlson, most customers' first comment when they arrive at Schwa is either to complain about how difficult it was to get a reservation or to ask for another one. Schwa will not seat customers without a reservation, even if the restaurant is empty.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Jason Isaacs {{obtained}} {{the role of}} Michael Britten, the central character of the series. Gordon summated {{the premise of the}} character: [...] "He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he's with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. [...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] Killen thought that the premise behind the series would be relatable to audiences, making it easier to expand his fanbase. [...] "I think there were aspects of Lone Star that were more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> wider, broader audience interested in," [...] he articulated. [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that Britten's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win." [...] The following month, producers approached Laura Allen to play Hannah Britten. Michaela McManus initially received the role of Hannah, but later received the role of Tara instead, whom Allen originally auditioned to play.|$|E

500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta. Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson. It took Lieberstein and Celotta {{four or five days}} to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was {{inspired}} by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call [...] "blitzes", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as [...] "Michael's feelings to Holly". Then they all read all of them out loud and see which one gets the biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a private account.

When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.|$|E
