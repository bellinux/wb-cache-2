500|$|She {{acknowledges}} the struggles for equality that women riders in earlier generations {{had to face}} were greater than her own, but notes that women jockeys still [...] "fight a battle." [...] In her early career, she simply tried to [...] "blend in" [...] with the male riders, but nonetheless encountered some owners and trainers who refused to hire a female jockey. She later said, [...] "I was very conscious when <b>I</b> <b>raced</b> against their horses—and when I beat them." [...] Napravnik has encountered harassment from male jockeys on the track when other riders would deliberately bump her or pen in her horse from all sides. [...] In a 2013 interview with 60 Minutes, Napravnik said that she has heard hecklers at the track yell at her to [...] "go home and have a baby," [...] or [...] "go home {{and stay in the}} kitchen." [...] She repeatedly has chosen to make her mark on the track instead of getting into post-race fights. [...] Trainer Larry Jones, having witnessed other jockeys deliberately bumping into her on the track, commented, [...] "Don't do Rosie that way, because she will run over you. The girl has no fear." ...|$|E

Jarrett started off 2008 with a 16th-place finish at Daytona. He retired from points racing after the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. At the weekend's pre-race driver's meeting, {{he spoke to the}} other drivers, saying [...] "Enjoy this. We all have our time in this, and mine has been fantastic. To me, it has been an honor and a privilege to be able to race in this series and say <b>I</b> <b>raced</b> with and against and sometimes beat the best in the world.

60|$|When I {{knocked the}} shackle-bolt loose, the chain roared {{out through the}} hawse-hole and into the sea. <b>I</b> <b>raced</b> aft, putting the wheel up.

60|$|Loading as I ran we {{soon came}} to a bok which had been turned {{by some of the}} other hunters. Again <b>I</b> <b>raced,</b> pulled up, leaped off, and fired. The pop! pop! was now going on all over the plain, and balls were {{whistling}} everywhere. Again my bok refused to stop to look at me--as he ought to have done--and again I missed.

60|$|As I sped {{through the}} air the {{screeching}} of the bullets around me convinced me that only by a miracle could I escape, but the die was cast, and throwing on full speed <b>I</b> <b>raced</b> a straight course toward Helium. Gradually I left my pursuers further and further behind, and I was just congratulating myself on my lucky escape, when a well-directed shot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my little craft. The concussion nearly capsized her, and with a sickening plunge she hurtled downward through the dark night.|$|E
60|$|It was for {{the house}} of the Ravons that <b>I</b> <b>raced.</b> But even as I reached it, it flashed into my mind that there was no refuge for me there. The door was locked.

But oh, my friends, it is at that supreme moment of danger that Etienne Gerard has ever risen to his height. There was one path to safety, and in an instant I had chosen it.|$|E

60|$|I {{shoved him}} my rifle {{and left him}} on guard while <b>I</b> <b>raced</b> around the chart-house. A lighted match, {{in the hands of}} Tom Spink, {{directed}} me. Between the booby-hatch and the wheel, sitting up and rocking back and forth with wringings of hands and wavings of arms, tears of agony bursting from his eyes, was Buckwheat. My first thought was that in some stupid way he had got the acid into his own eyes. But the terrible fashion in which he coughed and strangled would quickly have undeceived me, had not Louis, bending over the booby-companion, uttered a startled exclamation.|$|E
60|$|Those at {{the table}} had their backs toward me. But for the {{creature}} walking toward us I might have escaped that moment. Slowly the thing approached me, when its attention was attracted by a huge slave chained a few yards to my right.

He had never seemed to want to play with me before, and I took it as a great compliment. <b>I</b> <b>raced</b> after the ball, which he had hit quite a long way, picked it up in my mouth, and brought it back to him.
