50|$|As {{the second}} {{illustration}} shows, a low pressure ratio fan (such as that {{used on a}} high bypass ratio turbofan) has a range of <b>working</b> <b>lines.</b> At high flight speeds, the ram pressure ratio factors up the cold nozzle pressure ratio, causing the nozzle to choke. Above the choking condition, the <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> tend to coalesce into a unique steep straight line. When the nozzle unchokes, the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> starts to become more curved, reflecting the curvature of the nozzle characteristic. With falling flight Mach number, the cold nozzle pressure ratio decreases. Initially this has no effect upon {{the position of the}} <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> apart from the curved (unchoked) tail, which becomes longer. Eventually, the cold nozzle will become unchoked at lower flight Mach numbers, even at full throttle. The <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> will now become curved, gradually migrating towards surge as flight Mach number decreases. The lowest surge margin <b>working</b> <b>line</b> occurs at static conditions.|$|R
