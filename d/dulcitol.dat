50|$|As {{cataract}} formation progresses due to galactitol synthesis {{and subsequent}} osmotic swelling, changes {{occur in the}} lens epithelial cells. For instance, when rabbit lenses are placed in high-galactose mediums, a nearly 40% reduction in lens amino acid levels is observed, along with significant ATP reduction as well. Researchers theorized that this reduction in amino acid and ATP levels during cataract formation {{is a result of}} osmotic swelling. To test this theory, Kinoshita placed rabbit lenses in a high-galactose environment, but inhibited the osmotic swelling by constantly regulating galactose and galactitol concentrations. The results show that amino acid levels remained relatively constant and in some cases even increased. Thus, from these experiments {{it would appear that the}} loss of amino acids in the lens when exposed to galactose is primarily due to the osmotic swelling of the lens brought about by <b>dulcitol</b> galactitol retention. Interestingly, galactosemic patients will also present with amino aciduria and galactitoluria (excessive levels of amino acids and galactitol in the urine).|$|E
50|$|In galactosemic cataracts, osmotic {{swelling}} of the lens epithelial cells (LEC) occurs. Osmosis is the movement of water from areas of low particle concentration to areas of high particle concentration, to establish equilibrium. Researchers concluded that this osmotic swelling must {{be the result of}} an accumulation of abnormal metabolites or electrolytes in the lens. Ruth Van Heyningen was the first to discover that the lens's retention of <b>dulcitol,</b> synonymous for galactitol, induces this osmotic swelling in the galactosemic cataract. However, galactose concentration must be fairly high before the enzyme, aldose reductase, will convert significant amounts of the sugar to its galactitol form. As it turns out, the lens is a favorable site for galactose accumulation. The lens phosphorylates galactose at a relatively slow pace in comparison to other tissues. This factor, in combination with the low activity of galactose-metabolizing enzymes in galactosemic patients, allows for the accumulation of galactose in the lens. Aldose reductase is able to dip into this galactose reservoir and synthesize significant amounts of galactitol. As is mentioned above, galactitol is not a suitable substrate for the enzyme, polyol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes {{the next step in the}} carbohydrate metabolic cycle. Thus, the sugar alcohol idly begins to accumulate in the lens.|$|E

40|$|The {{ordinary}} procedure in diagnosing the common poultry diseases consists in making cultures on agar slants and, after growth has appeared, transferring the culture to four fermenta-tion tubes containing respectively lactose, glucose, sucrose, and either maltose, dextrin, or <b>dulcitol.</b> The fermentation of glucose alone, either {{with or without}} the production of gas, indicates the presence of Salmonella pullorum, the cause of bacillary white diarrhea. If both glucose and maltose (dextrin or <b>dulcitol</b> may be used in place of maltose) are fermented, but neither lactose nor sucrose, the organism is Salmonella gallinarum, the cause of fowl typhoid. Acid in glucose and sucrose, but not in lactose or in maltose, shows the organism to be that of fowl cholera (Pas-teurella avicida) '. Hadley and his co-workers (1918) showed that Salmonella pullorum and Salmonella gallinarum produce approximately the same amount of acid in glucose. Most cultures of S. pullorum pro-duce gas in glucose. Pasteurella avicida ferments glucose, but not as strongly as S. pullorum and S. gallinarum. These workers also demonstrated that maltose is fermented more rapidly and with greater acid production by S. gallinarum than are either dextrin or <b>dulcitol.</b> S. pullorum produces at once an alkaline reaction in maltose, whereas Pasteurella avicida may or may not produce a very slight acid fermentation of this sugar.

40|$|D-Sorbitol and <b>dulcitol</b> (galactitol), which, to-gether with D-mannitol, are {{the three}} {{naturally}} occurring hexitols, have been known since {{the last quarter of}} the nineteenth century. Many fungi can utilize sorbitol for growth, but <b>dulcitol</b> is assimilated poorly by Aspergillus niger and a few yeasts. Among bacterial fermen-tations of these hexitols the best known are those by members of the Acetobacter group. These species will readily oxidize mannitol to fructose, sorbitol to sorbose, glycerol to dihy-droxyacetone, and erythritol to L-erythrulose, but most of the organisms will not attack <b>dulcitol.</b> In a study of oxidation by Acetobacter suboxydans, King and Cheldelin (1952) found that the initial step of sorbitol oxidation (1 atom of oxygen) in resting cells was not affected by 4 X 10 - 4 M 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and thus they concluded that this step to sorbose was independent of the esterifica-tion of inorganic phosphate.

The inhibition could be abolished by addition of glucose or by aeration. When a small inoculum of a dulcitol-positive E. coli strain was introduced into a fully grown (24 hr) static Veal Infusion Broth culture of a dulcitol-negative E. coli, no multiplication occurred. However, the inoculum did grow {{in the presence of}} a carbon source (<b>dulcitol)</b> which could not be utilized by the static population. The logarithmic growth rate attained by the dulcitol-positive inoculum under these conditions was independent of the <b>dulcitol</b> concentration. In contrast, the maximal population size was a function of the amount of <b>dulcitol</b> present. Similar results were obtained when sucrose or salicin was substituted for the <b>dulcitol.</b> All strains grew well in filtrates of 24 -hr broth cultures with growth rates and maximal populations approximating those attained in fresh broth.

40|$|Six {{species and}} six {{additional}} genovars are combined within the so-called Enterobacter cloacae complex, {{with one of}} them being the species Enterobacter hormaechei. In a recent population genetic study, two genetic clusters were found in close phylogenetic proximity to the genetic cluster of E. hormaechei. In order to prove the hypothesis that these three genetic clusters belong to the same species, we performed cross-hybridization experiments in microplates with DNAs of representatives of each genetic cluster. The close phylogenetic relationship among the clusters was reflected by their relatively low ΔTm values, ranging from 0. 3 to 4. 8, confirming the hypothesis that the clusters are parts of the same species. These clusters can be distinguished from the other species of the E. cloacae complex, which have ΔTm values of 5. 6 to 10. 3. Forty-eight E. hormaechei strains from the different genetic clusters were phenotypically characterized with 129 biochemical tests. In this way, E. hormaechei could be differentiated from the other species of the E. cloacae complex because it tests negative in the 3 -hydroxy-butyrate test. The three genetic clusters of E. hormaechei could also be differentiated from each other by using phenotypic tests. Hence, we propose three new subspecies of E. hormaechei corresponding to genetic clusters VI, VII, and VIII of the E. cloacae complex.

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{characteristics of}} 213 isolates of Burkholderia pseudomallei from patients with melioidosis and 140 isolates {{from the soil}} in central and northeastern Thailand were compared. Whereas the biochemical profiles of all the clinical isolates were similar, all soil isolates from the central area and 25 % of isolates from northeastern Thailand comprised a different phenotype. This was characterised by the ability to assimilate L-arabinose (100 %), adonitol (100 %), 5 -keto-gluconate (90 %) and D-xylose (84 %), but failure to assimilate <b>dulcitol</b> (0 %), erythritol (0 %) and trehalose (10 %). Compared with clinical isolates, these organisms had similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles and were also recognised by a specific polyclonal antibody against B. pseudomallei. As melioidosis is rare in central Thailand, but common in the northeast, this {{raises the possibility that}} this biochemical phenotype may be less virulent, or may even represent a different species...|$|E
