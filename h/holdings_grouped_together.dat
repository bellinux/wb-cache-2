Integral to the Acland Report of 1916, which led to the setting up of the Forestry Commission immediately after the war, was the wider social concern.

They envisaged that ‘the small <b>holdings</b> will be <b>grouped</b> <b>together</b> on the best land within or near the forests so as to economise labour in the working of the holdings, ... and to provide an ample supply of ... labour for forestry work. Families settled on new holdings in forest areas will be a net addition to the resident rural population’.|$|R
