5|$|Higgins sued Lucas and Gladys City Oil, Gas and Manufacturing Company for royalties, {{using the}} basis that the second lease was invalid because the first lease had not yet expired when the second was enacted. After the parties settled out of court, Higgins formed the Higgins Oil and Fuel Company located {{at the center of}} Spindletop. This company was {{vulnerable}} to takeover bids due to Higgins' over-zealous land prospecting, which enabled the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby to overtake his ownership in 1902 by purchasing his shares of the company for $3 million. Higgins maintained his leasing rights to his land, and would establish the Higgins Standard Oil Company. He later established other wells with various <b>investors,</b> <b>with</b> an eccentric habit of pulling his interests out, leaving the majority of the profits for others.|$|E
