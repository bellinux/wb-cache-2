40|$|Material {{testing is}} a crucial step during the design process as {{particular}} materials serve as safety and life saving conditions. In this study, a MoSi 2 is chosen as the target specimen to undergo impact under high temperatures. An <b>impact</b> <b>apparatus</b> is designed and constructed {{for the purpose of}} propelling alumina particles at high velocities. A nozzle using compressed nitrogen gas is used to fire the particle at the desired velocities. Due to the possibility of thermal shock occurring at higher temperatures, a separate nozzle utilizing vitiation heating is designed to fire the particle at equally higher temperatures to prove the lack of thermal shock. Throughout the experiment, measurements including particle velocity, exit temperature, specimen temperature, and damage of the specimen are documented in both the cold test nozzle and vitiated heating test nozzle. Ultimately, the design of the <b>impact</b> <b>apparatus</b> is such that it may used as a characterization tool. Although the final results focus on the characterization of the MoSi 2 specimen and the damage associated, the <b>impact</b> <b>apparatus</b> may be used to characterize materials at any temperature application and is not limited to characterizing ceramics. ...|$|E

The maximum reduction of the strength and modulus are 10 and 3. 7 %, respectively. ...|$|E

The results showed that the peak load degradation of collapsed tubes is more rapid when it is impacted by higher incident energy. Heavier impactors caused more damage to the tubes at lower incident energies as reﬂected by their lower number of impacts to collapse, however, its effect gradually decreases at relatively higher energies. The incident energy is a major damage factor in the collapse of the tubes for lower number of impacts. However, the number of impacts becomes the key factor when the value of the incident energy decreases. ...|$|E

A specially designed <b>impact</b> <b>apparatus</b> was developed to evaluate the strength of the reactivated pellets as well as determine the effect of “superheating”. It was found that the reactivity of synthetic pellets was significantly elevated over that of raw limestone after steam hydration. The CaO conversion of spent pellets increased from 0. 113 to 0. 419 after hydration, whereas that of spent limestone ranged from 0. 089 to 0. 278. The CaO conversions of hydrated samples calcined under different conditions achieved the identical level, proportional to the degree of hydration. As expected, the mechanical strength of synthetic pellets declined severely after reactivation. Large cracks emerged on hydrated limestone as seen in scanning electron microscope images. By contrast, similar cracks were not observed for synthetic pellets after hydration, although hydration did produce higher porosity than seen with limestone and an increased surface area, which enhanced CO 2 capacity and was associated with an increase in strength loss. The breakage rate of superheated steam-reactivated limestone derived pellets was about half that of hydrated samples. This demonstrates that superheating treatment (which allows the annealing of stacking faults and mechanical strain produced by hydration) enhances the strength of hydrated pellets. This work demonstrated that combining steam hydration with superheating can both reactivate the spent synthetic pellets and reduce strength decay associated with the hydration process...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed in order to mimic the effect of landmine-loading on materials and structures to be studied in a laboratory setting, {{without the need for}} explosives. Compressed gas is discharged beneath a sand layer, simulating the dynamic flow generated by a buried explosive. High speed photography reveals that the stages of soil motion observed during a landmine blast are replicated. The effect of soil saturation and the depth of the sand layer on sand motion are evaluated. Two series of experiments have been performed with the buried charge simulator to characterise subsequeny impact of the sand. First, the time variation in pressure and impulse during sand impact on a stationary target is evaluated using a Kolsky bar apparatus. It is found that the pressure pulse imparted to the Kolsky bar consists of two phases: an initial transient phase of high pressure (attributed to wave propagation effects in the impacting sand), followed by a lower pressure phase of longer duration (due to GRAHAM, DO YOU MEAN LATERAL OR AXIAL FLOW? flow of the sand against the Kolsky bar). Both phases make a significant contribution to the total imparted impulse. It is found that wet sand exerts higher peak pressures and imparts a larger total impulse than dry sand. The level of imparted impulse is determined as a function of sand depths, and of stand-off distance between the sand and the impacted end of the the Kolsky bar. The second study uses a vertical impulse pendulum to measure the momentum imparted by sand impact to a target which is free to move vertically. The effect of target mass upon imparted momentum is investigated.
