5|$|Wales. The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} built in 610. The present {{building}} on the site dates from 1873, and was designed by the rector at the time. It reuses earlier material including a decorated 15th-century <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> a 17th-century bell.|$|E
5|$|Cave 11 is {{difficult}} to reach with a broken front and a hall. To the left of a hall is a cell, lower in height than the hall. The hall has a grooved <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> a recess with {{a seat at the}} back. Outside the hall is a view seat. The cave bears traces of paint.|$|E

5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South <b>doorway,</b> <b>and</b> {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The Bishops House {{consists}} of two narrow ranges with a narrow courtyard. The {{front of the building}} on the south side is crenelated. The arrangement of the rooms inside has been changed many times over the years. It still includes features from the 15th century including a <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> oak screens. The windows include some remnants of 16th century stained glass.|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Hall {{sits at the}} {{southern}} end of a terrace. It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with a decorative dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large <b>doorway,</b> <b>and</b> are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building. On {{the southern}} side of the building, more Ionic pilasters rise the height of the building, spread between four large windows.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged {{by the addition of}} a south porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda appears in the <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E
5|$|Little archaeological {{evidence}} {{relates to the}} period immediately after the dissolution, or to the Tudor house built on part of the site. A sawpit {{was found in the}} outer courtyard. It is considered that this might date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of the abbey. The kitchens to the south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family. The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as middens. Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front, and the foundations of the north wing. The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.|$|E

Reyes is able to {{retrieve}} the license plate number on the truck used to kidnap the abductee. It is later revealed that it belongs to Travis Clayton Moberly, better known as Absalom, {{the leader of a}} doomsday cult. The FBI storms the cult's compound, and arrests Absalom, but Smith is not found. Absalom tells Scully and Doggett that he has been saving abductees that had been left for dead by the aliens. Examining video of the compound raid, Scully, Reyes and Doggett watch Smith step through a <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> transform into Agent Doggett. Doggett is stunned, and the agents realize that Smith is still in the compound.|$|E
5|$|The {{first was}} floor was {{accessed}} via the main staircase, {{situated in the}} east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and {{the entrance to the}} oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall {{was the head of the}} west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.|$|E
5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, in Durham, the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on {{the west end of}} the cathedral. Originally, Puiset had planned to put in a Lady Chapel {{on the east side of}} the cathedral, but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side of the cathedral. The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four lobed, piers. A model for the chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster in rebuilding the choir. The current Norman <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> the gallery that is above the doorway in Durham Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E

5|$|Some of the cathedral's {{fittings}} {{and monuments}} {{are hundreds of}} years old. The brass lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan Ionic capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of John Godelee. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The bishop's throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, canted front and stone <b>doorway,</b> <b>and</b> a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped statue niches and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former Saxon cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round plinth. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of putti. The Chapel of St Martin is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each {{side of the}} porch is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E
