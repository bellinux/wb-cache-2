5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when {{he was trying to do}} so.|$|E
5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E

Heavily influenced by visual art, the sound of The Abyss has been described to capture the dark emotional underpinnings from life in a way that transforms those emotions <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be felt through sound.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory of}} {{creative}} {{people is the}} investment theory of creativity. This approach {{suggest that there are}} many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea {{to the point that it}} is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.|$|E

Epworth watched the first thirteen Bond films seeking the [...] "musical code" [...] of the songs, [...] "whatever the modal structure or the chord that always seemed to unify those songs" [...] {{and contributed to the}} mood and [...] "that kind of '60s jazzy quality".

It’s this 'oh shit... maybe this isn’t what God wants'. I think it’s the darkest moment on the record." [...] Spearman called the inclusion of loaded, political lyrics on otherwise upbeat songs [...] "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your interesting lyrical idea <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{on the face of it}} is just there to be enjoyed". Higgs told NME that Kanye West's 2013 album Yeezus had a major impact on his writing, encouraging him to present himself more confidently, while Nick Cave provided inspiration to be more impulsive with his writing.|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

[...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was more benign.

[...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before.

5000|$|The album has {{received}} positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic's James Manheim wrote [...] "They (the tracks) are artfully done, {{stepping up to}} the line of pure schlock but not crossing over, and using the simplicity of minimalist patterns to rope audiences <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> actually slightly different." [...] Sputnikmusic gave the album 4.5 stars saying [...] "Divernire is filled with piano compositions that capture the attention and emotions of listeners and probably won't give them back.". Classic FM wrote that the title track is [...] "A piece that builds from a simple piano chord sequence to a swirling hive of activity." ...|$|R

500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it <b>into</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'"

PopMatters reviewer Kiel Hauck wrote that Lazzara and Nolan's call-and-response vocals, featured on the group's debut, were placed [...] "perfect throughout the record" [...] as the pair [...] "create a beautiful combination that serves as a reminder of what made this band so special in the first place". Tori Pederson of Punknews.org {{said the group}} [...] "sound like a well-oiled machine here," [...] producing [...] "arguably the best album of their career" [...] in the process.
