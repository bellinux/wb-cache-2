5|$|Breckinridge's first speech favored {{allowing}} the Kentucky Colonization Society {{to use the}} House chamber; later, he advocated directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and to meet the costs of transporting settlers there. Funding internal improvements was traditionally a Whig stance, but Breckinridge advocated conducting a state <b>geologic</b> <b>survey,</b> making the Kentucky River more navigable, chartering a turnpike, incorporating a steamboat company, and funding the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum. As a reward for supporting these projects, he presided over {{the approval of the}} Louisville and Bowling Green Railroad's charter and was appointed director of the asylum.|$|E

25|$|Coal {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Cebu about 1837. There were 15 localities {{over the whole}} island, on both coast; some desultory mining had been carried out Naga near Mount Uling, but most serious operations were at Licos and Camansi west of Compostela and Danao. Active work ceased about 1895 with insurrections, and no production worked {{for more than ten}} years. A topographic and <b>geologic</b> <b>survey</b> of Compostela, Danao and Carmen took place in 1906. The Compostela-Danao coalfield contained about six million workable tons.

2500|$|Mudge was {{responsible}} for surveying [...] of mineral and soil resources {{by the end of}} the year, with a budget of US$3,500 and a staff of five. In the 1860s, there were no railroads and very few towns west of Topeka, and the area had seen a resurgence of [...] "Indian trouble". Mudge moved to Manhattan, Kansas, and despite not being able to visit all the areas of the state, he submitted Geology of Kansas by the November 30, 1864 deadline, the first book on the geology of Kansas. The document covered stratigraphy but primarily focused on exploitable economic resources, particularly coal and salt. Mudge resigned at the end of his term, but the position was renewed and Swallow was appointed to head the 1865 survey with a larger budget and staff, and completed a more extensive survey. Due to funding problems, both the 1864 and 1865 reports were not published until 1866. After the two surveys, the Kansas <b>Geologic</b> <b>Survey</b> went into abeyance until 1895, when it was permanently established at the University of Kansas.|$|E
