40|$|One of the {{problems}} faced by manufacturers is the difficulty in constructing a robust and reliable, angled <b>applicator</b> <b>tip.</b> This can be overcome by handmaking your own retrograde carrier. The <b>applicator</b> <b>tip</b> may be bent to about 50 degrees and, if a kink occurs while bending the tip, it can be replaced easily by a new modified needle. Because the wire used is flexible, it can adapt to the bend without a problem. Narrower carriers can also be made using a 20 -G needle, perhaps more suitable for retrograde fillings of molar apices. Because the carrier {{is designed to be}} used once only, {{the problems}} of it being difficult to load and liable to blockages should not arise.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{tracking}} (EMT) is {{a promising}} technology for automated catheter and applicator reconstruc- 10 tions in brachytherapy. In this work, a proof-of-concept is presented for {{reconstruction of the}} individual channels of a shielded tandem applicator dedicated to intensity modulated brachytherapy. All six channels of a straight prototype was reconstructed and the distance between two opposite channels was measured. A study was also conducted {{on the influence of}} the shield on the data fluctuation of the EMT system. The differences with the CAD specified dimensions are under 2 mm. The pair of channels which has one of it more distant from the generator have 15 higher inter-channel distance with higher variability. In the first 110 cm reconstruction, all inter-channel distances are within the geometrical tolerances. According to a paired Student t-test, the data given by the EM system with and without the shield <b>applicator</b> <b>tip</b> are not significantly different.

40|$|Temperature {{distribution}} T(x,y,z,t) in tissue undergoing Laser-induced Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT) plays {{a crucial}} role on treatment outcome. Theoretical and experimental assessment of temperature on ex vivo laser-irradiated pancreas is presented. The aim of this work is to assess the influence of thermometers dimensions on temperature measures during LITT. T(x,y,z,t) inside tissue is monitored by optical sensors, i. e., Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) : three FBGs with lengths of 10 mm and nine FBGs of 1 mm, at different distances (2 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm) and different quotes (0 mm, 2 mm and 4 mm) from the laser fiber tip are used. Theoretical punctual T(x,y,z,t) is averaged out on both 10 mm and 1 mm in order to compare numerical predictions with experimental data. Results demonstrate the influence of FBG length on T(x,y,z,t) measures. This phenomenon depends on the distance between sensor and applicator: it is particularly significant close to the <b>applicator</b> <b>tip</b> (2 mm) because of the high spatial T(x,y,z,t) gradient within the tissue. Both theoretical results and experimental ones show that just at a distance of 10 mm from the tip, differences between T(x,y,z,t) provided by FBGs of 10 mm and 1 mm are negligible...|$|R

We investigated daily {{needle applicator}} displacement during multifractionated high-dose-rate intersti-tial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for postoperative recurrent uterine cancer. Eight patients with postopera-tive recurrent uterine cancer received HDR-ISBT {{with or without}} external beam radiotherapy using our unique ambulatory technique. To analyze displacement, we obtained daily computed tomography (CT) images for 122 flexible needle applicators at 21, 45, 69, and 93 hours after implantation. Displacement {{was defined as the}} length between the center of gravity of titanium markers and the needle <b>applicator</b> <b>tips</b> along the daily CT axis. For cases in which displacement was not corrected, we also calculated the dose that covered 90 % of the clinical target volume (D 90 (CTV)) using a dose–volume histogram (DVH). Median caudal needle applicator displacement at 21, 45, 69, and 93 hours was 3, 2, 4, and 5 mm, respec-tively. More than 15 mm displacement was observed for 2 % (2 of 122) and 17 % (10 of 60) of needle applicators at 21 and 93 hours, respectively. Cases in which dwell positions were not changed to correct the treatment plan, 2 of 8 patients showed more than 10 % reduction in D 90 (CTV) values compared with the initial treatment plan.

40|$|The {{interstitial}} thermotherapy {{succeeded in}} getting established as a minimally invasive method for the destruction and volume reduction of tissue, with laser light or monopolar radiofrequency current being predominantly applied. Since there are scarcely suitable applicator systems available for bipolar HF application, which is generally extremely safe and, at the same time, easy to handle, the design and effect of such systems was investigated and prototypes developed and tested. First investigations were carried out for a standard-configuration applicator with two successively arranged cylindrically shaped electrodes regarding the influence of diameter, length and distance between the electrodes {{as well as the}} applied power on the shape and size of the lesions to be generated. Varying these parameters, ellipsoid coagulations can be generated extending from spherical ones to such of a length-to-diameter ratio of 2. 6. With a 3 mm applicator, which has an active length of 45 mm, a volume of 14. 8 cm 3 was achieved, while the volume achieved with a cooled applicator was 26. 7 cm 3 (liver, in vitro, not perfused, exposure time 10 min). To generate cylindrically shaped lesions of extended length, both a helically shaped arrangement of the two electrodes and straight strips were investigated. Both were suitable for uniformly generating cylindrical coagulations, the length of which corresponded to that of the applicator. Referring to the generation of large lesion volumes, comparisons were made between rinsing of the <b>applicator</b> <b>tip,</b> internal cooling of the electrodes, clocking of the energy supply and a control based on temperature and impedance. Contrary to cooling, rinsing causes undefined lesion shapes and is hardly suitable for thermal therapy, while cooling permits the volumes to be enlarged by 80 %. The other three measures, too, do not permit any essential lesion enlargement. An electrolytically generated titanium oxide layer was found to be a solution to the constructional implementation of thin insulations. In addition suitable adhesives for the <b>applicator</b> <b>tip</b> joints were successfully investigated. An MRT compatible applicator set-up was developed and successfully tested. Finally, based on the experience gained, applicators were set up and evaluated for three exemplary applications, namely the treatment of turbinate hyperplasia, benign prostatic hyperplasia and liver metastases. The prototype for the conchal cautery proved to be as efficient as monopolar HF or laser applicators and was, moreover, characterised by a better controlled depth effect and a lack of tissue carbonisation. In an ex-vivo trial the applicator for the benign prostatic hyperplasia turned out to be equal to established laser systems in terms of efficiency and manoeuvrability. Investigations of the third prototype using differently perfused porcine liver proved the practicability of application, too. In this case, the coagulation volume achievable could be enlarged by 4. 3 and 5. 8 times, respectively by temporary microembolisation or a pringles manoeuvre. In summary, it has been possible to demonstrate that bipolar alternating current is basically suitable for interstitial thermotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the precise influence of different intrahepatic vessels, vessel sizes, and distances from the applicator on volume and shape of hepatic laser ablation zones in an in vivo porcine model. Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Eighteen computed tomography-guided Nd:YAG laser ablations were performed in the livers of 10 pigs at varying distances from hepatic veins and portal fields. After hepatectomy the livers were cut into 2 -mm slices perpendicular to the laser applicator axes. For each ablation zone the maximum achievable (ideal) volume, the segmented (real) volume, the maximum radius, and the radius at the position of adjacent hepatic vessels were determined. The shapes of the ablation zones were evaluated qualitatively. Comparative statistics using the unpaired t test and a multiple linear regression analysis were performed. Results: Ideal and real ablation zone volumes differed by 27. 3 % (8. 6 ± 1. 5 mL vs. 6. 4 ± 1. 1 mL; P 0. 05). When influencing, all hepatic veins showed a focal indentation whereas portal fields always showed broad flattening of the ablation zone. Conclusions: Portal fields lead to more heat sink than hepatic veins. The effects decreased with the distance between vessel and <b>applicator</b> <b>tip,</b> but less so for portal fields. The 2 vessel types induced considerably different shape alterations of the ablation zones. These results were not dependent on vessel size.

Materials and Methods: Flat buccal dentinal surfaces were obtained on 60 extracted human primary molars. The specimens were divided into 3 equal groups (n = 20). Self-etch adhesive was applied on the dentinal surface of group I with cotton pellet, group II with microapplicator tip, and group III using 3 M brush. The groups were further divided into 2 subgroups-single coat of dentin-bonding agent (DBA) in subgroups A and triple coat (with no curing in between coats) in subgroups B. The composite {{was placed on the}} dentinal surface using split nylon cylinder and cured. SBS was tested for all specimens with Instron Universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student&#x 2032;s t test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the main study groups, that is, {{no significant difference in the}} SBS with the use of different <b>applicator</b> <b>tips.</b> However, the use of triple coat of self-etch DBA exhibited highly significant difference in the SBS as compared with single coat. Conclusion: This study revealed that one-step self-etch adhesive could prove attractive in pediatric dentistry because of its lesser technique-sensitivity; however, increasing the number of coats of DBA (with no curing in between the layers) enhanced the bond strength to dentin owing to the improved resin infiltration...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Brachytherapy {{is a type}} of {{radiotherapy}} {{in which}} radioactive sources are used in proximity of tumors normally for treatment of malignancies in the head, prostate and cervix. Materials and Methods: The Cs- 137 Selectron source is a low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy source used in a remote afterloading system for treatment of different cancers. This system uses active and inactive spherical sources of 2. 5 mm diameter, which can be used in different configurations inside the applicator to obtain different dose distributions. In this study, first the dose distribution at different distances from the source was obtained around a single pellet inside the applicator in a water phantom using the MCNP 4 C Monte Carlo code. The simulations were then repeated for six active pellets in the applicator and for six point sources.   Results: The anisotropy of dose distribution due to the presence of the applicator was obtained by division of dose at each distance and angle to the dose at the same distance and angle of 90 degrees. According to the results, the doses decreased towards the <b>applicator</b> <b>tips.</b> For example, for points at the distances of 5 and 7 cm from the source and angle of 165 degrees, such discrepancies reached 5. 8 % and 5. 1 %, respectively.   By increasing the number of pellets to six, these values reached 30 % for the angle of 5 degrees. Discussion and Conclusion: The results indicate that the presence of the applicator causes a significant dose decrease at the <b>tip</b> of the <b>applicator</b> compared with the dose in the transverse plane. However, the treatment planning systems consider an isotropic dose distribution around the source and this causes significant errors in treatment planning, which are not negligible, especially for a large number of sources inside the applicator...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} {{assess the}} incidence {{and magnitude of}} air pockets around vaginal cylinders {{and its impact on}} dose distribution in vaginal cuff image-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Material and methods: Fifty endometrial carcinoma patients treated by postoperative HDR vaginal cuff brachyther-apy were included in the study. The average age of patients was 58. 3 ± 11. 8 years (range: 31 - 87 years). Brachytherapy was performed using cylindrical applicators, and the dose prescribed to 0. 5 cm from the applicator’s surface, over a length of 5 cm from the <b>applicator’s</b> <b>tip.</b> Computed tomography (CT) simulation was used for each brachytherapy fraction. The incidence, vaginal mucosa displacement, volume, and dosimetric effect of air pockets around the vaginal cylinder were evaluated. Results: A total of 78 air pockets were found in 29 / 50 patients (58 %) and 45 / 135 (33 %) brachytherapy plans. They were located at the apex: 16 / 78 (20 %) and lateral to the applicator: 62 / 78 (80 %). The volume of air pockets ranged be-tween 0. 01 and 2. 1 cm 3 (mean: 0. 15 cm 3 ± 0. 36 cm 3), and the maximum displacement of vaginal mucosa from cylinder surface was between 0. 1 and 1. 09 cm (mean: 0. 34 cm ± 0. 2 cm). The dose reduction to the vaginal mucosa generated by the air pockets ranged from 0. 5 to 66 % (mean: 26. 4 % ± 13. 9 %). Conclusions: The presence of air pockets around vaginal cylinder applicators is frequently noticed in post-operative vaginal cuff brachytherapy. The dose to the vaginal mucosa is reduced, as a result of displacement generated by air pock-ets. The effect on the clinical outcome of this dose reduction is yet to be determined...|$|R

It provides guidance {{on how to make}} a satisfactory conventional Pap smear or a liquid-based cytology (LBC) sample. Practitioners taking samples for cytology should first explain to the woman the purpose, the procedure and how the result will be communicated. Three sampling methods are considered as acceptable for preparing conventional Pap smears: (i) the cervical broom; (ii) the combination of a spatula and an endocervical brush; and (iii) the extended tip spatula. Smear takers should take care to sample the entire circumference of the transformation zone, to quickly spread the cellular material over a glass slide, and to fix the preparation within a few seconds to avoid drying artefacts. According to local guidelines, one of these three methods may be preferred. Sampling with a cotton <b>tip</b> <b>applicator</b> is inappropriate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of {{combined}} laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) and hepatic blood flow manipulation (DSM) on tumor response and intrahepatic temperature distribution in rats with liver tumors. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Laser-induced thermotherapy is a promising in situ ablation technique for malignant liver tumors. However, clinical use is still limited, {{mainly because of the}} small size of the inducible coagulation necroses. This results in insufficient tumor destruction. METHODS: Colon carcinoma CC 531 was implanted in 60 WAG rat livers. Fourteen days later treatment was performed. Tumors were exposed to 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser light at 2 watts for 10 minutes from a diffuser <b>tip</b> <b>applicator</b> placed in the tumor. The animals were randomized into two control (group I: sham-operated, group II DSM only) and five test groups. Group II received DSM alone, group III received LITT alone, group IV received DSM + LITT, group V received LITT and pringle maneuver, group VI received LITT and arterial occlusion and group VII received LITT and venous occlusion. Tumor control was examined 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: A complete tumor remission was achieved in all rats treated with LITT + DSM (group IV). In contrast, tumor progression was seen in animals treated with LITT alone (group III) or DSM alone (group II), {{as well as in the}} sham-operated controls (group I).

40|$|Background: Nosocomial infections {{acquired}} during hospitalization {{depend on}} the characteristics of the microorganisms, with a high risk of these being acquired when the environment is contaminated. Cross-transmission of microorganisms by contaminated surfaces and the hands of health care workers are considered to be the main route of the spread of nosocomial infections and in many Mexican hospitals, information about microbial and fungi contaminants on indoor surfaces is insufficient. Objectives: In this study, we explore the bacterial and fungal genera present on surfaces taken from; armrest beds, wash sinks, medical tables, and the hands of medical staff from emergency, intensive care unit, inhalation therapy, stomatology and pediatric areas. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in a hospital located in Xalapa City in Mexico; the samples were taken during a 6 month period from August to December, 2010. Surface swab specimens were collected from predefined surfaces with cotton <b>tipped</b> <b>applicators,</b> pre-moistened with sterile saline and inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose or selective Eosin-Methylene Blue agar plates and incubated for 1 to 7 days at 28 °C or 37 °C in three triplications in order to isolate bacterial and fungal contaminants. Results: We isolated and identified gram-negative bacteria and fungi and the results showed that the predominant bacteria were; Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas spp. and E coli spp. The predominant genera of fungi were; Cladosporium spp. Microsporum canis., Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. Conclusions: This study showed that all areas of the hospital have pathogenic fungi and bacteria, indicating that these are a potential source of cross-infection from the hands of health care workers to their patients [...] Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:Identification of bacterial and fungal contamination in indoor surfaces would be the key elements in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} aseptic techniques that can be applied and contribute to better preventive measures against infectious diseases caused by nosocomial pathogens.
