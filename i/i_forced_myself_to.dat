I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> play the guitar. I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E

"After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{take a long}} tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell {{into a kind of}} somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

"The young lady," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> assume {{an air of}} pleasantry, which, I believe, became me {{extremely}} ill, [...] "would {{perhaps have}} been inclined {{to look a little}} lower on the family-tree, for the branch to which she was desirous of clinging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think she}} has done badly for herself, so far,” <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> say. “I suppose you know that she began life by herding the village goats.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{different}} then," [...] he explained. [...] "I was scared--badly scared--but I felt I {{could do the}} thing if <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> it. Now I'm almost certain that I can't." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, now, Aunt Roxy," [...] said Mara, [...] "at any rate, it's {{a relief}} to speak out to some one. It's {{more than two months}} that I have felt every day more and more that there was no hope,--life has hung on me like a weight. I have had <b>to</b> make <b>myself</b> keep up, and make myself do everything, and no one knows how it has tried me. I am so tired all the time, I could cry; and yet when I go to bed nights I can't sleep, I lie in such a hot, restless way; and then before morning I am drenched with cold sweat, and feel so weak and wretched. <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> eat, and <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> talk and laugh, and it's all pretense; and it wears me out,--it would be better if I stopped trying,--it would be better to give up and act as weak as I feel; but how can I let them know?" ...|$|R
60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> back <b>to</b> my own affair.|$|R

60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{take part}} in conversation, {{speaking}} {{of this or that}} trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth.|$|E

60|$|So far <b>I</b> had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{listen to}} him. At those last words {{the picture of}} the future that he was placing before me became too hideous to be endured. I refused to hear more.|$|R
6000|$|... (Village of Treen, October 22nd.)--The {{events of}} this one day have changed the whole future of my life. <b>I</b> must <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> write of them at once.

60|$|It {{was hard}} to give up {{pursuing}} the inquiry to that final point, but <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> abandon all idea of continuing it.

The light was within a foot of his eyes. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} the end of the battle. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> endure it as long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so I made frank {{confession}} to that effect, and we retired.

60|$|Andr.

40|$|Mrs MJ is a 56 -year-old {{architect}} with {{a husband}} and two children. You performed a mastectomy and axillary dissection on her after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer 2 years ago. Unfortu-nately, she developed widespread disease with metastases to liver, lung, and bone. After several more rounds of chemotherapy, she is currently on antiestrogen therapy. Her disease appears stable. You have continued to follow her and she comes to see you for her routine visit. You notice that she is much thinner than you remember, but otherwise looks well. You ask her about her weight loss. She says: “I don’t really know what it is!

6000|$|I {{had really}} not {{supposed}} {{it possible that}} she could be more unendurable than ever. When she mentioned her Christian name, she succeeded nevertheless in producing that result. In the whole list of women's names, is there any one to be found so absolutely sickening as [...] "Selina"? <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> pronounce it; I made another neatly-expressed apology; I said English servants were so very peculiar. Selina was more than satisfied; she was quite delighted.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned in}} an instant, and tore the {{hair back from}} her face. For a moment, <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> look at her; for a moment, I confronted the {{smouldering}} fever in her cheeks; {{the glare of the}} bloodshot eyes; the distortion of the parched lips; the hideous clutching of the outstretched fingers at the empty air--but the agony of that sight was more than I could endure: I turned away my head, and hid my face in horror.|$|E
60|$|I {{spent the}} night at the hotel, and after breakfast I very reluctantly went to call upon the Willoughbys. <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> do this, for, {{considering}} the cordiality they had shown me, it would have required more incivility than I possessed to pass through the town without paying my respects. But to my great joy none of the ladies was at home. I hastened from the house with a buoyant step, and was soon speeding away, and away, and away.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you're wrong, sir!" [...] {{said the}} boy with a smile; [...] "I may not be elated over my fatal disease, but neither am <b>I</b> despondent. <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> keep going when I wonder how the miserable machine {{responds}} to my urging, and I shall keep it going, after a fashion, until the final breakdown. Fate weaves the thread of our lives, I truly believe, and she didn't use very good material when she started mine. But that doesn't matter," [...] he added quickly. [...] "I'm {{trying to do a}} little good as I go along and not waste my opportunities. I'm obeying my doctor's orders and facing the future with all the philosophy I can summon. So now, if you--who have given me a new lease of life--think I can use it to any better advantage, I am willing to follow your counsel." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all, Margaret. Whether you {{are with}} me or not, I shall have to leave Tripataly when Tippoo advances, and your {{presence}} will {{not in any way}} affect my plans. My wife and sons must travel with me, and one woman and boy, more or less, will make no difference. At present, this scheme of yours seems to me to border on madness. But we need not discuss that now. I shall, at any rate, be very glad to have you both with me. The English side of me has been altogether in the background, since you went away; and though I keep up many of the customs our mother introduced, I have almost forgotten the tongue, though <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> speak it, sometimes, with my boys, as I am sure that, in the long run, the English will become the sole masters of southern India, {{and it will be a}} great advantage to them to speak the language.|$|R
60|$|I {{hardly knew}} what to do. I first caressed the soft velvet on his cuff, and then. I stroked the hand it surrounded. It was his foresight, his goodness, his silent, strong, {{effective}} goodness, that overpowered me by their proved reality. It was the assurance of his sleepless interest which broke on me like a light from heaven; it was his--I will dare to say it--his fond, tender look, which now shook me indescribably. In {{the midst of all}} <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> look at the practical.|$|E
60|$|I reflected. Of {{course it}} ought to appear tolerable, I argued inwardly; but somehow, by some strange fatality, it would not. To live here, in this close room, the watcher of suffering--sometimes, perhaps, the butt of temper--through all that was to come of my youth; while all that was gone had passed, to say the least, not blissfully! My heart sunk one moment, then it revived; for though <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> realise evils, I think I was too prosaic to idealise, and {{consequently}} to exaggerate them.|$|E
60|$|Another {{five days}} went by--to {{me they were}} days of most unspeakable doubt and anguish. Each morning at breakfast I waited for the coming of Jane with an anxiety which {{was all the more}} dreadful because <b>I</b> <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> conceal it. There had been no further {{conversation}} between us about the matter that haunted both our minds, and so fearful was I lest she should divine my suspense that except in the most casual way I did not even dare to look at her as she entered the room.|$|E
30|$|The {{hiring and}} tenure {{decision}} {{is extremely important}} for me and I {{take a lot of}} time for it. First, I read CV’s, I contact other schools they worked in or did their internship, … […] After this screening, I interview some candidates profoundly. I ask them a whole set of questions and ask them to solve some problems which already occurred within our school to see whether he/she would be able to attain what we stand for in our school.[…] After they are hired, we follow a strict evaluation policy. After the first weeks I have a conversation with them. <b>I</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> visit new teachers twice a year and to discuss their performances afterwards. Based on this information, but also on informal contacts, I’m able to evaluate teachers’ quality and teachers’ fit with our school vision after one year. They need to fit, otherwise I will discontinue the contract. It’s hard, I know, but I have a big responsibility. I need to ensure my pupils get good education.|$|R
