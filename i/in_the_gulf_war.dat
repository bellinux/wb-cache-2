5|$|Walker {{attained}} general officer {{status with}} promotion to acting major general in 1991 and took command of North East District and 2nd Infantry Division. Having served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War,</b> {{he was promoted}} to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) later in 1991. He was granted the substantive rank of major general on 2 December 1991, with seniority from 14 February 1991, going on to serve as General Officer Commanding of the Eastern District and then as Assistant Chief of the General Staff from 11 December 1992 to 3 October 1994.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting {{that it could have been}} the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have been exposed to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to have been exposed to these agents.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage {{of time spent in}} critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I Corps {{also contributed to}} the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps. For several months, I Corps was the nation's worldwide contingency corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
