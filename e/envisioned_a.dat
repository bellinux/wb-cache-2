5|$|The card-based {{gameplay}} of Chain of Memories {{would later}} serve to inspire the gameplay of Jupiter's next game, The World Ends with You; originally, the team <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> similar card game-based system {{taking place on}} the lower screen of the Nintendo DS, but eventually this morphed to a battle system taking place on both screens, with a card game controlled on the upper screen.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E

Although many questioned the Port Authority's entry into the real estate market, Tobin saw the project {{as a way to}} enhance the agency's power and prestige, and agreed to the project. The Port Authority was the overseer of the World Trade Center, hiring the architect Minoru Yamasaki and engineer Leslie Robertson.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce had <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> young Jodie Foster. The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley. Peirce {{ultimately}} decided to cast Chloë Sevigny based on her performance in The Last Days of Disco (1998). Sevigny had auditioned for {{the role of}} Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because she could not picture Sevigny as a man.|$|E

5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E
5|$|Manila, {{being the}} seat of {{political}} power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started {{during the early years}} of American colonization when they <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington, D.C. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. Quezon.|$|E
5|$|The Broadway {{business}} district on Capitol Hill was developed between 1900 and 1930, along new city streetcar lines connecting Downtown Seattle to the University District. Urban planner Virgil Bogue's rejected 1911 comprehensive plan for Seattle <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> citywide subway system, including an underground loop on Capitol Hill and Broadway that would connect with an east–west line on Pike Street. The Forward Thrust Committee's planned regional rapid transit system, rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included a {{station at the}} intersection of Broadway, Union Street, and Madison Street, as well as additional stations in eastern Capitol Hill.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{proposed}} by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> crossover between the Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei series. Although initially reluctant {{due to their}} workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, {{and much of the}} early work went into deciding what genre of game {{it was going to be}} and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company Avex Group.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the British visit, the 1905 autumn {{maneuvers}} were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During October, Kaiser Wilhelm II conducted individual training and, in November, joined the rest of the I Squadron for a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
5|$|As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became {{longer and}} more expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out {{as one of the}} most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, New York state {{planners}} <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> {{system of}} arterial roads in Utica {{that would include}} connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81. Due to community opposition, only parts of the highway project were completed, including the North–South Arterial Highway running west of the city. Six New York State highways, one three-digit interstate highway, and one two-digit interstate highway pass through Utica. New York State Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus of each is in the city. New York State Route 5 and its alternate routes—State Route 5S and State Route 5A—are east–west roads and expressways that pass through Utica. The western terminus of Route 5S and the eastern terminus of Route 5A are both in the city. With Route 5 and Interstate 790 (an auxiliary highway of Interstate 90), New York State Route 12 and State Route 8 form the North–South Arterial Highway.|$|E

5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about {{the life and death of}} actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Oswald Lutz and {{his chief of}} staff, Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian. Guderian became the more {{influential}} of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps (panzerkorps) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also <b>envisioned</b> <b>a</b> fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, {{which was to be}} armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, armed with a 150-millimeter (5.9in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 2003, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle {{signed an}} {{agreement}} in principle {{to develop a plan}} for light rail expansion to the airport.

The two agencies also agreed to work together on planning and engineering for the project, which would be built in conjunction with a realignment of the Airport Expressway. The plan was finalized in December 2004, with an agreement to accelerate planning and construction in time for a December 2009 opening, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
