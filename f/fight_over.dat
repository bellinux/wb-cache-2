5|$|Ancient Greek art, {{as found}} in pottery and other remains, {{frequently}} depicts scenes associated with Troilus' death: the ambush, the pursuit, the murder itself and the <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> his body. Depictions of Troilus in other contexts are unusual. One such exception, a red-figure vase painting from Apulia c.340BC, shows Troilus as a child with Priam.|$|E

5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power {{to go to}} their heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E
5|$|Samsung Galaxy then won {{the fourth}} game, also {{after winning a}} key <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> Baron. Despite losing two {{inhibitor}} buildings in their base, SKT was able to stall SSG with defensive play until the 42-minute mark, after which SSG took three Dragons – another in game objective – uncontested and gained buffs {{that allowed them to}} win the game. In the final game, SK Telecom played a more cautious gameplay style, which was effective against Samsung Galaxy's riskier play. SKT was able to grab two Baron kills and two Elder Dragon kills en route to winning the final game.|$|E

5|$|Six {{men were}} {{candidates}} for the Greenback nomination. James B. Weaver, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, Benjamin F. Butler from Massachusetts and Hendrick B. Wright from Pennsylvania, also commanded considerable followings. Weaver triumphed quickly, winning {{a majority of the}} 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot. Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran, was likewise nominated for vice president on the initial vote. More tumultuous was the <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over women's suffrage, Chinese immigration, {{and the extent to which}} the government should regulate working conditions.|$|E

Slide and Fitzhugh <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> Slide's gun; the gun goes off and the bullet hits the car, revealing gold underneath the Ferrari's paint. They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight. Josh then finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's glove box.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) invites his old college a cappella group, Here Comes Treble, to perform for the office during Halloween. Andy, however, gets angry when he hears that his college friend Broccoli Rob (Colbert) is telling a different story about the group. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), {{with the help of}} Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tries to track down a person who is using prescription anxiety pills.

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah crashing to the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the <b>fight</b> <b>over,</b> resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} first two games, Samsung Galaxy won a long third game against SK Telecom. SKT {{dominated}} {{the early stages of}} the game and built up a lead in both kills and gold. The turning point in this game was a <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> Baron, an important in-game objective, where Samsung Galaxy was able to kill half of SK Telecom's team and destroy two of their turrets afterwards. After winning a similar engagement over Baron later in the game, Samsung Galaxy was then able to quickly destroy five of SKT's defensive towers and win the game. This third game was the second-longest in competitive League of Legends history, at 71 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Bowie studied art, {{music and}} design, {{including}} layout and typesetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, {{introduced him to}} modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother {{to give him a}} Grafton saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician. Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil, which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour. Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.|$|E
5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to <b>fight</b> <b>over</b> Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E
