Although it can represent any <b>fixed-to-fixed</b> code and has optimization methods that guarantee local optimality, its encoding and optimization require the computation that grows exponential to the data length. We propose an optimization method for a product coding, which avoids this computational explosion problem by applying a reasonable restriction to the model architecture. The performance of the product coding is evaluated by a simple problem. Key-Words:- lossy source code, product code, companding function, optimization...|$|E

40|$|A new {{coding scheme}} for image {{transmission}} over noisy channel is proposed. Similar to standard image compression, the scheme includes a linear transform followed by successive refinement scalar quantization. Unlike conventional schemes, {{in the proposed}} system the quantized transform coefficients are linearly mapped into channel symbols using systematic linear encoders. This <b>fixed-to-fixed</b> length "linear index coding" approach avoids {{the use of an}} explicit entropy coding stage (e. g., arithmetic or Huffman coding), which is typically fragile to channel post-decoding residual errors. We use linear codes over GF(4), which are particularly suited for this application, since they are matched to the dead-zone quantizer symbol alphabet and to the QPSK modulation used on the deep-space communication channel. We optimize the proposed system where the linear codes are systematic Raptor codes over GF(4). The rateless property of Raptor encoders allows to achieve a "continuum" of coding rates, in order to accurately match the channel coding rate to the transmission channel capacity and to the quantized source entropy rate for each transform subband and refinement level. Comparisons are provided with respect to the concatenation of state-of-the-art image coding and channel coding schemes used by Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Mission.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{provides}} an extensive {{study of the}} behav-ior of the best achievable rate (and other related fundamental limits) in variable-length strictly lossless compression. In the non-asymptotic regime, the fundamental limits of fixed-to-variable lossless compression with and without prefix constraints are shown to be tightly coupled. Several precise, quantitative bounds are derived, connecting {{the distribution of the}} optimal code lengths to the source information spectrum, and an exact analysis of the best achievable rate for arbitrary sources is given. Fine asymptotic results are proved for arbitrary (not necessarily prefix) compressors on general mixing sources. Nonasymptotic, explicit Gaussian approximation bounds are established for the best achievable rate on Markov sources. The source dispersion and the source varentropy rate are defined and characterized. Together with the entropy rate, the varentropy rate serves to tightly approximate the fundamental nonasymptotic limits of fixed-to-variable compression for all but very small block lengths.

40|$|Doktorgradsavhandling i informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologi, Universitetet i Agder, Grimstad, 2014 The {{demanding}} mobility {{features of}} communication technologies {{call for the}} need to advance channel models (among other needs), in which non-stationary aspects of the channel are carefully taken into consideration. Owing to the mathematical complexity imposed by mobility features of the mobile station (MS), the number of non-stationary channel models proposed in the literature is very limited. The absence of a robust trajectory model for capturing the mobility features of the MS also adds to the depth of this gap. Not only statistically non-stationary channels, but also physically non-stationary channels, such as vehicle-to-vehicle channels {{in the presence of}} moving scatterers, have been rarely investigated. In the literature, there exist two fundamental channel modelling approaches, namely deterministic and stochastic approaches. Deterministic approaches, such as measurement-based channel modelling, are known to be accurate, but site-specific and economically expensive. The stochastic approaches, such as geometry-based channel modelling, are known to be economically inexpensive, computationally fair, but not as accurate as the deterministic approach. Among these approaches, the geometry-based stochastic approach is the best to capture the non-stationary aspects of the channel. In this dissertation, we employ the geometry-based stochastic approach for the development of three types of channel models, namely stationary, physically nonstationary, and statistically non-stationary channel models. We geometrically track the plane waves emitted from the transmitter over the local scatterers up to the receiver, which is assumed to be in motion. Under the assumptions that the scatterers are fixed and the observation time is short enough, we develop the stationary channel models. In this regard, we propose a unified disk scattering model (UDSM), which unifies several well-established geometry-based channel models into one robust channel model. We show that the UDSM is highly flexible and outperforms several other geometric models in the sense of matching empirical data. In addition, we provide a new approach to develop stationary channel models based on delay-angle joint distribution functions. Under the assumption that the scatterers are in motion and the observation time is again short enough, we develop a physically non-stationary channel model. In this connection, we model vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) channels in the presence of moving scatterers. Proper distributions for explaining the speed of relatively fast and relatively slow moving scatterers are provided. The statistical properties of the proposed channel model are also derived and validated by measured channels. It is shown that relatively fast moving scatterers {{have a major impact on}} both V 2 V and <b>fixed-to-fixed</b> (F 2 F) communication links, as they are significant sources of the Doppler spread. However, relatively slow moving scatterers can be neglected in V 2 V channels, but not in F 2 F channels. Under the assumption that the scatterers are fixed and the observation time is not necessarily short anymore, we develop the statistically non-stationary channel models. To this aim, we first introduce a new approach for generating fully spatial random trajectories, which are supposed to capture the mobility features of the MS. By means of this approach, we develop a highly flexible trajectory model based on the primitives of Brownian fields (BFs). We show that the flexibility of the proposed trajectory is threefold: 1) its numerous configurations; 2) its smoothness control mechanism; and 3) its adaptivity to different speed scenarios. The statistical properties of the trajectory model are also derived and validated by data collected from empirical studies. We then introduce a new approach to develop stochastic non-stationary channel models, the randomness of which originates from a random trajectory of the MS, rather than from the scattering area. Based on the new approach, we develop and analyze a non-stationary channel model using the aforementioned Brownian random trajectory model. We show that the channel models developed by this approach are very robust with respect to the number of scatterers, such that highly reported statistical properties can be obtained even if the propagation area is sparsely seeded with scatterers. We also show that the proposed non-stationary channel model superimposes large-scale fading and small-scale fading. Moreover, we show that the proposed model captures the path loss effect. More traditionally, we develop and analyze two non-stationary channel models, the randomness of which originates from the position of scatterers, but not from the trajectory of the MS. Nevertheless, the travelling path of the MS is still determined by a sample function of a Brownian random trajectory. It is shown that the proposed channel models result in a twisted version of the Jakes power spectral density (PSD) that varies in time. Accordingly, it is demonstrated that non-stationarity in time is not in line with the common isotropic propagation assumption on the channel...|$|E
