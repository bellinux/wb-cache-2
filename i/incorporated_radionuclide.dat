50|$|In {{the case}} of {{internal}} exposure, the dose is not received {{at the moment of}} exposure, as happens with external exposure, since the <b>incorporated</b> <b>radionuclide</b> irradiates the various organs and tissues during the time it is present in the body. By definition, the committed dose equivalent corresponds to the received dose integrated over 50 years from the date of intake. In order to calculate it, one has to know the intake activity and the value of the committed dose equivalent per unit of intake activity. The uncertainties of the first parameter are such that the committed dose equivalent can only be regarded as an order of magnitude and not as a very accurate quantity. The use of it is justified, however, for, like the dose equivalent for external exposure, it expresses the risk of stochastic effects for the individual concerned since these effects, should they appear, would do so only after a latent period which is generally longer than the dose integration time. Moreover, the use of the committed dose equivalent offers certain advantages for dosimetric management, especially when it is simplified. A practical problem which may arise is that the annual dose limit is apparently exceeded by virtue of the fact that one is taking account, in the first year, of doses which will actually be received only in the following years. These problems are rare enough in practice to be dealt with individually in each case.|$|E

Since DOTA compounds are easy to label with β- or α-particle emitters like 177 Lu, 213 Bi or 225 Ac, the tracers discussed in this paper seemed to be excellently suitable for bone targeted radionuclide therapy. Therefore, we investigated the biodistribution of the best performed compound with its 177 Lu analogous. [177 Lu]DOTAZOL showed to have the same skeletal retention, but a faster blood clearance. The kidney uptake was found to be higher for the 177 Lu-complex (1.78 [*]±[*] 0.13 %ID/g) compared to the 68 Ga-complex (0.24 [*]±[*] 0.02 %ID/g).

Sheet silicates, particularly clays such as bentonite are common materials in near-field engineered barriers in high-level nuclear waste (HLW) repositories. This is because migration of radionuclides from an underground HLW repository to the geosphere may be significantly reduced by sorption of radionuclides (e. g., Pu, U and Np) onto sheet silicates (e. g., clays and micas) that line the fractures and pores of the rocks along groundwater flowpaths. In addition to surface sorption, it has been suggested that some sheet silicates may also be able to <b>incorporate</b> many <b>radionuclides,</b> such as Cs and Sr, in the inter-layer sites of the sheet structure.

30|$|Although various {{chelating}} agent-mediated radioisotope labeled nanoprobes {{have been}} suggested for nuclear molecular imaging and pharmacokinetics, chelating agent-mediated functionalization methods have several limitations for nanoparticles used in vivo [28]. Firstly, the functionalized radionuclides using chelating agents at the surface of nanoparticles can induce the change of intrinsic surface properties of nanoparticles, such as surface charge, polarity, and degree of hydrophobicity. Basically, the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles are strongly affected by their surface conditions [74], and therefore, chelating agent-functionalized nanoparticles may show different biodistributions or pharmacokinetic properties than compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles. Secondly, <b>radionuclides</b> <b>incorporated</b> with a chelating agent {{may be influenced by}} harsh conditions in vivo, resulting in the detachment of radionuclides during circulation or their replacement by biological substances due to protein transchelation or dehalogenation [25 – 27]. Accordingly, these instabilities of radionuclide-chelating agent complexes decrease the accuracy of pharmacokinetics and diagnosis data [75]. To avoid these disadvantages, researchers have been developing labeling strategies free of chelating agents. One of these studies, by Gibson et al., carried out direct radiolabelling using cyclotron accelerators to <b>incorporate</b> <b>radionuclides</b> into nanomaterials directly [76]. However, this direct incorporation method, which used neutron bombardment to generate high energy radiation, damaged the nanomaterials by causing them to aggregate.|$|R

HAP is biocompatible, presenting neither local nor systemic toxicity, {{and in some cases}} the organism can absorb it. At the present work, experimental models were setup to study the spatial distribution, radiological and ultrasound response of M-HAP (“M” = metallic radionuclides) macroaggregates carried by high viscosity CMC gel through interstitial implants into kidney, lung, liver, brain and muscle samples. The studied composition demonstrated high ecogenicity and easy ultrasound identification in all evaluated tissues experimental models. However, the identification of M-HAP (M=Ca) implants in X-ray anatomic image was not considered satisfactory. The Barium Sulphate addition to the gel increased considerably the radiological contrast. As conclusion, M-HAP gel presents adequate radiobiological response after brachytherapy implants. The incorporation of high atomic number (Z) radionuclides to the hydroxyapatite structure may increase the composition contrast, possibly excluding the barium sulphate after KV and mA X-ray adjustments. The M-HAP composition application through needles can be performed based on fluoroscopy or ultrasound techniques, providing adequate conditions to perform dosimetric calculations through CT, X-ray, or ultra-sound images...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{behavior of}} nuclear waste {{glass in a}} geologic repository may require a technical consideration {{of the role of}} colloids in the release and transport of radionuclides. The neglect of colloidal properties in assessing the near- and far-field migration behavior of actinides may lead to significant underestimates and poor predictions of biosphere exposure from high-level waste (HLW) disposal. Existing data on colloid-facilitated transport suggests that radionuclide migration may be enhanced, but the importance of colloids is not adequately assessed. Indeed, the occurrence of radionuclide transport, attributed to colloidal species, has been reported at Mortandad Canyon, Los Alamos and at the Nevada Test Site; both unsaturated regions are similar to the proposed HLW repository at Yucca Mountain.

For this work, photon and electron SAFs were derived with Monte Carlo simulations in the new male voxel-based reference computational phantom adopted by the ICRP and ICRU. The present results show that the assumption of electrons being locally absorbed is not always true at energies above 300 - 500 keV. For source/target organ pairs in close vicinity, high-energy electrons escaping from the source organ may result in cross-fire electron SAFs in the same order of magnitude as those from photons.

Following a short seawater exposure, cuttlefish accumulated 241 Am and 134 Cs, but only to limited extent (whole-body CF < 2). Among the cuttlefish organs, branchial hearts and their appendages displayed the highest degree of uptake for 241 Am (CF = 42 and 16, respectively), but these tissues contained low percentage of total 241 Am due to their relatively small contribution to whole organism weight. The major fraction of <b>incorporated</b> <b>radionuclides</b> was associated with muscular tissues (viz. 65 and 82 % of total 241 Am and 134 Cs, respectively).

However, assimilated 241 Am was more strongly retained in adults than in juveniles (Tb 1 / 2 = 28 vs 5 d, respectively), suggesting that different mechanisms govern 241 Am elimination at both ages. Ingested 134 Cs was assimilated to a similar extent in juveniles (29 %) and adults (23 %), but the depuration rate was 4 times faster in adults.

This work, as described in the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) Underground Test Area (UGTA) strategy (FFACO, 1996; amended 2010), forms {{an essential part of the}} technical basis for subsequent negotiation of the compliance boundary of the Frenchman Flat corrective action unit (CAU) by Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) and National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO). Underground nuclear testing via deep vertical shafts was conducted at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) from 1951 until 1992. The Frenchman Flat area, the subject of this report, was used for seven years, with 10 underground nuclear tests being conducted. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), NNSA/NSO initiated the UGTA Project to assess and evaluate the effects of underground nuclear tests on groundwater at the NTS and vicinity through the FFACO (1996, amended 2010). The processes that will be used to complete UGTA corrective actions are described in the “Corrective Action Strategy” in the FFACO Appendix VI, Revision No. 2 (February 20, 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|Not all {{the nuclear}} waste destined for Yucca Mountain {{is in the}} form of spent fuel. Some of it will be {{radioactive}} waste generated from the production of nuclear weapons. This so-called defense waste exists mainly as corrosive liquids and sludge in underground tanks. An essential task of the U. S. high-level radioactive waste program is to process these defense wastes into a solid material [...] called a waste form. An ideal waste form would be extremely durable and unreactive with other repository materials. It would be simple to fabricate remotely so that it could be safely transported to a repository for permanent storage. What's more, the material should be able to tolerate exposure to intense radiation without degradation. And to minimize waste volume, the material must be able to contain high concentrations of radionuclides. The material most likely to be used for immobilization of radioactive waste is glass. Glasses are produced by rapid cooling of high-temperature liquids such that the liquid-like non-periodic structure is preserved at lower temperatures. This rapid cooling does not allow enough time for thermodynamically stable crystalline phases (mineral species) to form. In spite of their thermodynamic instability, glasses can persist for millions of years. An alternate to glass is a ceramic waste form [...] an assemblage of mineral-like crystalline solids that <b>incorporate</b> <b>radionuclides</b> into their structures. The crystalline phases are thermodynamically stable at the temperature of their synthesis; ceramics therefore tend to be more durable than glasses. Ceramic waste forms are fabricated at temperatures below their melting points and so avoid the danger of handling molten radioactive liquid [...] a danger that exists with incorporation of waste in glasses. The waste form provides a repository's first line of defense against release of radionuclides. It, along with the canister, is the barrier in the repository over which we have the most control. When a waste form is designed, the atomic environment of the radionuclides is chosen to maximize chemical durability. Elements such as zirconium and phosphorus can be included in the waste form that react with and make some radionuclides less soluble and therefore less likely to be released. The long-term performance assessment of radionuclide containment requires the development of models for each part of the barrier system. It is almost certainly easier to model the corrosion and alteration of waste forms than it is to develop coupled hydrologic, chemical, and geophysical models of radionuclide transport away from a repository. Therefore, much time and effort has been spent optimizing the chemical durability of both glass and ceramic waste forms for radionuclide containment. This has not been an easy task. Three problems in particular posed the greatest challenges. The first is that radionuclides decay, transmuting into daughter elements that may have different chemical properties. These new elements might degrade the existing mineral by making it unstable. A good waste form that works well for uranium may work poorly for lead, its final decay product. The second problem is that the radioactive decay itself damages the solid over time. Radioactive decay is an energetic process in which ejected particles and the recoiling nucleus disrupt the surrounding atoms. A single alpha-decay event can displace thousands of atoms in the surrounding volume. We know from laboratory measurements that radionuclides are more easily released from radiation-damaged structures than from materials that do not sustain radiation damage. The third problem is that radioactive waste, particularly the high level waste from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium, contains a variety of elements with widely varying chemistry. The waste form must <b>incorporate</b> the <b>radionuclides,</b> as well as non-radioactive elements such as silicon and sodium that are present in the waste stream as a result of waste processing. A number of ceramic waste forms have been developed that minimize these problems and provide a potentially useful host for radionuclides. For ceramics, the mineralogy can be tailored to the waste stream by selecting solid mineral phases with structural sites that can accommodate the waste elements, as well as newly formed radioactive decay elements. Radiation damage can be minimized by selecting mineral phases that allow atoms to renew or regain their original crystalline structure, a process known as annealing. For example, actinide phosphate minerals anneal more readily than actinide silicate minerals. Despite the superior thermodynamic stability of crystalline materials, borosilicate glasses have become the preferred waste forms. One reason is that the processing technologies associated with this glass are believed to be easier to adapt to handling highly radioactive material...|$|R
