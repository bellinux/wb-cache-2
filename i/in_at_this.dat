5|$|A {{number of}} Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' {{practice}} specialised <b>in.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> early stage in his career, he produced designs {{in a variety}} of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences of a number of architects. Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School. He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandatory}} pit stops, {{during which}} all drivers {{need to change}} into a second car, started on lap 17. Everyone came <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point except the two NEXTEV TCR drivers Piquet and Charles Pic. D'Ambrosio managed {{to get ahead of}} Buemi into second place thanks to swift work from his crew. Piquet benefited from his late stop by moving ahead into eighth after everyone had pitted and having more power left to use {{towards the end of the}} race. Heidfeld ran into additional trouble during the second half of the race, losing two positions during the final laps to both Loïc Duval (Dragon Racing) and the fast running Piquet, who managed to finish fifth from thirteenth on the grid, even closing on Duval on the final lap. Meanwhile, di Grassi won comfortably from d'Ambrosio, the gap being more than twelve seconds.|$|E

25|$|Immediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet, {{at which}} she reveals {{that she is}} Jewish and that Haman is {{planning}} to exterminate her people, including her. Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation. The King returns <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> very moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier than before and he orders Haman hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Crete campaign, the 2/8th was rebuilt in Palestine. Reinforcements were brought <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, and a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Winning, arrived in July. After this, a period of garrison duty followed in Syria, as the 2/8th was dispatched to form part of the Allied occupation force that had been established there {{in the wake of the}} SyriaLebanon campaign to defend against a possible Axis thrust through the Caucasus. They remained there between October 1941 and January 1942 when the Australian government requested their return to fight against the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|The Lake Bafu profile {{shows the}} {{replacement}} of deciduous oak and pine with maquis species: Phillyrea, Cistus, Ericaceae; fruit trees: Olea, Castanea; and farm weeds: Plantago lanceolata and Juniperus. Carbon in the sediment suggests the forest was cleared by slash and burn. This period corresponds to the settlement of the Carians in the area, who apparently moved in from southern Anatolia. There is a semi-legendary tradition that they subdued another Pre-Hellenic people, the Leleges, but the evidence is not precise enough to say if the indigenes were all or partly Leleges. As the Carians worshipped Endymion, {{he may have been}} brought <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Only five {{banks were}} opened during this time, while seeing many black-owned banks closed, leaving these banks with an {{expected}} nine-year life span for their operations. With African-Americans continuing to migrate towards Northern urban areas, they {{were faced with}} the challenge of suffering from high unemployment rates, due to non-minorities willing to do work that African Americans would previously take part <b>in.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time the entire banking industry, in the U.S., was suffering however, these banks suffered even more due to being smaller, having higher closure rates, as well as lower rates of loan repayment. The first groups of banks invested their finances back into the Black community, where as banks established during this period invested their finances mainly in mortgage loans, fraternal societies, and U.S. government bonds.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch's {{original}} conception as a {{goal for}} his epic poem was {{to bring back the}} glorious days of ancient Rome. There was a clash however between this fame for glory at his coronation and Christian values he was trying to impart to his readers. The story of the death of Mago Barcid (Book 6) and the Dream of Scipio (Books 1 and 2) entered <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point. In the 1350s Petrarch reworked the Africa extensively to reflect this. These events ultimately established the main concepts of the poem. Petrarch was writing his third book of the Secretum, a sort of self investigation of moral values especially as it related to fame, structured as an imaginary dialogue with Saint Augustine, also in the 1350s. From this developed the Secretum's Africa, a conflict between the vanity of the glory for Rome and Christian values.|$|E
25|$|A few Hyderabads {{fell back}} to the next {{battalion}} (Lt.Col.Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles {{in front of the}} more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column stacked up, almost bumper to bumper. If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point in the battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their stacked up and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This golden opportunity for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded loop road that enabled them to by-pass the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment.|$|E

500|$|Winter {{began to}} set <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point, {{and even though}} combat {{operations}} all but ceased during this time, the battalion endured considerable hardships amid snow and rain, in a sector that {{has been described as}} [...] "the worst... of the sodden front". For a brief period during December, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Blamey commanded the battalion before taking over as acting commander of the 1st Brigade. During this time, the battalion was reorganised as part of a wider-Army restructure that resulted in an attempt to increase the firepower of the each platoon. Earlier in the year, the battalion machine-gun section had been deleted and replaced by a single Lewis gun held within each company; by end of the year this had been increased to one Lewis per platoon.|$|E
500|$|The {{evidence}} for {{the layout of the}} second mansio is also very fragmentary. It was a courtyard building constructed with posts set vertically in foundation trenches.The walls were plaster and daub and some rooms were painted in vivid colours. In the courtyard was a large well [...] and [...] deep, cut into the underlying sandstone. The second mansio was deliberately dismantled in about 140–150CE during construction of the third mansio. The well was filled <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time and contained a samian sherd dated 125–145CE. About the same time the second hilltop fort was abandoned and the town ceased to be a military site. One of the last military features at Letocetum was the [...] "punic ditch" [...] associated with this last small fort. The ditch was filled before any secondary silt formed and the filling contained a Trajanic coin dated 98–117CE and pottery suggesting a Hadrianic or early Antonine date.|$|E
500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E

500|$|In March 1974, Lennon began {{producing}} Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats album, thus {{named to}} counter the [...] "bad boy" [...] image the pair had earned in the media with two drinking incidents at The Troubadour: the first when Lennon placed a Kotex on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress at a concert given by Ann Peebles, {{who at the time}} had released one of Lennon's favorite records, 'I Can't Stand The Rain' and, two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon {{thought it would be a}} good idea for the musicians to live under one roof to ensure they would get to the studio on time, so Pang rented a beach house in Santa Monica, for her, Lennon, Nilsson, Ringo Starr and Keith Moon to live <b>in.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, Pang encouraged Lennon to reach out to family and friends. He and Paul McCartney mended fences and played together for the first and only time after the breakup of The Beatles (see A Toot and a Snore in '74). Pang also arranged for Julian Lennon to visit his father for the first time in almost four years.|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". He said in his review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people {{trying to do the right}} thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{restricted}} personnel {{access to the}} tunnel at Sudbrook Pumping Station, where an iron ladder descends in the shaft of the water pumping main; the ventilation air is pumped <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point also. The GWR original ventilation arrangement was to extract air at Sudbrook, but the exhaust gases from steam train operation led to premature corrosion of the fan mechanism. [...] When the Cornish pumping engines were replaced in the 1960s the draughting was reversed so that atmospheric air is pumped into the tunnel exhausting at the tunnel mouths.|$|E

2500|$|Lunger was {{not raised}} a car enthusiast. He {{was brought up}} to enjoy baseball, hockey, and football. He became {{interested}} in auto racing when a friend {{took him to a}} race in 1965. By 1966 he was the [...] "rich kid" [...] of the Can-Am series. Between 1972 and 1973 he faced the top competition in European Formula Two, from the likes of Emerson Fittipaldi, Ronnie Peterson, and Jean-Pierre Jarier. His best finish was a 4th place at Mantorp Park in Sweden, for Space Racing, in their March-Ford BDA 722. The machinery he was <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> juncture did not allow him to do better. On a single weekend in Rouen, France, Lunger blew three Ford BDA engines.|$|E
2500|$|Ord's troops began {{advancing}} against Gordon's corps {{while the}} Union II Corps began moving against Lieutenant General James Longstreet's corps to the northeast. The 11th Maine Infantry Regiment {{was cut off}} from the rest of Brigadier General Robert S. Foster's division and suffered significant casualties in this final fight. Colonel Charles Venable of Lee's staff rode <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time and asked Gordon for an assessment. Gordon gave him a reply he knew Lee did not want to hear: [...] "Tell General Lee I have fought my corps to a frazzle, and I fear I can do nothing unless I am heavily supported by Longstreet's corps." [...] Upon hearing it and considering the position of the armies, Lee finally stated the inevitable: [...] "Then there is nothing left for me to do but to go and see General Grant and I would rather die a thousand deaths." [...] Lee surrendered his army at 3p.m., accepting the terms Grant had proposed by letter the previous day. He was accompanied to the McLean House where the surrender occurred only by his aide Colonel Charles Marshall and their orderly, Private Joshua O. Johns.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Travers {{modified}} the high altar reredos, adding paintings of Moses and Aaron and the Ten Commandments between the existing Corinthian columns and reconstructing the upper storey. [...] Above the reredos Travers added a painted and gilded rood. [...] In {{the centre of}} the reredos there is a carved gilded pelican (an early Christian symbol of self-sacrifice) and a roundel with Baroque-style angels. [...] The glazed east window, which can be seen in an early photograph of the church, appears to have been filled <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. [...] A new altar with console tables was installed and the communion rails moved outwards to extend the size of the sanctuary. Two old door frames were used to construct side chapels and placed at an angle across the north-east and south-east corners of the church. One, the Lady Chapel, was dedicated to the Rector's parents in 1925 and the other was dedicated to Christ the King. Originally, a baroque aumbry was used for reservation of the Blessed Sacrament, but later a tabernacle was installed on the Lady Chapel altar and the aumbry was used to house a relic of the True Cross.|$|E
