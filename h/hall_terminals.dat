40|$|We report voltage noise {{measurements}} on the cryogenic quantum Hall resistance (QHR) and present two new findings {{to illustrate the}} potential of the two-channel instrumentation used. Without applied current, only Johnson–Nyquist noise is present, but at two separate pairs of quantum <b>Hall</b> <b>terminals,</b> it can be cross-correlated via a longitudinal resistance. With applied current, excess noise due to dissipation bursts appears, which increases dramatically with the noninteger fraction of the filling factor...|$|E

50|$|The second {{segment of}} the system runs from the SkyPier to Terminal 2 and then {{continues}} to the East <b>Hall</b> of <b>Terminal</b> 1. Different from the first segment, the second segment is the only means by which these three places are connected. SkyPier passengers heading for departing flights must take the westbound service of this segment to the East <b>Hall</b> of <b>Terminal</b> 1. SkyPier passengers {{are not allowed to}} alight at Terminal 2. Departure passengers from Terminal 2 can join the westbound service of the second segment from Terminal 2. All passengers must leave the train when it arrives at the East <b>Hall</b> of <b>Terminal</b> 1. Then, depending on the boarding gate location of their onward flight, passengers can choose to change to the first segment of APM system at the opposite platform of the East Hall, to continue their way to the West Hall, or simply approach the boarding gate directly from the East Hall. The eastbound service is only for arrival passengers heading to SkyPier for ferry service to PRD ports. Ferry tickets will be checked before passengers may board the APM. Once arriving at the SkyPier, passengers are not allowed to travel back to Terminal 1. Since there is no eastbound platform in Terminal 2, there is no intermediate station for the eastbound service.|$|R

40|$|The "cabins" {{fire safety}} design concept in the {{terminal}} buildings of the new Hong Kong international airport is evaluated in this paper. Retail shops in the <b>terminal</b> <b>hall</b> are taken as cabins {{in which it is}} highly possible to get a flashover fire. Correlations for the flashover time were derived using sixty simulations for cabins of different sizes employing the fire protection engineering tool FASTLite. Heat generated by the fire would be conducted out through the cabin wall or ceiling to the <b>terminal</b> <b>hall</b> and the associated heat transfer equations are reviewed. Upon flashover, the whole cabin becomes a large hot object and a thermal plume would be induced. Smoke generated in the cabin would flow out from the door left opened for human egress. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to study the smoke filling process in the <b>terminal</b> <b>hall</b> for cases with and without a cabin. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|Terminal 3 {{uses the}} Jetway system. The overall layout {{is similar to}} that of {{airports}} in Europe and North America, with multiple levels and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by escalators and moving walkways. The upper level departures hall, with an area of over , is equipped with 110 check-in counters and as well as flight information display systems. A small shopping mall, known as Buy & Bye, is open to both travellers and the general public. The mall, which includes shops, restaurants and a post office, was planned to be a draw for non-flyers too. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. The arrivals hall is located on the ground floor where there are also 20 additional check-in counters (serving Star Alliance airlines). Car rental counters are located in an intermediate level situated between the departing and arriving passenger <b>halls.</b> <b>Terminal</b> 3 has two synagogues.|$|R
