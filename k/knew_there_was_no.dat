Before he had been taken ill, Philip had decided that he only wanted peace. His health did not improve and he resultingly died the following year.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the game stems {{primarily from the}} graphic {{manner in which the}} player executes enemies. In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence. We all <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way we could explain away that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line." ...|$|E

500|$|This ample {{provision}} {{arose from}} the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended his original gift of seed money to an undertaking {{to cover the costs}} of the entire expedition. The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as [...] "about £100,000". Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt. According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: [...] "His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that he <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> prospect of financial return, and what he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton." [...] His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition. Rowett was, according to Huntford, [...] "a stodgy, prosaic looking" [...] businessman, who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in Aberdeen known as the Rowett Research Institute (now part of the University of Aberdeen). He had also endowed dental research work at the Middlesex Hospital.|$|E
500|$|On {{realizing that}} NBC was {{switching}} {{away from the}} game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, [...] "Where the hell has our football game gone?" [...] During the station break which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which {{was not part of}} NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him {{to go back to the}} game. Although Cline <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it." [...] Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.|$|E

Hirohito had to intervene personally on two occasions {{during the next few}} days to induce hardliners to abandon their conditions."

2500|$|In August 1968, French [...] Régis Debray, who was {{captured}} in Bolivia while living with Che Guevara, gave a jailhouse interview where he also drew the comparison. According to Debray, Che (an atheist) [...] "was a mystic without a transcendent belief, a saint without a God." [...] Debray went on to tell interviewer Marlene Nadle of Ramparts Magazine that [...] "Che was a modern Christ, but I think he suffered a much harder passion. The Christ of 2,000 years ago died face-to-face with his God. But Che <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> God and that after his death nothing remains." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for Waddingham, the man {{in charge}} of cremations was Dr Cyril Banks, who was also the Medical Officer for Health in Nottingham. Banks had never thought highly of Waddingham's {{establishment}} as a so-called [...] "nursing home", and <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> State Registered Nurse on the staff (as there should have been). He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation and ordered a post-mortem. The post-mortem found no traces of anything connected to Ada's physical conditions that could have immediately caused death. This led to an analysis of the organs of the deceased by Dr W. W. Taylor, Senior Assistant to the Nottingham Analyst. He found considerable traces of morphine (over three grains) in her stomach, liver, kidneys and her heart.|$|E
2500|$|On January 28, 1936, Leopold and Loeb {{were working}} on {{assignment}} at the prison school. While they were working, Day passed them and reportedly said [...] "I'll see you later" [...] (referring to Loeb). Loeb was later attacked by Day with a straight razor (shaving blade) in a shower room. He was taken directly to the prison hospital where doctors tried to save his life. Leopold {{went to the hospital}} to find his friend barely conscious and slashed all over. Leopold offered to have his blood tested for a transfusion but was denied by the doctors, who <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> hope. Loeb's last words to Leopold were [...] "I think I'm going to make it." [...] Leopold then washed his friend's body as an act of affection.|$|E

2500|$|Fifteen minutes later, {{the cruiser}} signalled, [...] "Show your secret sign". Detmers <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> chance of fooling Sydney for much longer, so ordered Kormorans {{disguise}} dropped, the German battle ensign raised, {{and for all}} weapons to commence firing. The raider's opening salvo bracketed the ship, while the next four salvoes destroyed Sydneys bridge, gun direction tower, forward turrets, and aircraft. Two torpedoes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of lighter weapons to rake Sydneys flank and interfere with attempts to man the cruiser's secondary weapons. In contrast, Sydney was only able to fire a single full salvo before her forward turrets were knocked out, shells from which punched through Kormorans exhaust funnel and wireless room, and caused shrapnel wounds to two sailors. Kormorans gunners shifted their aim to Sydneys waterline with their next three salvoes. Sydney responded from her aft turrets: one damaged the raider's machinery spaces and started a fire in an oil tank, while the other fired only a few ineffective shells. Around {{the time of the}} eighth or ninth German salvo, one of Kormorans torpedoes struck Sydney forward of [...] "A" [...] turret, ripping a hole in her side and causing her to settle by the bow. After the torpedo hit, Sydney turned hard to port in what the Germans assumed was an attempt to ram, but the cruiser passed harmlessly aft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music videos}} {{presented}} by Skinny Puppy are often graphic and disturbing in nature, featuring heavy uses of blood, gore, and violence. It {{is because of}} this nature {{that the majority of}} the group's videos have received little commercial airplay, or have been banned outright. The music video for [...] "Stairs and Flowers" [...] was banned by the Canadian Censorship Bureau because of scenes depicting [...] "an excrement-covered woman being beaten by soldiers". The woman in question was in fact a mud soaked Nivek Ogre. The letterbox effect seen in the [...] "Dig It" [...] video was accused by the Bureau and as well as MuchMusic to be portraying pornography; the letterbox actually portrayed stock market footage. Also banned was the video for [...] "Testure", an action resulting from a poll held by CityTV, and the video for the song [...] "Worlock" [...] was banned from MTV. Ogre, a self-described horror fan, defended the [...] "Worlock" [...] video by saying [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way they'd play [...] "Worlock' there [...] But I went out to make that video so no one would play it!"; Ogre has affirmed that the video was meant to draw attention to censorship in horror films. Some of Skinny Puppy's music videos have received airplay, such as those for the promotional singles [...] "Killing Game" [...] and [...] "Pro-test"; [...] "Dig It" [...] was also occasionally played on MTV. A 30-second television promo was produced for the band by Capital Records in 1987, featuring a mix of scenes from the [...] "Stairs and Flowers" [...] and [...] "Dig It" [...] videos.|$|E
