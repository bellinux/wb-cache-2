2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four soil series recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus <b>defined</b> <b>ranges</b> of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, consistence, pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs.

CIETmap can also classify or display administrative boundaries and geographic features, as well as pictorial symbols.

50|$|The method starts by {{sampling}} {{a set of}} start values {{within the}} <b>defined</b> <b>ranges</b> of possible values for all input variables and calculating the subsequent model outcome. The second step changes the values for one variable (all other inputs remaining at their start values) and calculates the resulting change in model outcome compared to the first run. Next, the values for another variable are changed (the previous variable is kept at its changed value and all other ones kept at their start values) and the resulting change in model outcome compared to the second run is calculated. This goes on until all input variables are changed. This procedure is repeated r times (where r is usually taken between 5 and 15), each time with {{a different set of}} start values, which leads to a number of r(k + 1) runs, where k is the number of input variables. Such number is very efficient compared to more demanding methods for sensitivity analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Rowing is a {{low impact}} {{activity}} with movement only in <b>defined</b> <b>ranges,</b> so twist and sprain injuries are rare. However, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on knee joints, the spine and the tendons of the forearm, and inflammation of {{these are the most}} common rowing injuries. If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains. Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade (previously described). Another common injury is getting [...] "track bites", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks {{at either end of the}} stroke.|$|E
50|$|Focal adhesions are integrin-containing, multi-protein {{structures}} that form mechanical links between intracellular actin bundles and the extracellular substrate in many cell types. Focal adhesions are large, dynamic protein complexes {{through which the}} cytoskeleton of a cell connects to the ECM. They are limited to clearly <b>defined</b> <b>ranges</b> of the cell, at which the plasma membrane closes to within 15 nm of the ECM substrate. Focal adhesions {{are in a state}} of constant flux: proteins associate and disassociate with it continually as signals are transmitted to other parts of the cell, relating to anything from cell motility to cell cycle. Focal adhesions can contain over 100 different proteins, which suggests a considerable functional diversity. More than anchoring the cell, they function as signal carriers (sensors), which inform the cell about the condition of the ECM and thus affect their behavior. In sessile cells, focal adhesions are quite stable under normal conditions, while in moving cells their stability is diminished: this is because in motile cells, focal adhesions are being constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge, and breaks old contacts at the trailing edge of the cell. One example of their important role is in the immune system, in which white blood cells migrate along the connective endothelium following cellular signals to damaged biological tissue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} months several ballon and {{satellite}} experiments improved significantly our knowledge of cosmic ray (CR) spectra at high energy. In particular CREAM allowed to measure B/C, C/O and N/O ratios up to 1 TeV/n and PAMELA the ¯p/p ratio up to 100 GeV with unprecedented accuracy. These measurements offer a valuable probe of CR propagation properties. We performed a statistical analysis to test the compatibility of these results, {{as well as other}} most significant experimental data, with the predictions of a new numerical CR diffusion package (DRAGON).
