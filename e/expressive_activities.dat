50|$|Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach, 621 F. 3d 1051 (2010), was a {{decision}} by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that tattoos, the process of tattooing, and the business of tattooing are pure <b>expressive</b> <b>activities</b> that are fully protected by the First Amendment's free speech clause. The court determined that the process of tattooing constitutes pure expressive activity rather than conduct that is sufficiently imbued with elements of communication. As pure expressive activity, the process of tattooing can only be regulated by a proper time, place, and manner restriction. The court found in Anderson v. The City of Hermosa Beach that the Hermosa Beach Municipal Code banning tattoo parlors within the city was not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction because the regulation was not narrowly tailored to meet the government’s interest and the regulation did not leave open ample alternative avenues for the same messages to be conveyed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the justices held that the school principal was entitled to censor the articles. The majority opinion, written by Associate Justice Byron White, stated that officials had never intended the school paper {{to be a public}} forum, as underground publications were in past cases. White {{went on to say that}} educators do not infringe on First Amendment rights when exercising control over student speech in school-sponsored activities, [...] "so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns". The court established that the student publication could be regulated by school officials, and that they [...] "reserved the forum for its intended purpose, as a supervised learning experience for journalism students".A school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission, even though the government could not [...] ... (Judicial action to protect students' rights is justified) only when the decision to censor a school-sponsored publication, theatrical production or other vehicle of student expression has no valid educational purpose.The decision overrode the precedent set in the Tinker case, which had permitted censorship of student speech only if it violated the rights of other students or threatened to cause a campus disruption. The majority opinion in Hazelwood held that this case was different. The majority opinion said that school administrators are not required to tolerate speech that is contrary to the school's academic mission, and continued: The question of whether the First Amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student speech—the question we addressed in Tinker—is different from the question whether the First Amendment requires a school affirmatively to promote particular student speech. The former question addresses educators' ability to silence students' personal expression that happens to occur on the school premises. The latter question concerns educators' authority over school sponsored publications, theatrical productions, and other <b>expressive</b> <b>activities</b> that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.In a footnote, the court clarified that the ruling did not necessarily apply at the collegiate level.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{also held}} that the {{business}} of tattooing does not affect {{whether or not the}} process of tattooing is free expression. The sale of artwork does not remove the expressive content from being protected by the First Amendment. This protection does not become diminished as the artwork is sold. The Court noted that the sale of the tattoo is intertwined with the process of tattooing and the tattoo itself. The business of tattooing is therefore pure <b>expressive</b> <b>activity</b> that is entitled to full protection under the First Amendment.|$|R
