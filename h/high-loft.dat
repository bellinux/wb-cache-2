5000|$|The thermal {{resistance}} R-value provided by Thinsulate products varies by the specific thickness {{and construction of}} the fabric. Values (US units) range from 1.6 for 80-gram fabric to 2.9 for 200-gram fabric. Thinsulate is considered [...] "the warmest thin apparel insulation" [...] available. In fact, when equal thicknesses are compared, it provides about 1½ times the warmth of down and about twice the warmth of other <b>high-loft</b> insulation materials.|$|E

5000|$|Sarazen's new club, {{including}} the wide, angled sole, was ruled legal by both R&A and USGA authorities, {{and the club}} itself and its basic design concepts became widely copied by other golfers and by club manufacturers. As irons became more standardized in the 20s through the 40s, the wide sole of the sand wedge was copied on other mid- and <b>high-lofted</b> irons to add mass, which compensates for the progressively shorter shaft lengths to provide a similar feel across all the irons with a given swing. The highest-lofted irons got the most additional weight, resulting in the widest soles, giving these clubs the same eponymous wedge-shaped profile as the sand wedge. This led to the tradition of calling these <b>high-lofted</b> irons [...] "wedges", regardless {{of the amount of}} bounce (angle of the sole to the ground) that the sole provided.|$|R
2500|$|Mickelson {{has also}} been {{characterized}} by his powerful and sometimes inaccurate driver, but his excellent short game draws the most positive reviews, most of all his daring [...] "Phil flop" [...] shot in which a big swing with a <b>high-lofted</b> wedge against a tight lie flies a ball {{high into the air}} for a short distance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, {{the first}} commercially {{available}} PrimaLoft insulated garment was manufactured by L.L.Bean. A 1990 New York Times article titled [...] "Outdoor Wear: Sorting Out the Choices" [...] featuring statements by Edward Howell, then L.L. Bean’s director of product development, featuring PrimaLoft insulation as a <b>high-loft</b> synthetic alternative to down with similar performance dry, but superior performance wet. Since then, PrimaLoft {{has gone on}} to become a major supplier of high performance, technical insulation for the outdoor industry.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{technically}} a wedge, pitching wedges {{are generally}} {{treated as if}} they were numbered irons. This is for a number of reasons: first, before the term [...] "wedge" [...] became common for <b>high-loft</b> short irons, the pitching wedge was actually numbered as the [...] "10-iron" [...] of a matched set, and to this day it follows the normal loft progression of the numbered irons. Also, even though it has been named a wedge, many matched iron sets for retail sale include the pitching wedge even when not including other wedges. Finally, the loft of modern irons has been reduced compared to older designs. This is both to compensate for cavity-back iron designs that launch the ball higher for a given loft, and to increase the distance carried by each club for the average golfer's clubhead speed. (Professionals now also use similar designs, preserving the gap in hitting distance between the amateur golfer and the pro.) As a result the loft of the pitching wedge decreased along with the numbered irons from a traditional loft of between 48-54° to between 45-50°, similar to that of an older 8-iron. Many pitching wedges have a loft close to 50°.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "chip" [...] or [...] "half-swing" [...] is {{used for}} {{relatively}} short-distance shots near the green, with <b>high-lofted</b> irons and wedges. The goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green, allowing it to roll out towards the hole. It {{can also be used}} from other places to accurately position the ball into a more advantageous lie. The backswing typically ends {{with the head of the}} club between hip and head height.|$|R
5000|$|When a ball {{is lying}} near the green, a player {{can use a}} hybrid to perform a short [...] "bump and run". By {{assuming}} the player's typical putting stance and grip, a ball can be [...] "bumped" [...] in the air over the taller rough onto the green, where it will then [...] "run" [...] (roll) like a putt. Other clubs, especially mid- and <b>high-lofted</b> irons, can make a similar stroke and are more commonly used.|$|R
5000|$|The ultra lob wedge, {{also called}} the flop wedge by some makers, is a highly specialized, {{extremely}} <b>high-lofted</b> lob wedge (up to 70°), that is designed for situations where an almost vertical launch is required, such as shots from the [...] "lip" [...] of a bunker. They are generally only made by specialty companies, and are not in common usage as many golfers prefer to instead [...] "open" [...] a sand or lob wedge to make a similar shot.|$|R
40|$|New {{millennium}} fibers {{have found}} new application {{fields in the}} textile industry. One type of these, hollow fibers, have unique properties, such as lightness, thermoregula-tion, microfiltration, bulkiness, soil proofing, and water absorption [1, 2]. These unique properties enable us to use them in unique application fields in conventional and func-tional textiles, such as sport textiles [2], artificial dialysis membranes, water purification [3], underwear, swimming costumes [1], suits, casual wear [4], soil-resistant carpets, and <b>high-loft</b> non-woven materials [5]. Hollow fibers can be manufactured by wet spinning, dry spinning, and melt spinning. Melt spinning is the most favorable {{one of them in}} case of process simplicity and cost effectiveness [6]. Generally two different die cross sections are used in the melt spinning. In the first method, the poly-mer exits from an annular hole and nitrogen blows into the inner core. In the second method, the polymer is extruded into a C-shaped spinneret. The following steps are similar to those used in the conventional melt-spinning process, namely cooling, drawing, and winding [5]. The dyeing properties of hollow fibers are very impor-tant, particularly in conventional applications. In this study, the dyeing behavior of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) hollow fibers have been examined...|$|E
40|$|Manufactured fibers {{comprise}} {{a broad spectrum}} of products with an almost endless potential for engineering in specific physical, chemical and aesthetic properties. World fiber consumption is about 40 + % cotton; 40 + % polyester; 7 - 8 % nylon, with all the other fibers representing only about 10 % of the total (Table 1). So it is obvious that both cotton and polyester are very important, whether used alone or together. Historically, fiber manufacturers and cotton producers have focused on the competitive aspects of the marketplace. However, there have also been notable successes for materials containing both fiber types. When mixed in intimate blends, the advantages of different fiber types can be combined to yield superior fabric properties. Cotton/polyester blend fabrics are the quintessential example of utilizing the best attributes of both fibers to produce fabrics with price, performance and aesthetics not achievable with either fiber alone. Similarly, flame resistant fabrics and <b>high-loft</b> battings have been developed using the char forming ability of FR cotton enhanced by the flame poisoning ability of modacrylics and/or FR polyesters. And more complex ternary and quaternary fiber blends are in use to produc...|$|E
5000|$|The modern sand wedge, {{the first}} of the clubs to be called a wedge, was {{developed}} by Gene Sarazen after flying in Howard Hughes' private plane. Sarazen noticed the flaps on the wings that were lowered on takeoff to help create lift, and surmised that the same could be done to a <b>high-lofted</b> golf club to help the clubhead cut through and then lift out of the sand (bringing the ball with it). [...] He built his first prototype in 1931 by taking a niblick and soldering extra lead to its sole to add mass, then adjusting the angle of the sole to about 10 degrees from level with the ground, which he found to be the optimal angle to prevent the clubhead either digging deeply into the sand or skimming (bouncing) along the top. The resulting clubhead profile was roughly wedge-shaped as opposed to the blade-like style of <b>high-lofted</b> irons, hence the name. He brought his new club to compete in the 1932 British Open, but kept it hidden from the authorities to avoid having it ruled illegal. He won that tournament with a then-record score of 283 (the sum of four rounds of play), and also won the subsequent 1932 U.S. Open with a final-round score of 66 that would stand as a tournament record for almost 30 years.|$|R
50|$|Present in some golfers' bags is the chipper, a club {{designed}} {{to feel like}} a putter but with a more lofted face, used with a putting motion to lift the ball out of the higher grass of the rough and fringe and drop it on the green, where it will then roll like a putt. This club replaces the use of a <b>high-lofted</b> iron to make the same shot, and allows the player to make the shot from a stance and with a motion nearly identical to a putt, which is more difficult with a lofted iron due to a difference in lie angle.|$|R
5000|$|Wedges are a {{subclass}} of irons {{with higher}} loft than numbered irons, {{used for a}} variety of specialized [...] "utility" [...] shots that require short distance (typically less than 130 yards), high launch angle, and/or high backspin to reduce roll distance. The first wedge to have that name was the sand wedge, invented by Gene Sarazen in 1931, which features a wide sole that is angled complementary to the striking face to help prevent the clubhead digging into soft turf such as sand. This wide sole was added to other <b>high-lofted</b> irons to add mass to the clubhead (compensating for the shorter shafts) and gives wedges their name, alluding to the clubs' appearance in profile.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Mickelson won the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial with a −14, {{one shot}} ahead of Tim Clark and Rod Pampling. Mickelson shot a first-round 65 {{to start off}} the tournament at −5. He ended the day tied with Brett Wetterich, two shots behind leader, Johnson Wagner. Mickelson shot a second round 68, and the third round 65, overall, being −12 {{for the first three}} rounds. On the final hole, after an {{absolutely}} horrendous tee shot, he was in thick rough with trees in his way. Many players would have punched out, and taken their chances at making par from the fairway with a good wedge shot. Instead, he pulled out a <b>high-lofted</b> wedge and hit his approach shot over a tree, landing on the green where he one-putted for the win.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{omissions}} are the [...] "long irons", numbered from 2 to 5, which are notoriously difficult to hit well. The player can supplement {{the gaps in}} distance with either higher-numbered woods such as the 5 and even the 7-wood, or may replace the long irons with equivalently-numbered hybrid clubs. If hybrids are used, higher-lofted woods are often omitted as redundant, but ladies' and seniors' sets commonly feature both hybrids and <b>high-lofted</b> woods, omitting the long irons entirely {{in favor of the}} lofted woods, and replacing the mid-irons (5-7) with hybrids. The combination allows for higher launch angles on the long-distance clubs, which gives better distance with slower swing speeds. Where a club is omitted and not replaced with a club of similar function, players may add additional clubs of a different function such as additional wedges.|$|R
50|$|Second, the angled sole {{lifts the}} leading edge off {{the ground at the}} bottom of the swing, {{preventing}} the club from digging in to softer lies such as muddy ground, thick grass and of course sand, instead tending to skim over the surface. This in turn allows players more flexibility when addressing the ball; the player can line the ball up in the centre of their stance and take a normal swing in which the club will skim over the turf before contact with the ball, or alternatively they can move the ball rearward in their stance (towards the right foot for a right-handed player) and strike the ball earlier in the swing. The natural consequence of such a shot, executed correctly, is that the club face has less loft at contact, so the ball is launched at a lower angle for more distance. Without bounce, such a shot even if executed correctly will generally cause the club to dig into the ground after it contacts the ball which, with such a <b>high-lofted</b> club, prevents the player from following through on their swing and can cause injury.|$|R
5000|$|Hybrids are a {{cross between}} a wood and an iron, giving these clubs the wood's long {{distance}} and higher launch, with the iron's familiar swing. The club head of a hybrid has a wood-inspired, slightly convex face, and is typically hollow like modern metal woods to allow for high impulse on impact and faster swing speeds. The head is usually smaller than true woods, however, not extending as far back from the face, and the lie and shaft length are similar to an iron giving similar swing mechanics. These clubs generally replace low-numbered irons in a men's set (between 2 and 5, most commonly 3-4), which are typically the hardest clubs in a player's bag to hit well. By doing so they also generally make higher-lofted woods redundant as well. However, some manufacturers produce [...] "iron replacement" [...] sets that use hybrid designs to replace an entire set of traditional irons, from 3 to pitching wedge. Ladies' and seniors' sets commonly feature a combination of <b>high-lofted</b> woods (up to 7w) and hybrids to replace the 5, 6 and 7-irons, allowing these players to get greater carry distances with slower swings.|$|R
