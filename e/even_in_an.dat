5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It is a good {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E

IGN ranked Jonah Hex the 73rd greatest comic book hero of all time.

25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent. Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> idle amplifier due to quiescent currents {{necessary to ensure}} linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.|$|E
25|$|The {{belief in}} ghosts is deeply {{ingrained}} {{in the minds}} of the people of India across generations and it still persists <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> era of modern technology and scientific development. The various concepts of ghosts trace their roots in the vast bodies of Hindu mythology, religious texts, literature and folktales. There are many allegedly haunted places in India, such as dilapidated buildings, royal mansions, forts, forest bungalows, burning ghats etc. Ghosts also occupy a significant place in the Bengali culture. Ghosts and various supernatural entities form an integral part of the socio-cultural beliefs of the both Hindu and Muslim communities of rural Bengal. Fairy tales often use the concept of ghost and references to paranormal activities are found amply in modern-day Bengali literature, cinema, radio and TV programmes.|$|E

25|$|The Danish government, for {{political}} reasons, wished to halt this language shift from Danish to German. After the First War of Schleswig, in 1851, the government issued language rescripts ordering {{that the school}} language should be Danish in those areas where the peasantry spoke Danish and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area stretching further south, into the Low German speaking area. Church language would alternate between Danish and German. Standard Danish had never been widely used in South Slesvig even where the populace spoke a Danish dialect. The dominant official language was German, and the measures of the government had quite the adverse effect, reinforcing anti-Danish sentiment. A pattern emerged, the poorest in rural areas sticking to South Jutlandic, the wealthier peasants speaking Low German as the lingua franca, and educated townsmen speaking High German.|$|E
25|$|Chirped-pulse {{amplification}} {{was originally}} introduced as {{a technique to}} increase the available power in radar in 1960. CPA for lasers was invented by Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland at the University of Rochester in the mid 1980s. Before then, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a laser pulse at intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter causes serious damage to the gain medium through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, {{some of the most}} powerful compressed CPA laser beams, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 gigawatts/cm2, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser gain medium would instantly self focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below the threshold of the nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or terawatt level for very large multi beam facilities.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Jacques Monod, Jean-Pierre Changeux and François Jacob {{discovered}} the lac operon in the bacterium Escherichia coli. It was {{a cluster of}} genes, arranged in a feedback control loop so that its products would only be made when [...] "switched on" [...] by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was an enzyme that splits a sugar, lactose; and lactose itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on.

The British carriers converted from [...] "large light cruisers", , , and , each had two flight decks, {{but there is no}} evidence that the Japanese copied the British model.
