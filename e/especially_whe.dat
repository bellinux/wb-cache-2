40|$|Older farmers remain {{active on}} the farm for several reasons {{including}} good health, desire to remain active, financial, or enjoyment of life {{on the farm}}. The average age of farmers in Ohio is 56 years. However, farming is traditionally a labor-intensive profession that involves physically demanding work. For older farmers, this can present problems in the form of health or safety issues. Many farmers as they age may not be aware of changes in their sensory systems because these changes are usually gradual. Some considerations include: Reaction Time People’s reaction times tend to become slower with age. Therefore, older farmers may not react as quickly in a hazardous situation, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Infections of {{snake bite}} wounds by Shewanella are rarely {{discussed}} in the medical literature. This study aims to characterize the presentation and management of Shewanella infections in snake bite wounds. METHOD: We retrospectively investigated the microbiology, clinical features, and outcomes of patients with Shewanella infected snake bite wounds admitted to a tertiary medical center from January 1998 to December 2009. RESULTS: Ten patients with Shewanella-infected snake bite wounds were identified. All of the snake bites were caused by cobras. The majority of patients had moderate to severe local envenomation and polymicrobial infections. Shewanella isolates are susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and quinolones but are resistant to penicillin and cefazolin. All of the patients examined had favorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that Shewanella infection be considered in snake bite patients, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E

40|$|Music affects {{performance}} in both sensory and motor tasks. It can also pro-vide a significant form of therapy for some mental illness, particularly anxiety. This {{study investigated the}} effects of music on anxiety between: (1) music and nonmusic majors; (2) females and males of each group; and (3) females and males, regardless of sex, to determine the combined interaction effect. Results showed that {{there were significant differences}} in responses between each of the stated groups. Moreover, the female responses to music were more consistent than the male responses in all groups. Key words: aesthetic experience, music students, nonmusic students, psycho-logical processes, sex Music can increase work efficiency, decrease boredom, and mini-mize frustration. Its effects on sensory and motor performance are described by Farnsworth (1965) and Winckel (1967). Music has a calming, soothing, arresting effect on certain forms of mental ill-ness.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} growing interest in genetic predisposition to common diseases, and along with rapid advancements in high-throughput genotyping technology, {{has resulted in a}} tremendous amount of published epidemiological evidence on gene-disease associations. Reported genetic associations with common diseases have become numerous and are mostly of small magnitude [1]. With this growth in evidence has come an increasing need to collate and summarize the evidence in order to identify true genetic associations among the large volume of false positives [2]. Convincing evidence of true association therefore requires careful control over potential biases and chance effects. Control over bias is important both in study design [3] and in considering the selective availability of data on associations that have been examined [4]. Because most genetic associations are small, large sample sizes are necessary for their detection, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Åberg In {{the present}} paper {{the results of a}} survey of {{opinions}} about speeding is discussed. A nation wide sample of 2800 Swedish drivers, with a response rate of 68. 4 %, have been asked to answer a questionnaire based on the Theory of planned behaviour. The results, presented in the paper, show that the theoretical model provides a good frame of reference for explanations of self reported speeding behaviour. Implications from the results and from the literature, are discussed with respect to possible measures to improve behaviour, including, for example, technical support to drivers and information about the general speed level. Also, possible strategies for implementation of such technical solutions are discussed. 11. 1 Reasons for speeding and need for technical support Drivers ’ attitudes are often referred to when the discussion concerns traffic violations and possibilities for driver improvement. However, there might be other factors of importance for behaviour in traffic.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{research}} of influence of the blank holding force and nonmonotonous process of deep drawing on the formability of low-carbon steel sheet with one-side galvanic coating of zinc are presented in this paper. Identification and influence assessment was done by monitoring: forming force, {{the distribution of the}} principal strains in the sheet plane and their relationship to the forming limit diagram, changes of thinning strain and drawing depth as the most significant technological indicator. Based on the analysis of test results, it was concluded that the blank holding force has a significant influence in terms of intensified friction in the flange. Also, in terms of a single-phase monotonous process, the applied type of variable blank holding force had a beneficial effect on the results of forming. A nonmonotonous two-phase process with uniaxial tension in the first stage greatly affects the behaviour of materials. During the first phase, there is an increase of sheet anisotropy, which affects the formability decrease. The applied variable holding force shows favourable effects, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Different, rapid, plate {{diffusion}} assays of tobramycin in serum {{were compared}} {{with each other and}} with an overnight assay. These assays were done with Klebsiella edwardsii var. atlantae, which was resistant to many antibiotics. One of the rapid assays of tobramycin tested used a 1 : 50 - 1 : 100 dilution of an overnight culture, and results were recorded after incubation for 5 hr at 35 C. Two shorter assays were also tested with a 1 : 10 dilution of an overnight culture. The 5 -hr assay was as reproducible and as accurate as the overnight assay. The 2. 5 -hr assay at 35 C proved to be an inaccurate method. Incubation of the assay at 40 C instead of 35 C resulted in more rapid growth of K. edwardsii and in the production by tobramycin of larger and sharper zones of inhibition. The 2. 5 -hr assay at 40 C was as reproducible and as accurate as the 5 -hr and the overnight assays. Tobramycin may be used in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections [t- 4] and may have particular value for treatment of infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} tool in flood prediction is quantitative precipitation estimation using weather radars. This study {{focuses on the}} VRP's (vertical reflectivity profiles) obtained from S-Band RHI scans from the Chilbolton radar in the United Kingdom. The RHI scan consists of several beams, each one elevated at an incremental angle. In an RHI scan pixels represent reflectivity with a corresponding range and height above the earth's surface. The VRP is extracted by a polar to rectangular transformation. During stratiform rainfall a region of enhanced reflectivity associated with echoes from melting snowflakes is commonly observed. This region {{is known as the}} Bright Band. It is necessary to detect the Bright Band region and correct for its presence accordingly. However, previous work has shown Bright Band classification to be rather problematic. Various AI algorithms are introduced namely: Naive Bayes, Fuzzy Naive Bayes, LID 3 (Linguistic ID 3), and applied to the Chilbolton dataset in order to classify bright band regions pixel by pixel. Once trained, these algorithms have the added value of being computationally very cheap compared with current detection models. To estimate class probabilities we attempt to discretise data using uniform discretisation and use two more sophisticated discretisation methods – Entropy Minimisation Partitioning and K-Means Clustering. The algorithms are shown to perform well, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections cause {{morbidity}} worldwide. They {{are difficult}} to diagnose in resource-limited regions, and most patients receive empiric treatment for tuberculosis (TB). Our objective here is to evaluate {{the potential impact of}} NTM diseases among patients treated presumptively for tuberculosis in Mali. Methods: We re-evaluated sputum specimens among patients newly diagnosed with TB (naı̈ve) and those previously treated for TB disease (chronic cases). Sputum microscopy, culture and Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing were performed. Identification of strains was performed using molecular probes or sequencing of secA 1 and/or 16 S rRNA genes. Results: Of 142 patients enrolled, 61 (43 %) were clinically classified as chronic cases and 17 (12 %) were infected with NTM. Eleven of the 142 (8 %) patients had NTM disease alone (8 M. avium, 2 M. simiae and 1 M. palustre). All these 11 were from the chronic TB group, comprising 11 / 61 (18 %) of that group and all were identified as candidates for second line treatment. The remaining 6 / 17 (35. 30 %) NTM infected patients had coinfection with M. tuberculosis and all 6 were from the TB treatment naı̈ve group. These 6 were candidates for the standard first line treatment regimen of TB. M. avium was identified in 11 of the 142 (8 %) patients, only 3 / 11 (27. 27 %) of whom were HIV positive. Conclusions: NTM infections should be considered a cause of morbidity in TB endemic environments <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{longitudinal}} studies, marked {{changes in}} item salience may occur {{even if the}} internal consistency of a scale remains stable over time. Such changes in the pattern of response probabilities are relevant for the substantive interpretation of the scale scores. Also, there may be interindividual differences in item salience within time points. The article demonstrates how Rasch models can be used to study item salience within and across time points. Also, the authors want to demonstrate that even if a test or questionnaire does not fulfill the assumptions of the Rasch model, {{it can be used to}} obtain information on item functioning across participants and over time. The method is illustrated using data from the Baltimore Prevention Program. The use of adequate measurement instruments is an important issue in the design of longitudinal studies. These instruments are used periodically throughout the course of the study to obtain data on participants, giving rise to repeated measurements. Researchers usually use factor analytic methods to identify and group the items from the instrument to create substantively meaningful constructs (see, e. g., Nunnally, 1978). Generally, constructs are determined using data from the initial time point of the study, and then these constructs are checked for reliability and/or validity at each subsequent time point during analysis. Researchers have addressed methodological questions regarding the longitudinal stability of constructs using methods such as latent growth models (see Magnusson, Bergman, Rudinger, & Torestad, 1994). However, little attention has been paid to the longitudinal salience of the items that form these constructs, which may be an important aspect, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Kirstenbosch: A unique {{blend of}} beauty and science The Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens, {{regarded}} by many {{as one of the}} top 10 botanical gardens in the world, celebrates its centenary in May 2013. The garden is distinctive in that it was the first in the world to be established to preserve a country’s unique flora, and in no small part owes its existence to Harold Pearson, a Cambridge graduate and erstwhile Professor of Botany at the South African College. Pearson’s vision for the role of a botanical garden was presented in an address to the South African Association for the Advancement of Science in 1910. He foresaw an institution that could take advantage of the country’s immense floristic wealth by focusing on research, indigenous plant horticulture, economic botany and plant conservation. Pearson’s choice of the Kirstenbosch site was made in February 1911, when he was recorded to have exclaimed ‘this is the place! ’ on being shown the magnificent potential location by Neville Pillans. This book provides a history of the establishment of the Kirstenbosch garden from this point in 1911 on, and outlines the many achievements, setbacks and triumphs of those who worked there. Following Pearson’s death in 1916, the duties of Director were taken over by Robert Compton, who served in this capacity for 34 years, and then by Brian Rycroft whose tenure spanned a further 30 years, ending in 1983. During this long period, the research budget of the National Botanical Garden (NBG) was limited, <b>especially</b> <b>whe...</b>|$|E

Williams-Beuren syndrome is a rare familial multisystem disorder occurring in 1 per 20, 000 live births. It is characterized by congenital heart defects (CHD), skeletal and renal anomalies, cognitive disorder, social personality disorder and dysmorphic facies. We present a case of Williams syndrome that presented to us with heart murmur and cognitive problem. A 5 -year-old girl referred to pediatric cardiologist because of heart murmurs. She had a systolic murmur (2 - 3 / 6) in right upper sternal border with radiation to right cervical region. She also had a bulge forehead. Angiography showed mild supra valvular aortic stenosis and mild multiple peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed and the result was: 46. XX, ish del (7 q 11. 2) (ELN X 1) (7 q 22 X 2) ELN deletion compatible with Williams syndrome. Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is associated with Noonan syndrome, Alagille syndrome, Cutis laxa, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, and Silver-Russel syndrome. The patient had peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, but no other signs of these syndromes were present, and also she had a supravalvular aortic stenosis which was not seen in other syndromes except Williams syndrome. Conclusion. According to primary symptoms, paraclinical and clinical finding such as dysmorphic facies, cognitive disorder and congenital heart defect, Williams syndrome was the first diagnosis.
