5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron <b>flasks</b> have {{traditionally}} been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals {{with the exception of}} manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.|$|E

50|$|A Büchner <b>flask,</b> {{also known}} as a vacuum <b>flask,</b> filter <b>flask,</b> suction <b>flask,</b> {{side-arm}} <b>flask</b> or Kitasato <b>flask,</b> is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer <b>flask</b> with a short glass tube and hose barb protruding about an inch from its neck. The short tube and hose barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled flexible hose (tubing) can be fitted to form a connection to the <b>flask.</b> The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the Büchner <b>flask.</b>|$|R

5|$|The major use {{of silver}} besides coinage {{throughout}} most of history was {{in the manufacture of}} jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum <b>flasks,</b> and Christmas tree decorations.|$|E
5|$|Spore {{prints are}} dark brown, {{sometimes}} with violet shades. Spores are thick-walled with an apical pore, and elongated ellipsoid to equilateral in face view, and somewhat inequilateral in side view, typically measuring 12.0–12.6–13.1 by 6.8–7.1–7.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, four-spored with sterigmata up to 5.5μm long, and have dimensions of 27–37 by 9–11μm. Clamp connections {{are present in}} hyphae. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant. They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and variably shaped, and range from narrow clubs to narrow <b>flasks</b> with a neck no longer than 8μm; their dimensions are typically 20–30 by 6–8μm. The pleurocystidia (found on the gill face) are common; they are broadly club-shaped but taper to a point (sometimes with a rounded tip at the end), and measure 25–35 by 9–14μm. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are also present, with variable shapes similar to the cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 <b>flasks</b> of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E

50|$|An Erlenmeyer <b>flask,</b> {{also known}} as a conical <b>flask</b> (BrE) or {{titration}} <b>flask,</b> is a type of laboratory <b>flask</b> which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is named after the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), who created it in 1860.|$|R
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pink, and the spores measure 10–13 by 6–9μm. They are heterodiametric (with {{different}} diameters in different directions), possessing between 6 and 8 pronounced angles. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, lack clamps, and measure 33–40 by 9–14μm. Located on the gill edge, the thin-walled, inconspicuous cheilocystidia measure 20–30 by 5–9μm and have shapes ranging from irregular cylinders to narrow clubs to <b>flasks.</b> The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form}} of a cutis (with bent-over hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface), comprising cylindrical to inflated hyphae that are up to 20μm wide. The cap tissue is made of narrow cylindrical hyphae that are 4.5–9μm in diameter. They contain granules that have a purple-brown pigment. The stipe cuticle is made of loosely arranged, cylindrical hyphae measuring 2–7μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass <b>flasks</b> filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} <b>Flask,</b> a new {{programming}} language for sensor networks that {{is focused on}} providing an easy-to-use dataflow programming model. In <b>Flask,</b> programmers build applications by composing chains of operators into a dataflow graph that may reside on individual nodes or span multiple nodes in the network. To compose dataflow graphs across sensor nodes, <b>Flask</b> supports a lean, general-purpose communication abstraction, called Flows, that provides publish/subscribe semantics over efficient routing trees. At the heart of <b>Flask</b> is a programmatic wiring language, based on the functional language OCaml [13]. <b>Flask’s</b> wiring language allows dataflow graphs to be synthesized programmatically. The <b>Flask</b> wiring program is interpreted at compile time to generate a sensor node program in NesC, which is then compiled to a binary. Our design of <b>Flask</b> makes three main contributions. First, <b>Flask</b> allows the programmer to specify distributed dataflow applications in a high-level language while retaining the efficiency of compiled binaries and full access to TinyOS components. Second, <b>Flask</b> provides a unified framework for distributing dataflow applications across the network, allowing programmers to focus on application logic rather than details of routing code. Finally, <b>Flask’s</b> programmatic wiring language enables rich composition of dataflow operators, {{making it possible to}} develop higher-level programming models or languages directly in <b>Flask.</b> In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the <b>Flask</b> language, its runtime system, the Flows communication interface, and a compiler that produces NesC code. We evaluate <b>Flask</b> through two motivating applications: a distributed detector of seismic activity (e. g., for studying earthquakes), and an implementation of the TinyDB query language built using <b>Flask,</b> showing that using <b>Flask</b> considerably reduces code complexity and memory size while achieving high runtime efficiency...|$|R
25|$|Pasteur {{performed}} {{several experiments}} to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then {{he closed the}} flask, and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, when he opened <b>flasks</b> containing boiled liquid, dust entered the <b>flasks,</b> causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of <b>flasks</b> in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used swan neck <b>flasks</b> containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the <b>flasks</b> were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.|$|E
