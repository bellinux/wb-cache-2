2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> I {{was to be}} {{so easily}} frightened as that? My sense of my own {{importance}} was up in arms at the bare suspicion of it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; I {{paved the}} way perhaps. That was only justice. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> {{that she was going}} to hit me and that she wasn't to be hit in return?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{significance}} of Bob's remarks about newspapers was lost upon Cynthia then. Not till afterward <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> of them, or connect {{them with his}} unexpected visit. Then the supper bell rang, and they went downstairs.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked at}} her again, {{and his eyes were}} filled with bitterness, with angry passion at the {{injustice}} of fate. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> that he had not suffered? Because he did not whine his misery to all and sundry, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> he did not care? He sprang up and walked {{to the other end of}} the room. He did not want that woman, for all her kindness, to see his face. He was not the man to fall in and out of love with every pretty girl he met. All his life he had kept an ideal before his eyes. He turned to Julia savagely.|$|E
6000|$|I was bewildered and {{inclined}} to be angry that she should carry her dislike of Mr. Ravenor so far. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> me so weak and impressionable that a few minutes' conversation with any man could bring me harm? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Go to your room, {{and put on}} your bonnet," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{mean you}} to {{accompany}} me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think,</b> Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?" ...|$|E
60|$|She did {{not know}} how much of her {{severity}} towards herself was learned from the example that had been two years before her.

60|$|In chapel Miriam saw {{him find}} {{the place in}} the hymn-book for Clara, {{in exactly the same}} way as he used for herself.

He did not stop to consider. He felt himself cruel towards Miriam.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, {{what does}} she mean?--ain't that damned impertinent?' he stammered. 'What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> I was going to say? Does she suppose I would say any harm before--before her? Dash it, does she suppose I would give away my wife to the servants?' Then he added, 'And I wouldn't say any harm before you, Laura. You are too good and too nice and I like you too much!' ...|$|E
60|$|And Adrienne toiled the {{succeeding}} day, not only until {{her fingers and}} body ached, but, until her very heart ached. Poor child! Little <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>think</b> that she was establishing precedents against herself, by which further and destructive exertions might be required. But the apprehension of losing the pittance she actually received, and thereby blasting all hopes from me, was constantly before her mind, quickening her hand and sustaining her body.|$|E
