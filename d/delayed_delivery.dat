5|$|Prinz Adalbert {{was built}} {{under the cover}} name Cheops by the French {{shipyard}} of the Arman brothers in Bordeaux. Her sister ship, built under the cover name Sphinx, was delivered to the Confederate Navy and renamed CSS Stonewall. The French emperor, Napoleon III, ordered the Arman brothers to sell Cheops to another navy immediately; Prussia purchased the ship on 25 May 1864. The Second Schleswig War between Denmark and Prussia and its ally Austria <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> of the ship. Cheops was commissioned into the Prussian fleet on 29 October 1865 as Prinz Adalbert. Along with the turret ship , Prinz Adalbert {{was among the first}} armored vessels acquired by the Prussian Navy. The ship was named for Prince Adalbert of Prussia, one of the creators of the German fleet. While conducting trials off Denmark in June 1865, Prinz Adalbert ran aground. During the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prinz Adalbert was mobilized in Kiel under the command of Admiral Jachmann, but {{due to the lack of}} opponents in the North and Baltic Seas, the ship remained in the Baltic for the duration of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, No.82 Wing's Canberras were {{slated for}} {{possible}} bombing and reconnaissance tasks against Indonesian forces under Operation Handover, a little-publicised contingency plan {{put into effect}} during the Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi, although no combat ensued. No.2 Squadron Canberras saw extensive action in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971, {{under the control of}} the USAF's 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. The Canberras flew almost 12,000 sorties and delivered over 76,000 pounds of bombs, for the loss of two aircraft to enemy action, and gained a high reputation for their accuracy. No.1OCU was made independent of No.82 Wing in April 1968; its sole purpose from then until its disbandment in June 1971 was to supply trained crews to No.2 Squadron in Vietnam. Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations in 1968, while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Between 1970 and 1973, as an interim measure pending the <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> of the F-111, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms; meanwhile No.2 Squadron continued to operate the Canberra, mainly for aerial survey work in Australia and Indonesia, until disbanding in 1982. The Air Force retained the option to purchase the Phantoms if the F-111C program was cancelled. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and was highly regarded by its RAAF crews.|$|E
25|$|In May 1983, the UAE {{placed an}} order for 36 Mirage 2000 aircraft. The order {{consisted}} of 22 single-seat Mirage 2000EAD, eight unique single-seat reconnaissance variants designated Mirage 2000RAD and six Mirage 2000DAD trainers, which collectively are known as SAD-8 (Standard Abu Dhabi). The order specified an Italian-made defensive avionics suite that <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> {{of the first of}} these aircraft until 1989.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{may be useful}} to <b>delay</b> <b>delivery</b> including: NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, beta mimetics, and atosiban. Tocolysis rarely <b>delays</b> <b>delivery</b> beyond 24-48 hours. This delay however may be sufficient to allow the pregnant woman to be transferred to a center specialized for management of preterm deliveries and give administered corticosteroids to reduce neonatal organ immaturity. Meta-analyses indicate that calcium-channel blockers and an oxytocin antagonist can <b>delay</b> <b>delivery</b> by 2-7 days, and β2-agonist drugs delay by 48 hours but carry more side effects. Magnesium sulfate {{does not appear to be}} useful and may be harmful when used for this purpose.|$|R

25|$|Due to the <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> of FB-111A from General Dynamics, the Group's {{training}} mission suffered. Delivery of {{the first}} a/c, 67-7193, took place in late September 1969, followed by the second FB-111A on October 25. These two planes were powered by TF30-P-12A engines. Problems with the Mark IIB avionics slowed further deliveries, with the Air Force not accepting its next FB-111A until 23 June 1969.|$|E
25|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> of {{machines}} kept the factory unfinished throughout 1896 and into 1897. During 1896 Daimler sold imported cars from companies for which Lawson held the licences. Cannstatt supplied engine parts but {{the delivery of}} working drawings were delayed for months. Four experimental cars were built in Coventry and a Panhard van was dismantled and reverse engineered. Some Daimler engines, with details redesigned by works manager J. S. Critchley, were also made in 1896.|$|E
25|$|A {{little over}} a year after her marriage, on 27 January 1859, Victoria gave birth to her first child, the future German Emperor William II. The {{delivery}} was extremely complicated. The maid responsible for alerting doctors to the onset of contractions delayed giving notice. Moreover, the gynecologists hesitated to examine the princess, only wearing a flannel nightgown. The baby was in breech, and the <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> could have caused the death of both the princess and her son.|$|E
40|$|In {{hierarchical}} reliable multicast schemes, {{the number}} of repair proxies and their locations influence the <b>delivery</b> <b>delay.</b> Low <b>delivery</b> <b>delay</b> {{is essential for the}} transmission of real time media. In this paper, we propose a method to decide optimal locations of repair proxies that minimize the mean <b>delivery</b> <b>delay</b> of all receivers in heterogeneous networks using a dynamic programming approach. Additionally, we evaluate how well the optimal proxies endure the link fluctuations. The evaluation results of our proposal in a simulation topology show that the mean <b>delivery</b> <b>delay</b> of all receivers can be reduced by about 10 ms in network size of 1000 nodes. Moreover, we show that if an optimal proxy set is configured once and if an application can tolerate a mean <b>delivery</b> <b>delay</b> increase of 2. 5 ms, the proxy set can sustain about 200 % fluctuation of link statistics. Our method can be used by network providers in order to reduce <b>delivery</b> <b>delay</b> in their HRM network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel adaptive DS-CDMA slotted-ALOHA packet random access scheme with transmitter-based spreading codes for mobiles. It {{is aimed at}} improving the throughput and message <b>delay</b> <b>delivery</b> when traffic load values below the saturation point of the conventional DS-CDMA slotted-ALOHA system are sensed in the channel. For this purpose a mobile assisted algorithm is envisaged to control the change of the transmission rate according to the traffic load. This algorithm revealed that the optimum behavior, obtained using a Markov chain model, may be almost reached at a low complexity cost. Moreover, priorities between mobiles could be easily established. Finally, a traffic model based on a realistic statistical length distribution of the messages illustrates how the <b>delay</b> <b>delivery</b> can be greatly reduced.

25|$|With {{the blessing}} of the king, {{construction}} of the railroad could commence. However, there was one major obstacle, a lack of qualified railroad construction engineers. The experts had to be imported from other countries, mainly England. Even with this expertise, a few odd decisions were made; citing safety concerns, it was decided that the rail would be built on a broad gauge of , while the neighbouring countries all used standard gauge. This made the railroad incompatible with those of neighbouring countries, whereas the system was originally intended to link up with them (the railroads would later be converted to standard gauge to remedy this).

500|$|Between the mid-1860s and {{the early}} 1880s, the Prussian and later Imperial German Navies {{purchased}} or built sixteen ironclad warships. In 1860, however, the Prussian Navy consisted solely of wooden, unarmored warships. The following year, Prince Adalbert and Albrecht von Roon wrote an expanded fleet plan that included four large ironclads and four smaller ironclads. Two of the latter were to be ordered from Britain immediately, as German shipyards were at the time incapable of building such vessels. The rival Danish fleet had three ironclads in service {{by the time the}} Second Schleswig War broke out in 1864; as a result, Prussia purchased the ironclads [...] and , then under construction in Britain and France, respectively. The British, sympathetic to the Danish cause, <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> of both Arminius and Prinz Adalbert until after the combined Austro-Prussian victory.

500|$|Allward had {{initially}} hoped to use white marble for the memorial's facing stone, but Percy Nobbs suggested {{this would be}} a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern France and the memorial would have a [...] "ghost like" [...] appearance. Allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity. He found it in the ruins of Diocletian's Palace at Split, Croatia; he observed that the palace had not weathered over the years, which Allward took as evidence of the stone's durability. His choice—Seget limestone—came from an ancient Roman quarry located near Seget, Croatia. The difficulties with the quarrying process, coupled with complicated transportation logistics, <b>delayed</b> <b>delivery</b> of the limestone and thus construction of the memorial. The first shipment did not arrive at the site until 1927, and the larger blocks, intended for the human figures, did not begin to arrive until 1931.|$|E
