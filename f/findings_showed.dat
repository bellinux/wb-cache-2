5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

The ATSB determined the time of impact to be approximately 14:21, 17 minutes after the last communication with the aircraft. The impact was determined to be not survivable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Gerngross {{became one of}} the first vocal critics of {{biobased}} processes. By using life cycle assessment tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{equivalent}} {{magnetic noise}} spectral density level for long type magnetostrictive-piezoelectric laminated composites {{has been investigated}} by using a 1 D equivalent circuit model, and exemplified for a longitudinal-transverse mode. The theoretical developments explain well our experimental results. The <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that similar ultimate magnetic noise spectral noise density can be expected whether using either charge or voltage amplifier detection methods. The <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that a volume effect and the dielectric loss factor of the piezoelectric layer are the dominant sources of the noise floor. Our <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that the noise scales as 1 /√f.

25|$|Another {{cross-country}} study compared {{access to care}} based on immigrant status in Canada and the U.S. <b>Findings</b> <b>showed</b> that in both countries, immigrants had worse access to care than non-immigrants. Specifically, immigrants living in Canada {{were less likely to}} have timely Pap tests compared with native-born Canadians; in addition, immigrants in the U.S. were less likely to have a regular medical doctor and an annual consultation with a health care provider compared with native-born Americans. In general, immigrants in Canada had better access to care than those in the U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries. However, immigrants in the U.S. {{were more likely to have}} timely Pap tests than immigrants in Canada.|$|E
25|$|A small {{subpopulation}} of Cit− cells {{unable to}} grow on citrate, and {{belonging to a}} separate clade persisted in the population after the Cit+ cells became dominant. Early <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that this diversity was {{partly due to the}} Cit− cells being better at growing on the glucose in the medium. Turner et al. later found that another factor behind the coexistence was that the Cit− cells evolved the ability to cross feed on the Cit+ majority. They showed that the Cit+ cells release succinate, malate, and fumarate during growth on citrate, as the CitT transporter pumps these substances out of the cell while pumping citrate into the cell. The Cit− cells had rapidly evolved the ability to grow on these substances due to a mutation that restored expression of an appropriate transporter protein that was silent in the ancestor.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau, and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, {{conducted}} an investigation {{to see if}} Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated {{the size of the}} palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted electric resistivity and magnetometric soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to dig trenches. Their <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought. With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former Megiddo Expedition colleague, Prof. Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University, the following year and asked whether he would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.|$|E
40|$|Operational {{employees}} play {{a pivotal}} role in delivering superior service quality to customers or converting aggrieved customers into satisfied and loyal ones. However, high workforce turnover rate, especially on operational level employees {{has been one of the}} most pressing issues of the global hotel industry. Managing staff turnover to improve retention can lead to better recruitment, lower costs, improved morale and a better knowledge base. Turnover fluctuates with economic cycles and during a recession, for example, often falls. This may disguise underlying problems (such as dissatisfied staff or lack of new talent), so it is important to manage the underlying factors relating to turnover, even though turnover itself may not always be a problem. The general objective of the study is to examine the predictors of hotel staff propensity to leave; and the mediating role of job satisfaction and organizational commitment and also individual characteristics (self-esteem and emotional intelligence), job characteristics (role conflict, role ambiguity and work overload) and organizational characteristics (perceived career advancement, empowerment and leader-staff relationship). Specifically it aims to examine the relationship between the research variables; whether job satisfaction and organizational commitment mediate the effect of independent variables such as (individual, job and organizational characteristics) on the dependent variable (propensity to leave). The sample size was 411 hotel employees in Tehran, Iran. The data analyses were conducted by a process of multivariate analysis using structural equation modelling (SEM) and AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) software package Version 17. There are seven parts in the <b>findings</b> which <b>showed</b> the relationship between the study variables and the role of the mediating variables. In the first part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that self-esteem, role ambiguity, work overload, perceived career advancement and perceived empowerment effect job satisfaction. In the second part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that just perceived leader-staff relationship effects organizational commitment. In the third part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that perceived career advancement effects propensity to leave. In the fourth part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that organizational commitment is related to propensity to leave. In the fifth part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that job satisfaction effects organizational commitment. In the sixth part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that job satisfaction mediates the effect of emotional intelligence, role ambiguity, role conflict, perceived career advancement and perceived empowerment on propensity to leave. In the final part, <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> that organizational commitment mediates the effect of role ambiguity, perceived career advancement and perceived empowerment on propensity to leave...|$|R

25|$|Similar to the {{problems}} of a restricted educational background, the subjects of the first studies on the social sharing of emotions were limited to Belgian and French populations. While later studies conducted in Netherlands, Italy, and Spain produced similar results to the first studies, the question of whether social sharing exists in non-Western cultures. The first intercultural study compared Dutch subjects to Turkish and Surinamese immigrants, and the <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that social sharing was a prominent behavior in each group, although slightly less so for the Surinamese subjects. Other studies comparing Western and Eastern cultures produced similar results, finding that Eastern cultures had slightly lower rates of social sharing. Furthermore, several general qualitative differences were found between Western and Eastern populations. On average, Western subjects shared an emotional event more often (5–6 times) than Asian subjects (2–3 times). There was also a longer delay between the emotional event and the social sharing for Asian groups than for Western ones.|$|E
25|$|The nail's design {{began when}} its inventor, civil {{engineer}} Ed Sutt, {{traveled to the}} Caribbean {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Marilyn. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95mph (155km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse. Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility, which had received funding through a grant from FEMA. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity. The outcome of the project's research showed {{that the best way to}} strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the roofing and wall sheathing to the internal frame, and with this information Sutt signed on as a fastener engineer for the Stanley subsidiary, Bostitch.|$|E
25|$|As {{an attempt}} to tackle such issues, the UK {{launched}} a national campaign called Be Real, after <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves. The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead. Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual’s body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial. Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed {{as a tool to}} share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to speak out on issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular hashtags and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, {{the total}} Armenian {{population}} of the districts of Kalbajar, Lachin, Qubadli, Zangilan, Jabrayil, Fuzuli and Agdam was around 1,400 people. An OSCE fact-finding mission established at Azerbaijan's request visited these regions in February 2005 with the intention to assess {{the scale of the}} settlement attempts. The mission's <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> that these districts had as of 2005 an overall population of 14,000 persons, mostly living in precarious social conditions. It consisted primarily of ethnic Armenians displaced from non-conflict zones of Azerbaijan during the war. It was noted, however, that most of them had settled in the conflict zone after having lived in Armenia for several years and some held Armenian passports and even voted in Armenian elections. A smaller segment of the settlers were originally from the towns of Gyumri and Spitak in Armenia who had lived in temporary shelters following the devastating 1988 earthquake before moving to Karabakh, as well as a small number of natives of Yerevan who moved there for financial reasons. A field assessment mission revisited the region in October 2010, confirming that there had not been much growth in population or change in living conditions of the settlers. The Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group who visited Artsakh, Kalbajar and Lachin in 2014 reported seeing signs of improvements in infrastructure, but could not observe any indications that the size of the population had changed in recent years.|$|E
