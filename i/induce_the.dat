5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.|$|E

5|$|After their victory, Alcibiades and Thrasybulus {{began the}} siege of Chalcedon in 409 BC with about 190 ships. Although unable to attain a decisive victory or <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> city to surrender, Alcibiades was able to win a small {{tactical}} land battle outside of the city gates and Theramenes concluded {{an agreement with the}} Chalcedonians. Afterwards they concluded a temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some much needed immediate cash for the army, but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E

Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E

On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent to the}} Allied {{headquarters}} at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E

5|$|The Sihanaka {{share the}} belief common {{throughout}} the island that {{the spirits of}} ancestors can possess the living, placing them in a trance state called a tromba. The Sihanaka traditionally believe that looking at a cuckoo roller (an indigenous bird) will <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> tromba. Communities look to ombiasy (wise men) for spiritual guidance, to commune with the ancestors, and to determine which days are auspicious for undertaking particular tasks or endeavors. By the 1600s, a uniform religious belief system had grown around a group of sampy (idols) believed to channel the protective spiritual power of 11 deities. The origin of these amulets {{is said to have}} been in the western territories under Sakalava control.|$|E
5|$|Treating. Treating is {{the act of}} corruptly giving or providing, or paying {{in whole}} or part for, any food, drink, refreshment, cigarette, {{entertainment}} or other thing, or any money or ticket or other means to enable such things to be obtained, in order to corruptly influence a person to vote or refrain from voting, or to <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> person to attend an election meeting, or to reward him for having done so. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both, and the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E
5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> mammalian interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Outside Australia it {{has become}} naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not {{considered}} to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and tannin production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae <b>induce</b> <b>the</b> formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E
