40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{widespread}} use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (nRTx) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) introduced the problem of treating locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) after nRTx and TME. Few data exist {{on the outcome of}} the surgical treatment of this type of LRRC and the influence of nRTx <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor on the outcome is unclear. METHODS: All patients receiving multimodality treatment (including intraoperative radiotherapy) for LRRC in our center between 1996 and 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. The outcome of patients with nonmetastasized resectable LRRC who received nRTx and TME <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor was compared to the outcome of patients who did not receive nRTx <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor. RESULTS: During this period, 139 patients underwent surgery for LRRC; 93 of these patients underwent curative surgery for LRRC after TME <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor. Sixty-five patients did not receive nRTx <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor, whereas 28 patients received nRTx <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor. There {{were no significant differences in}} the number of incomplete resections or perioperative morbidities. There was no significant difference in 5 -year overall survival (28 vs. 43 %, p = 0. 81), recurrence-free survival (55 vs. 48 %, p = 0. 5), and disease-free survival (27 vs. 40 %, p = 0. 59). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of carefully selected patients with nonmetastasized resectable LRRC after nRTx and TME <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor is feasible and can result in sustained local control and overall survival. Patients with resectable LRRC who received nRTx <b>for</b> the <b>primary</b> tumor do not have a poorer outcome than patients who did not...|$|R

5|$|Production {{processes}} <b>for</b> <b>primary</b> {{and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and {{this trend is}} likely to increase in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
