40|$|AbstractRice bran oil (RBO) {{contains}} {{significant amounts}} of the natural antioxidants γ-oryzanol and tocopherols, which are lost {{to a large degree}} during oil refining. This results in a number of industrial residues with high contents of these phytochemicals. With the aim of supporting the development of profitable industrial procedures for γ-oryzanol and tocopherol recovery, the contents of these phytochemicals in all the residues produced during RBO refining were evaluated. The samples included residues from the degumming, soap precipitation, bleaching earth filtering, dewaxing and <b>deodorisation</b> distillation steps. The highest phytochemical concentrations were found in the precipitated soap for γ-oryzanol (14. 2 mgg− 1, representing 95. 3 % of total γ-oryzanol in crude RBO), and in the <b>deodorisation</b> distillate for tocopherols (576 mg 100 g− 1, representing 6. 7 % of total tocopherols in crude RBO). Therefore, among the residues of RBO processing, the <b>deodorisation</b> distillate was the best source of tocopherols. As the soap is further processed for the recovery of fatty acids, samples taken from every step of this secondary process, including hydrosoluble fraction, hydrolysed soap, distillation residue and purified fatty acid fraction, were also analyzed. The distillation residue left after fatty acid recovery from soap was found to be the best source of γ-oryzanol (43. 1 mgg− 1, representing 11. 5 % of total γ-oryzanol in crude RBO) ...|$|E

40|$|The ToxicOilSyndrome (TOS) was an {{epidemic}} disease appeared in central Spain in 1981, causing over 400 deaths and affecting more than 20, 000 people, mainly women and children. The disease {{was linked to}} the consumption of rapeseed oil denatured with aniline, illegally refined at the ITH oil refinery in Seville, mixed with other oils and sold as edible olive oil. Among the anilinederivatives detected in the oil batches generated by an uncontrolled <b>deodorisation</b> procedure during the refining process, fatty acid anilides were first postulated as the causal agents. Nevertheless, compounds identified as 3 -(N-phenylamino) propane- 1, 2 -diol (PAP) and its mono-, di-, and triacyl derivatives (mPAP, dPAP and tPAP, respectively), were subsequently considered better biomarkers of toxicoils and the best candidates for causing the intoxication. In this account, we will discuss the results obtained in recent years by our group concerning: (a) The effect of different variables intervening in the <b>deodorisation</b> process that could influence the formation of PAP derivatives. To this end we decided to take the anilinederivatives linked to oleic acid as compound models since this is the fatty acid present in highest amounts in rapeseed oil. The study was focused on the influence of different parameters on the formation of the diester PAP derivative (OOPAP) the monoester derivative (OPAP) and the corresponding amide (oleanilide, OA), and the interactions between any two of these variables. Of particular interest was the interaction observed between OOPAP and OA, due to its potential relevance to the final composition of the toxicoil model. (b) Xenobiochemical aspects of PAP derivatives, specifically: the stereospecific hydrolysis of OPAP and OOPAP by human pancreatic lipase, the in vitro activation of PAP by human and rat liver microsomes as well as by recombinant 450 enzymes, and the formation and stability of GSH and N-acetylcysteine adducts of a highly reactive iminoquinone intermediate generated in the biotransformation of PAP.

40|$|The {{difference}} in Calendula oil quality from fractions obtained after seed classification is enormous. The oil quality varies from excellent to very poor, according to important aspects {{such as in}} the hulls and dust fraction, high free fatty acid values (13 % vs. 0. 6 %) are found. This {{can be explained by the}} presence of active lipase enzymes in this fraction, possibly from fungal or microbial sources. In general, Calendula oil deterioration will occur after long periods of post-harvest storage due to seed damage and unfavourable quality conditions regarding moisture, temperature and enzymatic activity. The dark oil colour is probably caused by chemical/enzymatic oxidation and hydrolyzation and is very persistent during the chemical refining steps as degumming, refining, bleaching and deodorising. Processing the oil directly after harvesting, combined with nitrogen flushing and cold storage will probably prevent the formation of a dark colour. Lab-scale refining has shown that an excellent oil quality can be produced using a good initial oil quality. The use of high temperatures (200 °C or higher) for oil <b>deodorisation</b> will cause modification and polymerisation and the formation of calendic acid isomers. Calendula oil is rich in gamma (1800 - 1900 ppm) and alpha (270 ppm) tocopherol and its content is not affected by processing or refining and is relatively high compared to other tocopherol-rich sources such as soybean or maize oil. Recovery of these tocopherols can be of interest, both as a by-product (vitamin E) and to obtain reactive oils (low in anti-oxidant). However, special care must be taken to avoid changing the reactive character of the conjugated triens present in the oil. High temperatures should similarly be avoided while developing a mild process for oil <b>deodorisation</b> and tocopherol removal.

40|$|The Australasian {{section of}} the American Oil Chemists Society (AAOCS) held their {{biennial}} meeting in Adelaide, Australia on 8 – 11 November 2011. Over 70 scientists, researchers and industry representatives gathered for three days of talks and discussions on lipid related topics. A highlight was the hot topic symposium on the new olive oil standard being introduced in Australia. Paul Miller, Australian Olives Association, gave a compelling address on why the standard was needed. He demonstrated {{that the increase in}} price and demand for high quality olive oils has led to products falsely or misleadingly labelled. Furthermore, the genetic and seasonal variation in minor components of olive oil has led to misclassifications. An extensive scientific and political process in Australia and overseas led to development of this new standard. Dr. Leandro Ravetti, Mordern Olives, demonstrated the development of two new methods, for analysis of pyropheophytins and diacylglycerols, are good indicators of modification by <b>deodorisation</b> of oils and show excellent correlation with organoleptic assessment with aging/degradation of extra virgin olive oils. Professor Rod Mailer finished this session with studies of actual adulteration cases in Australia and overseas, further highlighting the need for this new standard. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} quality characteristics for refined {{vegetable oils}} focus on a bland taste, a light colour and a good oxidative stability. Currently, an increased interest is observed for functional minor components naturally present in oils and fats performing a beneficial nutritional effect. Refining of crude vegetable oils involving degumming, bleaching and <b>deodorisation</b> has a high influence {{on the content of}} functional minor components. In this study the difference of chemical versus physical refining will be studied. Especially the reduction of the tocopherol content in refined oil is mainly due to oxidation of the tocopherol. Also the content of sterols in free and esterified form is changing during the various stages of refining. As the economic value of physical deodoriser distillates is much lower compared to chemical distillates an improved deodorization technology to increase the quality of physical deodoriser distillates by condensation of the distillate in two separate fractions was developed. Free fatty acids distillated in the initial stages of the deodorization process are collected in a first distillate, followed by a condensation of tocopherols and phytosterols in a second distillate with a high economic value. The fractionated distillation of free fatty acids and tocopherols / phytosterols was achieved by optimisation of the deodorization temperature profile...|$|E
40|$|Discrimination between {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} isomers with three double bonds is a great challenge, due to structural similarities and similar polarities. In this study, we report the identification of four minor geometrical isomers of α-linolenic acid (ALA) present in linseed oil samples: (9 E, 12 Z, 15 E) -, (9 Z, 12 Z, 15 E) -, (9 Z, 12 E, 15 Z) - and (9 E, 12 Z, 15 Z) -octadeca- 9, 12, 15 -trienoic acids, chromatographically resolved by gas chromatography (GC) using a new and highly polar ionic phase column (SLB-IL 111). Gas chromatography-electron ionisation mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) determined that the four unknown compounds were C 18 : 3 n- 3 isomers. The positional 9 - 12 - 15 C 18 : 3 configuration was achieved by covalent adduct chemical ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (CACI-MS/MS) while geometrical configuration was established with analytical standards based on relative retention.

40|$|Ozone is now {{attracting}} {{much attention}} worldwide as a pollutionfree oxidant {{for a wide}} range of applications, including <b>deodorisation,</b> decolourisation, disinfection, various bleaching processes, gas treatment and chemical synthesis. In each of these, ozone requires less energy than the alternative chlorination process [1]. The consequent surge in the use of ozone has brought about the requirement for its generation at the rate of grams per kilowatt hour (g/kWh), at the same time as producing a high part per million (ppm) concentration. To fulfil these demands, extensive research has been undertaken recently on a number of different experimental configurations and discharge techniques. Ozone is generated by means of an electric discharge, when a high-energy electric field exists between two conductors that are separated by a dielectric and a discharge gap and have a gas containing oxygen or air flowing between them. The high electric field in the resulting low current discharge causes an electron flow across the discharge gap, and by providing sufficient energy to dissociate the oxygen molecules leads to the formation of ozone. For many years silent electric discharge have been commonly used to generate ozone and for other chemical processes [2 - 7]. The use of dielectric material on one or both side of the electrodes is necessary for the silent technique, as the dielectric barrier serves to distribute the micro-discharges evenly over the entire electrode area and thereby limits the amount of charge and energy that is fed into any individual micro-discharge [2, 3, 6, 7]. Other techniques that are used for ozone generation include corona discharge [8, 9], surface discharge [10, 11, 12], pulsed streamer discharge [13 - 18] and atmospheric pressure glow discharge [20 - 24]. This study focuses on the production of ozone using atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD). A study of the relevant literature has confirmed that this technique has the potential to generate ozone more efficiently and effectively than the silent discharge.

40|$|Photocatalytic {{purification}} {{of organic}} pollutants, contaminants and hazardous microorganisms {{is an interesting}} approach toward pollution control. Using photosensitive catalysts, undesirable organic compounds can be completely mineralised. Among photosensitive catalysts, nanostructured anatase titanium dioxide has long been regarded as excellent catalyst scientifically and commercially {{for a wide range}} of applications, especially in sterilisation, disinfection, air purification, water treatment, and <b>deodorisation.</b> Although research work on anatase photocatalyst has been intensively pursued, the development of photocatalytic self-cleaning treatment for fibrous materials with low thermal and chemical resistance, particularly in keratinous fibres, is still at infantile stage. The core motivation for conducting this present study is to investigate and modify the photocatalytic property and compatibility of anatase titanium dioxide on naturally-occurring keratinous fibres. Attempts were successful to produce an innovative photocatalytic self-cleaning keratinous fibrous material, in which environmental-friendly photocatalytic self-cleaning property was conferred on keratin fibers by coating low temperature-synthesised colloid of anatase nanocrystals using the conventional dip-pad-cure surface coating treatment. The synthesis parameters of the photocatalytic self-cleaning colloid formulation in terms of chemicals used, synthesis preparation time, and formulation concentration were studied to advance the photocatalytic efficiency. The anatase adhesion to the surface of keratinous fibers was also improved so as to enhance the photoactivity and its sustainability using surface activation techniques such as wettability pre-treatment, silicone surface modification, and microwave-generated plasma afterglow treatment. On the other hand, the photocatalytic activity of anatase has been limited by its specific excitation source to ultraviolet light. To date, current debate centeres on the limited use of solar energy in triggering advanced oxidation process due to the large photonic band gap (3. 2 eV) of anatase. In order to take full advantage of the photoreaction, the synergistic effects of chemical doping on the visible-light photocatalysis of anatase were also studied in this investigation. The properties of anatase nanocrystals were modified by doping with metals and non-metal in order to tune the oxidising power of anatase to the visible light region. The spectroscopic and physicochemical characteristics of the modified-anatase have been determined. The findings revealed that the modified-anatase spectral response was extended to the visible light region and concurrently the electron-hole recombination was retarded, resulting in accelerating the visible-light photoactivity. This research provides insights on the structure-property-use relationship of anatase titanium dioxide in biomaterial applications under ultraviolet and visible light conditions. In addition, development of keratin fibers with self-cleaning function helps in preserving our limited natural resources such as water, energy, and petrochemical detergents for a more sustainable environment by reduction of the laundering cycles through exploiting new possibilities of self-cleaning materials in the society...|$|E
40|$|Some recent {{developments}} on {{trans fatty acids}} (TFA) include aspects like regulation (limited levels in food for Denmark, labelling in USA and Canada), scientific data analysed by different expert committees (Codex Alimentarius, Efsa in Europe, Afssa in France), technology with process solutions already developed (some of them, for more than 10 years) or in progress to decrease their occurrence. While most of the “natural” unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) are in the cis configuration, TFA main dietary origins are: i) products containing fats from ruminant animals (dairy products, meat…), where TFA are produced by the bacterial transformation of UFA in the rumen of animals – ii) partially hydrogenated fats (vegetable and fish oils) – iii) oils heated at high temperature (like <b>deodorisation</b> during refining). If the Codex Alimentarius as well as USA and Canada have adopted a definition of TFA excluding conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), {{or in the case}} of Denmark, excluding also the TFA from “natural” origin, the European and French Authorities (Efsa and Afssa) define TFA as any UFA (MUFA or PUFA) having at least one double bond in the trans configuration. TFA dietary intake surveys show a significant trend to decrease, but all the countries do not start from the same point (USA, Canada four times more than Greece, for instance). Within European countries, TFA consumptions are at least ten times lower than saturated fatty acids (SAFA) intakes. 60 % of the TFA intake contributing food are from animal origins (Afssa report). Considering the health effects of TFA, it is well established now that, as for SAFA, higher intakes (when compared to cis MUFA and PUFA) increase the LDL-cholesterol level, and tend to decrease HDL-cholesterol (when compared to SAFA and cis MUFA and PUFA), with a linear dose-response and a probable threshold under which no effect can be observed (Aquitaine study). The nutritional status of CLAs is not that clear, and the expert position remain cautious on their positive impact. Besides these considerations, it has to be noted that the analytical determinations of TFA together with CLAs and other fatty acids (cis) may require some sophisticated methodologies. Moreover, some technical solutions have been found, encouraged by good practice manufacturing codes (like IMACE, FEDIOL) for margarines, spreads formulation and polyunsaturated vegetable oil refining. Nevertheless, some improvements should be made for certain products (bakery, confectionery, crackers…) still contributing to TFA intakes. This specific concern on TFA should not obliterate the fact that, as far as lipids are concerned in nutritional balance, the whole diet must be considered to reach the nutritionist recommendations on SAFA/MUFA/PUFA with an optimal n- 6 /n- 3 ratio of 5...|$|E
40|$|Replacement of {{fish oil}} with {{sustainable}} alternatives, such as vegetable oil, in aquaculture diets {{has to be}} achieved without compromising the nutritional quality, in terms of n- 3 highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) content, of the product. This may be possible if the level of replacement is not too high and oil blends are chosen carefully but, if high levels of fish oil are substituted, a fish oil finishing diet prior to harvest {{would be required to}} restore n- 3 HUFA. However, a decontaminated fish oil would be required to avoid increasing undesirable contaminants. Here we test the hypotheses that blending of rapeseed and soybean oils with southern hemisphere fish oil will have a low impact upon tissue n- 3 HUFA levels, and that decontamination of fish oil will have no major effect on the nutritional quality of fish oil as a feed ingredient for Atlantic salmon. Salmon (initial weight ~ 0. 8 kg) were fed for 10 weeks with diets in which 60 % of fish oil was replaced with blends of soybean, rapeseed and southern hemisphere fish oil (SVO) or 100 % decontaminated northern fish oil (DFO) in comparison with a standard northern fish oil diet (FO). Decontamination of the oil was a two-step procedure that included treatment with activated carbon followed by thin film <b>deodorisation.</b> Growth performance and feed efficiency were unaffected by either the SVO or DFO diets despite these having lower gross nutrient and fatty acid digestibilities than the FO diet. There were also no effects on the gross composition of the fish. Liver and, to a lesser extent flesh, lipid levels were lower in fish fed the SVO blends, due to lower proportions of neutral lipids, specifically triacylglycerol. Tissue lipid levels were not affected in fish fed the DFO diet. Reflecting the diet, flesh eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and total n- 3 fatty acids were higher, and 18 : 1 n- 9 lower, in fish fed DFO than FO, whereas there were no differences in liver fatty acid compositions. Flesh EPA levels were only slightly reduced from about 6 % to 5 % although docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reduced more severely from around 13 % to about 7 % in fish fed the SVO diets. In contrast, the liver fatty acid compositions showed higher levels of n- 3 HUFA, with DHA only reduced from 21 % to about 18 % and EPA increased from under 8 % to 9 - 10 % in fish fed the SVO diets. The evidence suggested that increased liver EPA (and arachidonic acid) was not simply retention, but also conversion of dietary 18 : 3 n- 3 and 18 : 2 n- 6. Increased HUFA synthesis was supported by increased hepatic expression of fatty acyl desaturases in fish fed the SVO diets. Flesh n- 3 HUFA levels and desaturase expression was significantly higher in fish fed soybean oil than in fish fed rapeseed oil. In conclusion, partial replacement of fish oil with blends of vegetable oils and southern hemisphere fish oil had minimal impact on HUFA levels in liver, but a greater effect on flesh HUFA levels. Despite lower apparent digestibility, decontamination of fish oil did not significantly impact its nutritional quality for salmon...|$|E
