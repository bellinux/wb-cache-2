40|$|SUMMARY Psoriasis is a chronic, {{inflammatory}} disease affecting 1 - 3 % of the world’s population. Joints {{can be affected}} in up to 30 % of patients. About one third of patients have either severe or moderate (involving more than 10 % of body surface area) disease. Patients affected with extensive psoriasis have an impaired quality of life. Psoriasis has a large spectrum of clinical features and evolution, so no complete agreement on the classification of the clinical variants exists. Plaque psoriasis is the commonest form (more than 80 % of affected patients). The course of plaque psoriasis varies. Spontaneous resolution is possible, but rarely occurs. Plaques tend to remain static or slowly enlarge. Flexural (inverse, intertriginous) psoriasis manifests with lesions thinner than those of plaque form with no or minimal scaling, and is localized in the skin folds. <b>Guttate</b> (eruptive) <b>psoriasis</b> has frequently a sudden onset and frequently appears abruptly after a bacterial or viral febrile episode of inflammation of the upper ways. Pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis are the most severe clinical variants. In the diffuse pustular form recurrent episodes of fever occur, followed by new outbreaks of pustules. Erythrodermic psoriasis corresponds to the generalized form of the disease. The entire skin is bright red and is covered by superficial scales. Fatigue, myalgia, shortness of breath, fever and chills may also occur. In sebopsoriasis (seborrheic dermatitis + psoriasis) the lesions tend to occur at the same sites as seborrheic dermatitis; greasy scales predominate, but silvery scales {{can be found in}} some areas. Nail psoriasis shows various features: nail pits; oil spots; subungual hyperkeratosis; onycholysis. Rare forms include psoriasis circinata, lip psoriasis and oral psoriasis. Differential diagnosis includes many other dermatological conditions. Key words: Psoriasis, nail, quality of lif...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{more than}} one-third of the psoriatic population, the first manifestations occur in childhood. Whether the age of onset of {{psoriasis}} influences the march of psoriasis is not known. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology and clinical features as well as prescribed treatments and familial distribution in psoriasis depending on the age of onset of the disease. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was sent to 5300 adult psoriatic patients. Respondents were divided into two groups: patients who experienced an onset of disease before the age of 18 [childhood onset psoriasis (COP) ] and patients with an onset of disease from the age of 18 [adult onset psoriasis (AOP) ]. RESULTS: Questionnaires of 1926 (36. 3 %) patients were suitable for analysis. In 37. 1 % of patients, first signs of the disease occurred before the age of 18. COP occurs predominantly in females, has a longer delay in diagnosis and a higher frequency of familial distribution. The development of <b>guttate</b> and erythrodermic <b>psoriasis</b> in adulthood is more frequently seen in COP. In contrast to common belief, type of psoriasis in COP often remains the same from childhood to adulthood. There was no evidence found that getting psoriasis before the age of 18 years influences development of high body mass index in adulthood, disease severity in later life or type of treatments used.

40|$|Background. In recent years, {{the efforts}} of dermatologists and patomorphologists {{directed}} to identifying additional prognostically significant criteria that will allow determining the psoriasis course and effectiveness of the treatment. Objective. To study the expression levels of immunohistochemical markers of cell proliferation, vascularization, apoptosis, inflammation, depending on the form of psoriasis and severity of pathological processes. Methods. The study included 18 patients (9 men and 7 women) aged from 24 up to 58 years with a diagnosis of psoriasis (general group) in two forms - plaque and guttate. To identify the relationship between angiogenesis, inflammatory infiltration and violations of keratinocytes maturation morphological and immunohistochemical studies were performed; primary antibody to CD 3, CD 68, Ki- 67, VEGF, CD 34, P 63, S 100, and MMP- 9 were used. Results. The obtained results allow determining the form, stage and severity of psoriasis usual {{at the time of}} patient appeal and biopsies of psoriatic skin lesions obtaining. The activity of inflammation in psoriasis could be determined by neutrophils, macrophages and proliferative activity of the basal layer. Subsequent persistence of the pathological process - by the presence of basal cell hyperplasia in the regressing stage, overexpression of markers MMP- 9, VEGF and dilation of blood vessels with T-lymphocyte infiltrates. Conclusion. Exclusively morphological criteria can not be used as reliable indicators of patient’s recovery with plaque and <b>guttate</b> forms of <b>psoriasis</b> and require additional immunohistochemical investigations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The first {{manifestations of}} {{psoriasis}} begin in childhood {{in more than}} one-third of patients. However, epidemiological data of juvenile psoriasis are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To compare Dutch (NL group) and Singaporean (SG group) children with psoriasis with the aim of studying the characteristics of juvenile psoriasis and to highlight similarities and differences between these different ethnic groups. METHODS: Data were collected from 207 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with psoriasis from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands and the National Skin Centre, Singapore. RESULTS: A striking difference in familial distribution was found, with more Dutch children having an affected family member (73. 3 % vs. 13. 6 %). Presence of itch and triggering factors were more common among Dutch children (80 % vs. 14. 2 % and 33. 3 % vs. 7. 4 %, respectively). However, both groups shared similar triggering factors like stress and infections. Other similarities included mean age at presentation (NL group 11. 3 years; SG group 14. 1 years) and gender ratio (NL group, M/F 1 : 1. 1; SG group, M/F 1 : 1. 4). Plaque psoriasis was the most common type in both cohorts while <b>guttate</b> and pustular <b>psoriasis</b> were rare. In both groups, the head, followed by the limbs, was the most common site involved. Similar proportions of children in both countries had nail involvement and psoriatic arthritis was rare.

40|$|Retinoids are {{the most}} widely used agents for {{systemic}} treatment of psoriasis; as structural and functional analogs of vitamin A, they are involved in the regulation of several biologic functions. Acitretin is the oral retinoid currently used, alone or in combination with other treatments, for plaque type, erythrodermic, and pustular psoriasis. Due to its high teratogenic effect, therapeutic contraception is required for women taking the drug. Narrowband ultraviolet B (nbUVB, 311 +/- 2 nm) is effective for <b>guttate</b> and plaque-type <b>psoriasis.</b> At the Molecular level, UV light acts (1) directly (type I reaction) inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers that, in turn, cause a transient cellular growth arrest, and (2) indirectly (type 11 reaction) through the generation of reactive oxygen species that act on key molecules such as lipids (in particular lipid membranes), proteins, and nucleic acids. Several Studies show that UV rays call cause a transient decrease ill DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. These events are accompanied by a temporary normalization of cell kinetics of psoriatic keratinocytes. Phototherapy is carried out 3 times a week alone or in combination with topical treatments and/or acitretin. Several studies have confirmed that oral retinoids together with nbUVB (ReUVB) reduce the recovery time and also the doses of both acitretin and nbUVB. The regimen is carried out treating the patient with acitretin alone (0. 5 mg/kg bw) for 2 weeks, then the dose of acitretin is reduced to 0. 3 mg/kg bw, and the nbUVB is added 3 times a week until complete resolution of disease.
