40|$|The {{conventional}} {{pipeline system}} is facing seviour problems due to improper synchronization of clock pulses. The data transfer rates most importantly {{depend on the}} effective clock management. <b>In</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> systems <b>the</b> propagation of information mainly controlled {{on the basis of}} clock pulses. This is a universal problem <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> systems mostly called jitter or skew. <b>In</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> systems <b>the</b> clock skew decreases the performance of <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> systems. Here a new system is implemented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of the clock to remove or reduce the clock skew...|$|R
5|$|Today, it {{is often}} {{preferred}} to carry out filtering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> domain where complex algorithms are much easier to implement, but analogue filters do still find applications, especially for low-order simple filtering tasks and are often still the norm at higher frequencies where digital technology is still impractical, or at least, less cost effective. Wherever possible, and especially at low frequencies, analogue filters are now implemented in a filter topology which is active {{in order to avoid}} the wound components (i.e. inductors, transformers, etc.) required by passive topology.|$|E
