The Hock process essentially converts high value propylene to low value acetone. The proposed process design, detailed in this report, provides an alternative reaction pathway that utilizes a direct synthesis from benzene, as developed at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in New Delhi, India. The endorsed proposal is in accordance with US Patent 8, 772, 552 B 2, that describes the production of phenol via <b>vapor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>oxidation</b> of benzene over a copper chromium oxide catalyst.

Downstream separation removes non-condensable species, recycles up to 98 % of the unreacted benzene, and purifies phenol to design specifications.

40|$|International audiencePhase {{transition}} is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, science and technology. In general, the phase separation from a homogeneous phase {{depends on the}} depth of the temperature quench into the two-phase region. Earth’s gravity masks the details of phase separation phenomena, which is why experiments were performed under weightlessness. Under such conditions, the pure fluid sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) near its critical point also benefits from the universality of phase separation behavior and critical slowing down of dynamics. Initially, the fluid was slightly below its critical temperature with the liquid matrix separated from the <b>vapor</b> <b>phase.</b> A 0. 2 mK temperature quench further cooled down the fluid and produced a double phase separation with liquid droplets <b>inside</b> the <b>vapor</b> <b>phase</b> and <b>vapor</b> bubbles <b>inside</b> the liquid matrix, respectively. The liquid droplets and the vapor bubbles respective distributions were well fitted by a lognormal function. The evolution of discrete bins of different radii allowed the derivation of the transition rates for coalescence processes. Based on the largest transition rates, two main coalescence mechanisms were identified: (1) asymmetric coalescences between one small droplet of about 20 μ m and a wide range of larger droplets; and (2) symmetric coalescences between droplets of large and similar radii. Both mechanisms lead to a continuous decline of the fraction of small radii droplets and an increase in the fraction of the large radii droplets. Similar coalescence mechanisms were observed for vapor bubbles.

Bismuth molybdate supported on zirconium oxide, an n-type catalyst was used. The effect of various process variables, namely the feed ratio of oxygen to 2 -methylpropene, reaction temperature, and the reciprocal of space velocity on the conversion of olefin and the product distribution {{was investigated}}. It was observed that {{an increase in the}} conversion of 2 -methylpropene was always accompanied with a decrease in the selectivity. In most cases the selectivity for methacrolein increased with the increasing feed ratio of oxygen to 2 -methyl-propene (0. 6 to 2. 0). Relatively lower temperature was found to favor the selectivity of methacrolein. Though the conversion of 2 -methylpropene, the yield of methacrolein and carbon dioxide increased rapidly at longer contact time, it was hardly affected in the range of shorter contact time. Out of the several models proposed for the oxidation of 2 -methylpropene over bismuth molybdate catalyst. The most suitable one appear to be the one in which the rate determining step is the surface reaction between adsorbed olefin and oxygen on different active sites, the rate of reaction can expressed by the equation r=KSKHPH 1 +KHPH+KMPM ˙KOPO 1 +KOPO where KS, KH, KO and KM are temperature dependent constants...|$|R

Two areas of concern relate to the 'durability' of phosphate deposited films and {{to the ability of}} the lubricating system to "self-recover" when <b>vapor</b> <b>phase</b> lubricated with an organo phosphorous compound.

The effect of various process variables, namely the weight ratio of halogen additive to methane, the feed ratio of air to methane, reaction temperature and the reciprocal of space velocity, on the conversion of methane and the product distribution was determined. The products and reactants were analysed by gas chromatography. It was observed that {{in the presence of}} halogen compounds, though the overall conversion of methane decreased, the selectivity of the catalyst for formaldehyde formation significantly increased. The effect of different halogen compounds are compared and discussed. Methylene chloride, which affected in producing relatively high yields of formaldehyde, was used as a modifier for the detailed kinetic study of methane oxidation reaction. The weight ratio of modifier additive to methane in the feed mixture at a given temperature was found to be an important variable in the selectivity of the catalyst. It is suggested that the charged methane and oxygen are selectively adsorbed on the catalyst surface and that the partial oxidation of methane is a p-type reaction and its further oxidation to carbon dioxide is an n-type reaction under the reaction conditions. The results indicate that the promotional effect of the modifier, in the sense of increasing the catalyst selectivity, is mainly due to its successfully suppressing further oxidation of aldehyde to undesired products. The active phase of the catalyst in selective oxidation of methane was found to be palladium oxide. Among the several mechanisms proposed for the oxidation of methane over chlorine modified palladium catalyst, the experimental data were found to be in best correlation with a mechanism involving the surface reaction between charged adsorbed methane and oxygen with surface reaction being the rate controlling step.
