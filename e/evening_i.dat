25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy <b>evening</b> <b>I</b> made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

Some of the bathhouses in St. Petersburg at the time became known as friendly to gay men and provided [...] "attendants", who might provide sexual services for a fee. In his diary, Kuzmin writes of one bathhouse visit: the <b>evening</b> <b>I</b> had the urge to go to a bathhouse simply to be stylish, for the fun of it, for cleanliness.|$|E
500|$|Fleming wrote Diamonds Are Forever at his Goldeneye {{estate in}} Jamaica in January and February 1955. He {{followed}} his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine, {{in which he}} said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] On completion Fleming wrote to his friend Hilary Bray: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} to Alfred Russel Wallace dated 23 February 1867 Charles Darwin wrote [...] "On Monday <b>evening</b> <b>I</b> called on Bates & put a {{difficulty}} before him, which he could not answer, & as on some former similar occasion, his first suggestion was, 'you had better ask Wallace'. My difficulty is, why are caterpillars sometimes so beautifully & artistically coloured?" [...] Darwin was puzzled because his theory of sexual selection (where females choose their mates based on how attractive they are) could not apply to caterpillars since they are immature and hence not sexually active.|$|E
500|$|In May 1963 Fleming wrote a {{piece for}} Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] Benson identified what he described as the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E
500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} mentioned to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." ...|$|E

500|$|Once Fleming and {{his wife}} arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] As he had done with Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that [...] "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On a trip to the US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS Queen Elizabeth to correct the proofs of the novel.|$|E
500|$|In June 1911 Heseltine {{learned that}} Thomas Beecham was {{to conduct an}} all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the {{composer}} would be present, and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine {{was introduced to the}} composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: [...] "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music". He told his mother that [...] "Friday evening was the most perfectly happy <b>evening</b> <b>I</b> have ever spent, and I shall never forget it". Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.|$|E
500|$|While {{he appears}} to have been {{attracted}} to young women throughout his life, and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice, there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind. He recorded in his diary in 1830 that [...] "it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc". He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that [...] "it fills up a couple of hours in the <b>evening,</b> <b>I</b> should be at a loss how else to employ".|$|E

500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the <b>Evening,</b> <b>I</b> can be alone at my Office, and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
500|$|In June 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming began a {{collaboration}} with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, Commander Jamaica, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. [...] When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea {{as the basis for}} Dr. No. By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953—Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever. A fifth, From Russia, with Love, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By the time he returned to London in late February, he had completed a 206-page first draft, which he initially titled The Wound Man.|$|E
500|$|The {{basis for}} Southey wishing {{to write an}} epic poem came from his private reading of {{literature}} while attending Westminster School as a boy. In particular, the subject was suggested by a school friend that {{claimed to be a}} descendant of Madoc's brother, Rhodri, and Southey began to write a prose version of the story in 1789. In 1794, the 20-year-old Southey was attempting to publish works to raise money to support himself and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in an expedition to America to establish a Pantisocracy, a democratic form of government that the two invented. One of the poems he sought to publish was Madoc, which was an epic that he started working on while at school but he never finished. Southey and Coleridge were able to complete the poem Joan of Arc by summer 1795 while Southey worked on Madoc. However, in his notebook he claimed on 22 February 1797. [...] "This morning I began the study of law, this <b>evening</b> <b>I</b> began Madoc." [...] During 1797, Southey had given up his ideas of Pantisocracy and was studying to become a lawyer. He spent the rest of his time working on other publications, such as a translating part of Jacques Necker's On the French Revolution. Southey continued to work on Madoc through 1798, and started his mornings by working on the poem.|$|E

500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the <b>evening.</b> <b>I</b> never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse is in a very bad way... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E
