500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked [...] "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" [...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4. The album was ranked at number 177 on Spins [...] "The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)" [...] list.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{drama of}} the day {{occurred}} after the practice session had ended. Inoue had spun and stalled his Footwork, which was being towed back to the pit lane by a recovery vehicle when it was struck from behind by the Renault Clio safety carwhich was being taken on quick demonstration laps of the circuit {{in the hands of}} rally driver Jean Ragnotti, with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's press delegate as passengerin the middle of the Piscine complex. The impact was sufficient to overturn the Footwork and render it a write-off: the FA16 sustained severe rear-end damage to the engine and gearbox, whilst the tow rope, attached to the car's crash structure behind the driver's head, pulled the roll hoop from the chassis. Inoue, who still sitting in the cockpit with his helmet on but his seatbelts unfastened, sustained two impacts to the head, the severity of which was shown by the fact that a chunk had been taken out of his helmet. He was taken to The Princess Grace Hospital Centre for a brain scan and, although he was found to have sustained only a slight concussion, was not permitted {{to take part in the}} afternoon qualifying session as a precaution. The Footwork team principal, Jackie Oliver, was infuriated by the incident, and wrote an official letter of complaint to the Automobile Club de Monaco, the body responsible for organising the event. He said that Inoue would have been killed had he not been wearing his helmet, and questioned the organisation of the ACM and Ragnotti's attitude: [...] "Why was Ragnotti out there? It's just lack of discipline. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> had accomplished a couple of laps before at a million miles an hour with handbrake turns at the Loews hairpin. What was the purpose of him doing it? Was it to give officials a thrill?" [...] The stewards tacitly acknowledged that the incident was not Inoue's fault by authorising him to use the team's spare car for qualifying, but this was rendered academic by his non-participation in the session.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Indeed,' says another, <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>he</b> had quitted Mrs----, {{because she}} had not fortune enough for him, and that he courted another certain lady, whom we all know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} {{comes and}} goes a good deal," [...] said Spouter. [...] "He was away several hours last night and the night before. And <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he's</b> going away to-morrow afternoon again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a letter this morning, from which <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> has acquitted you of the charge he brought against you, and offers to make such discoveries as will render the {{settlement}} of Sir Arthur's affairs a more easy task than we apprehended--So writes the Sheriff; and adds, that he has given some private information of importance to Government, in consideration of which, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> will {{be sent back to}} play the knave in his own country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must bear}} in mind that we have a {{valuable}} secret, and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> lives somewhere in the country we are going through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a pity,' I remarked, 'your brother {{should have}} {{neighbours}} {{of such a}} description, especially as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> is at some variance with them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the fact}} is, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he's</b> rather a crusty, funny old fellow. The {{agencies}} won't send him anyone any more. He speaks his mind very openly, and men don't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{forgotten}} their talk. A little <b>I</b> <b>understood.</b> <b>He</b> spoke without any {{respect of the}} white ruler in Batavia, and of protection, {{and said he had}} been wronged; he said that several times. More <b>I</b> did not <b>understand.</b> Listen! Again <b>he</b> speaks!" ...|$|R
60|$|By persuading {{him that}} <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> what <b>he</b> meant, <b>I</b> rose in his estimation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gad, I {{believe it}} is quite a {{different}} sort of a thing. I do not know what it is exactly; but <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> is crotchetty." ...|$|E
60|$|HON. J. O. MORTON, Joliet, Ill.: William Chumasero is {{proposed}} for provost-marshal of your district. What think you of it? <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> {{is a good}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was at the}} hotel," [...] Deering replied. [...] "The {{morning before}} I got there a police {{sergeant}} arrived. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> was curious about your excursion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{certainly}} makes you like him," [...] sighed Mrs. Pasmer. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>he</b> can't make {{people like him}} without family or money; and <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> that <b>he's</b> one of those 'nouveaux riches' who are giving Harvard such a reputation for extravagance nowadays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{goes with}} the house, and when we let the grazing I stipulated that no snares should be laid, but there was some mistake and the tenant claimed the rabbits. We said he could shoot them, and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he's</b> disputing with the agent. But where are you going?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't. You see, I {{stayed behind}} in Madeira while the Palestrina came on, and when I got here Ormsgill had gone. Desmond {{told me about}} him. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>he</b> was to marry {{somebody}} when he had done his errand, though, if he knew, Desmond never mentioned who she was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{school is}} {{patterned}} after West Point, as was Putnam Hall, and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> has a West Point officer there to instruct the cadets in military tactics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He does; but, {{to begin}} with, I'd {{like to know}} how much he lost before he staked the check. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> {{increased}} the original stakes during the game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} him. He {{gave me his}} vote. I must call to thank him. He seems a very bright {{pleasant}} little fellow. And <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> is a naturalist." ...|$|E
60|$|It was Darius who spoke, {{and when}} this had been said <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> that <b>he</b> was running toward the stairway.|$|R

6000|$|Leland shrugged a weary shoulder. [...] "The usual thing," [...] he said. [...] "The {{implement}} {{man wants}} his money now, though <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to}} wait until harvest. The fellow in Winnipeg can't sell the horses. There's {{a letter from the}} bank, too. If I purpose drawing on them further, they'd like something as security. The rest are unpleasantly big accounts from the stores." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{right around}} the corner of Broad Street, not five minutes, walk. He hired the place from the first, and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> and another man are already doing {{business}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yet in his council, as <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> <b>he</b> did utter bitter things against us, putting affronts {{upon the}} King, and making {{light of his}} just claims upon the fealty of his nobility?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cyril Jernyngham {{seems to}} have taken the consequences," [...] Muriel pointed out. [...] "Isn't there {{something}} to be said for the person who does so uncomplainingly? <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> never recanted or asked for help." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>he</b> {{would have}} me do the same, {{and walked slowly}} along the shore keeping within the line of foliage, and {{thinking}} meanwhile {{that as soon as}} this task had been finished, if indeed it ever was, we might with good cause seek for food from some plantation nearby, for my stomach was crying out loudly {{that it was time to}} break fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{over here}} {{as a sort of}} general mischief-maker!" [...] Fischer exclaimed fiercely. [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>he</b> has been down in----?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>understood</b> that <b>he</b> was afraid. Answering him by an {{inclination}} of {{the head}} (I hate a coward!) I walked silently to the door.|$|R
60|$|RICARDOS. For my daughter's {{settlement}} {{one thousand}} pounds. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> {{did not wish}} to give a cheque because of his marriage. So I did not think anything about it being in notes, you see.|$|E
