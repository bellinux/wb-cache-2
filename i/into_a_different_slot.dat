30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} the proposed MSA process in detail. First, we assume that each node follows global slot synchronization. Thus, all nodes know the starting time of each frame. Before {{the description of the}} proposed MSA process, we first introduce the delay effect caused by an allocation sequence of TDMA slots and show that the allocation sequence in a flow is critical for reducing the multihop packet transmission delay in an environment where a node allocates <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>slot</b> to each flow in a link.|$|R

50|$|Three {{episodes of}} the show were aired on SBS, but was then pulled due to {{programming}} issues. The show was then aired three months later at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> time <b>slot</b> of 9pm Thursdays and finally moved again to 8:30pm. The show received mostly positive reviews but was not renewed for a second season.|$|R

Madden drove himself to a local hospital after feeling nauseated, and had the heart procedure done a day after checking in. He resumed his radio show three days later, although in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> time <b>slot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shooting Kid (...) is {{a variety}} show {{where a group}} of kids train and {{practice}} their soccer skills to compete with other mini-leagues. It is still airing, however at <b>a</b> <b>different</b> time <b>slot</b> and is no longer a part of Happy Sunday. This program now airs on the KBS N Sports channel. It is into its fourth season with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> cast.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Phase II {{involves}} three steps for slot allocation: an initial frame length synchronization (IFLS) process, a multihop slot allocation (MSA) process, and a global frame length synchronization (GFLS). First, IFLS determines the initial frame length Linit, {{which can be}} used initially for slot allocation in the network. Second, the MSA process allocates <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>slot</b> to each flow in a link to eliminate the secondary queuing delay. For example, in Figure 1, two flows exist between Node R 1 and Node R 2. Therefore, the proposed scheme allocates two <b>different</b> <b>slots</b> for two flows in the Node R 1 -to-R 2 link. Although such a slot allocation can eliminate the secondary queuing delay, it results in a large frame length. In such a case, {{it is important to consider}} the order of the slots allocated on a path. Therefore, we show the delay effect by an allocation order as well as demonstrate the manner in which slots should be allocated sequentially in a flow after the routing path is established.|$|R

5000|$|The Serial Pro was a {{multifunction}} {{serial interface}} and clock/calendar card from Applied Engineering. By combining {{the functions of}} two cards into one, the Serial Pro freed up an extra slot for those with highly populated machines. This card was unique {{in the sense that}} it did not use [...] "Phantom Slots" [...] to achieve this functionality. Previous multifunction cards required that a secondary function be [...] "mapped" [...] to <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>slot</b> in the computer's memory, rendering that slot unusable. The card was capable of a 12&#8209; and 24&#8209;hour clock format, was both ProDOS and DOS 3.3 compatible, and had on-screen time and date setting built into its ROM, eliminating the need to run a program in order to set the time. The battery was a GE DataSentry rechargeable Ni-cad battery which had a lifespan rating of 20 years. The card retailed for $139 during the late 1980s.|$|R

30|$|In {{the future}} studies, first, we intent {{to extend the}} {{proposed}} scheduling scheme to an autonomous environment where either new nodes can efficiently assign time slots or existing nodes can release their slots on a path in a distributed manner. Second, the proposed scheme has the characteristics that each node allocates <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>slot</b> to each flow in a link. Therefore, it needs lots of slots; however, the distance- 2 coloring leads to slightly smaller frame length because each node allocates one common slot for multiple flows in a link. This study have considered a situation wherein each node has only one flow. However, it is somewhat unrealistic. If two flows are considered per node, the frame length of the proposed scheme is up to two times greater than that when considering one flow per node. Accordingly, we are also interested in reducing the frame size and in concurrently reducing the network load by using conventional network coding (NC) schemes.|$|R
