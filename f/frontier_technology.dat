30|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, China has {{experienced}} an industrial productivity revolution mainly driven by the FTP. The FTP promoted the fast growth of industrial productivity on one hand and broadened the TE gap on the other hand, which means that the sustainable development of the economy and the industrial productivity revolution can be driven by both making industrial <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress and increasing industrial average efficiency. From the policy aspect, China’s industrial development must place emphasis on enforcing competition, narrowing the efficiency gap between enterprises and keeping the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progressing by emulating, learning from, catching up with, helping each other, {{and at the same time}} absorbing advanced technology, and keeping the <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progressing. In addition, it is necessary to further the market-orient economy reform, keeping the factor of labor and capital adjustable and increase the AE and SE of industrial economy on the micro level.|$|E
40|$|The report finds clear {{evidence}} of the potential of <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> to contribute to social, economic and political development gains {{in a number of}} ways, by: • Driving innovations in business models, products and processes that provide new goods and services to ‘bottom of the pyramid’ consumers; • Providing the means by which to make better use of existing underutilised household and productive assets; • Catalysing increases in demand, nationally and internationally, which create new industries and markets, leading to macro- and microeconomic growth; and • Changing demand for labour and capital, leading to direct job creation and transformation of the workforce. For all of the potential upsides, potential downsides must also be considered. While it will largely be the private sector that will drive deployment of these technologies, the public sector through national regulation, as well as development financing, will have a major role in mediating the pace and direction of technological change, both to achieve development objectives, and to protect potential losers. As new technologies and digital business models reshape economies and disrupt incumbencies, interest has surged in the potential of novel <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> to also contribute to positive changes in international development and humanitarian contexts. Widespread adoption of new technologies is acknowledged as centrally important to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. But while <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> can rapidly address large-scale economic, social or political challenges, they can also involve the displacement of existing technologies and carry considerable uncertainty and risk. Although there have been significant wins bringing the benefits of new technologies to poor consumers through examples such as mobile money or off-grid solar energy, there are many other areas where the applications may not yet have been developed into viable market solutions, or where opportunities have not yet been taken up in development practice...|$|R
40|$|We use 29 OECD {{countries}} data spanning over 1960 - 2000 {{to study}} the growth strategy when countries {{are close to the}} <b>technology</b> <b>frontier.</b> Relying on a semi-parametric generalized additive model, we estimate labor productivity equations. We find that the number of agents enrolled in higher education is a determinant of growth. Moreover, when a country is sufficiently near the <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> thanks to an increasing R&D expenditure, it becomes optimal to invest in fundamental research, since after a short period of efficiency, business R&D can no longer ensure the transition toward the <b>technology</b> <b>frontier,</b> while higher education presents the opposite shape.

30|$|The {{stochastic}} frontier {{production model}} was originally developed by [1, 11], and soon became popular in econometrics. In this model, {{we assume that}} some non-price factors such as organizing, management or institutional factors {{could lead to the}} loss of efficiency during the production process, and thus cannot reach the optimal <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> level. Nishimizu and Page [12] suggested decomposing TFP into the change of <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and the change of relative <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> efficiency. Later on, lots of research has been done using this method to analyze the improvement in TFP. Bauer [2] used the data on the U.S. airline industry to decompose the TFP growth into the change in <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress, the change in technology efficiency relative to the frontier, and the improvement in scale economy. This approach was also applied to analysis on the TFP and <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manufacturing industry [3]. Additionally, with the above model, decomposition of TFP of the Korean manufacturing industries and agriculture in all the provinces in China were studied [6 – 8], and the technical efficiency (TE) of the industrial sector of China were inspect [15, 16]. Furtherly, the constant-scale-return non-parameter model was introduced in decomposing TFP growth rate by the DEA-Malmquist index method, using province data of China [4], and the effects of ownership on the productivity of China’s manufacturing sector were interpreted based on the data of 1, 036 super-sized industrial enterprises in 1993 [13]. Besides, Wu [14] employed the panel data of 27 provinces during 1981 – 1995, and studied the sustainable development problem of China through the decomposition of productivity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceCan {{a country}} grow faster by saving more? The paper {{addresses}} this question both theoretically and empirically.

In such a country, domestic savings matters for innovation, and therefore growth, because it enables the local entrepreneur to put equity into this cooperative venture, which mitigates an agency problem that would otherwise deter the foreign investor from participating. In rich countries, domestic entrepreneurs are already familiar with <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> and therefore do not need to attract foreign investment to innovate, so domestic savings does not matter for growth. A cross-country regression shows that lagged savings is positively associated with productivity growth in poor countries but not in rich countries...|$|E

30|$|The {{literature}} that uses macro data in TFP study of Chinese economy is numerous.

By following the analyzing method brought forward by Kumbhakar and Lovell [10], the increase in TFP is decomposed into four parts in the present work,: including <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> progress, change in relative <b>frontier</b> <b>technology</b> efficiency, elevation on resources allocation efficiency and improvement on scale efficiency.|$|E

40|$|University-industry alliances {{have long}} been pursued by public funded {{programs}} hoping to boost innovation spillovers in a geographical or cognitive area of research-strength by universities. However, {{there is still a}} lack of industry-university cooperation in many fields {{while at the same time}} the benefits of universities to their regions' knowledge intensity is firmly advocated (Acs 2004, Martinez-Fernandez & Leevers 2004, Martinez-Fernandez 2004)). The issue is not limited to the dissemination of knowledge, a traditional role of universities, but to introducing change into the region's innovation system through activities that increase industry competitive advantage. Results from a project conducted in South-West Sydney from 2003 to 2005 shows that active industry engagement by Universities offering specific expertise in <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> has a positive effect in university-industry cooperation if compared with other technologies well established in the private sector. The project results also show that the role of Universities as active facilitators of industry engagement in <b>frontier</b> <b>technologies</b> is a critical element in the regional/local innovation system where the university operates. The paper discusses first the context of the emergence of the UWS Nanotechnology Network as a sophisticated knowledge intensive service activity led by the University. Secondly the paper discusses the particular case of nanotechnology as a science in an early path and the role of universities at this particular stage. Thirdly, the paper discusses the use and barriers of firms to nanotechnology applications and the role played by UWS during the duration of the project.
