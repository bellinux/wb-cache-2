This is the secret that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|E
500|$|On June 3, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs {{said during}} his morning press briefing, [...] "I hope that {{baseball}} awards a perfect game to that pitcher", joking that the White House was [...] "going {{to work on}} an executive order" [...] to that effect. He elaborated, [...] "To watch an umpire take responsibility and to watch a pitcher <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there—I think that gives a lot of heart (...) I think it's tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that {{they made a mistake}} and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake. I think that's a good lesson in baseball." [...] Michigan state Governor Jennifer Granholm also issued a gubernatorial proclamation stating, in part, [...] "I, Jennifer M. Granholm, {{governor of the state of}} Michigan, do hereby declare Armando Galarraga to have pitched a perfect game." ...|$|E
500|$|After his {{victories}} at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, {{he returned}} to Celtic Park, {{the home of the}} Irish American Athletic Club, in Queens, New York (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the Amateur Athletic Union's All-Around Championship. Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club. Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, [...] "Jim, my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete." [...] He told a reporter from New York World, [...] "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways. Even when I was in my prime, I could not <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> today." ...|$|E

500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E
500|$|The {{third round}} draw for the FA Cup paired Argyle with Newcastle United, which left {{assistant}} manager John Carver with mixed emotions. Neither side could break the deadlock {{in a competitive}} contest at Home Park. Argyle striker Rory Fallon forced a good save from Tim Krul before the visitors had chances of their own, the majority of which went to Fabrice Pancrate. Newcastle looked likely {{to win the game}} late on but were denied by goalkeeper Romain Larrieu, who tipped a looping volley from Nicky Butt over the crossbar. The match saw the return of Chris Barker to the Argyle defence after a lengthy spell on the sidelines because of injury, and manager Paul Mariner was full of praise for his performance. [...] "For him to come and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> against such a high powered, attacking team as Newcastle and playing 90 plus minutes was pretty remarkable. He's a very strong character and very experienced." [...] The replay at St James' Park was Argyle's next match due to the wintry weather, and they were on the wrong end of a 3–0 scoreline. Newcastle striker Peter Løvenkrands gave the home side a two-goal lead at half-time and completed his hat-trick after 72 minutes. [...] "His timing of his runs is pretty special and for the first goal, his finish was fantastic," [...] said Mariner. The match on Tyneside was to be the last in an Argyle shirt for Cillian Sheridan who returned to Celtic in Scotland the next day when his loan spell with the club finished, having made 13 appearances, scoring no goals.|$|E
500|$|With {{his wife}} {{administering}} the campaign organization, Sunday {{was free to}} <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran {{from one end of}} the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote, [...] "Many of the things said and done bordered upon things prohibited in decent society. The sermon on amusements was preached three times, to mixed audience of men and women, boys and girls. If the sermons to women had been preached to married women, if the sermons to men had been preached to mature men, if the sermon on amusements had been preached to grown folks, there might have been an excuse for them, and perhaps good from them. But an experienced newspaper reporter told me that the sermon on amusements was 'the rawest thing ever put over in Syracuse.' I can not, must not, quote from this sermon...", [...] "fainted under that awful definition;", [...] "if you do not 'hit the trail' then watch out for the fireworks"... says that Mr. Sunday's sermon on the sex question was raw and disgusting. He also heard the famous sermons on amusements and booze. [...] says that all in all they were the ugliest, nastiest, most disgusting addresses he ever listened to from a religious platform or a preacher of religion. He saw people carried out who had fainted under that awful definition of sensuality and depravity.|$|E

McKagan later recalled, [...] "I didn't have any foresight that the guy was going to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I could tell he was bummed out, and I'd been that way before...

"Short and rotund," [...] said Dick Brittenden, [...] "he wore {{an ample}} white moustache, {{but as a}} wicket-keeper he was {{incredibly}} quick, so quick {{that there were some}} who said he could not <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> and do it legally. A left-hander and a willing hitter, he was always given a tremendous reception when he came out to bat." [...] He often made useful runs in the lower order. In 1908-09 against Otago, after Canterbury had lost their first nine wickets for 108, he came in at number 11 and put on 98 for the last wicket with Sydney Orchard.|$|E

We knew the place was a free-fire zone and that Suharto was given the green light by the United States to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> We sent the Indonesian generals everything {{that you need to}} fight a major war against somebody who doesn't have any guns. We sent them rifles, ammunition, mortars, grenades, food, helicopters. You name it; they got it. ... None of that got out in the media. No one gave a damn. It is something that I will be forever ashamed of. The only justification I ever heard for what we were doing was the concern that East Timor {{was on the verge of}} being accepted as a new member of the United Nations and there was a chance that the country was going to be either leftist or neutralist and not likely to vote [...] at the UN.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 November 1532, therefore, the Cardinal de Tournon and Cardinal Gabriel de Gramont set off as Ambassadors to the Holy See; {{they had}} a joint commission. [...] On 21 November, it was {{reported}} that they had left Paris. It was {{at the beginning of the}} visit to Rome, on 13 January 1533, that Tournon first took his seat in Consistory. Pope Clement, who was caught between the Emperor and the King of France, was in no hurry to make up his mind either about the marriage or about a visit to France. In the meantime, Cardinal de Tournon was making proposals in Consistory against the Lutherans in France. [...] Tournon was still attending Consistory on 13 August, or rather, diplomatically absenting himself whenever the English matter came up for discussion. [...] On 17 August, he reported that the Pope had said that the King of England had forced him to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> On 27 September, he wrote to the King from Pisa, informing him that the Pope had personally told him that he was willing to accommodate the desires of the French king to the extent possible, but that the matter of the divorce of Henry VIII was a matter for Consistory, and that the cardinals were against it. [...] The culmination of these efforts was the papal visit to Marseille in October 1533, and the marriage of Henri of France and Catherine de' Medici on 28 October 1533. [...] During the visit, on 7 November, four new French cardinals were created. [...] The Pope met with King Francis and (separately) with the Emperor Charles—but not with Henry VIII, who had secretly married Anne Boleyn on 22 November 1532, and publicly married her on 25 January 1533.|$|E
