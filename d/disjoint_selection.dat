In joint ranking feature selection (JRFS), one of two approaches we present, conventional univariate feature-selection strategies are used (ANOVA and searchlight) {{based on data from}} both the source dataset (S) and on a partition of the target dataset (T 1). The other approach (<b>disjoint</b> feature <b>selection</b> (DJFS)) uses the target dataset partition only (T 1). In both variants, we assume spatial equivalence across sessions, and training of our linear models is carried out using only the source data S, and testing using the held-out target data T 2. The voxels identified during feature selection are akin to a region of interest, and the subset which is subsequently used by the trained linear classifiers are distributed regions with shared local coding patterns across S and T.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{emissivity}} maps in {{the infrared}} can contribute to explore Venus’ geology. Nightside radiance spectra at Themis Regio acquired by the IR mapping channel of the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS-M-IR) aboard Venus EXpress (VEX) are used to derive emissivity data from the three accessible spectral surface windows at 1. 02, 1. 10, and 1. 18 μm. The measured spectra are simulated by applying a full radiative transfer model. Neglecting geologic activity, a multi-spectrum retrieval algorithm is utilized to determine the emissivity maps of the surface target as parameter vectors that are common to many spectrally resolved images that cover this target. Absolute emissivity values are difficult to obtain due to strong interferences from other parameters. The true emissivity mean of the target cannot be retrieved, nor can the emissivity mean of a retrieved map be strictly preset. The retrieved map can exhibit trends with latitude and topography that are probably artificial. Once the trends have been removed in a post-processing step, it can be observed that {{the magnitude of the}} resulting spatial emissivity fluctuations around their mean value increases with increasing mean value. A linear transformation is applied that converts the de-trended map to exhibit a defined emissivity mean value called reference emissivity, here 0. 5, yielding the ‘renormalized emissivity map’ with accordingly transformed fluctuations. It is verified that renormalized emissivity maps are largely independent of the emissivity mean before renormalization, of modifications to interfering atmospheric, surface, and instrumental parameters, and of selected details of the retrieval pipeline and data calibration and preprocessing. Extremely large emissivity retrieval errors due to imperfect or unconsidered forward model parameters are effectively avoided. If the absolute emissivity at a given bin of the target were known, the absolute emissivity map of the entire target could be computed according to the mentioned transformation, assuming absent true trends with latitude and topography. Until then, the renormalized emissivities are interpreted as spatial variations relative to the reference emissivity. They represent an important step toward the retrieval of absolute emissivities. Renormalized emissivity maps of Themis Regio at the three surface windows are determined from 64 measurement repetitions. Retrieval errors are estimated by a statistical evaluation of maps derived from various <b>disjoint</b> <b>selections</b> of spectra and using different assumptions on the interfering parameters. Double standard deviation errors for the three surface windows amount to 3...|$|R

However, {{this is not true}} when deploying FD-communication in a large-scale setup due to the induced mutual interference. Therefore, a large-scale study is necessary to draw legitimate conclusions about gains associated with FD-communication. This paper studies the FD operation for underlay device-to-device (D 2 D) communication sharing the uplink resources in cellular networks. We propose a <b>disjoint</b> fine-tuned <b>selection</b> criterion for the D 2 D and FD modes of operation. Then, we develop a tractable analytical paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, to calculate the outage probability and rate for cellular and D 2 D users. The results reveal that even in the case of perfect SIC, due to the increased interference injected to the network by FD-D 2 D communication, having all proximity UEs transmit in FD-D 2 D is not beneficial for the network. However, if the system parameters are carefully tuned, non-trivial network spectral-efficiency gains (64 % shown) can be harvested. We also investigate the effects of imperfect SIC and D 2 D-link distance distribution on the harvested FD gains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{increase}} the Internet's reliability {{and to have}} greater control over traffic transmission, reliable path selection is important and Multipath routing is promising technique {{that are used in}} the communication networks. Finding reliable end-end paths and backup can increase network performance. So, using proper decision metrics and algorithm should be used to paths and backup selection phase in these networks. For this goal, in this paper selecting a more reliable multi disjoint paths is addressed as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and availability factor is defined and calculated based on network histories. For decision algorithm, a new fuzzy evaluation method is proposed to rank these multi <b>disjoint</b> paths <b>selection</b> algorithms and it is compared with bandwidth based, TOPSIS, FuzzyTOPSIS and AHP methods as candidate techniques to select more appropriate global disjoint paths in the IP/MPLS networks with packet loss, delay and availability parameters as decision making metrics. The proposed method combines fuzzy theory and Copeland method to evaluate the rank of each proposed method base on bandwidth, delay and new defined availability metric of selected end to end paths. Simulation results show that this method selects more reliable backup paths with better bandwidth in compared with others and can be used to path selection in IP/MPLS networks...|$|R

For two players, we show that <b>disjoint</b> envy-free piece <b>selections</b> may not exist for two cakes cut into two pieces each, and they may not exist for three cakes cut into three pieces each. However, there do exist such divisions for two cakes cut into three pieces each, and for three cakes cut into four pieces each. The resulting allocations of pieces to players are Pareto-optimal with respect to the division. We use a generalization of Sperner’s lemma on the polytope of divisions to locate solutions to our generalized cake-cutting problem...|$|R

In {{this thesis}} graph theoretic {{techniques}} are adopted {{for addressing the}} network survivability issue of <b>disjoint</b> paths <b>selection.</b> The evaluation was conducted after {{the implementation of a}} solver that produces a solution of the problem after successive application of two algorithms on any given topology, the algorithm of Louca et al [19] and Castanon’s [8]. The first algorithm transforms any networks into a trellis graph and the second exploits the special structure of the trellis graph and solves for the k-best paths using the minimum cost network flow (MCNF) algorithm. The transformation and evaluation of the K-best paths solution is illustrated for a number of topologies through the graphical user interface adapted from [37]. It is also contrasted with the k-successive approximation methods, which cannot guarantee the selection of the K-best paths, due to the successive removal of shortest paths at each iteration. Furthermore, the performance of the algorithm and its time complexity are investigated and also compared with Surballe’s Disjoint Pair Algorithm [31]. Even though the trellis transformations algorithm can find all possible disjoint paths {{in the vast majority of}} cases, pathological situations where the algorithm may fail is also identified in the thesis, analysed, and a solution is provided and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Topological {{changes in}} mobile ad hoc {{networks}} frequently render routing paths unusable. Such recurrent path failures have detrimental {{effects on the}} network ability to support QoS-driven services. A promising technique for addressing this problem is to use multiple redundant paths between the source and the destination. However, while multipath routing algorithms can tolerate network failures well, their failure resilience only holds if the paths are selected judiciously. In particular, the correlation between the failures of the paths in a redundant path set should be as small as possible. However, selecting an optimal path set is an NPcomplete problem. Heuristic solutions proposed in the literature are either too complex to be performed in real-time, or too ineffective, or both. This paper proposes a multipath routing algorithm, called <b>Disjoint</b> Pathset <b>Selection</b> Protocol (DPSP), based on a novel heuristic that, in nearly linear time on average, picks a set of highly reliable paths. The convergence to a highly reliable path set is very fast, and the protocol provides flexibility in path selection and routing algorithm. Furthermore, DPSP is suitable for real-time execution, with nearly no message exchange overhead and with minimal additional storage requirements. This paper presents evidence that multipath routing can mask a substantial number of failures in the network compared to single path routing protocols, and that the selection of paths according to DPSP can be beneficial for mobile ad hoc networks, since it dramatically reduces the rate of route discoveries...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} the routing problem for multi-commodity survivable network ows, with splittable demands, and propose end-to-end path-based solutions where maximum link utilization is minimized, {{in order to}} improve resilience in existing telecommunication networks. We develop mixed integer programming models, and demonstrate that, when the <b>selection</b> of <b>disjoint</b> paths is part of the optimization problem (rather than when k-shortest paths are pre-selected, as in earlier works), maximum link utilization is reduced and the overall network also balances out. We find that three paths are usually enough to reap the benefits of a multipath approach. A reduction in maximum link utilization also provides a margin by which demand values can grow without causing congestion. We also prove that the <b>disjoint</b> multipath <b>selection</b> problem is NPcomplete, even for the case of one node-pair. This warrants a recourse to effi- cient solution methods within ILP (such as decomposition), and to matheuristics. Our literature survey of applications of heuristic techniques, and those combining heuristics with exact methods, shows a research gap, which we attempt to bridge through a novel heuristic algorithm. The heuristic works well and, in several cases, yields better solutions than ILP (in a given time limit), or provides solutions for problems where ILP could not even find one valid solution in the given time limit. We also study this problem within a decomposition methods framework: i. e., column generation. The pricing sub-problem is a mixed non-linear programme, for which we propose an ILP formulation. We find some lower bounds for missing dual values and use them as surrogates. We then show that the lower bounds are valid and present examples where the proposed pricing is applied to path generation for self-protecting multipath routing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Energy {{efficiency}} {{has become}} increasingly important to mobile systems on which wireless interfaces are among the largest power consumers. While existing physical layer power optimization mostly focuses on improving the transmission efficiency, our recent work has showed that wireless interfaces can spend most of its time and energy in very short idle periods between transmitting two packets [9]. In this work, we present a physical layer optimization method, drowsy transmission, which explicitly considers the power cost of such idle periods in physical layer power optimization through joint power control/rate selection and power management. We provide a control theoretical formulation of the optimization problem and present a dynamic programming based solution and its approximation that is close form and practical. We further offer an on-line learning technique to cope with unknown channel and traffic. Using a power model from a commercial wireless network interface card, we demonstrate that drowsy transmission can reduce the energy per bit by 70 % and 40 % in comparison to power control/rate selection-based optimization and optimization with <b>disjoint</b> power control/rate <b>selection</b> and power management, respectively. Moreover, the achieved energy per bit {{is very close to}} the theoretical lower bound. Our evaluation shows that the proposed on-line learning technique can assess the channel and approach the performance under pre-known channel in as short as 200 ms. We also show that our optimization introduces negligible packet delays. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} multi-hop ad hoc networks, {{the simultaneous}} {{use of multiple}} routes may degrade the performance of applications due to mutual interference of discovered paths, irrespective of whether paths are physically node disjoint or link <b>disjoint.</b> Therefore, the <b>selection</b> of noninterfering routes is the main criterion to be addressed when using multiple routes simultaneously. This thesis introduces a new metric to select multiple routes by reducing the effect of interference between paths {{as far as possible}} and also selecting the least congested paths. The proposed protocol is named Radio Disjoint Multipath (RDM). The concept of the RDM protocol which can be applied to both reactive and proactive ad hoc protocols is developed and feasibility of the protocol is proven by an implementation and also through an analytical model. Furthermore, this thesis introduces a novel mechanism to distribute multiple flows as well as packets of a single flow based on the properties of the discovered path, which is computed considering the Background Traffic Load (BTL) of each path and the mutual interference between paths. In summary, all investigations presented in this thesis can help to enhance the application performance in different kinds of wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), by discovering RDM routes and using them simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|The Internet has scaled massively {{over the}} past 15 years to extend to billions of users. These users {{increasingly}} require extensive applications and capabilities from the Internet, such as Quality of Service (QoS) optimized paths between end hosts. When default Internet paths may not meet their requirements adequately, {{there is a need}} to facilitate the discovery of such QoS optimized paths. Fortunately, even though the route offered by the Internet may not work (to the required level of performance), often there exist alternate routes that do work. When the direct Internet path between two Internet hosts for instance is sub-optimal (according to specific user defined criterion), there is a possibility that the direct paths of both to a third host may not be suffering from the same problem owing to path disjointness. Overlay Networks facilitate the discovery of such composite alternate paths through third party hosts. To discover such alternate paths, overlay hosts regularly monitor both Internet path quality and choose better alternate paths via other hosts. Such measurements are costly and pose scalability problems for large overlay networks. This thesis asserts and shows that these overheads could be lowered substantially if the network layer path information between overlay hosts could be obtained, which facilitates <b>selection</b> of <b>disjoint</b> paths. This thesis further demonstrates that obtaining such network layer path information is very challenging. As opposed to the path monitoring which only requires cooperation of overlay hosts, <b>disjoint</b> path <b>selection</b> depends on the accuracy of information about the underlay, which is out of the domain of control of the overlay and so may contain inaccuracies. This thesis investigates how such information could be gleaned at different granularities for optimal tradeoffs between spatial and/or temporal methods for selection of alternate paths. The main contributions of this thesis are: (i) investigation of scalable techniques to facilitate alternate path computation using network layer path information; (ii) a review of the realistic performance gains achievable using such alternate paths; and (iii) investigation of techniques for revealing the presence of incorrect network layer path information, proposal of new techniques for its removal...|$|R
