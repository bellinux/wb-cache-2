5|$|Hubbard's {{comments}} {{suggest that}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> being {{directly involved in}} the film's production; author Stewart Lamont suggests that Hubbard may even have envisioned directing it, having previously helmed Scientology training films. In October 1983, the film rights were sold by the Church of Scientology's in-house literary agency, Author Services Inc., to Salem Productions of Los Angeles. Two films were envisaged, each covering half of the book and tentatively budgeted at $15 million each. William Immerman was set as the producer for the film. Veteran screenwriter Abraham Polonsky and British director Ken Annakin were hired to produce a film breakdown, with production scheduled to begin in 1985. In November 1984, Santa Monica public relations firm Dateline Communications announced a nationwide contest to promote the film. First- and second-place prizes were an all-expense-paid trip to the film's production location and a paid walk-on part in the film, and other announced prizes included a trip to Los Angeles for the world premiere, records, cassettes, and hardcover and paperback copies of the novel. A 30-foot (10m) high inflatable figure of the film's villain, Terl, was erected by Scientology officials on Hollywood Boulevard in 1984 in an effort to promote the production, and auditions were held in Denver. The low-budget project soon collapsed, and Hubbard died soon afterwards, in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently Schelling {{identified}} himself with Baruch de Spinoza, to whose thought <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as approaching. The Darstellung meines Systems, and the expanded {{treatment in the}} lectures on a System der gesamten Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere given in Würzburg in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|In Aristotelian science, {{especially}} in biology, things <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> have {{stood the test}} of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.|$|E
2500|$|Paisley <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> {{primarily}} as an Ulsterman. However, despite his hostility towards Irish nationalism and the Republic of Ireland, <b>he</b> also <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as an Irishman {{and said that}} [...] "you cannot be an Ulsterman without being an Irishman".|$|R
60|$|What had happened, Smoke {{could only}} guess, {{and as he}} came to McCan's fire he was {{prepared}} for a second cursing. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> McCan <b>himself</b> industriously chewing a strip of caribou meat.|$|R
5000|$|Conway is commemorated {{by having}} a street named after him in Tredegar. He died in February 1933 and <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> portrayed as [...] "Owen" [...] in the 1938 film [...] "The Citadel" [...] based on Cronin's novel.|$|R
25|$|Thucydides omits {{discussion}} of the arts, literature or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he himself grew up. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable lengths to exclude what he deemed frivolous or extraneous.|$|E
25|$|Alfred {{undertook}} no systematic {{reform of}} ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him {{the key to}} the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore was {{haunted by}} his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the {{circumstances}} surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured {{for the rest of his}} life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell that killed his sister. When he looked into the Mirror of Erised, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and together.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander professes that <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a writer, yet contributed {{his song}} writing talents to co-writing two {{songs on the}} album, opener [...] "Escape" [...] and {{epilogue}} [...] "Breathe". These were co-written with Andes Bagge and Tom Nichols.|$|R
50|$|Thomas' first archaeological {{excavation}} {{was at the}} Bronze Age barrow on Godrevy headland, St Ives Bay in 1950, and <b>he</b> initially <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a prehistorian. He was Director of excavations at Gwithian, Cornwall (1949-1963), {{which revealed}} an important post-Roman occupation.|$|R
5000|$|Charles told Doogue {{he took up}} drugs {{because he}} found he was a [...] "bad drinker" [...] but that, having given them up after being embarrassed at what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>himself</b> in the 2008 documentary, Bastardy, he had never looked back.|$|R
25|$|The {{conflict}} between what Bob had become, and what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as, {{led him to}} be impulsively inclined to follow the lead set by the more headstrong Terry, who led them recklessly into one scrape after another. Bob usually blamed his drinking, heavy smoking, poor diet and reckless behaviour on Terry, a view Audrey and Thelma only too willingly agreed with. This may have been true in part, but actually Bob needed little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry or to behave accordingly.|$|E
25|$|English voice actor Bryce Papenbrook got {{excited when}} he got the role of Eren as he was a fan of the show before it was {{announced}} that it would be dubbed into English. As a result, he viewed this as an advantage as he managed to understand the character beforehand. For example, he could understand the delivery of several lines because he already knew of the anime's series of twists. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> prepared for the role's pressure due to his previous works in popular anime.|$|E
25|$|In 1872 Griffith {{was elected}} to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, for East Moreton. Throughout his career <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a lawyer first and a {{politician}} second, and continued to appear at the Bar even when he was in office. Griffith took silk in 1876 as a Queen's Counsel. In Parliament he gained a reputation as a liberal reformer. He was Attorney-General, Minister for Education and Minister for Works, and became leader of the liberal party in 1879. His great enemy was the conservative leader Sir Thomas McIlwraith, whom he accused (correctly) of corruption.|$|E
50|$|Aron Ra {{was born}} in Kingman, Arizona, and baptized as a Mormon. He says as a child <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> {{as a member of}} that faith, however, because he did not know enough about it or other {{religions}} to make a responsible choice about what to believe. He studied paleontology in Dallas.|$|R

6000|$|... "We don't turn up again?" [...] The further {{she went}} the further <b>he</b> always <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> able to follow.

[...] "If that's how you're {{arranging}} so subtly {{to send me}} I {{thank you for the}} warning." ...|$|R
25|$|Besides {{numerous}} philological {{and philosophical}} works, Schottlaender published brilliant translations (new translations of Sophocles which were very effective on the stage, {{the publication of}} an edition of Petrarch, among others) and fundamental discussions of questions concerning Judaism and antisemitism. In his political essays and articles, which he predominantly published in the West, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a mediator between the systems. Because of his positions critical to East Germany, he was put under close surveillance by the Ministry for State Security (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit or Stasi). He inspired leading minds of the developing opposition in East Germany.|$|E
25|$|He did not {{hesitate}} to express his independent judgement (ijtihad). He stated his assessment as to which of the sources he cited was accurate. This was more understandably an aspect of his theology than of his history. This does not mean <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as innovative. On the contrary, he was very much opposed to religious innovation. The story goes that when he was near death ibn Kamil suggested he forgive his enemies. He said he was willing to do so, except for the person who had described him as an innovator. In general Tabari's approach was conciliatory and moderate, seeking harmonious agreement between conflicting opinions.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's next poem, the Medicamina Faciei, a fragmentary work on women's beauty treatments, {{preceded the}} Ars Amatoria, the Art of Love, {{a parody of}} didactic poetry and a three-book manual about {{seduction}} and intrigue, which has been dated to AD 2 (Books 1–2 {{would go back to}} 1 BC). Ovid may identify this work in his exile poetry as the carmen, or song, which was one cause of his banishment. The Ars Amatoria was followed by the Remedia Amoris in the same year. This corpus of elegiac, erotic poetry earned Ovid a place among the chief Roman elegists Gallus, Tibullus, and Propertius, of whom <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as the fourth member.|$|E
50|$|On the Constructor Fleet, {{a junior}} crew member notices that Earth has re-appeared. He is {{overridden}} by the captain, Jeltz, who declares that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it destroyed <b>himself.</b>|$|R
60|$|I see {{now that}} it was {{necessary}} that the bravest and humanest man in all the country should be hung. Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>himself.</b> I almost fear that I may yet hear of his deliverance, doubting if a prolonged life, if any life, can do as much good as his death.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} would," [...] answered Bateman, grimly, as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Edward gird <b>himself</b> in the loincloth {{and stand}} ready to start before he himself had got his shirt on.|$|R
25|$|Mbeki {{spent the}} early years of his exile in the United Kingdom. In 1962, aged 19, he arrived at the brand-new University of Sussex, earning first a BA degree in economics, and then {{remaining}} to complete a Master's degree in African studies. While at Sussex <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> {{as a representative of the}} ANC and helped motivate the university population against apartheid. Still in the UK, he worked in the ANC's London office on Penton Street. He received military training in the Soviet Union and lived at different times in Botswana, Swaziland and Nigeria, but his primary base was in Lusaka, Zambia, the site of the ANC headquarters.|$|E
25|$|When Banda {{returned}} to Nyasaland, {{which he had}} left in 1915, he was over 60. Chipembere and Chiume and most other leading Congress activists were in their late 20s or early 30s. As well as the age difference there was, from the start, a disagreement about Banda's role: the activists saw him as a figurehead, but <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> {{as the leader of}} Congress and expected their obedience. Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise more moderate in his speeches that the younger Congress members. Both Chipembere and Chiume avoided social contact with Europeans and, in their speeches, they frequently denounced Europeans as a group, in contrast to Banda's relatively cordial relations with individual Europeans.|$|E
25|$|In public, Attlee was {{modest and}} unassuming; he was {{ineffective}} at {{public relations and}} lacked charisma. His strengths emerged behind the scenes, especially in committees where his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity, and pragmatism proved decisive. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as spokesman {{on behalf of his}} entire party and successfully kept its multiple factions in harness. Attlee is consistently rated by scholars, critics and public {{as one of the greatest}} British Prime Ministers. His reputation among scholars in recent decades has been much higher than during his years as Prime Minister, thanks to his roles in leading the Labour Party, creating the welfare state and building the coalition opposing Stalin in the Cold War.|$|E
60|$|Well, I don't {{resort to}} that {{explanation}} now. I have got over my intervening doubts. I believe now, as I believed {{at the moment}} of telling, that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his secret for me. But whether <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> <b>saw,</b> or only thought <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> whether <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of a fantastic dream, I cannot pretend to guess. Even the facts of his death, which ended my doubts for ever, throw no light on that.|$|R
50|$|He {{claimed to}} be a member of the Tikal royal line. On Dos Pilas Panel 6 he names a king of Tikal as his father, this was {{probably}} the 23rd or 24th ruler of Tikal. <b>He</b> probably <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as the legitimate heir to the Tikal throne and defected from Tikal in AD 648 to found Dos Pilas as a rival kingdom under the overlordship of Calakmul.|$|R
50|$|Already a {{committed}} republican from his youth, {{well before the}} 1910 overthrow of the monarchy, Granjo {{became a member of}} the National Constituent Assembly, elected on 28 May 1911. He gave up his constituency in order to join the army; during Portuguese participation in World War I, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> combat <b>himself,</b> and upon returning home he wrote a book about his battle experiences.|$|R
25|$|Michelangelo used bright colours, easily {{visible from}} the floor. On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the {{ancestors}} of Christ. Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with Jonah over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the Book of Genesis. He was originally commissioned to paint only 12 figures, the Apostles. He turned down the commission because <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, {{there were more than}} 300. His figures showed the creation, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Great Flood.|$|E
25|$|After an {{armistice}} {{was arranged}} between Antiochus and Rome, the Roman army waged {{a campaign against}} the Galatians which politically undermined the Seleucid position in Asia Minor. The Romans had a tremendous advantage throughout their campaign from their much more limited political objective. All the small powers could ally themselves to Rome because Rome sought no political annexations at this time. Conversely, Antiochus desired to conquer Asia Minor, as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> in the vein of Alexander the Great. The Aegean Sea was a natural frontier for a state based in Babylonia, as Xerxes discovered long ago. If Antiochus had wanted to advance west into Greece, he needed to turn his state into the leading naval power in the Mediterranean, from nowhere, before sending his army west.|$|E
500|$|The {{terms were}} {{negotiated}} according to Bohemond's western understanding, so that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a feudal vassal of Alexios, a [...] "liege man" [...] (homo ligius or [...] ) {{with all the}} obligations this implied, as customary in the West: he was obliged to bring military assistance to the Emperor, except in wars {{in which he was}} involved, and to serve him against all his enemies, in Europe and in Asia.|$|E
5000|$|The Mayor of Port-au-Prince at the time, Franck Romain, {{a former}} Tonton Macoute leader, {{was accused of}} being involved. Romain, {{the former chief of}} police during the Duvalier regime, said Aristide had been [...] "justly punished". One witness said <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Romain <b>himself</b> at the massacre, {{alongside}} his men; a number of witnesses saw city hall employees among the attackers.|$|R
60|$|I {{seemed to}} see also how, during {{all the years}} of association, this strong man had upheld the weak one. But that time had gone forever, both in intent on Sampson's part and in possibility. Wright, like the great {{majority}} of evil and unrestrained men on the border, had reached a point where influence was futile. Reason had degenerated. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> only <b>himself.</b>|$|R
