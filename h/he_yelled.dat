Knight denied the allegations. An argument {{between the two men}} was recorded via camera phone and aired later on television.|$|E
25|$|As {{district}} attorney, Rendell reportedly {{had a mean}} temper {{while doing}} his job. Once, <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> in the governor's face for releasing a certain prisoner. It {{has been said that}} Rendell would even punch walls or throw furniture when became upset. In 1980, Rendell received 28 delegate votes for Vice President at the Democratic National Convention, although he was not a candidate. He served two terms as DA before leaving in 1986 to run for Governor of Pennsylvania. He was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bob Casey, Sr.|$|E
25|$|Joe Paterno {{expressed}} his displeasure with the officials {{for the second}} time this season as <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> at referee David Witvoet after regulation. There were a number of odd and questionable actions by the officials during the game, as pointed out by the TV commentators, including the roughing the punter penalty and the referee refusing to ask for measurements when it appeared Michigan had been stopped short of first down. Each time he glanced at the sideline and signaled first down. It was most noticeable in the third quarter when he signaled first down even as Michigan was lining up in short-yardage formation, thinking it was third-and-1.|$|E

25|$|Mehserle {{joined the}} Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Police in March 2007. During the {{less than two}} years prior to the shooting, he had never been the subject of a {{sustained}} complaint from BART's internal affairs department. Since the shooting, a Bay Area man has complained to the media that Mehserle had beaten him on November 15, 2008; Mehserle's police report said that four officers grabbed the man after <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> threats and assumed a fighting stance. The accuser was taken to the hospital for chest and facial injuries; he was later booked into jail for resisting arrest. He has not filed a formal complaint against BART.|$|E
25|$|Jarrett briefly feuded with Al Snow before reuniting with Debra, who {{had left}} WCW for the WWF, and forming a tag team with Owen Hart. Hart and Jarrett were close friends and travel {{partners}} for years, so the team jelled almost immediately. Jarrett and Hart won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man, successfully defending the titles at WrestleMania XV before losing to Kane and X-Pac on an episode of Raw. Eight days after Hart died in a stunt that went wrong at Over the Edge, Jarrett defeated The Godfather, who Owen was scheduled to face at the pay-per-view, for the Intercontinental Championship. As he was handed the title belt, <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> Hart's name in tribute to his friend. In mid-1999, Jarrett exchanged the Intercontinental Championship with Edge and D'Lo Brown on two more occasions. His fifth reign broke Razor Ramon's record from 1995. He held the record until Chris Jericho's seventh reign in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The main {{breakthrough}} in his decipherment {{was when he}} was also able to read the verb MIS related to birth, by comparing the Coptic verb for birth with the phonetic signs MS and the appearance of references to birthday celebrations in the Greek text. It was on September 14, 1822, while comparing his readings to a set of new texts from Abu Simbel that he made the realization. Running down the street to find his brother <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> [...] "Je tiens mon affaire!" [...] (I've got it!) but collapsed from the excitement.|$|E

500|$|While it is {{traditionally}} held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis! ("Thus always to tyrants") {{either from the}} box or from the stage, witness accounts conflict. Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but othersincluding Booth himselfsaid <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> only Sic semper! (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted, next, in English: either [...] "The South is avenged!", [...] "Revenge for the South!", or [...] "The South shall be free!" [...] (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: [...] "I have done it!") ...|$|E
500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
500|$|Lucullus {{personally}} led {{the charge}} on foot and upon reaching {{the top of the}} hill, <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> to his soldiers in an effort to buoy their morale: [...] "The day is ours, the day is ours, my fellow soldiers!" [...] With this, he gave special instructions to the cohorts to attack the horses' legs and thighs, since these were the only areas of the cataphracts which were not armored. Lucullus charged downwards along with his cohorts and his orders soon proved fatal: the lumbering cataphracts were caught by surprise and, in their attempts to break free from their attackers, careened into the ranks of their own men as the lines began to collapse.|$|E

500|$|That {{afternoon}} his platoon {{was conducting}} combat control operations {{in an effort}} to reduce and control sectarian violence in the area. While Private McGinnis was manning the M2 [...]50-caliber Machine Gun, a fragmentation grenade thrown by an insurgent fell through the gunner's hatch into the vehicle. Reacting quickly, <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> [...] "grenade," [...] allowing all four members of his crew to prepare for the grenade's blast. Then, rather than leaping from the gunner's hatch to safety, Private McGinnis made the courageous decision to protect his crew. In a selfless act of bravery, in which he was mortally wounded, Private McGinnis covered the live grenade, pinning it between his body and the vehicle and absorbing most of the explosion.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes hired Adams for {{six months}} to create {{photographs}} of lands {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a [...] "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> at his son Michael and at Wright to [...] "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!" [...] Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. [...] On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of this photograph for $609,600. [...] Art historian H. W. Janson called this photo [...] "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. [...] "They are going to get me this time," [...] <b>he</b> <b>yelled,</b> sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother <b>he</b> <b>yelled</b> at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale was right on the money [...] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E
500|$|The {{best known}} case of post-uprising {{departure}} involved {{a group of}} Jewish Combat Organization fighters {{under the leadership of}} Icchak Cukierman and Marek Edelman, who had taken part in both the Ghetto and the Warsaw Uprisings. Originally, the former Ghetto fighters stayed together in a large group, but in the second week of October, some of them moved to a different location. Those remaining stayed in the same place on Promyka Street until mid-November, when they were contacted by Ala Margolis, a courier from the Home Army, who had previously managed to leave the city. Margolis and a [...] "rescue squadron" [...] of five people returned to get {{the rest of the group}} out. The Germans had begun a systematic search and destruction of ruined houses near the hiding place, which meant time was running out. Dressed as nurses and doctors, with clothes and Red Cross IDs provided by Dr. Lesław Węgrzynowski, director of the Home Army sanitation unit, the rescue squadron and the seven in hiding made their way out of the city through two German checkpoints. The group consisted of five men and two women: Edelman, Cukierman, Cywia Lubetkin (later, Cukierman's wife), Tosia Goliborska, Julek Fiszgrund, Tuwia Borzykowski, and Zygmunt Warman. The first checkpoint was crossed during dinner, and the Germans did not bother to examine the group, but at the second, an SS officer noticed that Warman, who was lying in a stretcher, was wearing combat boots. <b>He</b> <b>yelled,</b> [...] "These are Polish bandits!", but one of the escorts dressed as a nurse quickly declared that the patients in the stretcher were ill with typhus. The SS soldiers backed off, and the group moved on its way.|$|E
