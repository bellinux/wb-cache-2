5|$|Rhenium is a silvery-white metal {{with one}} of the highest melting points of all elements, {{exceeded}} by only tungsten and carbon. It also {{has one of the highest}} boiling points of all elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by platinum, iridium and osmium. Rhenium has a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=276.1pm and c=445.6pm.|$|E
40|$|With Monte Carlo method, we {{investigate}} the magnetic ground state, magnetic specific heat, and {{magnetic hysteresis loop}} for three types of closely spaced nanomagnet arrays in three-dimensional (3 D) space. It is found that the magnetic ground state of three nanomagnet arrays exhibits the vortex order, caused by the long-range dipolar interactions. Three types of nanomagnet arrays have almost the same magnetic transition temperature even if their array formation in 3 D triangular lattice is different. Some slight jump occurs in the hysteresis loop of the face-centered cubic nanomagnet array, while for the simple <b>hexagonal</b> nanomagnet and <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> nanomagnet arrays no jump is found...|$|R
50|$|Gadolinium is a silvery-white {{malleable}} and ductile {{rare earth}} metal. It crystallizes in <b>hexagonal,</b> in the <b>close-packed</b> α-form at room temperature, but, when heated to temperatures above 1235 °C, it transforms into its β-form, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic structure.|$|R
5|$|Three of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal.</b> Ferritic steel has a body-centred cubic structure and austenitic steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper and nickel have the face-centred cubic structure.|$|R
5|$|Protactinium forms mixed binary oxides {{with various}} metals. With alkali metals A, the {{crystals}} have a chemical formula APaO3 and perovskite structure, or A3PaO4 and distorted rock-salt structure, or A7PaO6 where oxygen atoms form a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> lattice. In all these materials, protactinium ions are octahedrally coordinated. The pentoxide Pa2O5 combines with rare-earth metal oxides R2O3 to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.|$|E
5|$|Silver readily forms alloys with {{copper and}} gold, {{as well as}} zinc. Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc {{concentration}} may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as {{the structure of the}} silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to body-centred cubic (electron concentration 1.5), complex cubic (1.615), and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> phases (1.75).|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
40|$|Graphite {{intercalation}} compounds with Fe and Ni {{have been}} investigated by means of EXAFS spectroscopy. Iron atoms {{have been shown to}} form π-type complexes where the carbon net acts as a polydentate aromatic ligand.

50|$|The crystal {{structure}} of titanium {{at ambient temperature}} and pressure is <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> α phase with a c/a ratio of 1.587. At about 890 °C, the titanium undergoes an allotropic transformation to a body-centred cubic β phase which remains stable to the melting temperature.|$|R
50|$|A nearly <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> {{array of}} oxides centers {{provides}} relatively little free volume for Li+ ions to migrate within. For this reason, the ionic conductivity of Li+ is relatively low at ambient temperate. The {{details of the}} lithiation of FePO4 and the delithiation of LiFePO4 have been examined. Two phases of the lithiated material are implicated.|$|R
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of Pt-modified γ′-Ni 3 Al + γ-Ni coating on CMSX- 4 {{single-crystal superalloy}} {{has been investigated}} by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cross-sectional TEM analyses showed the presence of precipitates in the coating. This precipitate was identified as the <b>hexagonal</b> topologically <b>close-packed</b> (TCP) μ phase with lattice parameters a = 0. 473 nm and c = 2. 565 nm. The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrum of the μ phase suggested a refractory element rich compound comprising the elements Re, W, and Co. Twin domains parallel to (001) {{were found in the}} μ phase. The mechanisms of the μ phase and twinning formation were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Over a wide {{pressure}} range FeCl{sub 2 } is rather compressible {{due to its}} layered structure. At low pressures h-FeCl{sub 2 } condenses into a <b>close-packed,</b> <b>hexagonal</b> phase with a CdI{sub 2 } structure similar to the other anhydrous divalent transition metal halides.

The 6 cm diameter circular cathode is heated by radiation from a graphite foil flat spiral. The cathode {{along with a}} hollow copper anode {{is used for the}} arc discharge plasma production in a newly developed linear plasma device. A separately powered coil located around the anode is used to change the magnetic field strength and geometry in the anode region. Different discharge regimes were realized using this coil...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of simple metals and binary alloy phases {{based on the}} <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> structure are analyzed within the model of Fermi sphere-Brillouin zone interactions to understand distortions and superlattices. Examination of the Brillouin-Jones configuration {{in relation to the}} nearly-free electron Fermi sphere for several representative phases reveals significance of the electron energy contribution to the phase stability. This approach may be useful for understanding high pressure structures recently found in compressed simple alkali and alkali-earth metals. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} condensed phases of repelling core-softened spheres in two dimensions. The dipolar pair repulsion between superparamagnetic spheres {{trapped in a}} thin cell is induced by a transverse magnetic field and softened by suitably adjusting the cell thickness. We scan a broad density range and we materialize {{a large part of}} the theoretically predicted phases in systems of core-softened particles, including expanded and <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal,</b> square, chain-like, stripe/labyrinthine, and honeycomb phase. Further insight into their structure is provided by Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to previous two-dimensional coated photonic crystals, {{in this paper}} we propose a left-handed one that is made of dielectric tubes arranged in a <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> lattice. Without metallic cores, this structure is low-loss and convenient to fabricate. Negative refraction and its resulting focusing are investigated by dispersion characteristic analysis and numerical simulation of the field pattern. With proper modification at the interface, the image is improved. With better isotropy than that with noncircular rods, planoconcave lenses made by dielectric tubes focus a Gaussian beam exactly at R//n - 1 /...|$|R
5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener hassium {{is expected to be the}} densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E
25|$|The {{melting point}} of the {{refractory}} metals are the highest for all elements except carbon, osmium and iridium. This high melting point defines most of their applications. All the metals are body-centered cubic except rhenium which is <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed.</b> Most physical properties of the elements in this group vary significantly because they are members of different groups.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of low-pressure polymorphs of anhydrous silica consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO4. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica cristobalite and tridymite are frequently {{the first to}} crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear {{to be closer to}} that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as <b>hexagonal</b> and cubic <b>close-packed</b> layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.|$|R
500|$|Contrary to {{most other}} lanthanides, {{which have a}} <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> lattice, {{ytterbium}} crystallizes in the face-centered cubic system. Ytterbium has a density of 6.973g/cm3, which is significantly {{lower than those of}} the neighboring lanthanides, thulium (9.32g/cm3) and lutetium (9.841g/cm3). Its melting and boiling points are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium. This is due to the closed-shell electron configuration of ytterbium ( [...] 4f14 6s2), which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding (in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available) and increases ytterbium's metallic radius.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} electric field gradient at transition impurities in normal <b>close-packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> metals is shown {{to be consistent with}} an appreciable contribution from virtual bound 3 d states. By studing the crystal field influence on this virtual level in a Friedel-Anderson model, the localized electronic contribution to the EFG appears to be linearly related to the density of 3 d states at the Fermi level. So, the experimental data from Mössbauer spectroscopy for the {{temperature dependence}} of the EFG in the [MATH]-Fe dilute alloy can be ascribed to the effects of localized spin fluctuations...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} form of {{crystalline}} aluminium oxide is known as corundum, which is the thermodynamically stable form. The oxygen ions nearly form a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> structure with the aluminium ions filling two-thirds of the octahedral interstices. Each Al3+ center is octahedral. In terms of its crystallography, corundum adopts a trigonal Bravais lattice with a space group of R-3c (number 167 in the International Tables). The primitive cell contains two formula units of aluminium oxide.|$|E
25|$|Silicon crystallises {{in a giant}} {{covalent}} structure at standard conditions, {{specifically in}} a diamond cubic lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414°C. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> allotrope at about 40gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642°C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent {{with the fact that}} the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.|$|E

Transmission electron microscopy results using aberration-corrected imaging, and diffraction and compositional analyses, confirm the hexagonal phase in these 40 - 50 nm particles. Reports of hexagonal close packing in Au, even in nanoparticle form, are rare, and the observations suggest metastable pathways for the crystallization process.
