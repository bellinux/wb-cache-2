First, we study cheap talk games, <b>i.</b> e., <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> {{games in which}} messages are costless and unverifiable. Then, we analyze persuasion games, in which players' information is certifiable. Finally, we show in various settings how multiple stages of bilateral communication and delayed information certification may significantly expand the set of equilibrium outcomes, even if only one individual is privately informed. Several geometric equilibrium characterizations, examples and applications are examined along the paper. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{several years}} now, brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) in which brain signals {{are used to}} navigate a computer, a prostheses or a technical device, have been developed in various experimental contexts (Wolpaw & Wolpaw 2012; Grübler & Hildt 2014). Researchers have recently taken the next step and run experiments based on connections between two brains. These so-called brain-to-brain interfaces (abbreviation: BBIs or BTBIs) involve not only a BCI component deriving information from a brain and sending it to a computer, but also a computer-brain interface (CBI) component delivering information to another brain. What results is technology-mediated brain-to-brain communication (B 2 B <b>communication),</b> <b>i.</b> e. <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> between two brains that does not involve any activity of the peripheral nervous system. In what follows, ethical issues that arise in neural interfacing will be discussed after a short introduction to recent BBI experiments. In this, the {{focus will be on}} the implications BBIs may have on the individual at the CBI side of the BBI, i. e. on the recipient...|$|R

PeerDB distinguishes itself from existing P 2 P systems in several ways. First, it is a full-fledge data management system that supports fine-grain content-based searching. Second, it facilitates sharing of data without shared schema. Third, it combines the power of mobile agents into P 2 P systems to perform operations at peers' sites. Fourth, PeerDB network is self-configurable, i. e., a node can dynamically optimize the set of peers that it can communicate directly with based on some optimization criterion. By keeping peers that provide most information or services in close proximity (<b>i.</b> e, <b>direct</b> <b>communication),</b> the network bandwidth can be better utilized and system performance can be optimized. We implemented and evaluated PeerDB on a cluster of 32 Pentium II PCs. Our experimental results show that PeerDB can effectively exploit P 2 P technologies for distributed data sharing...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a traffic {{information}} system based on the distribution of knowledge provided by the cars themselves. Prior work in this area attempted to realize this distribution via vehicular ad-hoc networks, <b>i.</b> e., by <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> between cars. Such an approach faces serious problems due to capacity constraints, high data dissemination latencies, and limited initial deployment of the required technology. In this paper, we present a solution that is not based on ad-hoc networking, but is still fully decentralized. It establishes a peer-to-peer overlay over the Internet, using cellular Internet access. We present a structure for the overlay, a prototype implementation in a simulation environment, and results that underline the feasibility of such a system in a city scenario. We also provide an estimate of expected user benefits when our system is used for dynamic route guidance...|$|R

The leaders are Dawkins, Dr. King of Oxford, 'homme d'esprit, vif, agissant,' and the Earl of Westmoreland, 'homme sage, prudent, d'une bonne tete, bon citoyen, respectable, et respecte.' {198b} They will communicate with Frederick through the Earl Marischal, if at all.

40|$|In a {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) distributed system, nodes of equivalent {{capabilities and}} responsi- bilities pool their resources together {{to share information}} and services. However, most of the existing P 2 P systems such as Napster and Gnutella provide a coarse granularity of information sharing (i. e., file level) that ignore {{the content of the}} file. Moreover, a node's peers are typically statically defined. In addition, there is no support for nodes that are connected intermittently with temporary network addresses. In this paper, we present BestPeer, a prototype P 2 P system that we have implemented at the National University of Singapore. BestPeer is unique in several ways. First, it combines the power of mobile agents into P 2 P systems to perform operations at peers' sites. This facilitates content-based searching easily. Second, it is selfconfigurable, i. e., a node can dynamically optimize the set of peers that it can communicate directly with based on some optimization criterion. By keeping peers that provide most infor- mation or services in close proximity (<b>i.</b> e, <b>direct</b> <b>communication),</b> the network bandwidth can be better utilized and system performance can be optimized. Third, BestPeer provides a loca- tion independent global names lookup server to identify peers with dynamic (or unpredictable) IP addresses. In this way, several peers can always collaborate (or share resources) even if their IP addresses may be different at different occasions. We evaluated BestPeer on a cluster of 32 Pentium II PCs each running a Java-based storage manager. Our experimental results show that BestPeer provides excellent performance compared to traditional non-configurable models. Further experimental study reveals its superiority over Gnutella's protocol...|$|R
40|$|I {{believe that}} {{research}} should be refuted by research. More and more of our scarce journal space is being taken up by attacks, rebuttals, and rebuttals to the rebuttals, often ending with a whimper of recognition that the adversaries were not so very far apart to begin with, {{and that the only}} way (if possible) to resolve the disagreement is through empirical research. Communication of scientific disagreement does not require a published article. Grant proposals and manuscripts submitted to refereed journals like this one are sent out to reviewers, who provide written evaluations that are communicated to the author. Papers presented at conferences are evaluated and often criticized by discussants and members of the audience. The best strategy, <b>I</b> think, is <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> between the critic and the author. Unlike the published criticism, this method allows both critic and author to reach a clear understanding of each other 2 ̆ 7 s position, to identify specific topics of agreement and disagreement, and perhaps even to arrive at possible resolutions through the normal give and take of scientific dialogue. The best a published criticism can do is to provide an opportunity for back-to-back monologues, surely a far less effective means of communication...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Communication {{is often}} {{required}} for coordination of collective behaviours. Social insects like ants, termites or bees {{make use of}} different forms of communication, which can be roughly classified in three classes: indirect (stigmergic) <b>communication,</b> <b>direct</b> interaction and <b>direct</b> <b>communication.</b> The use of stigmergic communication is predominant in social insects (e. g., the pheromone trails in ants), but also direct interactions (e. g., antennation in ants) and <b>direct</b> <b>communication</b> can be observed (e. g., the waggle dance of honey bee workers). <b>Direct</b> <b>communication</b> may be beneficial when a fast reaction is expected, as for instance, when a danger is detected and countermeasures must be taken.
