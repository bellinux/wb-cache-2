40|$|For a long time, {{provisioning}} of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in Tanzania {{has been}} based on a threshold population and hierarchy of administrative units. Access to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is very low particularly within informal settlements in peri-urban areas. Focusing on the case of Charambe and Chamazi Administrative Wards in Dar es Salaam city, the study analyses the location of private <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in the context of rapid urbanisation. Theories which illuminate research questions include neo-liberal planning theory, sustainable urban form theory, interest based theory and central place theory. The study has found that provisioning of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> based on the hierarchy of administrative units is not successful due to the oversight of the variation that exists among administrative wards as results of rapid urbanisation. Moreover, locational preferences of private <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> are not clearly analysed and integrated into the overall spatial organisation of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. There are limitations of the private <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers in investing in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> of higher order and locating <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> based on population size and distribution. Therefore, spatial disparities of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities’ distribution are due to an inability of the Government to regulate spatial location of private <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities; it has also failed to adequately locate public <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in less accessible areas including peri-urban area. The paper concludes that location and distribution of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in rapid urbanising contexts should respond to population dynamics, nature of city growth and infrastructure in general. One of the key challenges is how to promote active participation of the private sector in addressing spatial location and distribution of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Key words: Location, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities,</b> administrative units, privatisation, accessibility, motivations, equity, population dynamics and hierarchy...|$|R
40|$|Adequate and {{equitable}} access to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> by local communities {{in urban areas}} {{is an important issue}} of human service provision to both public policy makers and urban planners. Equitable and easy access to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is often considered one of the main objectives of many <b>health</b> <b>care</b> systems. Due to spatial variations in population distribution, transportation infrastructure as well as distribution of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities,</b> there exists spatial variation in accessibility to the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> and locations where accessibility to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is poor.

25|$|Nursing {{shortage}} {{refers to}} {{a situation where the}} demand for nursing professionals, such as Registered Nurses (RNs), exceeds the supply—locally (e.g., within a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facility),</b> nationally or globally.

50|$|If an {{influenza}} pandemic occurs, {{the magnitude of}} the event would demand a response from the NYC OCME to assist any governmental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> as well as to support facilities in the private sector. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> which would be affected by a flu pandemic include public and private hospitals, nursing homes, retirement facilities, prison health clinics, public health clinics, and mental health hospitals. During a flu pandemic causing mass fatalities, the limited morgues and decedent storage space at most <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> will be quickly overwhelmed. The proposed solution consists of temporary morgues, known as Body Collection Points (BCPs), at <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> These would be either refrigerated 18-wheel trailers or refrigerated CONEX containers.|$|R

25|$|A {{hospital}} is {{a health care}} institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of {{hospital is}} the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> in its region, {{with large numbers of}} beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, Benefis {{sought to}} stop the Great Falls Clinic from {{purchasing}} 20-bed Central Montana Surgical Hospital. The clinic had partnered with Essentia Health, a non-profit healthcare system based in Minnesota and North Dakota, to purchase Harold Poulsen's outstanding stock in Central Montana Surgical Hospital and gain a controlling interest in the surgical hospital. Benefis sued to prevent the transaction, arguing that the new owners intended to run the facility as a specialty hospital in contravention of a 2005 state law banning further construction {{of these types of}} facilities and that the Clinic and Essentia did not apply for the required <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> license. The health system won a temporary restraining order. Benefis also said it stood to lose $4 million a year in revenues if Central Montana Surgical Hospital was licensed as a general hospital. The company said it would likely close its renal dialysis unit, suspend Mercy Flights, shutter its nursing home, and end outpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency services. Benefis also said it would lose several million dollars a year in federal payments as well. On March 24, the injunction was lifted. Benefis filed an emergency motion with the Montana Supreme Court three days later, appealing the district court's ruling. The state of Montana then issued a six-month provisional license to Central Montana to operate as a general hospital. But on October 4, 2006, the Montana Supreme Court ruled 4-to-3 to uphold the district court's dismissal of the temporary injunction. However, the state supreme court declined to rule on other issues raised by Benefis' lawsuit, and left open the door for the company to continue litigation in the district courts. On November 6, 2006, Benefis declined to appeal the high court's ruling and said it would not bring the other issues back to the district court. In February 2007, the Clinic sued Benefis to recover its legal fees. A state judge ruled in September 2007 that Benefis must pay these fees.|$|E
