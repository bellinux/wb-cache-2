40|$|Canadian provinces {{have become}} {{increasingly}} concerned with possible contamination of water from upstream agricultural activities. Many see watershed-based source protection, so called â€œsource-to-tapâ€ programs, {{as a means of}} improving water quality. A key factor in the success of these programs {{is the extent to which}} they provide incentives to farmers to undertake actions that ultimately result in a reduction of non-point source pollution. One type of program is cost-sharing whereby farmers are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses relating to best management practices which are expected to reduce runoff into water courses. Given increasing reliance on these types of programs, it is necessary from a public policy perspective to identify design features leading to the greatest likelihood of farmer participation. This paper examines Ontario’s Rural Water Quality Program for the Grand River using data from the first seven years of its operation, along with data from Agricultural Canada’s <b>Farm</b> <b>Census,</b> to model and estimate participation rates.

The empirical tests on the French <b>Farm</b> <b>Census</b> confirm the value of both Resource-Based Perspective and Transaction Cost Economics in understanding organizational choices in agriculture and food markets. Because asset specificity in wine trade is low on average, large wine producers have an advantage over smaller ones and so {{are more likely to}} venture into direct sale of generic wines. By contrast smaller wine producers are more likely to rely on the bulk wine market, which is less risky for them. In addition our model helps us to understand the effect of the State-sponsored certification of grape and wine quality, the Protected Designation of Origin system. All other things being equal, producers with vineyards of high reputation (PDO) {{are also more likely to}} bottle and sell their wines; we guess this is because they wish to capture the value of the PDO reputation, the collective brand name capital owned by the farmers. Finally, saving on transaction cost is only one side of the coin: the most educated wine producers can profitably reinvest their knowledge and capabilities into new activities. These choices have important consequence on the French Wine Supply Chain governance...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} {{invaluable}} tools for quantifying potential epidemics and devising optimal control strategies {{in case of}} an outbreak. State-of-the-art models increasingly require detailed individual farm-based and sensitive data, which may not be available due to either lack of capacity for data collection or privacy concerns. However, in many situations, aggregated data are available for use. In this study, we systematically investigate the accuracy of predictions made by mathematical models initialised with varying data aggregations, using the UK 2001 Foot-and-Mouth Disease Epidemic as a case study. We consider the scenario when the only data available are aggregated into spatial grid cells, and develop a metapopulation model where individual farms in a single subpopulation are assumed to behave uniformly and transmit randomly. We also adapt this standard metapopulation model to capture heterogeneity in farm size and composition, using <b>farm</b> <b>census</b> data. Our results show that homogeneous models based on aggregated data overestimate final epidemic size but can perform well for predicting spatial spread. Recognising heterogeneity in farm sizes improves predictions of the final epidemic size, identifying risk areas, determining the likelihood of epidemic take-off and identifying the optimal control strategy. In conclusion, in cases where individual farm-based data are not available, models can still generate meaningful predictions, although care must be taken in their interpretation and use...|$|E

Under a semiarid climate, the water quality {{is influenced by the}} predominating agriculture activities. The hydrological results are compared with the observed flows derived from measurements at the outlet of the Joumine watershed. Model performance showed good statistical agreements, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0. 9 and a r(2) value of 0. 92 after monthly calibration. The model predicted the timing of monthly peak flow values reasonably well. During the validation period, SWAT simulations were nearly as accurate, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and r(2) values of 0. 89 and 0. 92, respectively. The model was used to simulate NO 3 concentrations. The predicted NO 3 concentration values were compared with in situ measured concentrations. The simulated and measured NO 3 -N concentrations varied in the same range of 0 to 5 mg L- 1 at the E 3 and E 5 locations. The calibrated model was then used for simulating the impact of the best management practice scenarios to reduce NO 3 loads to the river. The first set-up consisted of reducing the N fertilizer application by 20 and 100 % from the current state. These two scenarios induced a reduction in NO 3 loads by 22 and 72 %, respectively. The second set-up consisted of using vegetation filter strips. The last scenario combined filter strips and a reduction of 20 % in N fertilizer application.

40|$|The {{aggregate}} {{approach to}} the evaluation of production oriented expenditure in the United States has consistently shown high rates of return to agricultural research investments. These efforts, while showing the value of agricultural research, are limited in the information they can provide policy and budget decisionmakers. More recently, efforts such as the analysis of four major commodity groups by Bredahl and Peterson and cross sectional studies by Evenson, White, and Havlicek have begun refining the level of analysis to individual regions and states and for specific commodities (Evenson, Bredahl and Peterson, White and Havlicek). The objective {{of this study is}} to further disaggregate these commodity groupings of Bredahl and Peterson into individual commodities and to begin investigating the impact of interregional research "spillovers. " Case studies of corn, wheat, and sorghum are made, using individual states as observation units over the time period for which research data on individual commodities are available. The empirical results presented in this paper are the results of some first attempts at estimation. Further work is being done to improve specification of variables measuring weather, cash inputs, risk, and other factors influencing yield response of grain commodities. A special cross sectional-time series algorithm is used in parameter estimation. Theoretical Framework, Model, and Data The conceptual framework of this study is particularly constrained by the availability of only 11 years of research expenditure data on individual commodities (1967 - 1977). The short number of years prohibits use of a 12 -, to 13 year polynominal Almon distributed lag which has been used in previous studies to investigate the research lag structure (White, et al., Quance and Lu). The nonavailability of production input data for specific commodities for other than <b>farm</b> <b>census</b> years also limits utilizing the traditional aggregate production function {{approach to the}} analysis of agriculture research expenditure. Faced with these data limitation problems, the framework of a supply response analysis is developed as an alternative to investigating the impact on research expenditures on productivity of individual grain commodities. The supply response model which is derivable from the production function, expresses the quantity of a commodity offered for sale as a function of input and output prices, technical parameters, and a variety of shifters, such as weather and technological change. Supply analysis studies have typically represented the effects of technological change as a linear trend variable. While the research evaluation studies have not focused on the processes of technological adoption and diffusion, their analyses have shown that public investments in agricultural research activities have contributed to increases in productivity. On this basis, lagged research expenditures on individual commodities will be used as the technological change shifter in the commodity response functions.

40|$|This report {{forms the}} first {{deliverable}} {{of a project}} jointly funded by BGS and the Environment Agency to consider the potential for incorporating the outputs from the BGS unsaturated zone travel time work in assessing the risks to water from nitrate. This is to help to inform the nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) designation process. In England, the Environment Agency advises Defra on identifying areas for designation as NVZs. Over time, the designation process has developed and become more complex since {{the first round of}} designations in 1996. The designation process for groundwater initially used only public supply monitoring data and the associated source catchment area. In December 2000, the European Court of Justice held that the UK had failed to designate sufficient NVZs for the protection of all waters, not just for drinking water sources. This resulted in the development of revised methodologies for the designation of NVZs which separately address surface waters, groundwater and waters at risk of eutrophication. This was implemented in 2002. Further reviews have been carried out in 2008 and 2012 and as a result, modifications and improvements to methods have been made at each designation round. For groundwater the Environment Agency developed a numerical risk assessment procedure that uses a range of risk factors including both nitrate concentration data and nitrate-loading data to assess the risk of nitrate pollution. The loading data is based on <b>farm</b> <b>census</b> returns made to Defra and combined using the NEAP-N methodology developed by ADAS (Lord and Anthony, 2000). The overall risk assessment considers both current observed concentrations and predicted future concentrations as well as current loadings. However, this approach has a number of disadvantages including a lack of a specific term for the time of travel to the water table and emergence of pollutant both into groundwater and to groundwater discharge points that support surface water features. Instead, these issues are considered at the conceptual level in workshops with local EA hydrogeologists. A key question for Defra and the Agency is {{how long it will take}} for nitrate concentrations to peak and then stabilise at an acceptable, lower level, in response to existing and future land management control measures. This is most important for soils, for aquifers, for lakes and for groundwater-fed wetland systems that respond less quickly to changes in loading. Groundwater and lake catchment numerical models can provide first-order estimates of likely response times, but can be difficult and costly to set-up for many different situations and are difficult to apply consistently at the national scale. A previous review of nitrate vulnerable zones suggests a range of further needs: •	to understand the recent developments in nitrate pollution simulation and particularly the potential to understand/characterise past nitrate loading from changing land management practices and correlate these with observed nitrate concentrations over time; •	to evaluate the retention of nitrate in catchments, particularly in the unsaturated zone of soils and aquifers; •	to simulate the recent and future anticipated decreases in nitrate loading by sectors within the UK; •	to understand the likely time taken for nitrate concentrations to peak and then stabilise at an acceptable, lower level, in response to existing and future control measures. Without evidence of how long it may take systems to recover it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of existing measures or decide whether additional measures are necessary. The aim of this project is to investigate the use of new models to inform decision-making on nitrate pollution in groundwater and the potential for incorporating unsaturated zone processes in future NVZ designations. The work described here forms the first task of this project and aims to review NVZ methodology and recent designation experience. As part of this we will: •	collate information from the Agency on the recent application of the methodology; •	provide case study examples of designation in different time-lag settings and/or where these are not corroborated by water quality. ...|$|E
