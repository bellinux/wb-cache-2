40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to update the cost {{estimates}} developed in a previous report, NUREG/CR- 1757 (Elder 1980) for decommissioning a reference uranium hexafluoride conversion plant from the original mid- 1981 dollars to values representative of January 1993. The cost updates were performed by using escalation factors derived from cost index trends over the past 11. 5 years. Contemporary price quotes wee used for costs that have increased drastically or for which is is difficult to find a cost trend. No changes were made in the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>procedures</b> or cost element requirements assumed in NUREG/CR- 1757. This report includes only information that was changed from NUREG/CR- 1757.

INTRODUCTION Decommissioning means {{permanently}} {{removing a}} nuclear facility from service and reducing radioactive {{material on the}} licensed site to levels that would permit termination of the NRC license. On June 27, 1988, the NRC issued general requirements on decommissioning that contained technical and financial criteria and dealt with planning needs, timing, funding mechanisms, and environmental review requirements (53 FR 24018). These requirements were codified in 10 CFR 50. 75, 50. 82, 51. 53, and 51. 95. On July 29, 1996, a final rule amending the regulations on <b>decommissioning</b> <b>procedures</b> {{was published in the}} Federal Register (61 FR 39278).

40|$|ICARUS T 600 liquid argon time {{projection}} chamber is {{the first}} large mass electronic detector {{of a new generation}} able to combine the imaging capabilities of the old bubble chambers with the excellent calorimetric energy measurement. After the three months demonstration run on surface in Pavia during 2001, the T 600 cryogenic plant was significantly revised, in terms of reliability and safety, in view of its long-term operation in an underground environment. The T 600 detector was activated in Hall B of the INFN Gran Sasso Laboratory during Spring 2010, where it was operated without interruption for about three years, taking data exposed to the CERN to Gran Sasso long baseline neutrino beam and cosmic rays. In this paper the T 600 cryogenic plant is described in detail together with the commissioning procedures that lead to the successful operation of the detector shortly {{after the end of the}} filling with liquid Argon. Overall plant performance and stability during the long-term underground operation are discussed. Finally, the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>procedures,</b> carried out about six months after the end of the CNGS neutrino beam operation, are reported.

5000|$|Multi-screen casing completion: the MLS is {{installed}} {{inside of a}} multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each well screen segment has a sand or gravel pack {{between it and the}} borehole wall, and is thus isolated from monitoring zones above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi-screened well. This adds another step to the well installation process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing multilevel monitoring systems. Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the multilevel systems can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various monitoring zones can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the multilevel monitoring systems are installed in the wells. Finally, installing multilevel systems inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the multilevel systems can be constructed {{so that they can be}} easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure-grouted or drilled out using standard well <b>decommissioning</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractX-band (11. 424 GHz) {{electron}} linac as {{a neutron}} source for nuclear data {{study for the}} Fukushima nuclear plant accident is under development. Originally we developed the linac for Compton scattering X-ray source. Quantitative material analysis and forensics for nuclear security will start several years later after the safe settlement of the accident is established. For the purpose, we should now accumulate more precise nuclear data of U, Pu, TRU and MA (Cm, Am, etc.) especially in epithermal (0. 1 - 10 eV) neutrons. Therefore, we have decided to suspend the Compton scattering X-ray experiment and move the linac in the core space of the experimental nuclear reactor “Yayoi” which is now under the <b>decommission</b> <b>procedure.</b> Due to the compactness of the X-band linac, the electron gun and accelerating tube and other components can be installed in a small space in the core. First we plan to perform the TOF (Time Of Flight) transmission measurement for study of the total cross sections of the nuclei for 0. 1 - 10 eV neutrons. Therefore, if we adopt a TOF line of less than 10 m, the macro-pulse length of generated neutrons should be shorter than 100 ns. Electron energy, macro-pulse length, power and neutron yield are ∼ 30 MeV, 100 ns - 1 μs, ∼ 0. 4 kW and ∼ 1012 n/s, ∼ 103 n/cm 2 /s at samples, respectively. Optimization of {{the design of a}} neutron target (Ta, W, 238 U), TOF line and neutron detector (Ce:LiCAF) of high sensitivity and fast response is underway. For the purpose, we are upgrading the electron gun and buncher to realize higher current and beam power with a reasonable beam size in order to avoid damage of the neutron target. Although the neutron flux is limited in case of X-band electron linac based source, we take advantage of its short pulse aspect and availability for nuclear data measurement with a short TOF system. 　We plan to perform the two phased development and measurement. First, we form a tentative configuration in the current experimental room for Compton scattering in 2014. Then, after the decommissioning has been finished, we move it the “Yayoi” room and perform the operation and measurement...|$|R

40|$|U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{regulations}} {{require that}} a licensee must submit a decommissioning plan {{to support the}} decommissioning of its facility when it is required by license condition, or if the NRC has not approved the procedures and activities necessary {{to carry out the}} <b>decommissioning</b> and these <b>procedures</b> could increase the potential health and safety impacts to the workers or the public. In July 1998 the NRC directed the staff to develop a Standard Review Plan (SRP) that incorporates a risk-informed, iterative approach and provides clear guidance on complying with the As Low As is Reasonably Achievable provisions in the final License Termination Rule. This NUREG is the culmination of that staff effort and was presented to the Commission in July 2000, with staff indicating that it intended to commence using the SRP in September 2000. The goal of the SRP is to allow the NRC staff to evaluate information submitted by licensees in a timely, efficient, consistent manner and {{in such a way that}} the public health and safety is protected and the facility can be released in accordance with NRC’s requirements.

40|$|With the {{implementation}} of DOE Order 420. 1 B, Facility Safety, and DOE-STD- 3007 - 2007, 'Guidelines for Preparing Criticality Safety Evaluations at Department of Energy Non-Reactor Nuclear Facilities', a new requirement was imposed that all criticality safety controls be evaluated {{for inclusion in the}} facility Documented Safety Analysis (DSA) and that the evaluation process be documented in the site Criticality Safety Program Description Document (CSPDD). At the Hanford site in Washington State the CSPDD, HNF- 31695, 'General Description of the FH Criticality Safety Program', requires each facility develop a linking document called a Criticality Control Review (CCR) to document performance of these evaluations. Chapter 5, Appendix 5 B of HNF- 7098, Criticality Safety Program, provided an example of a format for a CCR {{that could be used in}} lieu of each facility developing its own CCR. Since the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) is presently undergoing Deactivation and <b>Decommissioning</b> (D&D), new <b>procedures</b> are being developed for cleanout of equipment and systems that have not been operated in years. Existing Criticality Safety Evaluations (CSE) are revised, or new ones written, to develop the controls required to support D&D activities. Other Hanford facilities, including PFP, had difficulty using the basic CCR out of HNF- 7098 when first implemented. Interpretation of the new guidelines indicated that many of the controls needed to be elevated to TSR level controls. Criterion 2 of the standard, requiring that the consequence of a criticality be examined for establishing the classification of a control, was not addressed. Upon in-depth review by PFP Criticality Safety staff, it was not clear that the programmatic interpretation of criterion 8 C could be applied at PFP. Therefore, the PFP Criticality Safety staff decided to write their own CCR. The PFP CCR provides additional guidance for the evaluation team to use by clarifying the evaluation criteria in DOE-STD- 3007 - 2007. In reviewing documents used in classifying controls for Nuclear Safety, it was noted that DOE-HDBK- 1188, 'Glossary of Environment, Health, and Safety Terms', defines an Administrative Control (AC) in terms that are different than typically used in Criticality Safety. As part of this CCR, a new term, Criticality Administrative Control (CAC) was defined to clarify the difference between an AC used for criticality safety and an AC used for nuclear safety. In Nuclear Safety terms, an AC is a provision relating to organization and management, procedures, recordkeeping, assessment, and reporting necessary to ensure safe operation of a facility. A CAC was defined as an administrative control derived in a criticality safety analysis that is implemented to ensure double contingency. According to criterion 2 of Section IV, 'Linkage to the Documented Safety Analysis', of DOESTD- 3007 - 2007, the consequence of a criticality should be examined for the purposes of classifying the significance of a control or component. HNF-PRO- 700, 'Safety Basis Development', provides control selection criteria based on consequence and risk that may be used in the development of a Criticality Safety Evaluation (CSE) to establish the classification of a component as a design feature, as safety class or safety significant, i. e., an Engineered Safety Feature (ESF), or as equipment important to safety; or merely provides defense-in-depth. Similar logic is applied to the CACs. Criterion 8 C of DOE-STD- 3007 - 2007, as written, added to the confusion of using the basic CCR from HNF- 7098. The PFP CCR attempts to clarify this criterion by revising it to say 'Programmatic commitments or general references to control philosophy (e. g., mass control or spacing control or concentration control as an overall control strategy for the process without specific quantification of individual limits) is included in the PFP DSA'. Table 1 shows the PFP methodology for evaluating CACs. This evaluation process has been in use since February of 2008 and has proven to be simple and effective. Each control identified in the applicable new/revised CSE is evaluated via the table. The results of this evaluation are documented in tables attached to the CCR as an appendix, for each CSE, to the base document...|$|R
