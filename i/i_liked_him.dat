500|$|Dickinson {{attended}} {{primary school}} in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was [...] "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> better than none." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arkansas Republicans {{were eager}} to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for {{governor}} if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> personally. He showed me many courtesies, and I still thought [...] {{that he would make}} a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket..... He had learned a lesson. And he won his next two races for governor..... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|Whaley met Tarantino {{while he}} was filming Reservoir Dogs at a lab in Sundance Institute. As he recalled, [...] "we ended up meeting and {{spending}} time together, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> so I was really happy when {{he asked me to}} be in this movie." [...] Regarding the reputation of his character, he said: [...] "When I came home, I was walking on the streets of Manhattan, and people were just screaming, [...] "Check out the big brain on Brett!" [...] And I was, like, [...] "What the fuck are you talking about?" [...] But to this day, that's what people remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} frankly. [...] "Oh, I don't hate <b>him,</b> of course. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> well enough. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very well. But we'll quarrel all our lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is all that, Wilfrid, {{but you see}} I don't want {{to marry}} <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> {{very much in the}} same way you <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> but <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> well enough for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know him}} better, certainly, {{if you mean}} that," [...] said Bessie. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much. But <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> enough to make trouble for him with his family. However, I don't believe in that." ...|$|R
2500|$|Foucault is {{sometimes}} criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism, which some see as {{an affront to}} the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating [...] "He struck me as completely amoral, I’d never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawkeye was {{introduced}} as a reluctant villain in Tales of Suspense #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in Tales of Suspense #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joins {{the ranks of}} the Avengers in Avengers #16 (May 1965). He became a perennial member of the team and has made numerous appearances in all five volumes (Vol. 1 (1963–1996), Vol. 2 (1997), Vol. 3 (1999–2004), Vol. 4 (2010–2013), Vol. 5 (2013–present), including specials and annuals, as well as in The Ultimates. However, Hawkeye would be absent from the Avengers - both the team and the series - for nearly a decade starting in early 1973. Steve Englehart, the Avengers writer at the time of Hawkeye's departure, explained, [...] "When I had Hawkeye quit the Avengers, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> but I wanted to try a different approach, so his leaving fit in with what I was trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
60|$|SYLVIA. Of course <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him....</b> <b>I</b> think he's a {{very good}} sort.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{gave the}} matter, thus admonished, some visible thought. “I know him better certainly, {{if you mean}} that. And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much. But <b>I</b> don’t <b>like</b> <b>him</b> enough to make trouble for him with his family. However, I don’t believe in that.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said he, filling {{my glass}} {{at the same}} time, [...] "our poets don't look at home. I don't see why we need go out of old England for robbers and rebels to write about. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> your Jack Straw, sir. He's a home-made hero. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> sir. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> exceedingly. He's English to the back bone, damme. Give me honest old England, after all; them's my sentiments, sir!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was a young}} doctor, {{somewhere between}} twenty and forty. He wore {{heliotrope}} socks, but he looked like Napoleon. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> immensely.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found out}} {{afterward}} that Wainwright {{was a regular}} beachcomber--the smartest man on the whole coast, but kept down by rum. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gazing at {{him with}} all my eyes, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> well, and rejoiced more in him than in all the other wonders of the Exhibition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are glad <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> my dear. If <b>I</b> did n't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> and you did, {{it would n't be}} {{satisfactory}} at all. I can imagine nothing more miserable; I should n't die in any sort of comfort." ...|$|R
60|$|No, I don't. <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Yet it's almost unbelievable. I've {{always thought}} men so detestable.|$|R
6000|$|... “Do as you please!” Bessie answered; {{after which}} she turned round. “I’m {{not afraid to}} say <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Lord Lambeth. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours was {{a triple}} combination," [...] Ormond said. [...] "Where's your cheerful partner; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> Ah, excuse an unfortunate question--a {{difference}} of opinion most probably?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hurried back}} to the Palazzo and found Scipione Moratini already arrived. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for his sister's sake, but in himself he was a {{pleasant}} person.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At Naples. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> {{very much}} till he persecuted me beyond {{endurance}} with Tennyson and Browning. He {{is always going}} about in raptures with some new-fashioned poet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Ruth; “I’ve noticed that, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> for it. After all, {{you need}} some sympathy. The situation’s complicated.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do as you please!" [...] Bessie answered; and {{presently}} {{she turned}} round. [...] "I {{am not afraid}} to say that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Lord Lambeth. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much." ...|$|R
5000|$|... haresvam go - <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> haresvam si go - no precise translation, roughly {{translates}} as [...] "hes really {{close to my}} heart" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why should I {{wish to be}} married? If <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> I {{would take}} him, but I don't. O, Aunt Josey, I thought you would be my friend!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It would depend," [...] said Jim. [...] "Upon {{how much}} <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> for one thing. Of course, I would go no {{distance}} {{if he tried}} to drive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dad, {{you know}} how Joel runs after me. I've told you. I let him till lately. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> But that wasn't why. I felt sorry for him--pitied him." ...|$|E
60|$|Lau. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> strangely. If {{his person}} were joined with Benito's wit, I know not {{what would become}} of my poor heart.|$|R
5000|$|It's a shame Mateos can't join {{us because}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> a lot. He defends well and {{knows how to}} {{instigate}} play from the back. That's a trait which we need here at Madrid. With the difficulties we have it is a pity {{that he can not}} play, <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> {{to be part of the}} first team.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack dear, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> {{but he said}} {{something}} that was true. I should never have {{fallen in love with}} the real Cyril Jernyngham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he answered, [...] "might be misleading. He {{has shown}} {{me so much}} kindness. Yet I think--I am sure--that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> from the first moment I saw him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Mrs. Jethway, you {{do think}} so mistakenly! <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> best--that's why I {{wanted him to}} do it. He was gentle and nice--I always thought him so--and I liked him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--poor boy! He meant it. With a word;--with a look, {{he would}} have been down there kneeling. He asked me whether <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> well enough. What do you think I did?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} part of it all, Lucy. If <b>I</b> did not <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> should not mind it half so much. It is just because <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> so very much that I am so very unhappy. His hair is just the colour of Aunt Emmeline's big shawl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is," [...] she declared. [...] "I have only known Captain Granet {{for a very}} short time. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> of course--every one must <b>like</b> <b>him</b> who knows him--but that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} very kind to me, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much. But if you mean that he'll propose for me I think you're mistaken." ...|$|R
