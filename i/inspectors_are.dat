25|$|The {{number of}} OSHA safety <b>inspectors</b> must <b>be</b> increased. The team of <b>inspectors</b> <b>was</b> hugely {{overburdened}} {{at the time}} of the accident, and the report says that an increase in the number of <b>inspectors</b> <b>is</b> required to solve the problem.|$|R
50|$|Officers of Police were {{formerly}} known as Commissioned Officers. This name was changed as SAPOL Officers no longer receive a Queens Commission. Officers of Police act primarily as managers and generally do not partake in operational policing. An <b>Inspector</b> <b>is</b> {{in charge of a}} section. A Detective <b>Inspector</b> <b>is</b> normally in charge of the whole station CIB. A uniform <b>Inspector</b> <b>is</b> normally in charge of the stations operations.|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, {{the rank}} of {{temporary}} or probationary <b>inspector</b> <b>was</b> granted one star, {{the rank of}} station inspector received two [...] "stars, and the rank of sub-divisional inspector received three stars. In 1949, the <b>inspector</b> ranks <b>were</b> reorganised. The rank of station <b>inspector</b> <b>was</b> changed to <b>inspector</b> and the rank of sub-divisional inspector abolished.|$|R
25|$|Staff <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> usually {{departmental}} administrative officers, {{serving on}} the police Command Staff under a commissioner or deputy commissioner. They are generally assigned to inspect police divisions, districts and units, evaluate police practices, equipment and personnel, and make recommendations for improvement where necessary; however, they may also command units and divisions. Staff Inspectors must have a minimum of one year's service as a captain.|$|E
500|$|Originally all {{inspectors}} {{were from}} APHIS, but {{a lack of}} funding led to a 1976 amendment to the act, which allows non-USDA employees to be trained and certified as inspectors. This program {{has not always been}} successful, with some non-USDA inspectors being more lenient on violators than others, and citations for violations tend to increase significantly when USDA <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> present at a show. Several methods are used to detect violations of the act, including observation, palpation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify chemicals on horses' legs. Certain training techniques and topical anesthetics can be used to avoid detection by the first two methods. There {{have been a number of}} unsuccessful challenges to the act on the grounds on constitutionality, as well as challenges on varying other issues. In 2013, an amendment to the act was proposed in the United States House of Representatives. The amendment would allow only USDA employees to perform inspections, toughen penalties for violations, and outlaw the use of action devices and [...] "stacks", or layers of pads attached to the bottom of the front hooves.|$|E
500|$|As {{originally}} enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to {{be enforced}} by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), {{a branch of the}} USDA. However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates [...] "the potential for a [...] "fox guarding the chicken coop" [...] situation", as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring, the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring. When APHIS <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly. Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted, have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses. In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Metropolitan Police superintendents were regraded {{to the new}} rank {{of chief}} superintendent, chief <b>{{inspectors}}</b> <b>were</b> regraded to superintendent, and sub-divisional inspectors and divisional detective <b>inspectors</b> <b>were</b> regraded to chief inspector (with those ranks being abolished).|$|R

50|$|From 1933, every Metropolitan Police {{division}} had two {{chief inspector}}s: chief inspector (administration) and chief inspector (crime) (the latter also being a uniformed administrative officer and not replacing the divisional detective inspector). From 1949, sub-divisional <b>inspectors</b> and DDIs <b>were</b> regraded as chief inspectors and current chief <b>inspectors</b> <b>were</b> regraded as superintendents. From 1953, chief inspectors commanding sub-divisions and detective chief inspectors commanding divisional CIDs were regraded as superintendents grade I, other chief <b>inspectors</b> <b>were</b> regraded as superintendents grade II, and a redefined rank of chief <b>inspector</b> <b>was</b> created for senior inspectors. Since 1974, the Metropolitan Police has {{only had one}} rank of superintendent, {{in common with the}} rest of the country.|$|R
2500|$|According to secret cables {{published}} by WikiLeaks, the US ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, stated that Luzhkov sat {{on top of}} a [...] "pyramid of corruption". [...] "Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behaviour," [...] wrote Beyrle. [...] "Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world. Luzhkov is at the top. The FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level. Finally ordinary criminals and corrupt <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> at the lowest level." [...] Beyrle also suggested that much of Luzhkov's business empire had been acquired using municipal finances to invest in [...] "less than transparent" [...] projects with former Soviet republics. In a further cable, Beyrle reported allegations that Luzhkov's billionaire wife Yelena Baturina, who became Russia's richest woman after he assumed office with her construction company Inteko, had links to major criminal groups, particularly Solntsevskaya Bratva. The couple denied the accusations as [...] "total rubbish".|$|E
60|$|Then, also, {{during the}} easy hours, the <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> most in evidence. For some reason, {{everybody}} employed in this tram-service is young: {{there are no}} grey heads. It would not do. Therefore the <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> of the right age, and one, the chief, is also good-looking. See him stand on a wet, gloomy morning, in his long oil-skin, his peaked cap well down over his eyes, waiting to board a car. His face is ruddy, his small brown moustache is weathered, he has a faint impudent smile. Fairly tall and agile, even in his waterproof, he springs aboard a car and greets Annie.|$|E
60|$|There is {{a similar}} {{situation}} as regards the salt tax. This also was accepted as security for various foreign loans, {{and in order to}} make the security acceptable the foreign Powers concerned insisted upon the employment of foreigners in the principal posts. As in the case of the Customs, the foreign <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> appointed by the Chinese Government, and the situation is in all respects similar to that existing as regards the Customs.|$|E

I am sure that you have plenty of both, and that I cannot make a better choice than in sending you there. Your age is the only thing against you--not with me, you know, but others may think that I have done wrong, in {{selecting}} so young an officer--but you see, I know my man. I know, too, that several of the <b>inspectors</b> <b>are</b> getting too old for this sort of work. I do not mean too old, perhaps, in point of years, but they are married men with families, and for desperate work I prefer men without encumbrances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inspectors</b> <b>are</b> {{careful and}} {{thorough}} in examining people and institutions. Comprising about 6 to 10 {{percent of the}} population, <b>Inspectors</b> <b>are</b> decisive in practical affairs. These guardians of institutions are perhaps best described as dependable: <b>Inspectors</b> <b>are</b> people of their word, intent on preserving social and family values. At home and at work, Inspectors reliably examine the people and products that fall under their tutelage - unobtrusively ensuring uniform quality and demanding that certain standards of conduct are maintained.|$|E
