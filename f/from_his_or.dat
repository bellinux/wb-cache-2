5|$|Use of regalia by monarchs in England can {{be traced}} back to its early history. A {{permanent}} set of coronation regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12thcentury. By the Tudor period it was usual for monarchs to inherit state regalia <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her predecessor. Most of the present collection as a whole dates from around 350 years ago when King CharlesII ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been either sold or melted down by Oliver Cromwell, a republican who overthrew the monarchy in 1649, during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon, which is the oldest object in the collection, and three early 17th-century swords.|$|E
