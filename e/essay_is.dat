5000|$|After {{transferring}} {{his medical}} practice to his son-in-law, Eliot wrote {{a series of}} essays on [...] "field husbandry" [...] (primarily agriculture). The first six concerned ways of improving agriculture; the seventh was about iron-making. The first six <b>essays</b> <b>were</b> collected under the title Essays Upon Field Husbandry. The first of the <b>essays</b> <b>was</b> published in 1748, with the following ones in 1749, 1751, 1753, 1754 and 1759. The last <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> delayed because of the French and Indian War. The <b>essay</b> on iron-making <b>was</b> published in 1763. The first three <b>essays</b> <b>were</b> published in New London, Connecticut; essays four and five were published in New York. The sixth agricultural <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> published in New Haven, Connecticut and the iron-making <b>essay</b> <b>was</b> again published in New York. The fact that the <b>essays</b> <b>were</b> published near his home enabled his neighbors and friends to share his accomplishments; “Jared is best seen as a thoughtful and convincing writer”. Jared wrote his essays in a flowing, easily understandable style, describing farming {{in the light of}} science. He added a religious overtone, asserting that his creatures were working for the “fulfillment of the kingdom”. Each essay had a different topic, ending with an appropriate Biblical verse.|$|R

The essay, in which Duncan compared the plight of homosexuals with that of African Americans and Jews, was published in Dwight Macdonald's journal politics. Duncan's <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> considered a pioneering treatise on the experience of homosexuals in American society given its appearance a full decade before any organized gay rights movement (Mattachine Society). In 1951 Duncan met the artist Jess Collins and began a collaboration and partnership that lasted until Duncan's death 37 years later.|$|E
25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> a series of verbose psychological observations {{on the subject of}} his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than go on living for a few more weeks, he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E

One contest had participants writing an essay about an event that impacted them the most to win a makeover that included a Hannah Montana wig, flight for four to Albany, New York, and four tickets to the January9,2008 concert held at the Times Union Center in Albany. The winner, a 6-year-old girl from Garland, Texas, had won with an essay stating the girl's father had died April17,2007 in a roadside bombing in Iraq during the Iraq War. However, the girl's mother, Priscilla Ceballos, later admitted that the essay and the military information she provided about her daughter's father were untrue. [...] "We did the essay and that's what we did to win. We did whatever {{we could do to}} win, but when [...] asked me if this <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> true, I said 'No, this <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> not true,'" [...] Ceballos said. The prizes were awarded to the runner up. The mishap garnered much attention from the media because it exemplified parents' desperate long to please their children.|$|E
500|$|The typescript of the <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{headed by}} an epigraph, {{attributed}} to The Upbringing of Daughters by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: [...] "The chief justification of reading books {{of any sort}} is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom". The text which follows is, in Motion's words, [...] "a homily on how and how not to write for children". It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: [...] "To be tenacious in evil {{is the duty of}} every villain... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for [...] "the Classic Unities": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Elsie J. Oxenham, Elinor Brent-Dyer and Nancy Breary.|$|E

500|$|The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> a {{redacted}} {{version of}} a series of lectures that Tolkien delivered to Oxford undergraduates in the 1930s. Notes for these lectures exist in two manuscript versions published together in 2002 as Beowulf and the Critics, edited by Michael D. C.

500|$|Although {{the focus}} in this <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> {{largely on the}} {{character}} of Prince Hamlet, Hazlitt also comments on the movement of the dramatic action. Shakespeare lends all the characters and settings an air of verisimilitude, so that the reader might consider [...] "the whole play [...] an exact transcription of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark, at the remote period of time fixed upon, before the modern refinements in morals and manners were heard of. [...] the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. There is no set purpose, no straining at a point." ...|$|E
500|$|The peace {{following}} {{the battle of}} Mons Badonicus is attested partly by Gildas, a monk, who wrote De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae or On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain {{during the middle of}} the sixth century. [...] This <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> a polemic against corruption and Gildas provides little in the way of names and dates. [...] He appears, however, to state that peace had lasted from the year of his birth to the time he was writing. [...] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is the other main source that bears on this period, in particular in an entry for the year 827 that records a list of the kings who bore the title [...] "bretwalda", or [...] "Britain-ruler". [...] That list shows a gap in the early sixth century that matches Gildas's version of events.|$|E

500|$|A {{highlight}} {{derived from}} Ephron's book {{and that was}} consistently praised was the O'Donnell portrayal {{of the role of}} the purse in the scene [...] "I Hate My Purse!". While Reiner says, [...] "There's an amusing 'I hate my purse' segment", Isherwood notes [...] "The smartest and shapeliest piece of writing in the show is that acerbic essay by Nora Ephron about her troublesome relationship with purses...Entrusted to Ms. O'Donnell, who does it proud, the <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> a defiant denunciation of the tyranny of the pocketbook, a 'j'accuse' for the era of the 'it' bag." [...] Shaw described O'Donnell's purse performance as an aria, and Jerry Tallmer of The Villager called it [...] "one of the pillars of the show". This scene is sometimes performed alone outside of the theatre.|$|E
500|$|Eureka was {{received}} poorly in Poe's day and generally described as absurd, even by friends. Modern critics continue {{to debate the}} significance of Eureka and some doubt its seriousness, {{in part because of}} Poe's many incorrect assumptions and his comedic descriptions of well-known historical minds. It is presented as a poem, and many compare it with his fiction work, especially science fiction stories such as [...] "The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar". His attempts at discovering the truth also follow his own tradition of [...] "", a term used in his detective fiction tales. Poe's suggestion that the soul continues to thrive even after death also parallels with works in which characters reappear from beyond the grave such as [...] "Ligeia". The <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> oddly transcendental, considering Poe's disdain for that movement. He considered it his greatest work and claimed it was more important than the discovery of gravity.|$|E
500|$|In February 1930, Marshall {{published}} an essay, [...] {{after it was}} rejected by four magazines. This is now celebrated as a defense of wilderness preservation, and the essay expanded themes developed in his earlier article, [...] "The Wilderness as a Minority Right." [...] Published in The Scientific Monthly, the <b>essay</b> <b>is</b> considered one of Marshall's most important works. He argued that wilderness was worth saving {{not only because of}} its unique aesthetic qualities, but because it could provide visitors with a chance for adventure. Marshall stated: [...] "There is just one hope of repulsing the tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole earth. That hope is the organization of spirited people who will fight for the freedom of the wilderness." [...] The article became a much-quoted call to action and by the late 20th century was considered seminal by wilderness historians.|$|E
