Empirical study of Xuanhua district of Hebei province from 1996 to 2012 showed that urban-rural land use transformation index (URLUTI) decreased linearly with increasing distance to central downtown (DCD), and the gap between central and edge areas increased during 1996 - 2012.

Industrialization and urbanization were the basic driving factors of URLUT, and local, regional and national social and economic transformation deeply and widely affected its development. The study highlights that the regional development should implement correct urban-rural transformation strategy and plan according to its location and nature resources conditions, and obey the spatial laws of urban-rural transformation for improving the efficiency of land use and promoting urban-rural integration. Furthermore, the government's intervention to economic development should be reduced and let the market play more roles in the allocation of resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Crime rate is a {{statistic}} used {{to summarize the}} risk of criminal events. However, {{research has shown that}} choosing the appropriate denominator is non-trivial. Different crime types exhibit different spatial opportunities and so does the population at risk. The residential population is the most commonly used population at risk, but is unlikely to be suitable for crimes that involve mobile populations. In this article, we use "crowd-sourced" data in Leeds, England, to measure the population at risk, considering violent crime. These new data sources have the potential to represent mobile populations at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than other available data. Through the use of two local spatial statistics (Getis-Ord GI* and the Geographical Analysis Machine) and visualization, we show that when the volume of social media messages, as opposed to the residential population, is used as a proxy for the population at risk, criminal event <b>hot</b> spots <b>shift</b> spatially. Specifically, the results indicate a significant shift in the city center, eliminating its hot spot. Consequently, if crime reduction/prevention efforts are based on resident population based crime rates, such efforts may not only be ineffective in reducing criminal event risk, but be a waste of public resources...|$|R

We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from the planet in this bandpass is 73 ± 5 % of the maximum flux; this corresponds to minimum and maximum hemisphereaveraged brightness temperatures of 982 ± 53 K and 1248 ± 53 K, respectively.

The similarities between the 8 and 24 µm phase curves for HD 189733 b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a fundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two wavelengths.

Methods: We reviewed (i) the clinical course of SCD cases and (ii) occupational and non-occupational risk factors including chemicals, the physical work environment, and job characteristics. Results: Possible occupational factors were chemicals, UFPs of rubber fume, a <b>hot</b> environment, <b>shift</b> work, overworking, and noise exposure. The mean diameter of rubber fume (63 - 73  nm) was (larger than diesel exhaust [12  nm] and outdoor dust [50  nm]).

Particle sizes of 5 nm– 30 µm and charge levels ranging from neutralized to ten times the saturation limit were considered.

We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from the planet in this bandpass is 76 ± 3 % of the maximum flux; this corresponds to minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 ± 48 K and 1220 ± 47 K, respectively.

40|$|Hot Jupiter" extrasolar {{planets are}} {{expected}} to be tidally locked because they are close (< 0. 05 astronomical units, where 1 AU is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11 K at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16 ± 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a <b>hot</b> spot <b>shifted</b> east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.

40|$|Kepler has {{detected}} numerous exoplanet transits {{by measuring}} stellar {{light in a}} single visible-wavelength band. In addition to detection, the precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, {{which can be used}} to study the dynamic processes on these planets. However, the interpretation of these observations can be {{complicated by the fact that}} visible-wavelength phase curves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets. Here we present a semi-analytical model framework that can be applied to study Kepler and future visible-wavelength phase curve observations of exoplanets. The model efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission components for both rocky and gaseous planets, considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous surfaces or atmospheres. We analyze the phase curves of the gaseous planet Kepler- 7 b and the rocky planet Kepler- 10 b using the model. In general, we find that a hot exoplanet's visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant phase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class requires a thermal <b>hot</b> spot <b>shifted</b> to one side of the substellar point, and the other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the substellar point. Particularly for Kepler- 7 b, reflective clouds located on the west side of the substellar point can best explain its phase curve. The reflectivity of the clear part of the atmosphere should be less than 7 % and that of the cloudy part should be greater than 80 %, and the cloud boundary should be located at 11 ° ± 3 ° to the west of the substellar point.

After correcting for systematics, we found fourteen systems with significant detections {{in each of the}} phase curve components: planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations. We model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary and secondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures and planet masses. Most planets manifest low optical geometric albedos (< 0. 25), with the exception of Kepler- 10 b, Kepler- 91 b and KOI- 13 b. We find that KOI- 13 b, with a small eccentricity of 0. 0006 + 0. 0001, is the only planet for which an eccentric orbit is favored. We detect a third harmonic with an amplitude of 1. 9 + 0. 2 ppm for HAT-P- 7 b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonic for KOI- 13 b reported in Esteves et al. : both could be due to their spin-orbit misalignments. For six planets, we report a planetary brightness peak offset from the substellar point: of those, the hottest two (Kepler- 76 b and HAT-P- 7 b) exhibit pre-eclipse shifts or to the evening-side, while the cooler four (Kepler- 7 b, Kepler- 8 b, Kepler- 12 b and Kepler- 41 b) peak post-eclipse or on the morning-side. Our findings dramatically increase the number of Kepler planets with detected planetary light offsets, and provide the first evidence in the Kepler data for a correlation between the peak offset direction and the planet's temperature. Such a correlation could arise if thermal emission dominates light from hotter planets that harbor <b>hot</b> spots <b>shifted</b> toward the evening-side, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominates cooler planets with clouds on the planet's morning-side.

40|$|AbstractThe {{solidification}} {{of metals}} {{continues to be}} a phenomenon of great interest to physicists, metallurgists, casting engineers and software developers. It directly affects the production cycle time, internal quality of castings and material utilization (yield). The process of casting solidification is complex in nature and the simulation of such process is required in industry before it is actually undertaken. The volumetric contraction accompanying solidification of molten metal manifests in defects like shrinkage cavity, porosity, and sink. These defects can be minimized by an intelligent methoding and simulation using casting software. In this paper, an attempt has been made to redesign and develop a casting free from defects, in particular, shrinkage defect. The component taken for methoding and simulation study was subjected to high amount of shrinkage defects which was the major cause for the rejection in the foundry. It also was having very low yield as 45 % as per the foundry information. The component under study consists of square shaped (at top) plate having three perforations with diminishing height (at bottom) and subjected to multiple hot spot. Therefore, optimum location of feeder has been identified by carrying out various simulation trials. Proper feeding aids have helped in getting the <b>hot</b> spot completely <b>shifted</b> inside the feeder. Simulation based approach has helped in the improvement of the feedability index which represents yield of feeders and quality of casting (percentage of volume free from shrinkage porosity).

40|$|The {{catalytic}} core of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III contains three tightly associated subunits, the α, ɛ, and θ subunits. The θ subunit is {{the smallest}} and least understood subunit. The three-dimensional structure of θ in a complex with the unlabeled N-terminal domain of the ɛ subunit, ɛ 186, was determined by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure was refined using pseudocontact shifts that resulted from inserting a lanthanide ion (Dy 3 +, Er 3 +, or Ho 3 +) at the active site of ɛ 186. The structure determination revealed a three-helix bundle fold {{that is similar to}} the solution structures of θ in a methanol-water buffer and of the bacteriophage P 1 homolog, HOT, in aqueous buffer. Conserved nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) patterns obtained for free and complexed θ show that most of the structure changes little upon complex formation. Discrepancies with respect to a previously published structure of free θ (Keniry et al., Protein Sci. 9 : 721 - 733, 2000) were attributed to errors in the latter structure. The present structure satisfies the pseudocontact shifts better than either the structure of θ in methanol-water buffer or the structure of <b>HOT.</b> satisfies these <b>shifts.</b> The epitope of ɛ 186 on θ was mapped by NOE difference spectroscopy and was found to involve helix 1 and the C-terminal part of helix 3.

The images are all phase-referenced to the stable reference point of the core of M 81, allowing us to display them relative to the supernova explosion center. At 50 d, SN 1993 J is almost unresolved with a radius of 520 AU. The shell structure becomes discernible at 175 d. The brightness of the ridge of the projected shell is not uniform, but rather varies by a factor of two, having a distinct maximum to the south-east and a minimum to the west. Over the next ~ 350 d, this pattern appears to rotate counter-clockwise. After two years, the structure becomes more complex with hot spots developing in the east, south, and west. The pattern of modulation continues to change, and after five years the three <b>hot</b> spots have <b>shifted</b> somewhat. After nine years, the radio shell has expanded to a radius of 19, 000 AU.

Allowing for absorption, we find that the thickness of the shell is (25 +/- 3) % of its outer radius. We find no compact source in the central region and conclude that any pulsar nebula in the center of SN 1993 J is either much fainter than the Crab or affected by remaining significant internal radio absorption.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Understanding the past, present, {{and future}} {{behavior}} of our nation's shorelines {{is vital for}} sensible coastal management. Localized areas of erosion, termed "erosional <b>hot</b> spots", can <b>shift</b> the shoreline landward threatening coastal infrastructure (Kraus and Galgano, 2001; Stauble and Gravens, 2004; McNinch, 2004). One specific type of erosional hot spot {{that is capable of}} causing damage to coastal dunes, cliffs, and property is a rip current embayment (Komar and Rea, 1976; Komar, 1983; Komar et al., 1988; Thornton et al., 2007). These features are hypothesized to form when rip currents transport sand from the beach face to the offshore forming localized embayments (Komar 1971). Due to the difficulty in obtaining bathymetric and hydrodynamic data for these features, they are not well understood. In the work reported here we take advantage of available extensive and synoptic topographic data to characterize the morphology of plausible rip current embayments found along stretches of the Oregon coast. Following the quantification of rip current embayment morphology a numerical modeling study is performed to briefly investigate the nearshore hydrodynamics within a typical rip current embayment. 	Lidar data along the Oregon coastline, collected in 1997, 1998, and 2002 (NOAA 2007 a), provides high resolution topographic data for the analysis of the beach face morphology including rip current embayments. From these data, four continuous, sandy beach sections of the Oregon coastline were selected to be studied. A methodology based on these data is presented and is used to quantify and summarize the observed physical scales of rip current embayments using topographic data. Four morphologic characteristics are measured and tabulated for each embayment including length, amplitude, aspect ratio, and skewness. The number of embayments, embayment location, mean embayment location, and spacing at each study site are then compared. A total of 98 embayments occupying 77...|$|R
40|$|Solar is a {{renewable}} energy {{that can be}} used to provide process heat to industrial sites. Solar is extremely variable and to use it reliably thermal storage is necessary. Heat recovery loops (HRL) are an indirect method for transferring heat from one process to another using an intermediate fluid (e. g. water, oil). With HRL’s thermal storage is also necessary to effectively meet the stop/start time dependent nature of the multiple source and sink streams. Combining solar heating with HRL’s makes sense as a means of reducing costs by sharing common storage infrastructure and pipe transport systems and by lowering nonrenewable hot utility demand. To maximise the value of solar in a HRL, the means of controlling the HRL needs to be considered. In this paper, the HRL example and design method of Walmsley et al. (2013) is employed to demonstrate the potential benefits of applying solar heating using the HRL variable temperature storage (VTS) approach and the conventional HRL constant temperature storage (CTS) approach. Results show the VTS approach is superior to the CTS approach for both the non-solar and solar integration cases. When the pinch is around the hot storage temperature the CST approach is constrained and the addition of solar heating to the HRL decreases hot utility at the expenses of increased cold utility. For the VTS approach the <b>hot</b> storage pinch <b>shifts</b> to a cold storage pinch and increased heat recovery is possible for the same exchanger area without solar. With solar the VTS approach can maintain the same heat recovery while also reducing hot utility still further due to the presence of solar, but only with additional area. When the pinch is located around the cold storage temperature, solar heating can be treated as an additional heat source and the benefits of CTS and VTS are comparable...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{ionic liquid}} (IL) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([bmim][DCA]) as the {{absorbent}} on {{the shell side}} of a membrane module containing either a porous hydrophobized ceramic tubule or porous hydrophobized polyether ether ketone (PEEK) hollow fiber membranes, studies for CO{sub 2 } removal from <b>hot</b> simulated pre-combustion <b>shifted</b> syngas were carried out by a novel pressure swing membrane absorption (PSMAB) process. Helium {{was used as a}} surrogate for H{sub 2 } in a simulated shifted syngas with CO{sub 2 } around 40 % (dry gas basis). In this cyclic separation process, the membrane module was used to achieve non-dispersive gas absorption from a high-pressure feed gas (689 - 1724 kPag; 100 - 250 psig) at temperatures between 25 - 1000 C into a stationary absorbent liquid on the module shell side during a certain part of the cycle followed by among other cycle steps controlled desorption of the absorbed gases from the liquid {{in the rest of the}} cycle. Two product streams were obtained, one He-rich and the other CO{sub 2 }-rich. Addition of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer of generation 0 to IL [bmim][DCA] improved the system performance at higher temperatures. The solubilities of CO{sub 2 } and He were determined in the ionic liquid with or without the dendrimer in solution as well as in the presence or absence of moisture; polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 was also studied as a replacement for the IL. The solubility selectivity of the ionic liquid containing the dendrimer for CO{sub 2 } over helium was considerably larger than that for the pure ionic liquid. The solubility of CO{sub 2 } and CO{sub 2 }-He solubility selectivity of PEG 400 and a solution of the dendrimer in PEG 400 were higher than the corresponding ones in the IL, [bmim][DCA]. A mathematical model was developed to describe the PSMAB process; a numerical solution of the governing equations described successfully the observed performance of the PSMAB process for the pure ionic liquid-based system...|$|R
40|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) is {{a fast-growing}} {{technology}} in which several hundreds/thousands of optical mirrors concentrate the solar energy onto a receiver. The received energy {{can be used}} to produce electricity through thermodynamic cycles or to drive an endothermic chemical reaction for chemicals production (e. g. solar fuels) or for chemical storage. The receiver is a crucial part of the whole system, as it owns the severe task of collecting and transferring the concentrated solar energy minimizing the heat losses. Dense fluidized beds have been proposed as CSP receivers thanks to their large heat-transfer and thermal diffusivity coefficients, and their use is currently under investigation (1 - 2). Directly-irradiated fluidized bed receivers are very promising in the context of solar chemistry and CSP applications, but they can undergo to extensive bed surface overheating. Tailoring bed hydrodynamics close to the region where the incident power is concentrated may disclose effective measures to improve the interaction between the incident radiative flux and the bed in order to maximize the receiver efficiency and mitigate the bed surface overheating. The present work addresses the study of the interaction between a concentrated solar radiation and bed surface. The experimental apparatus schematically reported in figure 1 a mainly consists of: i) a fluidized bed reactor (square 0. 78 x 0. 78 m bed column, 0. 6 m tall); ii) a simulated solar radiation source, consisting of a short-arc Xe lamp coupled with an elliptical reflector, whose spatial flux distribution map is shown in Figure 1 b; iii) a Bubble Generation System (BGS), able to produce bubbles with a minimum diameter of 0. 045 m at a maximum frequency of 2 Hz, connected to a submerged nozzle aligned with {{the focal point of the}} simulated solar beam. SiC particles (127 m) were used as solid bed material. The main diagnostic tool is represented by an infrared camera used to map the bed surface temperature. Tests were performed at incipient fluidization condition injecting through the nozzle bubbles with different diameters and at different frequencies keeping constant the gas flow rate. Two snapshot sequences of the bubble eruption phenomena are reported in Figure 2. It can be observed that increasing bubble diameter the lateral dispersion heat at bed surface is more efficient, as the <b>hot</b> particles are <b>shifted</b> towards a larger annular region. Nevertheless, the long delay between two successive bubble eruption events brings to a larger bed surface overheating, which could result into a fluidized particles degradation or into higher heat losses due to re-irradiation. A trade-off between these two-fold results has to be found to optimize bed hydrodynamics in CSP applications...|$|R
