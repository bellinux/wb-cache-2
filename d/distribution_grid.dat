5|$|In April {{and early}} May, ethnic {{tensions}} in Zadar and northern Dalmatia escalated after increased sabotage activities targeting communications, the power <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> and other property. On 2 May, the situation continued to deteriorate after the killings of Croatian policemen at Borovo Selo and Franko Lisica (a {{member of the}} Croatian special police) {{in the village of}} Polača (near Zadar) by Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) troops. The news incited riots in Zadar that day, with crowds marching through the city centre demanding weapons to confront the Croatian Serbs and smashing the windows of shops owned by Serbian companies and Serbs living in the city. Croat-owned businesses in Knin were destroyed in retaliation during the night of 7–8 May. The JNA took an active role in events in nearby Benkovac on 19 May, distributing a leaflet with the names of 41 Croats targeted for immediate execution and providing weapons to SAO Krajina forces in the area. In late May, the conflict gradually escalated to exchanges of mortar fire.|$|E

In this paper, a distributed continuation power flow method is presented for solving the VSA problem of integrated grid and the computation architecture of DCPF is developed.

The parameterization switching strategy and optimal multiplier technique are employed to guarantee the convergence of the proposed method. The reactive capability limits of different type of DGs and unbalanced three-phase <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are considered.

While generating hydrogen at centralized primary energy plants promises higher hydrogen production efficiency, difficulties in high-volume, long range hydrogen transportation (due to factors such as [...] hydrogen damage and the ease of hydrogen diffusion through solid materials) makes electrical energy distribution attractive within a hydrogen economy. In such a scenario, small regional plants or even local filling stations could generate hydrogen using energy provided through the electrical <b>distribution</b> <b>grid.</b> While hydrogen generation efficiency {{is likely to be}} lower than for centralized hydrogen generation, losses in hydrogen transport could make such a scheme more efficient in terms of the primary energy used per kilogram of hydrogen delivered to the end user.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of distributed generators connected to the distribution system at the low and medium voltage level requires a reliable monitoring of <b>distribution</b> <b>grids.</b> Economic considerations prevent a full observation of <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> with direct measurements. First state-of-the-art approaches using artificial neural networks (ANN) for monitoring <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> with {{a limited amount of}} measurements exist. These approaches, however, have strong limitations. We develop a new solution for distribution system monitoring overcoming these limitations by 1. presenting a novel training procedure for the ANN, enabling its use in <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> with a high amount of distributed generation and a very limited amount of measurements, far less than is traditionally required by the state-of-the-art Weighted Least Squares (WLS) state estimation (SE), 2. using mutliple hidden layers in the ANN, increasing the estimation accuracy, 3. including switch statuses as inputs to the ANN, eliminating the need for individual ANN for each switching state, 4. estimating line current magnitudes additionally to voltage magnitudes. Simulations performed with an elaborate evaluation approach on a real and a benchmark grid demonstrate that the proposed ANN scheme clearly outperforms state-of-the-art ANN schemes and WLS SE under normal operating conditions and different situations such as gross measurement errors.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{technological}} challenges {{in solving the}} global power flow problem. Firstly, the transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are operated and managed by different control centers in existing dispatch and control system of power grid. The models of TPSs and DNs are maintained separately and transferring models is against privacy protection rules, so {{it is hard to}} directly solve a whole power flow model in the field. Secondly, the transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are different in voltage level, topology structure and impedance parameters, which would lead to numerical difficulties. Thirdly, the size of the integrated power system is considerably large. In addition, the three-phase unbalanced characteristic of the <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> is prominent while the transmission grids are balanced. A “master-slave-splitting” (MSS) based method was proposed in [5, 6]. By decomposing the global power flow into a single transmission power flow master sub-problem and multiple distribution power flow sub-problems, this method addresses the above challenges effectively.|$|R

The impedance characteristics of the power grid need to be well understood {{for the design of}} efficient and robust high performance power <b>distribution</b> <b>grids.</b> The physical mechanisms underlying the dependence of inductance on frequency are discussed. The {{variation of}} inductance with frequency in three types of power grids is analyzed in terms of these mechanisms. The inductance of power <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> decreases with signal frequency. The decrease in inductance in non-interdigitated grids is primarily due to current redistribution in multiple forward and return current paths. In interdigitated grids, the variation of inductance with frequency is fairly small, typically less than 10 % because both proximity and multi-path current redistribution effects are minimal. In paired grids, the relative decrease in inductance with frequency is larger as compared to interdigitated grids. This behavior is due to significant proximity effects. The smaller the separation between the power and ground lines and the wider the lines, the more significant proximity effects become and the greater the relative decrease in inductance with frequency...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{process for}} grid companies {{in order to}} reduce power losses in electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> is to figure out where and how they appear. This report describes the factors that cause power losses in low voltage <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> and methods for how they could be measured and analyzed. Measurement data for consumed and injected energy were collected for twelve low voltage <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> owned by Gävle Energi AB in order to analyze the size of the power losses and how the measurement uncertainty affects the collected data. Then models of three of the grids were created in MATLAB in order to analyze the data and the power losses were calculated to be compared to the collected data. Curve fitting were also used as a method in order to analyze the power losses from collected data. The results show that the losses in the studied grids are low. The measurement uncertainty is also low when losses are studied for long time periods, but high when losses are studied for short periods such as single hours. The calculated power losses from the MATLAB calculations seem to be lower than the measured power losses, which could indicate that a more complex model is needed for these kinds of studies. With a good interaction between the grid information system and the system that is storing measurement data it should be possible for grid companies to chart their power losses and with an accurate model of the grids the power losses can be calculated theoretically which should make it possible to analyze the causes of power losses in low voltage <b>distribution</b> <b>grids...</b>|$|R

In power <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> with alternating power and ground lines, the inductance is shown to vary linearly with grid length and inversely linearly with the number of lines in the grid. The inductance is also relatively constant with frequency in these grid structures. These properties permit the efficient estimation of the inductive characteristics of power <b>distribution</b> <b>grids.</b> To optimize the process of allocating on-chip metal resources, inductance/area/resistance tradeoffs in high speed performance <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are explored. Two tradeoff scenarios in power grids with alternating power and ground lines are considered. In the first scenario, the total area occupied by the grid lines is maintained constant and the grid inductance versus grid resistance tradeoff is evaluated as the width of the grid lines varies. In the second scenario, the metal area of the grid is maintained constant and the grid inductance versus grid area tradeoff is investigated. In both cases, the grid inductance increases virtually linearly with line width, rising more then eightfold for a tenfold increase in line width. The grid resistance and grid area, however, decrease relatively slowly with line width. This decrease in grid resistance and area is limited to a factor of two under assumed interconnect characteristics...|$|R
