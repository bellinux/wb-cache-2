The terrace fills {{the gap between the}} left field bleachers and the Rivertowne Brewing Hall of Fame Club and is open to any fan with a ticket. Another addition includes a new outdoor patio that overlooks center field, right next to the terraces. The patio is now known as [...] "The Porch." [...] The Porch features bar tables and outdoor sofa-style seating, and accommodates groups of 25 people. Among the other additions for the 2015 season are: The Corner, which is a full-service bar at the very base of the left field rotunda with 9 flat screen TVs; Terrace Bar, which is a fully operating bar for fans in the upper concourse; and Pirates Outfitters, an additional merchandise shop located next to the home-plate entrance.

In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).|$|R

In addition, a <b>foot</b> <b>bar</b> was added to control the rudder.The 1st Aero Squadron of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps received eight JN-2s at San Diego in July 1915. The squadron was transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in August {{to work with the}} Field Artillery School, during which one JN-2 crashed, resulting in a fatality. The pilots of the squadron met with its commander, Capt. Benjamin Foulois, to advise that the JN-2 was unsafe because of low power, shoddy construction, lack of stability, and overly sensitive rudder. Foulois and his executive officer Capt. Thomas D. Milling disagreed, and flights continued until a second JN-2 crashed in early September, resulting in the grounding of the six remaining JN-2s until mid-October. When two new JN-3s were delivered, the grounded aircraft were then upgraded in accordance with the new design. In March 1916, these eight JN-3s were deployed to Mexico for aerial observation during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916-1917.|$|E

The results obtained from the presser <b>foot</b> <b>bar</b> displacement and compression force, together with the graphic kinematic analysis, which includes the velocity and acceleration taken from the displacement-time curves of the presser bar, led to further understanding of the feeding system dynamics. This study is providing the basis {{for the development of a}} redesigned and optimized fabric feeding system. The new actuation system, based on a proportional force solenoid integrated in the presser <b>foot</b> <b>bar,</b> will be also discussed as an important contribution to achieving a desired dynamic behaviour at high sewing speeds...|$|E
40|$|Sewing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes in the apparel industry for the production of high-quality garments. Although some research and improvements have been carried out in this area, the sewing process has remained almost unchanged throughout the years, staying largely dependent on the operator skills to set up sewing parameters and to handle the fabrics being sewn. Slight changes in sewing machine settings can influence the quality of seams, as well as sewing operation time. To avoid these empirical settings, reduce set-up times and improve machine performance, flexibility and sewing quality, an electromagnetic actuated presser foot, based on the use of a proportional force solenoid, was developed and implemented on an industrial overlock sewing machine. The compression force and displacement waveforms from the presser <b>foot</b> <b>bar</b> will be studied in this paper, as well as the admiss ible displacement limits used to monitor (on- and offline) fabricsâ€™ feeding efficiency. Following this analysis, a new research programme was established to enable a PC-based open- and closed-loop control of the presser foot system. This paper also highlights these recent developments, presenting and discussing, in detail, a PID closed-loop control strategy. The obtained results show that the presser foot closed-loop control has improved performance for a wide speed variation range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to enhance {{productivity}} and economic value with precise object information generation and reinforcement quantity take-off by developing the Automation Reinforcement Placement System of Foundation (ARPF). This study was conducted by selecting the most basic form, spread footing, and no force was applied on the foundation other than axial force. For the development of ARPF, variables that should be input into the typical programs directly by users were minimized through developing the reinforcement placement algorithm by using visual C# based on the reinforced concrete structure design standard. The process of reinforcement detail placement formation was performed in the Tekla Structure (TS) that has outstanding accessibility and usability of API. Objects made by applying ARPF enable information confirmation and modification, as typical ones. Through this process using ARPF, rapid and precise reinforcement quantity take-off and <b>footing</b> <b>bar</b> placement are possible. If modeling is performed on the Tekla Structures by using ARPF, a detailed 3 D reinforcement placing drawing, not 2 D, can be created. It is expected that this method may take a smaller amount of time and effort than the typical drawing generation method that users had to generate objects or input information themselves...|$|R
