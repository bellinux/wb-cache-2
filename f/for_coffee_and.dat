5|$|Soaring demand <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> rubber brought Brazil {{an influx}} of revenue in the early 1900s. Simultaneously, there was a drive {{on the part of}} {{prominent}} Brazilians, most notably the Baron of Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the National Congress of Brazil in October 1904 in accordance with their belief that a powerful navy would be crucial to the achievement of this goal, but it was two years before any ships were ordered.|$|E
5|$|Also at {{the dawn}} of the new century, however, rising demand <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{reproducibility}} <b>and</b> {{validity of}} <b>coffee,</b> decaffeinated <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea intake {{has not been}} adequately studied, particularly in Italy, where coffee drinking is peculiar in terms of type <b>and</b> amount of <b>coffee</b> consumed. Design: We compared <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea consumption, measured by two interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), with average intake derived from two 7 -day dietary (DD) records (the reference method) on 395 volunteers. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) {{were used to assess}} both reproducibility and validity of information on coffee intake. Results: A satisfactory level of reproducibility and validity of the pattern consumption was observed <b>for</b> <b>coffee,</b> decaffeinated <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea. The reproducibility for both sex combined showed r of 0. 74 - 0. 78 <b>for</b> <b>coffee,</b> 0. 57 - 0. 65 <b>for</b> decaffeinated <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> 0. 61 - 0. 67 for tea. The validity was about 0. 70 <b>for</b> <b>coffee,</b> around 0. 58 <b>for</b> decaffeinated <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> 0. 56 - 0. 60 for tea intake. Conclusions: The FFQ is a satisfactorily reliable and valid instrument for collecting information on <b>coffee,</b> decaffeinated <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea intake...|$|R
5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.|$|E
5|$|The {{late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century demand <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> rubber led to Brazil's coffee economy and rubber boom. At the time, it was {{estimated}} that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, Minas Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years. Simultaneously, there was an effort on the part of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, soaring demand <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> rubber brought {{prosperity}} to the Brazilian economy. The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a large naval building program in 1904, which authorized the construction of a large number of warships, including three battleships. The Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship Norge and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800longtons (12,000tonnes), have a speed of 19knots (22mph; 35km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9inches (23cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.|$|E

25|$|During the Civil War, yaupon tea {{was used}} as a {{substitute}} <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use by on Knotts Island, North Carolina. During the Interwar period the United States Department of Agriculture investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina. In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} 1864, {{surgeons}} {{refused to}} send recovering prisoners back to the barracks due to the rampant scurvy, attributable to Hoffman's policy of withholding vegetables from the prisoners. In October 1864, 984 of 7,402 prisoners were reported as sick in the barracks. Meanwhile, in November 1864, as repairs were being carried out, water was cut off to the camp and even to the hospital.

25|$|In 1984, Nathanson {{reported}} {{an effect of}} methylxanthines on larvae of the tobacco hornworm. He administered solutions of finely powdered tea leaves or coffee beans to the larvae and observed, at concentrations between 0.3 and 10% <b>for</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> 0.1 to 3% for tea, inhibition of feeding, associated with hyperactivity and tremor. At higher concentrations, larvae were killed within 24 hours. He repeated the experiments with purified caffeine {{and concluded that the}} drug was responsible for the effect, and the concentration differences between coffee beans and tea leaves originated from 2–3 times higher caffeine content in the latter. Similar action was observed for IBMX on mosquito larvae, mealworm larvae, butterfly larvae and milkweed bug nymphs, that is, inhibition of feeding and death at higher doses. Flour beetles were unaffected by IBMX up to 3% concentrations, but long-term experiments revealed suppression of reproductive activity.|$|E
