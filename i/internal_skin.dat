The experimental tests were conducted using a two-storey rig with double-skin facade installed. Test results showed that double-layer of toughened glass panes broke when the temperatures reached about 600 [*]°C– 800 [*]°C; the fire and smoke plume from the fire room {{were more likely to}} impede on the external skin in the cavity at the steady burning stage, and this could cause the external skin to break. The FDS model was employed to simulate one of the experimental tests and further used to study the effect of fire sources and cavity depths. Numerical modellings show good agreement when comparing the modelled temperatures with the measured temperatures next to the <b>internal</b> <b>skins</b> and external skins. For fully-developed fires in the modelling scenarios, the fire and smoke plume hit the external panes without any attaching to the internal panes.

40|$|Dried fruits like {{nuts are}} very much appreciated, but because of their low water {{activity}} may be susceptible to undesirable changes during storage. Therefore, this work was undertaken to study the effect of different storage conditions on three types of nuts commonly consumed in Portugal (almond, hazelnut and walnut). The samples were originated from different countries and while most had the <b>internal</b> <b>skin</b> on, one sample had it off. The storage conditions tested were: ambient temperature, high temperatures (50 and 50 ºC) and low temperatures (refrigeration at + 2 ºC and freezing at – 15 ºC). The characteristics evaluated were water activity, moisture content, colour and texture. The results obtained in the present work allowed concluding that the storage conditions that best preserve the characteristics of nuts are those at low temperatures, because, while the treatments at high temperatures induced in general more changes, the refrigeration and freezing systems had a lower effect on the products characteristics, particularly moisture, water activity, hardness and friability. Also {{the results indicate that}} the nuts stored under all conditions tested had values of water activity lower than 0. 6, thus guaranteeing stability at the microbial and enzymatic levels. It was further concluded that the <b>internal</b> <b>skin</b> had a great influence on the characteristics of the nuts, particularly texture and colour, for all treatments tested...|$|E

Nozzles with chordal boattail angles of 10, 20, and 30 degrees, with and without surface rippling, were tested. No effect on discharge coefficient due to surface rippling was observed.

40|$|Housing {{which has}} good thermal {{performance}} provides a steady and comfortable internal environment and has less energy consumption {{regardless of the}} weather conditions. The contribution of thermal mass is well recognized, however the influence of heavy (masonry) internal partition walls and concrete floor slabs is often passed over when considering the enhancement of the overall thermal performance. The impact of the internal thermal mass of masonry components, {{in the form of}} internal partition walls and the interior leaf of multi-layered enclosure walls, on the overall temperature variations and energy consumption of housing is investigated in the paper. The results are based on a detailed study of the performance of several full scale housing test modules incorporating a range of typical Australian walling systems. The study confirmed the premise that the thermal resistance (R-value) alone (a steadystate parameter) cannot represent the actual dynamic thermal performance of a building. The relative performance of the walling systems varied with season, but in general, the thermal mass of the partition walls and the <b>internal</b> <b>skins</b> of the enclosure walling systems were effective in absorbing energy from solar ingress and dampening the effects of the external diurnal temperature swings. This influence improves the thermal performance and has the potential to minimise the need for artificial heating and cooling in both new dwellings and in the retrofitting of existing houses...|$|R
40|$|The {{interior}} of the contemporary art gallery provides its users with a sterilised laboratory for the placement and experience of art. Increasingly, its bleached interior presents an a priori condition for the legitimate assignment of artworks within the complex milieu of the contemporary city. Such interiors have become an architectural typology, a predetermined homogenous non-place within which artworks can reside. In this sense we can look to Lefebvre {{in order to understand}} the condition of the gallery space for ‘inasmuch as abstract space tends towards homogeneity, towards the elimination of existing differences or peculiarities, a new space cannot be born (produced) unless it accentuates differences. ’ (Lefebvre: 1991, 52) The work of the artist, by contrast, liberates difference. More specifically, the art of performance simultaneously generates and exposes marginal space within the gallery interior; it is a corporeal action that deposits residual stains and blemishes across the galleries <b>internal</b> <b>skin,</b> leaving marks and traces that resist homogeneity to create a temporary site of differential experience. The lost, forgotten or overlooked marginal zones and irregularities of the gallery space become a point of ephemeral spectacle and this paper addresses the impact of this spatial and corporeal collision. The research that informs and situates these phenomena traces the lost and unrecorded spaces, irregularities, marks, blemishes and scars that exist within the gallery space before, during and after the performance act. Recorded through orthographic drawing conventions, the research generates a narrative cartography of corporeal intervention within the gallery interior. The co-authors of this research form a practical and tangible collaboration that fuses the dynamics and complexities of the performer’s body with the fixed conventions of architectural drawings. This paper will explore how the body can become an instrument to record and describe the gallery interior beyond, yet from within, traditional architectural systems of representation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. Aircraft {{in-flight}} icing {{is a major}} {{safety issue}} for civil aviation, having already caused hundreds of accidents and incidents related to aerodynamic degradation due to post takeoff ice accretion. Airplane makers have to protect the airframe critical surfaces against ice build up {{in order to ensure}} continued safe flight. Ice protection is typically performed by mechanical, chemical, or thermal systems. One of the most traditional and still used techniques is the one known as hot-air anti-icing, which heats the interior of the affected surfaces with an array of small hot-air jets generated by a piccolo tube. In some cases, the thermal energy provided by hot-air ice protection systems is high enough to fully evaporate the impinging supercooled droplets (fully evaporative systems), while in other cases, it is only sufficient to maintain most of the protected region free of ice (running wet systems). In the latter case, runback ice formations are often observed downstream of the wing leading edge depending on hot-air, icing, and flight conditions. The design process of hot-air anti-icing systems is traditionally based on icing wind tunnel experiments, which can be very costly. The experimental effort can be significantly reduced with the use of accurate three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation tools. Nevertheless, such type of simulation requires extensive CPU time for exploring all the design variables. This thesis deals with the development of an efficient hot-air anti-icing system simulation tool that can reduce the computational time to identify the critical design parameters by at least two orders of magnitude, as compared to 3 -d CFD tools, therefore narrowing down the use of more sophisticated tools to just a small subset of the entire design space. The hot-air anti-icing simulation tool is based on a combination of available CFD software and a thermodynamic model developed in the present work. The computation of the external flow properties is performed with FLUENT (in a 2 -d domain) by assuming an isothermal condition to the airfoil external wall. The <b>internal</b> <b>skin</b> heat transfer is computed with the use of local Nusselt number correlations developed through calibrations with CFD data. The internal and external flow properties on the airfoil skin are provided as inputs to a steady state thermodynamic model, which is composed of a 2 -d heat diffusion model and a 1 -d uniform film model for the runback water flow. The performance of the numerical tool was tested against 3 -d CFD simulation and experimental data obtained for a wing equipped with a representative piccolo tube anti-icing system. The results demonstrate that the simplifications do not affect significantly the fidelity of the predictions, suggesting that the numerical tool can be used to support parametric and optimization studies during the development of hot-air anti-icing systems...|$|E
50|$|Mallite {{is a type}} of {{laminate}} composite material, formerly {{manufactured by}} the William Mallinson & Sons company. The material is formed of a core sheet of end grain balsa wood, faced by duralumin sheets. This construction endows the finished material with greater strength and rigidity than a light alloy sheet of equal mass. The material was originally developed in the late 1950s for use in the aerospace industry, primarily for use in flooring and internal partitioning in jet airliner construction. However, it found fame {{as one of the first}} engineered composite materials to be employed in the motorsport industry. Robin Herd, formerly a designer on the Concorde project, used his aerospace knowledge to design the first McLaren single-seater racing cars. The M2A prototype used Mallite extensively, throughout its construction. The final production model, the Formula One McLaren M2B of 1966, only used Mallite for its <b>internal</b> <b>skins</b> and lower bodywork; a lack of understanding of the material's properties had led the team to design the car with conventional curved bodywork, creating problems during the fabrication process as the inherently inflexible material would not readily conform to complex, compound curvatures.
