25|$|Fractal {{dimensions}} {{were first}} applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms {{for which the}} details seemed {{more important than the}} gross picture. <b>For</b> sets <b>describing</b> ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical fractal dimension equals the set's familiar Euclidean or topological dimension. Thus, it is 0 <b>for</b> sets <b>describing</b> points (0-dimensional sets); 1 <b>for</b> sets <b>describing</b> lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 <b>for</b> sets <b>describing</b> surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 <b>for</b> sets <b>describing</b> volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). But this changes for fractal sets. If the theoretical fractal dimension of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have fractal geometry.|$|R

These languages can be convenient <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the framework of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.|$|E

5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E

The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

5|$|The {{discipline}} of plant ecology was pioneered {{in the late}} 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited {{with the idea of}} climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
