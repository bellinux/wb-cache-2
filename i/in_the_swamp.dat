5|$|At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew {{is confronted}} by Barbossa {{and his men}} and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish {{suddenly}} arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp.</b> When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne's Revenge and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena {{goes back to the}} dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.|$|E
5|$|During the event, a Warlord infiltrates Camelot and poisons Squire Everett. The party {{collects}} {{an antidote}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Swamp</b> of Zagar and saves the Squire.

They rescue {{the son of}} the Gnome King to obtain the fifth Key of Truth, and collects four Elemental Keys to unlock access to Castle Vilor and the sixth Key of Truth. The party finds the seventh and eighth Keys of Truth in Crownhorn village and the Cape of Death, respectively. The ninth and tenth Keys are found in Blackroot Keep and the Dark Citadel while searching for the missing pieces of the Staff of Rhiothamus, which can break open a path in Hadrian's Wall.|$|E
5|$|The third Chinook carried {{half of the}} {{enhanced}} A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but {{had been unable to}} determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E
40|$|A five week {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Botala region of <b>the</b> Likouala <b>swamps,</b> northern Congo. <b>The</b> aims {{of the study were}} as follows: To obtain preliminary information on distribution and density of large mammals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamps,</b> particularly elephants and gorillas. To collect preliminary data on hunting practices and the importance and extent of <b>the</b> bushmeat trade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Botala region. To assess the possible impact of hunting on large mammal populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamps.</b> To discuss <b>the</b> potential and/or need for conservation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Likouala <b>swamps.</b> Swamp vegetation where Raphia sp. is dominant contained exceptionally high gorillc [...] densities strongly suggesting that <b>the</b> Likouala <b>swamps</b> offer primary habitat anu hold a high population of gorillas.

25|$|During the 33rd's time in Tullahoma, {{several members}} of Company I (from Dale County) {{contracted}} smallpox, apparently from a soldier {{who had been on}} furlough to Columbus, Georgia.

25|$|By about 3:00p.m. on April 30, 1864, {{the federal}} forces finally crossed the Saline River {{with all their}} {{remaining}} men and the artillery pieces and equipment and supply wagons which were not irretrievably stuck in the mud, which they burned. Steele's forces were compelled to abandon many more wagons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> north of the Saline River. The Confederates did not renew the attack as Steele's men crossed the pontoon bridge {{on the afternoon of}} April 30. Not only were the Confederates exhausted from the morning’s battle, but the federal forces had set up artillery and infantry {{on the opposite side of}} the river to protect the remaining federal soldiers as they crossed the bridge. After crossing the Saline River, Steele's forces cut and burned the pontoon bridge, which they would not need for the remainder of their march. With no way to get across the river, the Confederates could not follow them. By not trapping Steele's force at Camden or cutting them off before they reached the Saline River, the Confederates under Kirby Smith lost a good chance to destroy Steele's army, which was the major portion of federal forces in Arkansas. After crossing the river and three days' further march, Steele’s forces regrouped within the fortifications of Little Rock.|$|E
