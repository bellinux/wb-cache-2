40|$|ABSTRACT. Stomach {{contents}} of 148 <b>hollowsnout</b> <b>grenadier,</b> Caelorinchus caelorhincus (RISSO, 1810), were examined. Crusta-ceans {{were found to}} be most important prey group in the diet. Polychaetes constituted the second most important prey group. Cha-etognathans were only occasionally eaten. KEY WORDS: Caelorinchus caelorhincus, food habits, diet, Aegean Sea...|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) and OCP {{concentrations were}} determined in the livers of two deep-sea fish species, roughsnout grenadier and <b>hollowsnout</b> <b>grenadier,</b> from the Adriatic Sea. In both species, contaminant concentrations {{were in the}} following order: PCBs>DDTs>>HCB. Contaminant load was higher in roughsnout grenadier (PCB: 12, 327 ngg(- 1); DDTs: 5357 ngg(- 1); HCB: 13. 1 ngg(- 1)) than in <b>hollowsnout</b> <b>grenadier</b> (PCB: 1234 ngg(- 1); DDTs: 763 ngg(- 1); HCB 6. 3 ngg(- 1)). PCB patterns were dominated by higher chlorinated congeners (hexa-CBs: 50. 3 - 52. 1 %, hepta-CBs: 29. 6 - 35. 5 %, penta-CBs: 8. 0 - 11. 1 % and octa-CBs : 5. 2 - 5. 4 %). PCBs 138, 153 180 and 187 were the most abundant. Regarding the DDT pattern, p,p'-DDE was prevalent in both species (roughsnout grenadier: 99. 7 %, hollowsnout grenadier: 90 %), suggesting no recent DDT input. In both species, the total 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations (roughsnout grenadier: mean 43. 77 pg/g, hollowsnout grenadier: mean 20. 49 pg/g), calculated from non- and mono-ortho PCBs, reached those encountered in marine organisms at higher levels in the trophic chain...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{were investigated}} in 15 composite liver samples from two deep-sea fish species, the <b>hollowsnout</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Trachyrinchus trachyrinchus, TT) and the roughsnout grenadier (Coelorhynchus coelorynchus, CC). Mean concentrations of sum tri- to hepta-BDEs were higher in CC species {{than in the}} TT species (16. 9 vs 4. 5 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively). BDE 47 and BDE 100 were the major congeners in both species. Methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs), reported as being naturally produced in marine environments, were also measured in all samples. Similar to those of PBDEs, mean concentrations of sum MeO-PBDEs (sum congeners 2 â€²-MeO-BDE 68 and 6 -MeO-BDE 47) {{were higher in the}} CC species (28. 9 vs 6. 6 ng/g lw, respectively). Interestingly, polybrominated hexahydroxanthene derivatives (PBHDs) had the highest contribution to the total load of organobromines in the deep-sea fish samples. Contrary to those of PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs, the mean concentrations of PBHDs were higher in the TT species (7040 vs 530 ng/g lw, respectively). Furthermore, an unusual profile was seen in the TT species, for which a tetrabrominated BHD isomer was the predominant isomer (up to 98 % of the sum PBHDs). This differs from the profiles of PBHDs dominated by a tribrominated BHD isomer reported until now in the literature. The mixed halogenated monoterpene (MHC- 1) and 2, 4, 6 -tribromoanisole (TBA) were detected as well, albeit at lower concentration (< 5 ng/g lw), supporting the hypothesis that these two natural products are rather abundant in shallow waters...|$|E
