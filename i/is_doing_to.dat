What the Internet <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> our brains" [...] (alternatively [...] "Is Google Making Us Stoopid?") is a {{magazine}} article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is {{highly critical of the}} Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of The Atlantic magazine as a six-page cover story. Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in , a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.|$|E

500|$|Raj Lyubov is the {{anthropologist}} in the colony, a scholar {{who holds the}} honorary rank of [...] "captain". He is depicted as being from an Indian heritage. Selver is initially a servant in the central camp; Lyubov enlists him as an assistant, and builds a relationship of trust with him. The two of them compile a dictionary of the Athshean and Terran languages. When Selver's wife Thele is raped and killed by Davidson, Selver attacks Davidson, who nearly kills him; Lyubov rescues Selver, and nurses him back to health. During {{the attack on the}} colony's headquarters, Selver tells the Athsheans to leave Lyubov's house alone, but Lyubov leaves his house and is killed by a collapsing building. As he dies, Lyubov warns Selver {{about the impact of the}} killings on the Athshean society. In comparison to Davidson, Lyubov reflects a lot upon his actions, and tries to analyze them in a detached manner. His contradictory position of being a colonial officer despite recognizing the damage that the colony <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> the Athsheans gives him migraines. He feels a strong sense of guilt at the impacts of the colony, and is willing to destroy his own reputation in order to protect the Athshean people. He is one of the only Terrans to treat the Athsheans as human beings, although this loses him the respect of his fellow Terrans.|$|E

Following his remarks several Tory MPs called for his sacking.

A senior European diplomat based in London concurred, saying that Johnson was “not taken seriously as a foreign policy actor” and was damaging British interests. He reckoned that three-fifths of the 27 EU ambassadors in London quite like Johnson but consider him ill-suited to the job, while the remaining two-fifths “positively dislike him”. [...] My interlocutors are, of course, experts in their field and fully paid-up members of the metropolitan elite. (...)

2500|$|After Joseph was born, Jacob {{decided to}} return home to his parents. Laban the Aramean was {{reluctant}} to release him, as God had blessed his flock on account of Jacob. Laban asked what he could pay Jacob. Jacob suggested that all the spotted, speckled, and brown goats and sheep of Laban's flock, at any given moment, would be his wages. Jacob placed rods of poplar, hazel, and chestnut, all of which he peeled [...] "white streaks upon them", within the flocks' watering holes or troughs in a performance of sympathetic magic, associating the stripes of the rods {{with the growth of}} stripes on the livestock. Despite this practicing of magic, later on Jacob says to his wives that it was God who made the livestock give birth to the convenient offspring, in order to turn the tide against the deceptive Laban. As time passed, Laban's sons noticed that Jacob was taking the better part of their flocks, and so Laban's friendly attitude towards Jacob began to change. The angel of the Lord, in a dream back during the breeding season, told Jacob [...] "Now lift your eyes and see [...] all the he goats mounting the animals are ringed, speckled, and striped, [...] for I have seen all that Laban <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> you", that he is the God whom Jacob met at Bethel, and that Jacob should leave {{and go back to the}} land where he was born, which he and his wives and children did without informing Laban.

2500|$|According to IDW, {{the first}} issue had reached over 90,000pre-orders by October2012 and {{exceeded}} 100,000 just before its release; most single issues of comics do not see sales in excess of 10,000to 12,000, particularly for publishers other than DC Comics or Marvel, according to Price. In light of this number, IDW announced plans to run a second printing of the first comic along with the collectible box set in December, and ultimately ended up reprinting the issue four times. The large number of pre-orders for an all-ages comic has been considered a boom for the comics industry; the pre-order numbers exceeded those for other, more traditional comics like DC's The New 52 and Marvel NOW! relaunches, putting it on track {{to be one of}} the best-selling issues for 2012. As many of the purchasers of these comics are likely to be first-time comic buyers, the comic's success may also filter to improved sales of other comic titles. Total sales of the standalone first issue, as tracked by Diamond Comic Distributors, exceeded 80,000units, making it the fifteen best comic for the month and an uncommon occurrence of a non-DC, non-Marvel comic breaking the top20, according to Russ Burlingane of Comicbook.com. The first issue of Friendship Is Magic was one of only two non-DC/Marvel publications (the other being The Walking Dead #100) to be in the top100 issue quantity sales for 2012, ranked at#90, and ranked#61 based on revenue. According to Heather Nuhfer and Amy Mebberson, {{the first issue}} of the comic is the best-selling issue published by IDW as of March2013. John Mayo of Comic Book Resources points out that even with lower sales figures, the 7th issue of the comic sold more than three times the number of copies of the combined Star Trek and Doctor Who IDW-licensed and fan-heavy series, and believes that [...] "whatever IDW <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> promote My Little Pony is working". The success of My Little Pony and other children's comics like Adventure Time help to boosting overall sales in the comics industry by 15% in 2012.|$|E

Not a week passes without one or more of those firemen, in trying to save life and property, doing things which are altogether heroic. What do you fancy keeps them up to their work? High pay? The amusement and excitement of the fires? The vanity of being praised for their courage?

When you go out from this church into those crowded streets, remember {{that there is not}} a soul in them who is not as precious in God's eyes as you are; not a little dirty ragged child whom Jesus, were he again on earth, would not take up in his arms and bless; not a publican or a harlot with whom, if they but asked him, he would not eat and drink--now, here, in London on this Sunday, the 8th of June, 1856, as certainly as he did in Jewry beyond the seas, eighteen hundred years ago. Therefore do to all who are in want of your help as Jesus would do to them if he were here; as Jesus <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> them already: for he is here among us now, and for ever seeking and saving that which was lost; and all we have to do is to believe that, and work on, sure that he is working at our head, and that though we cannot see him, he sees us; and then all will prosper at last, for this brave old earth whereon we are living now, and for that far braver new heaven and new earth whereon we shall live hereafter.|$|E
