50|$|Common {{dolphins}} face {{a mixture}} of threats due to human influence. Moderate levels of metal pollutants, which are thought to negatively impact dolphin health, have been measured in some populations. Populations have been hunted {{off the coast of}} Peru for use as food and shark bait. In most other areas, the dolphins have not been hunted directly. Several thousand individuals have been caught in <b>industrial</b> <b>trawler</b> nets throughout their range. Common dolphins were abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea until the 1960s but occurrences there have tailed off rapidly. The reasons are not well understood, but are believed to be due to extensive human activity in the area. In the US, they are a protected species and sometimes are caught by accident in some trawler nets as bycatch, though despite this they are still quite common throughout their range. Despite these potential threats, the short-beaked common dolphin is considered to be Least Concern by the IUCN Red List, and the long-beaked common dolphin is listed as Data Deficient.|$|E

40|$|Tropical shrimp {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by various interactions with their natural environment and with other fisheries. These latter interactions {{can be explained by}} the high quantity of bycatch taken by <b>industrial</b> <b>trawler</b> fleets, which has a significant impact on fish populations associated with shrimps and thus also on finfish fisheries. Bycatch also includes emblematic species, which are subject to strict conservation measures decided by the international community. It seems important to identify and assess the biological and economic consequences of different mitigation measures (increase of mesh size, turtle excluder devices and bycatch reducing devices). This communication is based on case studies undertaken on the Indian white prawn (Fenneropenaeus indicus) and speckled shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros) fisheries in Madagascar and on the brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus subtilis) and pink spotted shrimp (Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis) fishery in French Guiana. A review of the impacts of these fisheries on resources and ecosystems is made and some results of experiments on mitigation devices given. Finally, the results of simulations obtained using a multi-species, multi-fleet, age-structured bioeconomic model, including modifications of catchability and costs related to the adoption of these devices, is presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, the EU Fisheries Council fixed {{a minimum}} weight of 450 g (after gutting) for octopus caught in European waters or European imports of octopus fished {{in the waters of}} the Eastern Atlantic (Mauritania, Morocco, Senegal). The aim is to protect stocks of young octopus and {{give them a chance to}} breed before they are fished. According to the EC, Mauritania and Morocco have already {{introduced}} this minimum weight into their legislation. The issue is still to be discussed with Senegal as part of negotiations to renew fisheries agreements. From now on, it is forbidden for octopus under the minimum weight to be on board, transhipped, landed, transported, stored or sold. Scientists estimate that the 450 g minimum weight rule will cut the size of catches by one-quarter for adult females and one half for adult males. But the measure will only prove effective if tight controls are enforced, especially at Spanish landing ports. In Mauritania, octopus caught by small-scale fishers and <b>industrial</b> <b>trawlers</b> account for about 10 % of total catches. Before oil drilling began last February, it represented the country s chief source of export revenue. In Senegal, where fishing is also the main source of foreign exchange earnings, octopus fishing accounts for a smaller share of revenue. The most profitable markets for these products are in Asia.

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The {{industry}} owned trawlers land-lock obligation, {{originally intended}} to ensure both greater seasonal distribution of raw material as well as settlement in coastal communities, functions poorly and is being put under pressure. This is due to national and global trends in economics and politics, technological change and changing market conditions. Because of this, the <b>industrial</b> <b>trawler</b> concept is torn between {{its role as a}} raw material supplier with a social responsibility, and its role as a profitable actor on a competitive global arena. Municipalities have obtained a key role by intervening in what is regarded as a closed system made up by private industry actors, a state administrative apparatus and shifting policy strategies. In this paper, we examine industry owned trawlers land lock obligations through a theoretical framework including industrial policy analysis and municipal innovation theory. We show how changes in regulations concerning the trawler land-lock obligations have made appeals to the judicial system unsuccessful as an effort to ensure that the catch is landed according to the original intentions. However, innovative measures in individual municipalities has produced local results, mainly in the form of economic compensations for missed raw material landings. This has also led to the proliferation of strategies among municipalities in similar situations. In this way, local authorities may contribute to the removal of a regulatory failure underpinning an outdated industrial concept...|$|E
40|$|Shrimp are {{the most}} {{valuable}} fish stock in Bahrain waters, the fishery being based on a single species P. semisulcatus which forms about 95 {{percent of the total}} landings. In 1993, shrimp landings formed 23. 8 percent of the total Bahrain fish landing, which totalled 2, 128 tonnes at a first sale value of 5. 4 million Bahraini Dinars (1 DS. 0. 380 BD). Beside the increased fishing effort, the marine habitat of Bahrain suffers from several sources of pollution. Most evident is dredging and reclamation which have altered most of the coastal areas. Despite the shrimp fishery importance and the development-related stresses on Bahrain coastal environments, there were limited basic data on this valuable stock. The current study aimed to provide as full an understanding as possible of the shrimp fishery of Bahrain. Several surveys were conducted on the shrimp populations and their environment. A sediment survey was conducted from 9 August to 26 October. From May 1991 to May 1992, a regular sampling programme was initiated to record the physical properties of the sea water at fixed stations in TUbli Bay and off Mina Sulman. Physical properties of sea water were also recorded in the open sea during June 1980, October and December 1991. Plankton collection was conducted mainly through two sampling programmes. The first was conducted in the open sea from September 1991 to January 1992 (excluding November 1991). The second programme was restricted to Tubli Bay; samples were obtained over periods from May 1991 to June 1992 inclusive and from March to May 1993. Two major benthic surveys were completed. The first was conducted from June 1980 to June 1981 using an <b>industrial</b> <b>trawler,</b> covering the whole shrimping ground, except TUbli Bay. A second survey was carried out on the shrimp population in TUbli Bay from May 1991 to June 1993 in three time periods, from May 1991 to June 1992, November 1992 and from April to June 1993. Based on the above surveys, physical properties of sea water and bottom sediment of the shrimping ground were described. Also the bionomics of the seven penaeid species found in Bahrain waters were determined. Benthic and plankton surveys revealed spawning activities of P. semisulcatus restricted to the offshore waters. Also prolonged spawning activity was determined for this species, which most significantly occurred from August to March. P. semisulcatus main recruits appeared in the shrimping grounds from April to July, originating from nurseries found within the areas A and B. Two migration patterns were determined for P. semisulcatus within Bahrain shrimping grounds throughout a season. The updated information on shrimp fishery generated by the current work provides a basis for identification of areas for further improvement of this fishery. Consequently, the work determines of future investigations necessary for Bahrain shrimp fishery...|$|E
40|$|Mangroves {{are widely}} {{recognised}} as {{being one of}} the most valuable of coastal ecosystems. On a local scale they provide coastal protection, habitat for fish and shellfish, and control water quality. Globally, they are key to mitigate climate change given their considerable capacity to sequester carbon. In Latin America, especially in the Tropical Eastern Pacific region, mangrove forests are abundant, and linked to millions of coastal livelihoods. This thesis investigates the conservation status of mangroves on the Tropical Eastern Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panamá, by examining historical trends of mangrove loss, modern rates of deforestation (2000 - 2012), and the effectiveness of the protected area management in place. The contribution of mangrove-associated species to fisheries is evaluated using two artisanal fishing communities as case studies: Northern Chocó, Colombia and the Gulf of Montijo, Panamá. To do this, I investigate historical ecology, perform spatial analysis of proximate drivers of land use and land cover change adjacent to mangroves, and analyse small-scale fisheries landings. Results show that mangrove dependent species are important for small-scale fisheries in the Gulf of Montijo, Panamá. In Northern Chocó, territorial use rights in fisheries promote offshore fishing, thereby reducing fishing pressure on mangrove-associated species, but simultaneously may have displaced fishing effort from <b>industrial</b> <b>trawlers</b> into neighbouring areas. Regionally, mangrove area declined by almost 50 % in the 20 th century, but deforestation was virtually zero between 2000 and 2012, showing that protected areas are highly effective at conserving mangroves. Given that the success of mangrove conservation depends on government capacity to integrate multi-sectorial interests over mangroves, this thesis represents an important step to inform management strategies that involve a better understanding of human-mangrove interactions in Latin America...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} during July, 2003 to June, 2013 about landing volumes of shark fishery (sharks and rays) in artisanal and industrial fishing sector only in group- wise not in species wise. In these periods, in artisanal fisheries gill nets (shark nets), set bag nets, long lines and trammel nets exploiting data were analyzed. But from 2012 - 13 periods in industrial fisheries harvesting data of sharks and rays by trawl fishing were started to record keeping in group wise. During 2012 - 13 total sharks and rays landing volume contributes only 0. 85 % (5017 MT) of total the marine fish production of Bangladesh. During 2010 - 11 to 2012 - 13 no sharks and rays product items had been traded from Bangladesh due to international market ban But from 2003 - 04 to 2009 - 10 period sharks and rays product with fish maws export to the Myanmar, India, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, USA and other countries. Dried and iced sliced meat of shark and rays, its sun-dried hide, bones, fins, tails, teeth and shark liver oil all are sold for local consumers, but only sets of fins (2 pectoral, 2 pelvic, 1 dorsal, 2 anal and 1 caudal fin) and skins were exporting to the foreign markets, which has been stopped now. In the year 2009 - 10 total 955 MT of sharks and rays product (with fish maws) were exporting and earning (app.) USD 1. 60 million.

40|$|Only a {{few years}} ago, when the {{subsistence}} fishermen of Bongolon sighted a trawler poaching in their fishing grounds, they stood helplessly, sometimes firing submachine guns at it in frustration. The trawler would haul in its nets and leave without fear of penalty. Today, ICTs {{have come to the}} rescue of the members of this small community on Guinea´s northern coast, in the form of global positioning system (GPS) technology. Upon sighting a poacher, the fishermen can now calculate its exact location using a hand-held GPS receiver, and radio the information to the nearest coastguard station. The coastguard then dispatches a patrol boat to intercept the intruder. Fishermen say that poachers now flee at the sight of them, now they know how quickly they can summon the authorities. A two-year experiment using the GPS and radio-assisted community patrols has proven so successful in Guinea that the approach is being adopted by other West African fishing nations. This development has come not a minute too soon - poaching is a problem that affects the entire West African coast, an important and highly sensitive fish breeding area. Experts predict that, if the poachers are not stopped, the region´s coastal fisheries will be exhausted within 10 years. The situation has already reached crisis proportions in the coastal zone of Guinea, where 30, 000 people depend on small-scale ocean fishing. Foreign <b>industrial</b> <b>trawlers</b> destroy the nets of local fishermen by dragging heavy steel trawl nets over them, and regularly collide with their wooden canoes at night, wrecking the boats and injuring or killing their crews. To help Guinea address this problem, in late 1999 the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) launched the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme (SFLP), with funding from the UK´s Department for International Development. Already, government figures confirm the success of the programme. In 2000, before community patrols began around Bongolon and two other fishing villages, <b>industrial</b> <b>trawlers</b> made 450 illegal incursions into the area, where they collided with several canoes, injuring 12 local fishermen. Since the GPS-equipped community patrol boats began operating, the number of poachers has fallen dramatically - only 56 incursions were recorded {{in the first six months}} of 2002. The key to the programme´s effectiveness lies in the partnership between small-scale fishermen using their own motorized canoes and the Guinean coastguard, which lacks the equipment and resources needed to patrol 300 kilometres of coastline effectively. Although ICTs are playing a vital role in keeping the poachers at bay, the community patrol system now needs to be institutionalized, with an adequate budget for staff, equipment and training, to ensure that the technology is used to benefit the poor and protect the environment. As part of the programme´s participatory approach, a National Coordinating Unit (NCU) has been set up to bring together technicians, government officers and members of key civil society organizations that represent the interests of fishing communities. The members of the NCU act as advocates within the fisheries sector on behalf of the community patrol concept. Mamadou Moussa Diallo, NCU member and socio-economist at the Boussoura National Centre for Fisheries Science, has carried out a study of the impact of the community surveillance project, which demonstrated its success. ´I think I am getting through to my colleagues about the system, the methodology and how it works. They are interested. ´ The coast of Guinea is guarded by the National Centre for Fisheries Surveillance and Protection, whose budget allows for only six or seven patrols per month. According to Mohamed Sidibé, the Centre´s Assistant Director-General, community surveillance has been a great success. ´Now our boats can intervene when there is a call, and do not have to patrol at random´, he says. ´In the beginning, patrol officers were sensitive about the project - they thought they might be replaced by the village patrols - but now the spirit has changed. The system isn´t perfect yet, but we can improve it. ´ ´The Centre doesn´t have the means to expand the patrol network, but community surveillance has now been included in the government´s poverty reduction strategy´, he notes. ´The government will find the means to pay for its expansion. ´ One possible source of funding is the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, a comprehensive approach to debt reduction initiated by the IMF and World Bank. Meanwhile, the SFLP community patrol system is being adapted for use in the Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Mauritania, and Cameroon has also expressed interest. Little by little, fishermen throughout West Africa are benefiting from the opportunities offered by ICTs to end the threat posed by foreign trawlers and to safeguard their livelihoods.

40|$|Seismic {{shooting}} with airguns {{has been}} conducted continuously in the North Sea for about 40 years. In {{the past two decades}} there has been conflicts of interest between Norwegian <b>industrial</b> <b>trawlers</b> fishing for sandeel and seismic exploration activities in the North Sea. The fishermen have claimed that seismic shooting scares fish to flee to the bottom where the burry deep in the sediments and die. A common experience is that catchability is reduced for a period after seismic shooting. In May 2002, a field experiment on the effect of seismic shooting on the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) was conducted in the southeastern part of the North Sea. Buried sandeel were trapped in customized, bottomless, steel frame cages deployed during night on aggregations of sandeel located by a van Veen grab. Three cages were deployed in an experimental area and exposed to sounds from a standard threedimensional (3 D) seismic survey for about 2. 5 days. The behaviour of the fish caged fish were monitored and recorded with cameras mounted in one of the cage and on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). A control area with two cages was established about 35 km southeast of the experimental area. Within the shooting area, a predetermined set of localities was repeatedly sampled by grab (van Veen) prior to and after seismic shooting. The seismic shooting had no immediate lethal effect on the sandeel. No dead sandeel was found in the grab samples and the total mortality in the cages was on average about 35 % both in the experimental and control groups. This mortality was probably a result of injuries due to handling and confinement. There {{was no significant difference in}} the catches of sandeel in the grab samples before and after shooting. Behaviour analyses from the video recordings showed that the caged fish did not flee to the bottom exposed to seismic shooting. They reacted to the shooting by performing C-starts and increased tailbeat frequency. Almost all C-starts were recorded during seismic shooting, none was recorded before and only one was recorded after. The tailbeat frequency was significantly higher both during and after than prior to seismic shooting and it did not return to preshooting levels during the 3 -day period after the shooting ended. Some of the results differ from other results found in comparable studies. The sandeel lacks swimbladder and are thought to have poor hearing abilities and this is suggested to be an explanation for these differences...|$|R
50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are industrial fishery, fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as pelagic fishing), and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, <b>Industrial</b> fishing using <b>trawlers</b> began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand eel, Norway pout, blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total industrial fish catch was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|R

40|$|Marine resources, {{so crucial}} to the {{countries}} of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist, and these should be developed. June 11, 2005, saw a confrontation in Senegal between fishermen from Kayar and Guet-Ndar. The toll: one dead and several wounded. The cause of the dispute: rivalry over access to an increasingly scarce resource fish. Incidents of this kind are symptomatic of a serious problem. In August 2003, Spore sounded a cautionary note, urging the introduction of extensive political and economic changes if fish stocks were to be maintained. In March 2005, FAO confirmed that 75 % of fishery resources had been fished to their maximum yield, over-exploited or exhausted. Encouragingly, there is growing awareness of the need to move towards sustainable fisheries management, which combines long-term viability with a strategy that satisfies the needs of fishers and ensures the economic development of resources. This has translated into a growing understanding, shared by all those involved, and in a range of measures, binding or otherwise, developed to regulate fishing. But there {{is still a long way}} to go before responsible and voluntary management of marine resources is adopted by all players in the fisheries sector. As long as stocks are over-exploited, and their profits diminished, fishers will continue to break the law. That was the clear message from several participants in an internet debate organised by CTA in 2004. Crucial for ACP states The problem of fisheries surveillance is gradually being perceived as a major issue. Experts are coming up with acronyms such as IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), MCS (monitoring, control and surveillance) and VMS (vessel monitoring system). In June 2005, a conference on the impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on developing countries was held in London. These developing nations are particularly badly affected, the meeting heard, because of a lack of funds, technical capacity, manpower, cooperation between states and, occasionally, of political will. Look out, fishers on patrol In an effort to reduce the number of conflicts between industrial and small-scale fishers, sparked by the incursion of trawlers into the zone reserved for small-scale fishing, a community surveillance project was set up in Guinea in 2002 (see Spore 110). It aimed to lower the number of trawlers by teaming up the institutions charged with coastal surveillance with the fishing communities themselves. According to Hassimiou Tall, technical advisor to the Ministry for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Guinea, the results have been very encouraging. The programme has succeeded in reducing illegal incursions by <b>industrial</b> <b>trawlers</b> by 60 % as crews now know that some small-scale fishers are working for the authorities. Relatively inexpensive (US$ 20, 000 less than 16, 500) and holding considerable promise, the Guinean experiment is due to be extended to Congo, Gabon and Mauritania. But in Guinea itself, the pilot project has been (provisionally?) suspended, due to lack of funds. More proof, if it were needed, that good ideas are not enough, unless they are backed up by adequate resources. The countries of the South are not alone. Published last May, the European Commission s annual report on serious breaches to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy revealed that the number of infringements recorded rose from 6, 756 in 2002 to 9, 502 in 2003. Five EU member states detected nearly 90 % of all breaches. Unauthorised fishing accounted for 22 % of the cases, while the figure for unlicensed fishing was 17 %. A fine was imposed in 84 % of cases. In 4, 720 cases, fishing gear was seized. The June 2005 bulletin of the Fisheries News Update section on CTA s Agritrade website concluded that the report offered interesting lessons for ACP countries, noting that greater transparency over infringements and sanctions will increase confidence in the fair and equitable enforcement of regulations. Fisheries infringements come in many guises, they include: fishing with unlicensed boats; and failing to land catches in local ports, in spite of the obligations of fisheries agreements and falsely reporting tonnage caught. Whatever the measures taken, whether they are aimed at getting fishing zones respected, at better regulating fishing gear, at limiting the size of catches, at guaranteeing a biological rest period or at developing the economic activity of ports by making it mandatory to land all or part of catches locally, the notion of self-regulation appears to be an illusory one, and control measures are certainly needed. Some of these are already in place, and fall into two groups so-called hardware and software measures. Means and human resources Hardware measures consist of advanced and often costly and cumbersome techniques, such as radar, onboard systems and satellite. To monitor an economic zone of 200 square miles, it takes several rapid intervention boats, surveillance vessels, radar stations and even airplanes. And, of course, a computer system capable of cross checking data, with permanent internet access. For ACP countries, it is hard to reconcile such demands with budgetary constraints. These systems are essential, but they are also inadequate unless they are backed by human resources. The software techniques refer to onboard observers or the participation of fishing communities. Officially, any such observers go onboard to collect scientific data. But since they are equipped with communication tools, their information is by default used for surveillance. They run the risk therefore, if this aspect of their work were to be known, of no longer being allowed on board. Senegal s fishing committees By limiting their catches and adopting good practices, the fishers of Kayar, in Senegal, have enabled fish stocks to be replenished. A local initiative, surveillance committees see to it that this Kayar code is respected. Fishing zones have been defined and a limit imposed of 45 kg of fish per canoe per day. Highly destructive techniques such as the use of explosives or drag nets have been banned. These days, catches are smaller, but they fetch a better price. Not surprisingly, this initiative has quickly spread throughout Senegal s main fishing zones since 2001, around 50 local committees have been created. But the incidents of June 11 show that not all fishers are ready to take the idea on board. The presence of onboard observers is crucial for providing independent information on fishing activities, both on a daily and a case-by-case basis, the CTA online debate concluded. But to be effective, such methods depend on the inspectors receiving adequate training and payment, as Ms Janet Uronu, joint president for fisheries at the Ministry for Natural Resources and Tourism in Tanzania pointed out, The high levels of technology (and the principles on which it is based) to be found on modern fishing vessels were well beyond the comprehension of those fishery officers sent to inspect the vessels. The job of these inspectors also carries risks: vulnerability to corruption, especially if they are poorly paid, violence and the risk of being taken hostage, to prevent them from reporting what they have seen. A number of experiments closely linking fishing communities with surveillance operations have been carried out in West Africa. After all, the fishermen know the fishing grounds better than anyone. However, while these initiatives have produced positive results, they also raise the question of motivation the fishers are simultaneously acting as inspectors and stakeholders. This approach effectively establishes that small-scale fishers are also responsible for the over-exploitation of resources. A culture of change None of these methods will work unless at least two conditions are met. First, there must be clear rules about what is and is not allowed, accompanied by sanctions which are properly enforced. Secondly, there needs to be regional cooperation between countries facing the same problem. That is true for the North: on March 14, 2005, the EU Fisheries Council finally agreed to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency, based in Vigo, Spain which should coordinate fishing control systems within community waters, but also an important point for ACP countries within the framework of bilateral fisheries agreements. It is also true for the South, where one of the most successful initiatives in this respect has been the MCS Programme set up by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). Financed by the EU, it has, since 2003, allowed bilateral and trilateral surveillance operations to be carried out between the countries concerned, and strengthened the equipment, human resources and capacity to exchange information of member countries which needed support in these areas. Tanzania, for example, now has more than 30 trained observers. According to Ms Uronu, the first change needed to achieve such results involves overcoming inertia and bureaucracy. A culture of change is essential. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which numbers seven mainland or island East African countries among its members, is another example of regional cooperation. According to Mark Pearson, at the Secretariat of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), this cooperation has already enabled the number of refrigerated fishing vessels practising IUU fishing to be cut from 140 to 40. One method used is the exchange, between member countries and others, of lists of authorised vessels, together with their tonnage (known as the positive list). Other regional groupings in the fisheries sector may lead to similar initiatives. That has already happened in the case of the Programme pêche, commerce et environnement en Afrique de l Ouest (PCEAO), a programme set up to promote sustainable fishing in six West African states, which met in Dakar in early June 2005. The question of surveillance was not specifically on the agenda, but the West African sub-regional commission on West African fisheries, la Commission sous-régionale des pêches d Afrique de l Ouest (CSRP), does have a project to address this issue, supported by the Luxembourg Development Agency among others. In the Caribbean, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism lists the development of a monitoring, control and surveillance system as a priority. Finally, the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), based in the Solomon Islands, has, since 1999, installed a satellite surveillance system to monitor fishing vessels on behalf of its member states. It has proved to be highly effective the number of cases of illicit fishing recorded by the authorities is, and continues to be, very small. Fisheries surveillance requires considerable means. How should available resources be best used, and what kind of support is needed? That is what future fisheries agreements being drawn up between ACP countries and the EU should try to clarify. Equally, they should encourage greater harmony between national fisheries legislation, as well as regional cooperation in various forms: data exchange, joint patrols, exchange of personnel and experiences between crews, and of surveillance systems in the EU and the ACP regions concerned. In the long run, it makes sense all round. Marine resources, so {{crucial to the}} countries of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist [...] ...|$|R
