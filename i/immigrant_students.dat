Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and <b>immigrant</b> <b>students</b> from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their academic ability, and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} {{study was to examine}} the relationship between acculturative stress and spirituality among Chinese <b>immigrant</b> college <b>students</b> in the United States. The sample of this study was obtained by utilizing a convenience sample of 63 first-generation Chinese <b>immigrant</b> college <b>students.</b> The participants each received a self-administered questionnaire which was developed to measure their acculturative stress level and spiritual well-being level. The results indicated that there was a significant correlation between acculturative stress level and spiritual well-being. The respondents who had a higher level of spiritual well-being reported having a lower level of acculturative stress. Those who attended church activity on a regular basis, at least once a week, also reported a higher level of spiritual well-being.
