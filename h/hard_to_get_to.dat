25|$|Until {{it became}} commercially viable, natural gas {{was often a}} nuisance. Dangerous to handle and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> market, early oilmen despised it as a poor {{relation}} to its rich cousin crude oil. Although early processing procedures were able to remove water, in the 19th century discoveries were only developed if consumers could use the gas just as {{it came out of}} the ground. If the gas required further processing or needed to be piped a long distance to market, the producer shut in the well. Flares got rid of gas coming from oil wells.|$|E
500|$|Luton Town, based [...] from Milton Keynes in Luton and nicknamed [...] "the Hatters", {{were also}} seeking a new site at this time. As early as 1960, then-First Division Luton's attendances had been deemed far {{too low for}} the top flight by Charles Buchan's Football Monthly, which also {{considered}} their ground at Kenilworth Road, {{in the middle of}} town, to be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to.</b> At this time the club was already planning a 50,000-capacity ground near Dunstable, to the north-west of Luton, but no new ground materialised. Luton were relegated in 1960 and, apart from the 1974–75 season, remained outside of the top division until 1982–83.|$|E

Cyrus cited her various controversial moments {{as the reason}} behind this, claiming she only wanted to travel where she felt [...] "the most love". Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records. With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career. She commented, [...] "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm sure I do... I'm probably going to go book an acting coach." [...] She later confirmed {{she would not be}} going to college for the time being, stating that [...] " [...] a firm believer that you can go back at any age you want", and that she [...] " [...] worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> where [...] now, and [...] to enjoy it while it lasts".|$|E

50|$|Forthrightness (Factor N): the {{tendency}} {{to want to be}} known by others—to be open, forthright, and genuine in social situations, and thus to be self-revealing and unguarded.

This is the first {{elimination}} round of the game, and the player with the lowest score leaves.|$|R
500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] {{was going to get}} the gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew {{that this is going to}} happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> this stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

50|$|The Twilight {{itself is}} divided into several levels. Each level is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> and {{accessible}} only to powerful Others; this is {{due in large part}} to the fact that the Twilight drains energy much more quickly and greedily in deeper levels. In order to access the lower levels of the Twilight, an Other must step through their shadow at each successive level.|$|R

In return it is generally very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of any disappearance or even robbery there through the usual channels. To the casual visitor, and of course it attracts thousands from its reputation, it presents no more dangers perhaps than the ordinary night café of its sort.

60|$|At {{three in}} the afternoon, when the current turned, we started; but having a head-wind, made slow progress. At dusk we reached the {{entrance}} of the harbour, but an eddy and a gust of wind carried us away and out to sea. After sunset there was a land breeze, and we sailed a little to the south-east. It then became calm, and we hung down our anchor forty fathoms, to endeavour to counteract the current; but it was of little avail, and in the morning we found ourselves a good way from shore, and just opposite our anchorage of the day before, which we again reached by hard rowing. I gave the men this day to rest and sleep; and the next day (Oct. 10th) we again started {{at two in the morning}} with a land breeze. After I had set them to their oars, and given instructions to keep close in-shore, and on no account to get out to sea, I went below, being rather unwell. At daybreak I found, to my great astonishment, that we were again far off-shore, and was told that the wind had gradually turned more ahead, and had carried us out--none of them having the sense to take down the sail and row in-shore, or to call me. As soon as it was daylight, we saw that we had drifted back, and were again opposite our former anchorage, and, for the third time, had to row <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> it. As we approached the shore, I saw that the current was favourable to us, and we continued down the coast till we were close to the entrance to the lower harbour. Just as we were congratulating ourselves on having at last reached it, a strong south-east squall came on, blowing us back, and rendering it impossible for us to enter. Not liking the idea of again returning, I determined on trying to anchor, and succeeded in doing so, in very deep water and close to the reefs; but the prevailing winds were such that, should we not hold, we should have no difficulty in getting out to sea. By the time the squall had passed, the current had turned against us, and we expected to have to wait till four in the afternoon, when we intended to enter the harbour.|$|E
