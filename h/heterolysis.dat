50|$|The rate of {{reaction}} for many reactions involving unimolecular <b>heterolysis</b> depends heavily on rate of ionization of the covalent bond.

A change {{of reaction}} medium from hexane to water increases the rate of t-BuCl <b>heterolysis</b> by 14 orders of magnitude. This is caused by very strong solvation of the transition state. The main factors that affect <b>heterolysis</b> rates are mainly the solvent's polarity and electrophilic as well as its ionizing power. The polarizability, nucleophilicity and cohesion of the solvent had a much weaker effect on <b>heterolysis.</b> However, there is some debate on the effects of the nucleophilicity of the solvent, some papers claim it has no effect, while some papers claim that more nucleophilic solvents decrease the reaction rate.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, {{homolysis}} (from Greek ὅμοιος, homoios, [...] "equal," [...] and λύσις, lusis, [...] "loosening") or {{homolytic fission}} is chemical bond dissociation of a molecule {{by a process}} where each of the fragments retains one of the originally bonded electrons. During homolytic fission of a neutral molecule with an even number of electrons, two free radicals will be generated.

50|$|Aside from protons, other electrophilic {{groups can}} attack an {{acetylene}} moiety. When attacked by carboxylic acids, cis/trans alkene adducts may be formed. The reaction with hydrogen halides, {{which also has}} an initial protonation step, results {{in the formation of}} halo-substituted alkenes. Lastly, adamantyl ketones may be formed from an adamantyl cation attack on acetylene and subsequent hydration.In the hydrohalogenation of phenylpropene, two different alkene products are formed because of thermodynamic and kinetic effects. The linear sp-hybridized vinyl cation may be attacked by the halogen from two different directions. When attacked from the less sterically hindered side (hydrogen), the E-alkene is produced, attack to the other side forms the Z-alkene. Over short time scales, the E-alkene is favored because the attack from the less bulky side is preferred, but over longer times, the more stable (bulky methyl and phenyl groups on opposite sides) Z-alkene is preferred. Though the E-alkene is initially formed, it isomerizes to the Z-alkene through a carbocation intermediate the stems from protonation and C-C rotation steps.Neighboring groups surround the alkyne can enhance reaction kinetics by interacting with the intermediate via nonclassical approaches like intramolecular interactions. An alkyne that is adjacent to a tertiary alcohol formas a four-membered cyclic vinyl cation intermediate in which the oxygen of the hydroxyl group bridges two carbons across two bonds. Likewise, a five-membered chloronium ring intermediate is formed from 5-chloro substituted 1-pentynes. An unusually shifted product is formed because the intermediate undergoes <b>heterolysis</b> at the C5-Cl position.In the electrophilic attack of allenes, it takes place in a manner that prefers to form a terminal adduct and the vinyl cation at the central carbon. The polarization of the allene group show that the terminal carbons have a higher electron density and tendency to under nucleophillic attack. However, if the terminal end is stabilized by a substituent, an allyl-like cation may form as the electrophile attacks the central carbon. Similar to phenyl rings adjacent to vinyl cations, there must be bond rotation to achieve complete resonance stabilization.|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} developed (Song, L.; Wu, W.; Zhang, Q.; Shaik, S. J. Phys. Chem. A 2004, 108, 6017 - 6024) valence bond method coupled to a polarized continuum model (VBPCM) {{is used to}} address the long standing conundrum of the heterolytic dissociation of the C-Cl and Si-Cl bonds, respectively, in tertiary-butyl chloride and trimethylsilyl chloride in condensed phases. The method is used here to compare the bond dissociation in the gas phase and in aqueous solution. In addition to the ground state reaction profile, VB theory also provides the energies of the purely covalent and purely ionic VB structures {{as a function of}} the reaction coordinate. Accordingly, the C-Cl and Si-Cl bonds are shown to be of different natures. In the gas phase, the resonance energy arising from covalent-ionic mixing at equilibrium geometry amounts to 42 kcal/mol for tertiary-butyl chloride, whereas the same quantity for trimethylsilyl chloride is significantly higher at 62 kcal/mol. With such a high value, the root cause of the Si-Cl bonding is the covalent-ionic resonance energy, and this bond belongs to the category of charge-shift bonds (Shaik, S.; Danovich, D.; Silvi, B.;. auvergnat, D.; Hiberty, P. C. Chem. - Eur. J. 2005, 11, 6358). This difference between the C-Cl and Si-Cl bonds carries over to the solvated phase and impacts the heterolytic cleavages of the two bonds. For both molecules, solvation lowers the ionic curve below the covalent one, and hence the bond dissociation in the solvent generates the two ions, Me 3 E+ Cl- (E = C, Si). In both cases, the root cause of the barrier is the loss of the covalent-ionic resonance energy. In the <b>heterolysis</b> reaction of Si-Cl, the covalent-ionic resonance energy remains large and fully contributes to the dissociation energy, thereby leading to a high barrier for heterolytic cleavage, and thus prohibiting the generation of ions. By contrast, the covalent-ionic resonance energy is smaller for the C-Cl bond and only partially contributes to the barrier for <b>heterolysis,</b> which is consequently small, leading readily to ions that are commonly observed in the classical S(N) 1 mechanism. Thus, the reluctance of R 3 Si-X molecules to undergo <b>heterolysis</b> in condensed phases and more generally the rarity of free silicenium ions under these conditions are experimental manifestations of the charge-shift character of the Si-Cl bond...|$|E
