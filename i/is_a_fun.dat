500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the compilation album was positive overall; many reviewers appreciated the album in its entirety but criticized select tracks.

Davies concluded: [...] "Sia's ability to combine cult and popular appeal is successfully demonstrated by the strength of this compilation album.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it [...] "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Bart on the Road" [...] is an episode which is built upon a [...] "frankly ludicrous" [...] idea which if the writers were to [...] "stumble upon" [...] now, [...] "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup {{a great deal of}} consideration {{both on and off the}} screen." [...] He thought the story was [...] "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." [...] Foster thinks, [...] "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he [...] "loves" [...] the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, [...] "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: [...] "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and summarizing his review with: [...] ""Bart on the Road" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable." ...|$|E

ARD co-ordinator Thomas Schreiber stated that [...] "Xavier Naidoo is a brilliant singer who is, according to my own opinion, neither racist nor homophobe. It was clear that his nomination would polarise opinions, but we were surprised about the negative response. The Eurovision Song Contest <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> event, in which music and the understanding between European people should be the focus. This characteristic must be kept at all costs." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "it {{might be a}} little too {{straightforward}} in spots, but it does make for a solid action game." [...] He concluded that [...] "although The Suffering tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually trying to scare you, it's still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [...] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> action game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nintendo World Report's Jared Rosenberg {{scored the}} Wii version 8.5 out of 10, praising {{its use of}} the Wii's controls, but criticizing the graphics, writing [...] "It {{is obvious that the}} game is over 10 years old. Character and enemy models are noticeably low polygon, and the textures seem muddy and N64-like at times." [...] However, he {{concluded}} [...] "MDK2 is a well-designed action platformer that will take quite a bit of time to get through its 10 levels. Varied play mechanics keep the shooter fresh and the humorous story should occasionally put a smile on your face. It can be challenging and at times frustrating, but overall, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> romp." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Game Informer {{also found}} the game's visuals to be [...] "sharp and colorful", the {{magazine}} also felt that Empire of Dreams didn't take enough advantage of the system by providing [...] "pseudo-3D" [...] background graphics that had become the series hallmark, summarizing that [...] "The end result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> game, but doesn't hit the mark as well as previous efforts." [...] GamePro {{called attention to the}} [...] "Bright, kaleidoscopic levels", declaring that the [...] "graphics and sounds are as sharp as those of any other GBA game", ultimately calling Empire of Dreams [...] "a straightforward platformer with enough gameplay variety that will make you want to play to the very end." ...|$|E
