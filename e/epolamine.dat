40|$|David R Lionberger 1, Michael J Brennan 21 Southwest Orthopedic Group, Houston, TX, USA; 2 Department of Medicine, Bridgeport Hospital, Bridgeport, CT, USAAbstract: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to review published clinical data on diclofenac <b>epolamine</b> topical patch 1. 3 % (DETP) in the treatment of acute soft tissue injuries, such as strains, sprains, and contusions. Review of published literature on topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diclofenac, and DETP in patients with acute soft tissue injuries was included. Relevant literature was identified on MEDLINE using the search terms topical NSAIDs, diclofenac, diclofenac <b>epolamine,</b> acute pain, sports injury, soft tissue injury, strain, sprain, and contusion, and from citations in retrieved articles covering the years 1978 &ndash; 2008. Review of published, randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses shows that topical NSAIDs are significantly more effective than placebo in relieving acute pain; the pooled average relative benefit was 1. 7 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 &ndash; 1. 9). In a limited number of comparisons, topical and oral NSAIDs provided comparable pain relief, but the use of topical agents produced lower plasma drug concentrations and fewer systemic adverse events (AEs). The physical&ndash;chemical properties of diclofenac <b>epolamine</b> make it well suited for topical use. In patients with acute soft tissue injuries treated with DETP, clinical data report an analgesic benefit within hours of the first application, and significant pain relief relative to placebo within 3 days. Moreover, DETP displayed tolerability comparable with placebo; the most common AEs were pruritus and other application site reactions. Review of published literature suggests that DETP is generally safe and well tolerated, clinically efficacious, and a rational treatment option for patients experiencing acute pain associated with strains, sprains, and contusions, and other localized painful conditions.

40|$|Background: Diclofenac is a {{commonly}} used {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) for symptom control in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and soft tissue injuries. Although treatment with oral diclofenac is associated with serious adverse effects involving both the gastrointestinal and renal systems, these adverse effects {{are thought to be}} limited with topical diclofenac formulations without loss of efficacy. Objective: The aim of this review is to explore the available evidence in relation to the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and reported adverse effects of the topical diclofenac formulations available. Results/conclusions: In the majority of studies examined, topical diclofenac formulations with sodium lotion, lecithin or <b>epolamine</b> gel, patch or plaster were either superior or equivalent to oral diclofenac formulations or placebo. Topical diclofenac significantly reduced pain and morning stiffness and improved physical function and patient global assessment without major adverse effects reported in patients with OA of the knee; and provided significant pain relief in patients with sports and soft tissue injuries involving the ankle, knee or shoulder. In the majority of studies, the predominant adverse effect involved pruritus or rash at the site of application, or nausea. The principle outcome of these studies is that topical diclofenac is a safe and practical alternative as a method of treatment in OA of the knee or as an alternative treatment for sports and soft tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|Acute pain {{caused by}} {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{is very common}} and has a significant negative impact on quality-of-life and societal costs. Many types of acute pain have been managed with traditional oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors (coxibs). Data from prospective, randomised controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicate that use of oral traditional NSAIDs and coxibs is associated with an elevated risk of developing gastrointestinal, renovascular and/or cardiovascular adverse events (AEs). Increasing awareness of the AEs associated with NSAID therapy, including coxibs, has led many physicians and patients to reconsider use of these drugs and look for alternative treatment options. Treatment with NSAIDs via the topical route of administration {{has been shown to}} provide clinically effective analgesia at the site of application while minimising systemic absorption. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic potency of the traditional oral NSAID diclofenac, along with its physicochemical properties, makes it well suited for topical delivery. Several topical formulations of diclofenac have been developed. A topical patch containing diclofenac <b>epolamine</b> 1. 3 % (DETP, FLECTOR® Patch), approved for use in Europe in 1993, has recently been approved for use in the United States and is indicated for the treatment of acute pain caused by minor strains, sprains and contusions. In this article, we review the available clinical trial data for this product in the treatment of pain caused by soft tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|The epicutaneous {{application}} of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in localized rheumatic diseases {{results in a}} highly targeted antiinflammatory action and is associated with reduced systemic effects. The new diclofenac <b>epolamine</b> (DHEP) salt is much more soluble both In water and In lipid solvent than other diclofenac salts. The pharmaceutical addition of lecithin to DHEP leads {{to the formation of}} mixed micelles with high affinity to the cellular component, which guarantees the absorption of the active ingredient. We performed a bioavailability randomized, cross-over study to compare the plasma profiles of diclofenamic acid after repeated epicutaneous administration of the new topical formulation with those of the marketed DHEP formulation without lecithin. Based on a randomization list, 12 healthy volunteers were asked to apply one of the two formulations twice a day for 10 consecutive days. The other formulation was given after a washout period of 1 week. Blood samples were collected before the morning epiculaneous dose on days 1, 3, 5 and 8 of treatment and on day 10 at different sampling times until 24 h after the application. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed a significantly higher plasma concentration of diclofenamic acid after the {{application of}} DHEP lecithin, which indicates a better saturation of the subcutaneous tissues underlying the application site. This also indicates increased local availability of the active principle. In conclusion, the new DHEP formulation with lecithin should have a therapeutic advantage compared with the formulation without lecithin, even in cases of short- to medium-term treatments...|$|E

Data from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolling 274 male and female patients aged 18 to 65 years with acute ankle sprain were pooled and evaluated. The primary end point was pain reduction on movement assessed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Beginning approximately 3 hours after initial treatment, DETP-treated patients experienced statistically significant and sustained lower mean VAS scores in pain intensity on movement (mean &plusmn; SD, 54. 1 &plusmn; 20. 0 mm versus 60. 3 &plusmn; 16. 8 mm) compared with placebo-treated patients, representing a 20 % versus 13 % reduction in VAS pain scores from baseline (P = 0. 012). This statistically significant difference in mean VAS score was maintained through day 7 (9. 4 &plusmn; 14. 4 mm versus 18. 4 &plusmn; 18. 2 mm, P &lt; 0. 0001). The DETP and placebo patches were well tolerated. These results further confirm the efficacy and safety of DETP for the treatment of acute pain from ankle sprains.

Current therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), {{which have a}} high incidence of upper gastrointestinal side effects. The present study assessed the efficacy and safety of the diclofenac <b>epolamine</b> topical patch (DETP, 1. 3 %), a topical NSAID for the treatment of acute minor sprains and strains. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study enrolled adult patients (n = 134) with acute ankle pain (due to a minor sprain) occurring less than 48 hours prior to entering the study. Patients were treated with either the DETP or a placebo topical patch daily for seven days. Pain intensity was evaluated during the first six hours after application of the patch, and on treatment days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Results: Patients treated with the DETP experienced a significantly greater reduction in pain associated with their ankle injury compared with placebo, beginning four hours after the first patch application (P = 0. 02). The DETP was well tolerated and was comparable with placebo in terms of safety. Conclusion: Overall, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that the DETP is an effective analgesic for local treatment of pain in mild acute ankle sprain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common, {{disabling}} {{condition and}} a burden for the individual, {{health services and}} society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. Diclofenac is an established analgesic, and new formulations using the potassium or <b>epolamine</b> salts, which can be dissolved in water, {{have been developed for}} rapid absorption, which may be beneficial in acute migraine. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials. gov, and reference lists for studies through 27 September 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies (1356 participants) compared oral diclofenac with placebo, and one also compared it with sumatriptan; none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic. Four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication, and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response. Only two studies, with three active treatment arms, provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes. For single doses of diclofenac potassium 50 mg versus placebo (two studies), the NNTs were 6. 2, 8. 9, and 9. 5 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at two hours, and pain-free responses at 24 hours, respectively. Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, and functional disability were reduced within two hours, and similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient. There were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac, or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens; only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator (oral sumatriptan 100 mg). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Oral diclofenac potassium 50 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine, providing relief from pain and associated symptoms, although only a minority of patients experience pain-free responses.
