5|$|On February 5, 2009, TNT {{announced}} {{the addition of}} H–O–R–S–E to its All-Star Weekend coverage. The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to duplicate the shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was <b>done</b> <b>properly.</b>|$|E

25|$|The coat must be {{stripped}} by hand or a non-cutting knife {{to retain its}} weather-resistant qualities. This does not hurt the dog when <b>done</b> <b>properly.</b> Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut {{with the other hand}} helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat – use your fingers or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its weather-resistant characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.|$|E
25|$|Being a koryū, an {{old school}} with a {{traditional}} way of teaching, SMR relies on verbal instructions (as opposed to the detailed manuals of the more modern era) in order to teach {{the large majority of}} the practical applications in the art. The teacher-student relationship is very important to koryu-arts. The training forms (kata) alone do not (and cannot for practical reasons) reveal all the large number of practical applications and variations of the techniques. This can only be <b>done</b> <b>properly</b> by an experienced teacher who spends many years passing on the teachings to the student in person. Many koryū arts have deliberately hidden some, or all, applications inside their training forms, making them invisible unless properly explained by a teacher knowledgeable in the art. This was done as a way of making sure the secrets and principles could not be copied by rival schools or individuals, should an outsider accidentally (or by deliberate spying) observe the techniques in action.|$|E

I'm rooting for Arya and Maisie as well. Even though I won't be able {{to hang out with}} everyone again, I think it was done right and <b>done</b> <b>properly.</b> I think Arya deserved to rip off her face and stick it on a wall."

500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, they wanted it to be <b>done</b> <b>properly.</b> Gillan recalled, [...] "we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E

500|$|Ralambo is {{credited}} with introducing the tradition of polygamy in Imerina. The Merina legend {{of the origin of}} this practice was recorded in the 19th-century collection of Merina andriana oral history and genealogy entitled Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara. According to this source, Ralambo had already married once when his servant encountered the beautiful princess Rafotsimarobavina and four female companions gathering edible greens in a valley west of Ambohidrabiby. Upon hearing of her beauty, Ralambo instructed the servant to make her a marriage offer on his behalf. The servant asked three times, and each time the princess refused to give her consent, instead replying [...] "If Ralambo is king and I am queen." [...] The fourth time, after Ralambo had instructed his servant to carry her to him by force, the princess agreed to marry on the condition that it be <b>done</b> <b>properly</b> with the consent of her parents, a condition to which the king agreed. Ralambo then informed his first wife of his intention to marry again, to which she replied, [...] "I approve your decision," [...] and the marriage was made. Ralambo ultimately took four wives in total: Rafotsitohina, Rafotsiramarobavina, Ratsitohinina [...] and Rafotsindrindra. These marriages produced three daughters and twelve sons, the eldest of whom, Andriantompokoindrindra, was passed over for Ralambo's succession in favor of his second son, Andrianjaka.|$|E
