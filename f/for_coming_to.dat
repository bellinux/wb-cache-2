Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, {{but not so much}} for physics. This would change. As part of his price <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured professor ordinarius. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.|$|E

When pressed why she stole his bike and a dagger of his, she admits that she had an ulterior motive <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the ball; she plans on killing the prince, as vengeance for ruining her family and driving her father to an early death. Henry tries to talk her out of it and gives her a {{hyacinth}} flower for luck, telling her that he is returning to his own realm at midnight, and that she could start a new life there. Before he can pursue her any further, however, he blacks out and learns that his drink was drugged by Alice, a mysterious woman ordered by Rumpelstiltskin to keep a eye on Henry. Despite her warnings of the dangers of meddling in someone else's story, Henry chooses to stay and help. As Cinderella meets the prince, she pulls out the dagger, but eventually has a change of heart. Unfortunately, Tremaine takes the opportunity to kill him for turning down Drizella, and frames Cinderella for the murder. As the guards close in, Henry breaks out of his trance and helps Cinderella to escape, reiterating his offer and telling her to meet him where her carriage crashed.|$|E

500|$|The punishments {{doled out}} to the Quakers {{intensified}} as their perceived threat to the Puritan religious order increased. [...] These included the stocks and pillory, lashes with a three-corded, knotted whip, fines, imprisonment, mutilation (having ears cut off), banishment and death. [...] When whipped, women were stripped to the waist, thus being publicly exposed, and whipped until bleeding. [...] Such was the fate of Dyer's Newport neighbor, Herodias Gardiner who had made a perilous journey through a 60-mile wilderness to get to Weymouth in the Massachusetts colony. [...] She had made the arduous trek with another woman and with her [...] "Babe sucking at her Breast" [...] to give her Quaker testimony to friends in Weymouth. [...] Similarly, Katharine, the wife of Richard Scott, and a younger sister of Anne Hutchinson, had received ten lashes <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> visit her future son-in-law, Christopher Holder, in prison. This was the setting into which Mary Dyer stepped, upon her return from England.|$|E
500|$|Claire Redfield was {{originally}} known as 'Elza Walker', the female {{lead in the}} original version of Resident Evil 2 (in 1997, {{after a year of}} work, this version of the game was scrapped by the development team and is now widely referred to as [...] "Resident Evil 1.5"). In the released version of the game, rewritten by Noboru Sugimura, Elza Walker, a blond college student and motorcycle racer, was changed into Chris Redfield's sister named Claire. Her appearance and background remained mostly unchanged, but she was given an explanation for her skills with firearms and other weapons and her reason <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Raccoon City was to search for Chris, as opposed to trying to recruit fans at Raccoon City university to form a racing team back in her hometown. She was also given physical features which more closely resemble her brother, her signature jacket with [...] "Made in Heaven" [...] printed on the back, and a sheath for a standard-issue S.T.A.R.S. knife from Chris. These changes that occurred were done to connect Resident Evil 2 to the original game.|$|E

Dallas named it Brown Bread, {{and it was the}} first of a series of 'Tripes' that he would fly and fight in over the next year. He achieved his first victory with Brown Bread on 1July, the same day he was promoted to flight lieutenant. Three days later, he was recommended for further promotion. He scored his last Nieuport-mounted 'kill' on 9July, earning the Croix de guerre and a mention in despatches <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the aid of a French Maurice Farman biplane. On 7September 1916, Dallas was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, [...] "for the specially gallant manner in which he has carried out his duties" [...] since first seeing action in December 1915. By the end of the year he was among the earliest RNAS aces, with eight confirmed and four unconfirmed victories, and had been raised to the rank of flight commander.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} played by Madonna {{as a part}} of the promotional campaigns for the Confessions on a Dance Floor album, in London's night clubs, {{including}} the Koko Club and G-A-Y. During the performances at the clubs, Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots. In the Confessions Tour, the song was the fourth performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. As the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended, Madonna sat on a platform and announced [...] "Ladies and Gentleman! Thank you <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> our show. The night is young, and the show has just begun." [...] A huge assortment of steel rods and gymnastic equipment were planted on the stage. Madonna started singing the song, as her dancers started running around, displaying routines in parkour. Madonna climbs on blocks to sing the song as well as to strike poses. As the final chorus approached, Madonna went to the front of the stage and struck poses while holding on to the steel rods. The song continued with Madonna swiveling around the rods and the dancers continuing their routine. The performance ends with Madonna disappearing through the middle of the stage and her dancers doing a final vault before the lights are turned off. In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Jump" [...] was sampled in the song [...] "Into the Groove" [...] during which Madonna performed stunts in the air.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, I see all of you who have come to see me, and I'm completely awestruck. Thank you, and I hope you like the movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E
