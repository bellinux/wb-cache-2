Though rare, metallosis has been observed at an estimated incidence of 5% of metal <b>joint</b> <b>implant</b> patients over the last 40 years. Women may be at slightly higher risk than men.

50|$|The main {{properties}} {{required from}} an artificial <b>joint</b> <b>implant</b> are long term strength and stability under cyclic load (up to seven times body weight), bio-chemical inertness, wear resistance and biological bio-compatibility. Years of clinical {{experience with a}} variety of metals and polymers fell short of achieving all the requirements. Carbon is the basic component of organic material and in certain configurations is extremely stable mechanically and chemically. In this pioneer collaboration between Rafael industry and scientists from the Technion, a carbon composite hip implant was constructed. The implant was created using carbon fibers and carbon matrix. The result achieved three dimensions stability in compression and tension. The composite hip was implanted in animal experiments at the Technion laboratory by a team of the Center for Implant Surgery. These experiments did, however, uncover the one disadvantage of carbon composite: weakness in resistance to wear in friction and cyclic motion.|$|E

40|$|Total joint {{replacement}} is {{a common}} orthopedic procedure. An artificial <b>joint</b> <b>implant</b> may fail due to mechanical mishap and a granulomatous reaction can be induced by the artificial joint debris after the mechanical failure. We report a case of an exaggerated pigmented granulomatous tissue response to metallic artificial <b>joint</b> <b>implant</b> debris in a 72 -yr-old male that was mistaken for metastatic melanoma. The mass was soft, pigmented, ill-defined, and located in the right inguinal region. Fine-needle aspiration revealed numerous black-pigment laden cells. The cellular features were frequently obscured by the heavy pigmentation. Occasional cells exhibited atypia and prominent nucleoli. There were also abundant extracellular irregular small black particles dispersed in the background. The diagnosis of melanoma involving a lymph node was made. Since there was no prior history of melanoma, it was presumed that this represented metastatic melanoma from an unknown primary. A subsequent exploration of the groin was performed {{with the intent to}} resect the disease. At exploration, the mass was found to be contiguous with the hip joint and the frozen section of the mass revealed no evidence of melanoma. The final tissue diagnosis confirmed the frozen section report and showed a granulomatous reaction. This report underscores the diagnostic dilemma associated with the exaggerated pigmented granulomatous reaction due to an artificial prosthesis. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2004; 30 : 198 â€“ 200.

The incidence is increased after replacement with knee implants that release very low systemic levels of metal ions. A carcinogenic effect of the high levels of metal ions released by large metal-on-metal implants cannot be excluded.

We need to clarify the genetics of osteoarthritis, identify those at risk for progression and severe disease, and identify molecular processes critical for joint survival and failure.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of biomaterial hypersensitivity developing {{in response to}} <b>joint</b> <b>implant</b> materials was first presented more than 30 years ago. Many studies have established probable causation between first-generation metal-on-metal hip implants and hypersensitivity reactions.

The examination of hypersensitivity reactions in current-generation metal-on-metal knee implants is comparatively limited.

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{investigates the}} wear {{characteristics}} of a novel hip implant design. Key features of the design are elastic elements attached to the cup which provide a mechanical means for ball separation during the swing phase of the gait loading cycle. An Archard-based wear formulation was implemented utilizing the ANSYS {{finite element analysis program}} which relates contact pressure and sliding distance to linear wear depth. It is found that low-modulus elastic elements with bonded high-modulus metal coatings offer significant predicted improvement in linear and volumetric wear rates when compared with conventional implant geometries for gait cycle loading and kinematic conditions found in practice.

40|$|Small joint {{replacement}} arthroplasty of {{the hand}} is a well accepted surgical procedure to restore function and cosmesis in an individual with a crippled hand. Silicone elastomers {{have been used as}} prosthetic material in various small hand joints for well over three decades. Although the clinical science aspects of silicone elastomer failure are well known, the physical science aspects of prosthetic failure are scant and vague. In the following thesis, using both an animal model, and actual retrieved specimens which have failed in human service, experimental and failure analysis of silicone finger joints are presented. ^ Fractured surfaces of retrieved silicone trapezial implants, and silicone finger <b>joint</b> <b>implants</b> were studied with both FESEM and SEM; the mode of failure for silicone trapezium is by wear polishing, whereas the finger <b>joint</b> <b>implants</b> failed either by fatigue fracture or tearing of the elastomer, or a combination of both. Thermal analysis revealed that the retrieved elastomer implants maintained its viscoelastic properties throughout the service period. ^ In order to provide for a more functional and physiologic arthroplasty a novel finger joint (Rolamite prosthesis) is proposed using more recently developed thermoplastic polymers. The following thesis also addresses the outcome of the experimental studies of the Rolamite prosthesis in a rabbit animal model, in addition to the failure analysis of the thermoplastic polymers while in service in an in vivo synovial environment. Results of retrieved Rolamite specimens suggest that the use for thermoplastic elastomers such as block copolymer based elastomers in a synovial environment such as a mammalian joint may very well be limited. ...|$|R
