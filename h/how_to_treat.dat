5|$|The {{committee}} {{reported on}} the other four senators in February 1991, but delayed its final report on Cranston until November 1991. During that period there was partisan-aligned disagreement within the committee over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> Cranston, and in August 1991 a special counsel's report was released by Helms. A delay was also caused when Pryor {{suffered a heart attack}} in April 1991, and was replaced on the committee by Jeff Bingaman. Bingaman spent months learning the complex materials involved in the matter, only to resign in July due to a conflict of interest. Pryor was reassigned to the committee in August 1991, so as to not further delay its deliberations.|$|E

5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} as to <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> {{the wider}} battlefields surrounding these monuments. At {{the end of}} the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, and the {{issue of whether or not}} to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E

25|$|Otto Berman, {{the oldest}} and least {{physically}} fit of the four men, {{was the first to}} die, at 2:20 that morning. At the hospital, Landau and Rosencrantz waited for surgery and refused to say anything to the police until Schultz arrived and gave them permission; even then, they provided the police with only minimal information. Abe Landau died of exsanguination eight hours after the shooting. Meanwhile, Rosencrantz was taken into surgery; the doctors, incredulous that Rosencrantz was still alive despite voluminous blood loss and ballistic trauma, were unsure of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> him. He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E
25|$|The show also covered {{many social}} issue storylines, {{including}} sexual assault, mental illness, and alcoholism. When Lorna was raped {{after a night}} of heavy drinking, viewers watched as she dealt with the aftermath of her brutal attack. She originally pointed the finger at Morgan Winthrop (Grayson McCouch), but her rapist turned out to be Kyle Barkley (Roger Floyd). Cass and Frankie were devastated when their daughter, Charlie (Lindsay Fabes), became ill. Luckily, she recovered, but Cass had begun acting strangely. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which had been triggered by Charlie's illness. Again, viewers were informed: they learned both the symptoms of the illness and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> it by watching Cass see a counselor and start to take medication. Felicia had begun drinking heavily after Lucas's death, but she refused to call herself an alcoholic. After her friends staged an intervention, she found help through Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E

25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E
25|$|An early {{exploration}} in 1993â€“1994 of VRT {{was done by}} Ralph Lamson a USC graduate then at Kaiser Permanente Psychiatry Group. Lamson began publishing his work in 1993. As a psychologist, he was most concerned with the medical and therapeutic aspects, that is, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> people using the technology, rather than the apparatus, which was obtained from Division, Inc. Psychology Today reported in 1994 that these 1993â€“1994 treatments were successful in about 90% of Lamson's virtual psychotherapy patients. Lamson wrote in 1993 a book entitled Virtual Therapy {{which was published in}} 1997 directed primarily to the detailed explanation of the anatomical, medical and therapeutic basis for the success of VRT. In 1994â€“1995, he had solved his own acrophobia in a test use of a third party VR simulation and then set up a 40 patient test funded by Kaiser Permanente. Shortly thereafter, in 1994â€“1995, Larry Hodges, then a computer scientist at Georgia Tech active in VR, began studying VRT in cooperation with Max North who had reported anomalous behavior in flying carpet simulation VR studies and attributed such to phobic response of unknown nature. Hodges tried to hire Lamson without success in 1994 and instead began working with Barbara Rothbaum, a psychologist at Emory University to test VRT in controlled group tests, experiencing about 70% success among 50% of subjects completing the testing program.|$|E
