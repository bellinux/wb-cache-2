50|$|Today {{the company}} {{supplies}} drinking water to roughly one million households through its 95 water supply works and 13,700 kilometres of water mains. Wastewater is {{treated by the}} company's network of 370 wastewater treatment works and almost 40,000 kilometres of sewers. Also, the treatment of sludge results in a nutrient-rich <b>granulated</b> <b>fertiliser</b> which the company sells to the farming industry.|$|E
5000|$|A controlled-release {{fertiliser}} (CRF) is a <b>granulated</b> <b>fertiliser</b> that releases nutrients gradually {{into the}} soil (i.e., with a controlled release period). [...] The slowness of the release {{is determined by the}} low solubility of the chemical compounds in the soil moisture. Since conventional fertilisers are soluble in water, the nutrients can disperse quickly as the fertiliser dissolves. Because controlled-release fertilisers are not water-soluble, their nutrients disperse {{into the soil}} more slowly. The fertiliser granules may have an insoluble substrate or a semi-permeable jacket that prevents dissolution while allowing nutrients to flow outward.|$|E
40|$|Biosolids {{were applied}} with urea {{to produce a}} <b>granulated</b> organo-mineral <b>{{fertiliser}}</b> (OMF) for ap-plication by farm fertiliser equipment {{to a range of}} agricultural crops. The recommended rates of nitrogen, phosphate and potash were calculated for the test crops using “The Fertiliser Manual”, which assesses the nutrient requirement based on previous cropping, rainfall and soil index. The OMF produced similar crop yields compared to ammonium nitrate fertiliser when applied as a top-dressing to winter wheat, forage maize and grass cut for silage in the cropping years 2010 to 2014. In 2012 the grain yield of spring barley top-dressed with OMF was significantly lower than the conventional fertiliser treatment, due to dry conditions following application. For this reason it is recommended that OMF is incorporated into the seedbed for spring sown crops and The Safe Sludge Matrix guidelines followed. The experimental work presented shows that OMF can be used in sustainable crop production systems as a source of nitrogen and phosphorus for a range of ag-ricultural crops...|$|R
40|$|Fertilisation is {{considered}} essential for tree growth on cut-over peatlands. However, {{little research has}} been carried out on these managed ecosystems in North America. Two experiments were conducted on peatlands planted with black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill B. S. P.) and tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch). The first experiment compared the efficiency of six different localised and soil-incorporated fertilisers, applied at planting time, in promoting the growth and survival of seedlings. A second experiment evaluated the nutritional needs of previously established black spruce and tamarack plantations that exhibited stagnating growth. Growth and survival of black spruce seedlings were best improved with the commercial Forest PakTM fertiliser (2 N- 0. 5 P- 0. 7 K g per plant), whilst for tamarack the optimum was reached with an experimental formulation fertiliser (7 N- 3 P- 5 K g per plant). Spot fertilisation with <b>granulated</b> PK <b>fertiliser</b> (0 N- 3. 1 P- 5. 7 K g per plant) led to lower success for both species. For re-fertilisation, the shortage of phosphorus was the most growth-limiting factor for both tree species. Tamarack showed a beneficial response to a complementary application of potassium, whereas for black spruce the application of nitrogen and potassium in addition to phosphorous induced an additional growth increase...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{fertilisers}} {{provide a}} convenient and {{effective means of}} maintaining a satisfactory level of balanced nutrition in nurseries provided they are used with proper regard to timing and in quantities which have some relation to the actual requirements. For many years their regular use has been regarded as an accepted part of nursery husbandry. In New Zealand Forest Service nurseries, {{as well as some}} private forest nurseries, assessment of requirements is made largely on the basis of standardised agricultural soil tests. Soil sampling methods and interpretation of soil test results are outlined. Prescriptions based on soil test ratings have generally helped to maintain satisfactory growth in successive crops, while preventing cumulative excesses which could also adversely affect nursery stock. Fertilisers are commonly applied during bed preparation (especially P, K and secondary nutrients (Ca, Mg, S) as low-cost simple agricultural fertilisers), as well as later during the period when seedlings are making rapid growth (light maintenance side- or topdressings of <b>granulated</b> multinutrient <b>fertilisers</b> or nitrogenous fertilisers according to soil requirements). In the event of poor growth or malnutrition symptoms affecting a crop, visual diagnosis, aided where necessary by foliar analysis, is used to resolve the cause so that prompt remedial action can be taken, e. g., by foliar spray. Descriptions of diagnostic symptoms and "critical " foliar nutrient levels for radiata pine seedlings are given...|$|R
