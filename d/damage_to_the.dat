5|$|Reports of <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury {{in one case}} series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and right {{hypoglossal nerve}}s may occur with <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> facial and trigeminal nerves {{as a result of}} damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery.
