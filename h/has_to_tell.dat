500|$|Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, {{a former}} U.S. Navy admiral, began privately {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} seeking the Democratic nomination {{with his family in}} December 2008. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on CNN's State of the Union with John King, Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, [...] "I think Arlen <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us not that it was too hard to run against someone. ...

Andrew isn't happy with his presence and he and Orson are both suspicious of Sam's true intentions and decide to investigate. Bree soon realizes Sam is emotionally unstable and tries to fire him.

The Sydney Morning Herald noted: [...] "This is a wonderful insider’s view of the (1948 Ashes) series... Perry is a good, unpretentious writer and the story he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> is one of courage and drama... It is a great Australian yarn." [...] Adrian Nesbitt in Sydney’s Sun Herald wrote: [...] "Perry paints an excellent background picture of a tour that is remembered by Australians as a triumph over the mother country, often without consideration that England was still bearing the scars of war... Perry creates suspenseful moments, in the dressing-room and on the field... His meticulous approach gives us a great understanding of the subtleties and room for instinct that were Bradman trademarks." [...] Teri Louise Kelly in Independent Weekly said, [...] "Perry’s work, much like Bradman himself, is head and shoulders above the competition... Bradman’s Invincibles leads the reader into the dusty backrooms, on to windy training pitches and mid-Test; beautifully written and accompanies by excellent photographs." [...] David Stanley in Cricket Boundary Magazine commented: [...] "Bradman’s Invincibles is required reading for all cricket lovers, particularly those of the younger brigade who may not know much about the players, apart from Bradman, who made up his remarkable team... It is a good read and I recommend it." [...] Inside Sport noted: [...] "Perry’s prose provides worthwhile insight into the mechanics of Bradman’s mind." [...] Neil Harvey, one the Invincibles stars, [...] said: [...] "I found it a very entertaining read. It brought memories flooding back." ...|$|E

Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they have to take care of Emma.|$|E
