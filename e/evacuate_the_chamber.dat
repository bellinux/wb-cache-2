50|$|In a prototypical ALD process, a {{substrate}} {{is exposed}} to two reactants A and B in a sequential, non-overlapping way. In contrast to other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where thin film growth proceeds on a steady-state fashion, in ALD each reactant reacts with the surface in a self-limited way: the reactant molecules can react only with {{a finite number of}} reactive sites on the surface. Once all those sites have been consumed in the reactor, the growth stops. The remaining reactant molecules are flushed away and only then reactant B is inserted into the reactor. By alternating exposures of A and B, a thin film is deposited. This process is shown in the side figure. Consequently, when describing an ALD process one refers to both dose times (the time a surface is being exposed to a precursor) and purge times (the time left in between doses for the precursor to <b>evacuate</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber)</b> for each precursor. The dose-purge-dose-purge sequence of a binary ALD process constitutes an ALD cycle. Also, rather than using the concept of growth rate, ALD processes are described in terms of their growth per cycle.|$|E

Dinesh-Kumar 1 Corresponding author ([savithramma. dinesh-kumar@yale. edu](mailto:savithramma. dinesh-kumar@yale. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION The {{inherent}} RNA silencing {{mechanism in}} plants has been effectively manipulated {{as a tool}} for the targeted down-regulation of genes. Numerous methods have been employed to initiate this homology-based RNA degradation process, but all rely on the activity of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) corresponding to the gene of interest. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has gained acceptance as the tool of choice for transient induction of silencing. It involves creation of engineered viruses carrying sequences corresponding to the host gene to be silenced. Infection leads to synthesis of viral dsRNA, an intermediate step in viral replication. This activates the anti-viral RNA silencing pathway, resulting in down-regulation of the host gene transcript. While several VIGS vectors have been developed, the Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) provides the most robust results in terms of efficiency, ease of application, and absence of disease symptoms. Engineered TRV vectors carrying host-derived segments are transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is then introduced into the plant. This protocol outlines a simple procedure for introducing the TRV-based binary vectors pTRV 1 and pTRV 2 into solanaceous plants such as *Nicotiana benthamiana* and *Solanum lycopersicon* (tomato), as well as *Arabidopsis*. ### RELATED INFORMATION This protocol is an updated version of [Delivery of dsRNA into Plants by VIGS Methodology]([URL] (Burch-Smith et al. 2006 a). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** - *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*, strain GV 2260 or GV 3101, containing pTRV 1 - *GV 2260 is ideal for silencing in N. benthamiana, whereas GV 3101 is used for tomato and Arabidopsis*. - *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*, strain GV 2260 or GV 3101, containing pTRV 2 alone (empty plasmid; negative control), pTRV 2 with a fragment of the *phytoene desaturase* gene (PDS; positive control), or pTRV 2 with a fragment of the target gene - *To ensure efficient VIGS, use of both positive and negative controls is advised. PDS silencing leads to a visible bleached phenotype that can be easily scored (Fig. 1) *. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Silencing of the phytoene desaturase gene (PDS) using VIGS. N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with Agrobacterium containing either the empty vector TRV 2 (TRV 2 -Empty Vector) or TRV 2 with a PDS fragment (TRV 2 -NbPDS) and photographed 12 d post-infiltration. Plants with the empty TRV vector appear similar to healthy uninoculated plants, whereas TRV 2 -NbPDS-inoculated plants have newly emerged leaves with the photobleached phenotype characteristic of PDS silencing. - Infiltration medium - Luria Broth (LB) liquid medium containing appropriate antibiotics - Plant of interest, e. g., *N. benthamiana* (four-leaf stage), *S. lycopersicon* (two-leaf stage), or *Arabidopsis* (three- to four-leaf stage) ### Equipment - Air compressor, portable (e. g., Campbell Hausfeld) (for spray inoculation; see Step 6. v) - Airbrush, artist’s (e. g., Paasche V- 180 or equivalent) (for spray inoculation; see Step 6. v) - Beaker, plastic, 500 mL (for vacuum infiltration; see Step 6. vii) - Centrifuge - Desiccator, 240 -mm diameter (Bel-Art Products) (for vacuum infiltration; see Step 6. ix) - Incubator preset to 26 ¡C - Gloves, latex (for syringe infiltration; see Step 6. iii) - Growth carts - Razor blade (for syringe infiltration; see Step 6. ii) - Shaker - Spectrophotometer - Syringe, needleless, 1 mL (for syringe infiltration; see Step 6. i) - Vacuum pump (Fisher-Biotech FB-DVP- 0352 or equivalent) (for vacuum infiltration; see Step 6. ix) ### METHOD **Preparing Agrobacterium** 1. Inoculate *Agrobacterium* GV 2260 or GV 3101 containing the TRV 1 and TRV 2 vectors in LB containing appropriate antibiotics. Grow the culture overnight at 26 ¡C with shaking. - *Five milliliters of Agrobacterium culture is sufficient to inoculate three to four plants. The culture volume can be scaled up {{based on the number of}} plants to be used for silencing*. - Collect the cells by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 - 30 min. Resuspend the *Agrobacterium* pellet in infiltration medium. - Adjust the OD 600 to 1. 0 for *N. benthamiana* infiltration, 1. 5 for *Arabidopsis* infiltration, or 1. 5 - 2. 0 for tomato infiltration. If the vacuum infiltration method (see Steps 6. vii- 6. x) is used for introducing *Agrobacterium*, adjust the OD 600 to 0. 4 for pTRV 1 and 0. 2 for pTRV 2. - Incubate the cultures at room temperature for 3 - 6 h. - *A minimum of 3 h ensures sufficient activation of the Agrobacterium Vir genes that enhance transformation efficiency*. **Infiltration of Agrobacterium** 5. Mix the *Agrobacterium* cultures containing TRV 1 and TRV 2 1 : 1 just before infiltration. 6. Introduce *Agrobacterium* into the leaves of the plants of interest using one of the following methods: *Use the spray inoculation or vacuum infiltration methods for VIGS in tomato plants*. - Syringe infiltration: - i. Load a 1 -mL needleless syringe with the *Agrobacterium* mixture. - ii. Using the corner of a razor blade, gently nick the underside of the lower two leaves of the plant. - iii. Place the mouth of the syringe on the nick. Create a seal on the other side of the leaf by placing a finger from the other gloved hand just beneath the nick. - iv. Using minimal pressure, inject the *Agrobacterium* culture into the leaf. Repeat this step until the two lower leaves has been completely infiltrated. - *When performing multiple silencing experiments, take care to avoid cross-contamination. Use fresh gloves and syringes for each infiltration*. - Spray inoculation: - v. Load the *Agrobacterium* solution into an artist’s airbrush that is attached to a pressure compressor set to 80 psi. - vi. Spray the ventral side of the two lower leaves from a distance of ~ 8 in. for 1 - 5 sec. - Vacuum infiltration: - vii. Transfer the culture into a 500 -mL beaker. - viii. Turn the plant upside down. Submerge the plant completely inside the *Agrobacterium* solution. - ix. Place the beaker containing the submerged plant inside a vacuum desiccator attached to a vacuum pump. - x. <b>Evacuate</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> using a maximum vacuum of 29. 5 cm Hg for 90 sec. 7. Grow the plants in growth carts. Maintain at an ambient temperature of 25 ¡C (for *N. benthamiana*) and ~ 21 ¡C (for tomato and *Arabidopsis*). - *For *N. benthamiana*, VIGS efficiency is high under continuous light, whereas a 16 -h light/ 8 -h dark cycle is ideal for tomato and *Arabidopsis*. * 8. Visualize the VIGS phenotype 6 - 10 d post-infiltration. - *The upper (i. e., uninoculated) leaves of plants infiltrated with the positive control (TRV 2 -PDS) should develop a bleached phenotype indicating efficient silencing (Fig. 1). Plants infiltrated with the TRV 2 empty plasmid should resemble healthy uninoculated plants*. 9. Quantify the RNA levels of the silenced genes using northern blot hybridization or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Uniform silencing is not observed. **[Step 8]** - **Solution**: Multiple factors can affect the efficiency of VIGS: - 1. Growth conditions: Agrobacterium transformation efficiency is optimal at 16 ¡C- 21 ¡C, whereas VIGS efficiency for N. benthamiana is good at ~ 23 ¡C- 25 ¡C. Tomato plants show drastically reduced VIGS efficiency at temperatures above 21 ¡C. For *Arabidopsis*, short day conditions (8 h light/ 16 h dark) are suboptimal for VIGS induction. - 2. Age of the plant: If the plants are older than the stages indicated above, this can lead to a decrease in efficiency. - 3. Gene fragment chosen for silencing: Fragments of 300 - 1500 bp have been used successfully to induce VIGS. Silencing efficiency is reduced below 300 bp, whereas with longer fragments there is a strong possibility of the insert being lost from the recombinant virus. Different gene fragments can show variability in VIGS efficiency. Try to insert fragments from different regions within the same gene. ### DISCUSSION Elucidation of plant gene function has conventionally employed the use of stable insertions in the gene of interest. Homology-based silencing techniques have proven to be an attractive alternative that can overcome some of the limitations seen with gene knockouts. dsRNA can be introduced into plants either as stable hairpin-RNA-synthesizing transgenes or by infection with recombinant viruses that carry segments of plant genes (Baulcombe 1999; Wang and Waterhouse 2002). The advantage of VIGS is that it precludes the need for laborious and time-consuming plant transformation. It is possible to silence multiple classes of closely related genes, as well as genes where true knockouts are embryo-lethal. It is also more amenable to high-throughput studies and has been used successfully in model and non-model host systems (Lu et al. 2003; Burch-Smith et al. 2004; 2006 b; Constantin et al. 2004; Fofana et al. 2004; Ding et al. 2006). TRV has been perfected as a VIGS vector: It provides robust silencing, has a broad host range, can infect meristematic tissue, and produces only mild disease symptoms (Ratcliff et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2002; Burch-Smith et al. 2006 b). Using Agrobacterium to introduce TRV to the host also overcomes the need for cumbersome in vitro transcription of viral RNA or biolistic delivery. Recently, the Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus has been adapted for VIGS in *Arabidopsis* and provides robust silencing following simple mechanical inoculation with a plasmid-carrying engineered virus (Pflieger et al. 2008). Despite these advantages, it must be noted that VIGS provides only transient silencing and can only lead to reduced transcript accumulation and not a complete loss of transcript. ### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS VIGS work in the Dinesh-Kumar lab was supported by NSF. ### REFERENCES 1.

Possibility to control nozzle capacity through the regulated connection of <b>the</b> <b>evacuated</b> <b>chamber</b> to <b>the</b> atmosphere was experimentally estimated, thus depth of flow rate regulation of the nozzle with a triangular orifice was 45 % in comparison with 10 % regulation depth of the nozzle with a round orifice. Depth of regulation calculated by a mathematical model appeared to be much more. The paper presents experimental dependences of the flow coefficients of nozzle input orifice on the vacuum depth in <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b> Research findings allowed us to express opinion that accepted in the works on "Fluid Mechanics " equality of pressure values in the center of cross-stream gravity and in its surrounding steam-gas medium is incorrect. The paper shows a possibility to create the nozzle design with updated device to connect a <b>chamber</b> to <b>the</b> atmosphere by the air throttle, which is flow pressure-controlled thus providing the nozzle operation as the flow rate stabilizer. The publication supplements information on nozzles provided in literature on " Fluid Mechanics". The developed {{design of the}} external cylindrical nozzle with controlled vacuum and of research results of its working capacity can be taken into consideration in designing hydraulic systems and devices of hydro-automatic equipment...|$|R
50|$|A plasma etcher, or etching tool, {{is a tool}} used in the {{production}} of semiconductor devices. A plasma etcher produces a plasma from a process gas, typically oxygen or a fluorine-bearing gas, using a high frequency electric field, typically 13.56 MHz. A silicon wafer is placed in the plasma etcher, and <b>the</b> air is <b>evacuated</b> from <b>the</b> process <b>chamber</b> using a system of vacuum pumps. Then a process gas is introduced at low pressure, and is excited into a plasma through dielectric breakdown.|$|R
50|$|If the gas used is oxygen, {{the plasma}} is an effective, economical, {{environmentally}} safe method for critical cleaning. The VUV energy is {{very effective in}} the breaking of most organic bonds (i.e., C-H, C-C, C=C, C-O, and C-N) of surface contaminants. This helps to break apart high molecular weight contaminants. A second cleaning action is {{carried out by the}} oxygen species created in the plasma (O2+, O2&minus;, O3, O, O+, O&minus;, ionised ozone, metastable excited oxygen, and free electrons). These species react with organic contaminants to form H2O, CO, CO2, and lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. These compounds have relatively high vapor pressures and are <b>evacuated</b> from <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> during processing. <b>The</b> resulting surface is ultra-clean. In Fig. 2, a relative content of carbon over material depth is shown before and after cleaning with excited oxygen 1.|$|R

5000|$|In 1960 Everhart and Richard F. M. Thornley {{published}} a description for the improved {{design of a}} secondary electron detector, since known as the Everhart-Thornley detector. Everhart and Thornley increased the efficiency of existing detectors by adding a light pipe to carry the photon signal from the scintillator inside <b>the</b> <b>evacuated</b> specimen <b>chamber</b> of <b>the</b> scanning electron microscopes to the photomultiplier outside <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] This strengthened the signal collected and improved the signal-to-noise ratio. In 1963, Pease and Nixon incorporated the Everhart-Thornley detector into their prototype for the first commercial SEM, later developed as the Cambridge Scientific Instruments Mark I Stereoscan. This type of secondary electron and back-scattered electron detector is still used in modern scanning electron microscopes (SEMs).|$|R

50|$|Sachs Patera is {{a feature}} on Venus. Defined as a sag-caldera, Sachs is an {{elliptical}} depression 130 meters (81 feet) in depth, spanning 40 km in width along its longest axis. The morphology implies that a chamber of molten material drained and collapsed, forming a depression surrounded by concentric scarps spaced 2 to 5 km apart. The arc-shaped set of scarps, extending {{out to the}} north from the prominent ellipse, is evidence for a separate episode of withdrawal; the small lobe-shaped extension to the southwest may represent an additional event. Solidified lava flows 10 to 25 km long give the caldera its flower-like appearance. The flows are a lighter tone of gray in the radar data because the lava is blockier in texture and consequently returns more radar waves. Much of the lava, which was <b>evacuated</b> from <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> probably traveled to other locations underground, while some of it may have surfaced further south. This is unlike calderas on Earth, where a rim of lava builds up {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the caldera.|$|R

30|$|Gaq 3 {{nanowires}} and nanospheres {{could be}} fabricated by thermal evaporation. The schematic thermal evaporation system had been presented elsewhere [29]. This system mainly {{consists of four}} parts: a process chamber, a pumping system, a gauge system, and a heating system. Two graphite electrodes are installed {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> process <b>chamber.</b> A graphite boat spanning across the two electrodes is used as a resistive heater. The DC current applied to the graphite boat is converted by a power supply transformer. A K-type thermocouple in contact with the boat is employed to control the working temperature. The conjunctional circuits of the power supply, thermocouple, and cooling water are arranged below outside <b>the</b> process <b>chamber.</b> A movable shutter is utilized to control evaporation time. The pumping system including a rotary vane pump and a turbo pump is able to <b>evacuate</b> <b>the</b> process <b>chamber</b> down to a pressure lower than 1 × 10 − 6 torr. The top of <b>the</b> process <b>chamber</b> is a liftable cap with a hollow cavity inside. Liquid nitrogen can be poured into and fill the cavity for rapid uniform cooling of the n-type (100) silicon substrates. The substrates were repeatedly ultrasonically rinsed in acetone followed by dry purge of N 2 gas before use. They were then adhered to the underside of the cap for growth of Gaq 3 nanostructures. A stainless steel ring was put on the graphite boat, and commercial Gaq 3 powder was placed into the ring. The distance between the graphite boat and the substrate was fixed at 10 cm.|$|R
