6000|$|... "Well, you see {{the life}} of a tree is right under the bark. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the outer {{covering}} intact, the tree will live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} are sure of content--that is to say, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> free from doubts. Still, {{there is the}} {{fighting}} instinct, you know; the craving for action. Don't you feel that sometimes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wanted," [...] {{continued}} {{the other man}} quietly, [...] "to hear the truth, Will, and you've got it. For Louisa's sake, for all our sakes, in fact, I {{made up my mind}} to tell you all--or most--that is officially known to me at this moment. You must get Louisa out of town at once--take her abroad <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>keep</b> English newspapers away from her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! If {{the house}} and {{furniture}} will pay the notes I'm content, especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> contrive to <b>keep</b> the lots. Dosie will part with her handkerchief, too, I dare say, if that will do any good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't know," [...] he went on, [...] "that {{a dreamer}} {{is such a}} desperate character, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only <b>keep</b> him from trying to realise his dreams; and if Mr. Peck {{consents}} to stay in Hatboro', perhaps we can manage it." [...] He drew his chair a little toward the lounge where she reclined, and asked, with the kindliness that was both personal and professional, [...] "What {{seems to be the}} matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{corporal}} looked thoughtful. [...] "I'm {{not quite}} sure we'd have camped here if I'd known that," [...] he said. [...] "Still, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your man in hand, I guess I can answer for the trooper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, sir. Follow him round three earths, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> him in sight; but not round four. That is all I contend for, Captain Cuffe. Even women, {{they tell}} me, take {{what is called}} their thirds, in a fellow's fortin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't matter. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the Woozy {{until you}} {{get the rest of}} the things you need, you can take the beast and his three hairs to the Crooked Magician and let him find a way to extract 'em. What are the other things you are to find?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “So {{you have}} shipped, have you?” the {{boatswain}} {{said as he}} led them forward. “Well, you are plucky young cockerels. It ain’t exactly a bed of roses, you will find, at first, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>keep</b> your temper and return a civil {{answer to a question}} you will soon get on all right. You will have more trouble with the other boys than with the men, and will have a battle or two to fight.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About the election, Charles. Well, {{the long}} and short of it is this: that I wish to see you comfortable. To be harassed about money {{is one of the}} most disagreeable {{incidents}} of life. It ruffles the temper, lowers the spirits, disturbs the rest, and finally breaks up one's health. Always, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> possibly <b>can,</b> <b>keep</b> square. And if by any chance you do find yourself in a scrape, come to me. There is nothing under those circumstances like the advice of a cool-headed friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well, my dear,' said Mrs. Woodbourne in her plaintive voice, 'I {{shall be}} glad {{for him to}} go, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{undertake}} to <b>keep</b> him in order, but you must take care you do not tire yourself. You will have almost {{too much to do}} afterwards, and you must not let yourself be harassed by his restlessness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but not {{for coming}} to me--I judged by your looks and tone of voice. Now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> good-natured and pleasant, so as to go on {{steadily}} and patiently, difficulties or no difficulties, I will help you by my advice; otherwise, I think you had better give up the plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kit {{signed him}} {{to go on and}} Olsen resumed: [...] "The Buccaneer will drop out soon and you'll be left to {{do the best you can}} for yourself. Well, I don't suppose you'll get another chance like this; we'll pay you ten {{thousand}} dollars <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the Rio Negro back for a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll be glad enough {{presently}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> going {{even at that}} rate," [...] he retorted {{with his}} air of conscious virtue. [...] "And there's another thing: a man should stand up to his bad luck, to his mistakes, to his conscience and {{all that sort of}} thing. Why--what else would you have to fight against." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then, gentlemen, {{shall we}} {{try a little}} walk? Quick march! Thank you, gentlemen. Sorry to trouble you, {{but it may be}} {{necessary}} to run--forward I mean, of course.. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really do not mind, we will now do the double quick. Halt! And <b>if</b> next time <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> a little more in line--it has a more imposing appearance, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> understand me. The breathing comes with practice." ...|$|R
5000|$|RapReviews editor Arthur Gailes {{states that}} [...] "there is no dip in quality lyrically; 50 is often {{criticized for not}} being a good lyricist, but he's {{exceptionally}} witty in his writtens", and adds that 50 Cent [...] "manages to cover different themes very well", noting his [...] "seduction" [...] on [...] "Follow My Lead". Greene writes that 50 Cent is trying to [...] "revisit the raw fatalism that defined the best tracks on Get Rich or Die Tryin' [...] ", quoting lyrics from [...] "My Gun Go Off" [...] as an example: [...] "You know tomorrow's just a day away / <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>keep</b> your heart beatin' and your ass awake".|$|R
6000|$|... "If you fail," [...] {{continued}} Deane, [...] "and {{find yourself}} in trouble, I know nothing of you. I shall not raise a finger to help you. I demand from you your word of honor {{that you do not}} mention my name, that you deal with Sinclair simply as a speculative financier disposed to be his friend. Remember that the slightest association of my name with yours would give him the clue to the whole thing, and would mean ruin here. On the other hand, before <b>you</b> go, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> tell me that you are going heart and soul into this enterprise, I shall give you five hundred pounds. Some of this you will need for clothes, to make a presentable appearance, {{and to be able to}} entertain Sinclair, and play your part as a capitalist. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> fail, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the balance as a loan or a gift, whichever you like. Now <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take your choice. I am placing a good deal of confidence in you, but I think that I know my man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The next, and last, perplexity {{to settle}} relates, my dear, to {{the chances for}} and against your finding your way, in the {{capacity}} of governess, into Major Milroy's house. Once inside the door, with your knowledge of music and languages, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your temper, you may be sure of keeping the place. The only doubt, as things are now, is whether you can get it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's the doctor," [...] she announced. [...] "It seems I can't satisfy you; ask him what's the matter. Come in, doctor." [...] She {{threw open}} the door of the parlor, and {{introduced}} Emily. [...] "This is the mistress's niece, sir. Please try <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> her quiet. I can't." [...] She placed chairs with the hospitable politeness of the old school--and returned to her post at Miss Letitia's bedside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor do I. I {{thought you}} wouldn't, because you're a sensible, broad-minded... I mean, nor do I. I'm having one last try to-night, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> a secret. You won't tell anyone, will you?" [...] pleaded Mr. Cracknell, urgently. [...] "But I know you won't because you're a sensible... I'm {{giving her a}} little present. Having it brought here to-night. Little present. That ought to soften her, don't you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you keep}} yours," [...] he advised. [...] "You're my nearest of kin, Mary, though you're but my cousin's widdy. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> learn to <b>keep</b> a still tongue {{in your head}} and do what's asked of you, {{there may be a}} trifle coming to you when my time comes. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get these curious fits on you, and they're more than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stand; <b>if</b> you're going bleating from house to house in the village, and {{spending}} your time in tittle-tattling, then we'll part. Them's plain words, anyhow." ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{whenever}} it be possible, let the hounds themselves be your mark, and endeavour {{to remember that}} the leading hounds are those which should guide you. A single hound who turns when he is heading the pack should teach you to turn also. Of all the hounds you see there in the open, probably not one-third are hunting. The others are doing as you do, following where their guides lead them. It is for you to follow the real guide, and not the followers, <b>if</b> only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the real guide in view. To keep the whole pack in view and to ride among them is easy enough when the scent is slack and the pace is slow. At such times let me counsel you to retire somewhat from the crowd, giving place to those eager men who are breaking the huntsman's heart. When the hounds have come nearer to their fox, and the pace is again good, then they will retire and make room for you.|$|R
5000|$|Do not say, [...] "It is the Lord's {{doing that}} I fell away;" [...] for He {{does not do}} what He hates. Do not say, [...] "It was He who led me astray;" [...] for He has no need of the sinful. The Lord hates all abominations; such things are not loved by those who fear Him. It was He who created {{humankind}} in the beginning, and He left them {{in the power of}} their own free choice. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> choose, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the commandments, and to act faithfully is a matter of your own choice. He has placed before you fire and water; stretch out your hand for whichever you choose. Before each person are life and death, and whichever one chooses will be given.|$|R
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> {{your head}} when {{all about you}} [...] Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust {{yourself}} when all men doubt you, [...] But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, [...] Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated don't give way to hating, [...] And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Let an {{unaffected}} gravity, freedom, justice, and sincerity {{shine through}} all your actions, and let no fancies and chimeras give the least check to those excellent qualities. This {{is an easy}} task, if you will but suppose everything you do to be your last, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your passions and appetites from crossing your reason. Stand clear of rashness, and have nothing of insincerity or self-love to infect you.|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> {{your head}} when {{all about you}} [...] Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; [...] If you can trust {{yourself}} when all men doubt you, [...] But make allowance for their doubting too; [...] If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, [...] Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, [...] Or being hated, don't give way to hating, [...] And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{wonder that}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> these knights together, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> charm them thus with song. Would that I could hear you singing thus in William's hall." ...|$|R
60|$|OLIVER. Hello, Winnie! Can I come in? This is your sanctum: <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> us out <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{mean that}} you will be a {{treasure}} to him, he thinks so now; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> him thinking so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was only}} too {{glad to get}} rid of them both, and to take the {{opportunity}} of writing to Philip. I insisted on an explanation of his conduct while I was in the study--to be given within an hour's time, at a place which I appointed. [...] "You are not to attempt to justify yourself in writing," [...] I added in conclusion. [...] "Let your reply merely inform me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the appointment. The rest, when we meet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jethro," [...] Amuba said, [...] "you told me {{you were}} going to escort Mysa one day or other to {{the very top of the}} hills, in order that she could thence look down upon the whole city. Put it into her head to go this morning, or at least persuade her to go into the city. If she goes into the garden she will at once notice that the cat is lost; whereas <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> her away for the day it will give us so much more time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § IV. I {{imagine the}} reader's common sense, if not his {{previous}} knowledge, will {{enable him to}} understand that if the arch at a, Plate III., burst in at the top, it must burst out at the sides. Set up two pieces of pasteboard, edge to edge, and press them down with your hand, {{and you will see}} them bend out at the sides. Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the arch from starting out at the points p, p, it cannot curve in at the top, put what weight on it you will, unless by sheer crushing of the stones to fragments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marcus, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will, {{but then}} your sin against your own honour will be greater even than your sin against me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{carry it}} out. But you must {{remember}} it isn't only laying hold of a rope, you must go on pulling. It's the mistake you lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your pocket, to think you've got a better start in the world <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stick yourselves {{in a place where}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your coats clean, and have the shopwenches take you for fine gentlemen. That wasn't the way I started, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of tar, and I wasn't afraid of handling cheeses. That's the reason I can wear good broadcloth now, and have my legs under the same table {{with the head of the}} best firms in St. Ogg's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care. I {{had to look}} at {{his face}} while I was takin' the belt off. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> your catch <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like. I've no use for mine." ...|$|R
