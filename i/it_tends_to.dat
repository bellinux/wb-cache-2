5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> accumulate {{at the bottom}} of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E

5|$|Like many large, active sharks, {{this species}} adapts poorly to captivity; <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> bump into {{the sides of}} its enclosure, and the {{resulting}} abrasions then become infected with often fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|The New Guinean quoll (D. albopunctatus) {{is found}} {{throughout}} most of New Guinea. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> live at an elevation of about , and is {{not found in the}} south-western lowlands, although it can found on Yapen Island.|$|E
5|$|This variety has open winter rosettes {{composed}} of leaves which are spatulate {{in shape and}} have an obtuse or rounded end. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> grow in limestone-based substrates.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other left groups, the SPGB {{did not see}} fascism as {{a special}} threat to the working class. Rather than formulating it as the last refuge of {{capitalism}} organising to defend itself against the working class, the party’s writers and speakers <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> view <b>it</b> as {{a particular type of}} reform movement. The two specific characteristics identified, though, were that <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be a form of national consolidation – unifying fragment nations such as Germany, Italy and Spain – and that <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have the mass support of the working class.|$|R
50|$|Freud {{proposed}} that psychological energy was constant (hence, emotional changes consisted only in displacements) and that <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> rest (point attractor) through discharge (catharsis).|$|R

5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Inversions. When on a {{clear and}} calm night, a {{radiation}} inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above {{the top of the}} inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet can sometimes be observed. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E

5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} Rift Valley <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be more like the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{dynamics of}} this rule are complicated, including {{the existence of}} small stable structures. However, in the aggregate (when started with all cells in random states) <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> form large regions of cells that {{are all in the}} same state as each other, with the boundaries between these regions evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E

5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as primary ingredients. Various spices are typically used, and <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be a moist cake. Applesauce cake prepared with chunky-style apple sauce {{may be less}} moist. Several additional ingredients may also be used in its preparation, and it is sometimes prepared {{and served as a}} coffee cake. The cake dates back to early colonial times in the United States. National Applesauce Cake Day occurs annually on June 6 in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be relapsing-remitting {{over a long period}} of time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
