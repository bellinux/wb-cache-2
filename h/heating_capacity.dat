5|$|In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, {{engineer}} and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, {{which has a}} lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company {{with the intent of}} building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing <b>heating</b> <b>capacity</b> to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>capacity</b> is an {{extensive}} property of matter, {{meaning that it}} {{is proportional to the}} size of the system. When expressing the same phenomenon as an intensive property, the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> is divided by the amount of substance, mass, or volume, thus the quantity is independent of the size or extent of the sample. The molar <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> is the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> per unit amount (SI unit: mole) of a pure substance, and the specific <b>heat</b> <b>capacity,</b> often called simply specific heat, is the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> per unit mass of a material. Nonetheless some authors use the term specific heat to refer to the ratio of the specific <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of a substance at any given temperature to the specific <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of another substance at a reference temperature, much in the fashion of specific gravity. In some engineering contexts, the volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> is used.|$|R

2500|$|The {{heat pump}} is a {{refrigeration}} based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the {{indoor and outdoor}} coils. [...] This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a [...] "4-way" [...] or [...] "change-over" [...] valve). [...] During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat {{is removed from the}} outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. [...] The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool. [...] Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an [...] "O" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a [...] "B" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. [...] The <b>heating</b> <b>capacity</b> of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. [...] A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. [...] Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. [...] This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. [...] Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil. [...] This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements. [...] The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. [...] The elements are then used in the [...] "reheat" [...] function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail. [...] This function is normally activated by an [...] "E" [...] terminal on the thermostat. [...] When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.|$|E

5000|$|Dulong and Petit {{predicted}} in 1818 [...] {{that the product}} of solid substance density and specific <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> (ρcp) would be constant for all solids. This amounted to a prediction that volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> in solids would be constant. In 1819 they found that volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>capacities</b> were not quite constant, but that the most constant quantity was the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of solids adjusted by the presumed weight of the atoms of the substance, as defined by Dalton (the Dulong-Petit law). This quantity was proportional to the <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> per atomic weight (or per molar mass), which suggested {{that it is the}} <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> per atom (not per unit of volume) which is closest to being a constant in solids. Eventually (see the discussion in <b>heat</b> <b>capacity)</b> it became clear that <b>heat</b> <b>capacities</b> per particle for all substances in all states are the same, to within a factor of two, so long as temperatures are not in the cryogenic range.
