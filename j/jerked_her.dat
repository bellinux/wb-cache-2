25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams went right into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her coccyx when a stuntman <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
6000|$|Gertie <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> arm away, averted her profile, grated: [...] "If {{you miss}} her so much, perhaps you'd better run after her. Really, I wouldn't interfere, not for worlds!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> hand away, and, burying it {{with its}} mate in his curly mop, {{shook his head}} back and forth. [...] "What shall I do with him, father?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Stacy Campbell {{reportedly}} {{lost control}} of her head movements when prophesying and would wildly <b>jerk</b> <b>her</b> {{head from side to}} side while [...] "under the spirit" [...] similar to this video of her that was recorded much later.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a sneak! You're a robber! That's my house, and {{the sooner}} {{you get out of}} it the better!" [...] shrieked Jenny Wren, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> tail with every word as she hopped about just out of reach of Bully.|$|R
6000|$|Thatcher stood {{dumb and}} astounded at this capricious girl. She saw his mystification instantly. [...] "It {{is for the}} old Cat!" [...] she whispered, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> thumb over her {{shoulder}} {{in the direction of}} the sleeping Mrs. P. [...] "Good night,--go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mine's Philadelphia. But {{everybody}} except Rene {{calls me}} Phil. I'm Squire Bucksteed's daughter--over at Marklake yonder.' She <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> little round chin towards the south behind Dallington. 'Sure-ly you know Marklake?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get up!" [...] He <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> roughly erect {{and stood}} up himself. [...] "Thou art a woman. Wherefore the dirt {{is no place for}} thee, nor the feet of any man." ...|$|E
60|$|The Lizard {{dropped into}} {{a chair at the}} table with the girl, and after Jimmy had taken his order and {{departed}} for the kitchen Little Eva <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> thumb toward his retreating figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, don't 'ee know? 'Tes Gwenny Mara--prettiest, {{brightest}} maid {{in these}} parts." [...] And, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> thumb towards the neglected bridegroom, she added: [...] "He's a lucky young chap. She'm a sunny maid, for sure, and a gude maid tu." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That they what?' cried Catherine, {{gazing at}} him with a troubled countenance. 'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> head away from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl! That's enough; let me alone. What are you on the point of {{complaining}} about, Heathcliff?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall!" [...] {{he cried}} once, and, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> forward, {{he brought her}} falling from the fence. But her wild [...] "Ah!" [...] of pain, {{as if she were}} losing consciousness, cut him. She landed on her feet safely, and {{afterwards}} had courage in this respect.|$|R
60|$|Jenny Wren {{came right}} {{up in front}} of Sammy Jay and hopped up and down. She was so mad that with every word she <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> funny little tail so that Sammy Jay almost had to laugh.|$|E
60|$|Lenore {{screamed and}} tore frantically at {{the handle of}} the door. Nash struck her, <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> back into the seat. She {{struggled}} until the car shot full speed ahead. Then it meant death for her to leap out.|$|E
6000|$|Liza {{put on the}} air of a conquering hero, and sauntered on, enchanted at the uproar. She {{stuck out}} her elbows and <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> head on one side, and said to herself as she passed through the bellowing crowd: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Jerking</b> <b>her</b> roughly to {{her feet}} they forced her toward a window but she refused to walk, {{throwing}} herself instead upon the floor. They were very angry and would have resorted to cruelties to compel her obedience but dared not, since the wrath of Lu-don might fall heavily upon whoever mutilated his fair prize.|$|R
60|$|At {{the next}} halt Hooja the Sly One {{managed to find}} enough slack chain to permit him to worm himself back quite close to Dian. We were all standing, and as he edged near the girl {{she turned her back}} upon him in such a truly earthly {{feminine}} manner that I could scarce repress a smile; but it was a short-lived smile for on the instant the Sly One's hand fell upon the girl's bare arm, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> roughly toward him.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of May 22, 1879, Sallie Robinson, a 28-year-old black woman, bought two {{first-class}} tickets at Grand Junction, Tennessee, for a train trip to Lynchburg, Virginia. Shortly after midnight she and her nephew, Joseph Robinson, described as {{a young black man}} [...] "of light complexion, light hair and light blue eyes," [...] boarded the train and started into the parlor car. The conductor held Robinson back ("bruising <b>her</b> arm and <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> roughly around," [...] she alleged) and pushed her into the smoking car.|$|R
6000|$|The men had all {{got up and}} {{approached}} slowly, staring with dull surprise. Madame Levaille <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> daughter away from the door, swung her round upon a seat close to the wall. Then she turned fiercely to the men-- ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Pollacke <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> head, {{either in}} the affirmative or in the negative, and looked inquiringly at Mrs Monnerie, who merely drooped her eyes a little closer towards me and smiled, {{almost as if she}} and I were in a little plot together.|$|E
60|$|The man {{had seen}} a constable in uniform fifty yards ahead, where a lane ran into the road, and would have said more but that Hinchcliffe <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> up that lane with a wrench that nearly capsized us as the constable came running heavily.|$|E
60|$|With a <b>jerk</b> of <b>her</b> {{tail off}} flew Jenny Wren, and Peter {{hurried back to}} tell Johnny Chuck all he had found out about Hummer the Hummingbird.|$|R
500|$|Beyoncé {{additionally}} {{performed the}} song on many televised appearances. The first televised {{performance of the}} song was on New Year's Eve at Nikki Beach, St. Barth. Other televised performances included Rove, 2003's Party in the Park, and Top of the Pops. Reviewing concert performances of the song, Mimi ValdésVibe called Beyoncé possessed, stating: [...] "Tossing <b>her</b> head around, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> body, twirling the microphone stand, she's a new-millennium version of Tina Turner. As human and humble as she is off stage, watching her perform is a quick reminder of why she's a star. She's magnetic." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another time, {{discovering}} the little vessel to [...] "gripe" [...] hard in steering, {{as if some}} one under water were <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> backward, we instituted a diligent examination, {{to see what was}} the matter. When lo; what should we find but a rope, cunningly attached to one of the chain-plates under the starboard main-channel. It towed heavily in the water. Upon dragging it up--much as you would the cord of a ponderous bucket far down in a well--a stout wooden box was discovered at the end; which opened, disclosed sundry knives, hatchets, and ax-heads.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is what I like," [...] said Mrs. Flushing. She <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> {{head at the}} Villa. [...] "A {{little house}} in a garden. I had one once in Ireland. One could lie in bed in the mornin' and pick roses outside the window with one's toes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hobden's up!' Dan {{pointed to}} {{the open door of}} the Forge cottage. 'What d'you suppose he has for breakfast?' 'One of them. He says they eat good all times of the year,' Una <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> head at some stately {{pheasants}} going down to the brook for a drink.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sally Sly DID lay an egg in Redeye's nest, {{and now it}} has hatched and I don't know {{whatever}} is to become of Redeye's own children. It's perfectly scandalous! That's what it is, perfectly scandalous!" [...] cried Jenny, and hopped about and <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> tail and worked herself into a small brown fury.|$|E
60|$|Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, {{with another}} {{fit of the}} <b>jerks</b> upon <b>her,</b> and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the silence}} was broken by a sharp, {{metallic}} clang. She screamed, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> eyes back to the table. The plate had fallen down. Hans sighed as though awakening from sleep. The clang of the plate had aroused them to life in a new world. The cabin epitomized the new world in which they must thenceforth live and move. The old cabin was gone forever. The horizon of life was totally new and unfamiliar. The unexpected had swept its wizardry over the face of things, changing the perspective, juggling values, and shuffling the real and the unreal into perplexing confusion.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the girl}} lavishing her kisses upon the newcomer, {{a much younger}} man than he whom Smith-Oldwick had dispatched. Presently the girl {{disengaged}} herself from the embrace of her lover as though struck by a sudden memory. Her brows puckered as in labored thought {{and then with a}} startled expression, she threw a glance backward toward the hidden niche where the Englishman stood, after which she whispered rapidly to <b>her</b> companion, occasionally <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> head {{in the direction of the}} niche and on several occasions making a move with one hand and forefinger, which Smith-Oldwick could not mistake as other than an attempt to describe his pistol and its use.|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> {{tail and}} {{nodded her head}} vigorously. [...] "I suppose so," [...] said she. [...] "He doesn't have to make as long a journey as we do, so he gets here sooner. Did you ever in your life see such a {{difference}} as there is between Little Friend and his cousin, Bully? Everybody loves Little Friend." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet all {{the time}} she wanted, and stormily knew she wanted, to be fleeing to the boy Milt, her mate; to run away with him, hand in hand, {{discovering}} all the colored world, laughing at life, not afraid of losing dignity. In fear of Jeff's very kindliness and honor, she <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> hand free. Then she tried to smile like a clever fencer.|$|E
6000|$|The only {{result of}} his {{shouting}} was a tightening of the pressure of her arms. With a tremendous effort he tried to bring his right foot up to his left, and succeeded partly. He heard distinctly the rub of her body {{on the ground as}} he <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> along. He tried to disengage himself by drawing up his foot. He stamped. He heard a voice saying sharply-- ...|$|E
60|$|Lan-O saw {{the woman}} from Helium half turn, and with a quick {{movement}} <b>jerk</b> <b>her</b> right hand from where it had lain upon her breast. She saw the hand shoot from beneath the arm of E-Med and rise behind his shoulder and she saw in the hand a long, slim blade. The lips of the warrior were drawing closer {{to those of the}} woman, but they never touched them, for suddenly the man straightened, stiffly, a shriek upon his lips, and then he crumpled like an empty fur and lay, a shrunken heap, upon the floor. Tara of Helium stooped and wiped her blade upon his harness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Light, I think," [...] said Betty, <b>jerking</b> <b>her</b> {{back from}} the window--"the light of hell fire, and plenty of it, for that would be self-murder, nothing else, and besides, what would one look like on that road? Cousin, don't be a fool. If you are right, it isn't you who ought {{to go out of}} that window; and if you are wrong, then you would only make a bad {{business}} worse. Time enough to die when one must, say I--which, perhaps, will be soon enough. Meanwhile, if I were you, I would try to speak to Master Peter first, if only to let him know what I thought of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's he like to-night?" [...] she asked, with a <b>jerk</b> of <b>her</b> {{head in the}} {{direction}} of the next room. She placed her bag carefully upon the sofa, and examined the new shawl as she did so.|$|R
