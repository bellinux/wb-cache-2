5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|M {{is another}} {{character}} {{who is more}} fully realised {{than in the previous}} novels, {{and for the first time}} in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|E
5|$|Most of Final Fantasy IV {{takes place}} on Earth, {{also known as the}} Blue Planet, which {{consists}} of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> visited in the game.|$|E
50|$|The show is {{considered}} to be a lost television series since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> to <b>be</b> found anywhere because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> picked up by Boomerang and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> released in any home media.|$|R

5|$|Mr. Mackey, {{the school}} counselor, is giving {{a drug and}} alcohol {{prevention}} lecture to the class, emphasizing that smoking, drinking, marijuana, and LSD are bad. He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Lojban {{is meant}} to be as {{culturally}} neutral as possible, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> crucial or fundamental to claim that some particular orthography of some particular languages (e.g. the Latin alphabet) should be the dominant mode.|$|E

25|$|Altars in the Alexandrian (Coptic) {{tradition}} {{must have}} a square face upon which to offer the sacrifice. As the standard Coptic liturgy requires the priest to encircle the altar, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> attached to any wall. Most Coptic altars are located under a baldachin.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{social work}} has been {{historically}} defined by these institutionalized and deinstitutionalized periods, informal community design programs have always existed. In fact, informal community-based programs predate human service applications of this approach. In 1990, Bernice Harper illustrated {{this point in the}} book Social Work Practice with Black Families: A Culturally Specific Perspective in regards to African American communities, by writing that: Blacks have always cared for the sick at home, yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> labeled 'home care.' Blacks have been dying at home and receiving care in the process, yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> called 'hospice care.' Blacks have relieved each other from the caring and curing processes, yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> seen as 'respite care.' Blacks have cared for each other in their homes, in their neighborhoods, and throughout their communities, yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> referred to as 'volunteerism.' ...|$|R

25|$|The language-specific {{characteristics}} {{are closely related}} to the sound laws of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close or even identical to the most recent form common to the contributing words. This sometimes corresponds with that of Vulgar Latin. At other times, it is much more recent or even contemporary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> older than the classical period.|$|E
25|$|US9 enters New York {{as part of}} an expressway, soon {{becoming}} a surface street and major urban and suburban artery.

25|$|Traditionally, {{the names}} are given at a child's baptism. Non-Christian, but traditional, Slavic names are usually accepted, but the priest may {{encourage}} parents to pick at least one Christian name. In the past, two Christian names were given to a child so {{that he or she}} had two patron saints instead of just one. At confirmation, people usually adopt yet another (second or third) Christian name, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> used outside church documents.|$|E
