500|$|The ship {{spent most}} of April and May 1913 {{undergoing}} repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, {{to act as a}} supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the <b>hold</b> <b>space</b> in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. [...] "Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Research {{to improve}} {{dredging}} contract management, economics (cost optimization), and contaminated sediments management (document dredging and placement locations) {{is currently being}} conducted by the Innovative Technologies (IT) Focus Area of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Dredging Operations and Environmental Research (DOER) Program. A common element in these research efforts {{is the ability to}} measure dredge production with the Silent Inspector (SI). This technical note (TN) describes currently used hopper and bin production measurement methods and discusses their respective capabilities and limitations. In this TN, the term hopper is defined as the <b>holding</b> <b>space</b> for dredged material in a hopper dredge, and the term bin identifies the <b>holding</b> <b>space</b> of a barge or scow. Subsequent DOER technical notes will refer back to this document as a basis for defining system requirements in the development of improved hopper and bin measurement technologies. BACKGROUND: The DOER Innovative Technologies Focus Area is currently conducting research to develop and demonstrate robust hopper and bin instrumentation and data analysis techniques to quantify dredged material for assessing dredge performance. Corps dredging operations are in transition to automated monitoring of contract dredge operation (Rosati 1998...|$|R
