40|$|An {{introduction}} to the nomenclature and concept of “Romanowsky stains” {{is followed by a}} brief account of the dyes involved and especially the crucial role of azure B and of the impurity of most commercial <b>dye</b> <b>lots.</b> Technical features of standardized and traditional Romanowsky stains are outlined, e. g., number and ratio of the acidic and basic dyes used, solvent effects, staining times, and fixation effects. The peculiar advantages of Romanowsky staining are noted, namely, the polychromasia achieved in a technically simple manner with the potential for stain intensification of “the color purple. ” Accounts are provided of a variety of physicochemically relevant topics, namely, acidic and basic dyeing, peculiarities of acidic and basic dye mixtures, consequences of differential staining rates of different cell and tissue components and of different dyes, the chemical significance of “the color purple,” the substrate selectivity for purple color formation and its intensification in situ due to a template effect, effects of resin embedding and prior fixation. Based on these physicochemical phenomena, mechanisms for the various Romanowsky staining applications are outlined including for blood, marrow and cytological smears; G-bands of chromosomes; microorganisms and other single-cell entities; and paraffin and resin tissue sections. The common factors involved in these specific mechanisms are pulled together to generate a “universal” generic mechanism for these stains. Certain generic problems of Romanowsky stains are discussed including the instability of solutions of acidic dye–basic dye mixtures, the inherent heterogeneity of polychrome methylene blue, and the resulting problems of standardization. Finally, a rational trouble-shooting scheme is appended...|$|R
40|$|During dyeing, salts {{are placed}} in a dyebath to aid the {{fixation}} of various dyes on to the fabric while bases are added to raise the pH from around neutral to pH 11. Afterwards, the used dyebath solution, called dyebath spent liquor, is discharged with almost all the salts and bases added as well as unfixed <b>dyes.</b> Consequently, a <b>lot</b> of raw materials are lost in the waste stream ending up in the environment as pollutants. In this study, possibilities of reusing water and salts of dyebathes were investigated, using a nanofiltration membrane. When the salt concentration in the spent liquor was increased from 10 to 80 g/L, the salt rejection by membrane was found to decrease initially; however, the salt rejection increased over the time, which was not expected. The aggregation of dye was also studied and found to decrease in the concentrate when the salt concentration was increased. This {{may be due to}} the aggregation of salt in the concentrate, which explains the increase in salt rejection. This information is useful for the textile industry in evaluating the treated water quality for the purpose of reuse. <br /...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{there were}} a few minor changes, on the main the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) raised for service {{following}} the outbreak of the Second World War was of a similar pattern to that worn by the 1st AIF. [...] The woollen service dress of the previous war was re-issued, although trousers replaced breeches and cloth anklets were adopted instead of puttees. For summer or warm climates khaki drill-cotton clothing was issued. Unit colour patches were once again used, with 2nd AIF units distinguished by a grey border. Over-time the pre-war uniforms of the militia were replaced with khaki service dress and in 1942 regimental badges were universally replaced by the Rising Sun, with UCPs being the main distinction between troops of the militia and AIF. Some minor changes to the appearance of the service dress jack occurred mid-war, while cloth anklets were also later by webbing gaiters. Meanwhile, {{during the course of the}} war uniform colour was changed to jungle green following the transfer of the bulk of Australian forces from the Middle East to the Pacific to fight against the Japanese in 1942. Troops hastily sent to New Guinea in the early stages of the campaign had to <b>dye</b> a <b>lot</b> of their existing khaki clothing green, although this tended to run in the heavy tropical rain. Steel helmets were unpopular with the soldiers in the jungle climate, while some items of American equipment were adopted, such as long canvas gaiters. Eventually a range of equipment suitable for jungle conditions was specifically developed in order to meet the requirements of providing both suitable camouflage, as well protection against the mosquitos, fungal growth / mould, and mud prevalent in the tropical environment. This included studded boots, canvas gaiters, and cloth berets, in addition to other items of personal equipment. The establishment of a number of women's services by the Army during the war resulted in the development of a number of distinct uniforms, although these were mostly similar in colour and style to the uniform of the male services, including the wearing of trousers when in the field. Despite this the Australian Army Nursing Service opted to retain the grey serge that had been worn by nurses since before the previous war.|$|R
30|$|Besides, we {{have found}} that the β-mannanase {{produced}} by HDYM- 04 we used show remarkably high activity and found to be capable of decolorizing and degrading different structures of synthetic <b>dyes.</b> Though <b>lots</b> of papers reported the degradation and decolourisation of synthetic dyes by other enzymes, some studies demonstrating that laccases from Leptomitus lacteus could made different dyes decolorization (Svobodová et al. 2008). Such as, B.cereus could decolorize 85  % of an azo dye for 120  h of incubation (Kanagaraj et al. 2012) and a novel laccase from B.subtilis WD 23 could decolorize 50 - 90  % of congo red and methyl orange, which suggested the potential application of spore laccase in dyestuff treatment (Wang et al. 2010 a, b). Unfortunately, the majority of dyes are chemically stable and still resistant to microbiological attack. The differences in the decoloriaztion efficiencies may be attributed to the various chemical structures of different dyes. The most employed dyes belong to the azo and triaromatic class which accounts for the 80  % of all textile dye produced. The best decolorization over was obtained with reactive conge red methyl orange and titan yellow. β-mannanase may be modify azo dye structures by destroying their chromophoric assemblies, phenoxyl radicals are generated in the reaction course (Muralikrishna et al. 1995). Compared with the β-mannanase produced by HDYM- 04, these enzyme decolorization efficiency were relatively low. The β-mannanases are oxidase that cataluze oxidation reactions and hydrolysis reactions in many phenolic and organic substrates coupling with reduction reactions that transfer molecular oxygen to water (Murugesan et al. 2007). Triaromatic methane dyes represent an especially recalcitrant class of compounds. The present study confirms the ability of methyl orange and aniline blue purified β-mannanase to decolorize amaranth, chromotrope 2 R, amaranth and eosin with decolorization efficiency of more than 90  % in short time. This could be due to the presense of electron donating methy and methoxy groups on the triaromatic methane dyes. The results obtained in this study were in agreement with results reported previrously for Pleurotusostreatus laccase (Kumar et al. 2012) and P.variabile laccase (Forootanfar et al. 2011). They also demonstrated that different decolorization rates were attributed to the specific catalytic properties of the individual enzymes and to the structure of dyes. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a bacterial β-mannanase from HDYM- 04 able to degrade different dyes. Furthermore, the decolorization of dyes by β-mannanase produced by HDYM- 04 is simple and cheap. So, the broad substrates specificity of enzyme rendered its great potentials in industrial applications, such as degradation of dyes from acidic textile effluents and the purified β-mannanase produced by HDYM- 04 could be successfully employed for the treatment of dyes bearing industrial wastewater as it had prominent capacity to degrade other different dyes. Some studies found that, the degradation of azo dyes could result in the production of compounds of increased toxicity. However, most studies failed to evaluate the toxicity of either the dyes and/or the reaction products (Gottlieb et al. 2003). So, to further investigate its effect on the toxicity of dye decolorization, the toxicity experiment will be carry out.|$|R
40|$|The {{terahertz}} (THz) waves had {{not been}} obtained except by a huge system, such as a free electron laser, until an invention of a photo-mixing technique at Bell laboratory in 1984 [1]. The first method using the Auston switch could generate up to 1 THz [2]. After then, {{as a result of}} some efforts for extending the frequency limit, a combination of antennas for the generation and the detection reached several THz [3, 4]. This technique has developed, so far, with taking a form of filling up the so-called THz gap. At the same time, a lot of researches have been trying to increase the output power as well [5 - 7]. In the 1990 s, a big advantage in the frequency band was brought by non-linear optical methods [8 - 11]. The technique led to drastically expand the frequency region and recently to realize a measurement up to 41 THz [12]. On the other hand, some efforts have yielded new generation and detection methods from other approaches, a CW-THz as well as the pulse generation [13 - 19]. Especially, a THz luminescence and a laser, originated in a research on the Bloch oscillator, are recently generated from a quantum cascade structure, even at an only low temperature of 60 K [20 - 22]. This research attracts a lot of attention, because it would be a breakthrough for the THz technique to become widespread into industrial area as well as research, in a point of low costs and easier operations. It is naturally thought that a technology of short pulse lasers has helped the THz field to be developed. As a background of an appearance of a stable Ti:sapphire laser and a high power chirped pulse amplification (CPA) laser, instead of a <b>dye</b> laser, a <b>lot</b> of concentration on the techniques of a pulse compression and amplification have been done. [23] Viewed from an application side, the THz technique has come into the limelight as a promising measurement method. A discovery of absorption peaks of a protein and a DNA in the THz region is promoting to put the technique into practice in the field of medicine and pharmaceutical science from several years ago [24 - 27]. It is also known that some absorption of light polar-molecules exist in the region, therefore, some ideas of gas and water content monitoring in the chemical and the food industries are proposed [28 - 32]. Furthermore, a lot of reports, such as measurements of carrier distribution in semiconductors, refractive index of a thin film and an object shape as radar, indicate that this technique would have a wide range of application [33 - 37]. I believe that it is worth challenging to apply it into the steel-making industry, due to its unique advantages. The THz wavelength of 30 - 300 ¼m can cope with both independence of a surface roughness of steel products and a detection with a sub-millimeter precision, for a remote surface inspection. There is also a possibility that it can measure thickness or dielectric constants of relatively high conductive materials, because of a high permeability against non-polar dielectric materials, short pulse detection and with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 103 - 5. Furthermore, {{there is a possibility that}} it could be applicable to a measurement at high temperature, for less influence by a thermal radiation, compared with the visible and infrared light. These ideas have motivated me to start this THz work...|$|R

50|$|The <b>dye</b> <b>lot</b> {{number is}} {{important}} information for hobbyist knitters and crocheters, because {{the use of}} yarn from different dye lots can spoil the appearance of handmade textiles. These shade variations may be subtle enough to be undetectable on a store shelf, but actual differences in shade becomes apparent during knitting or crocheting or after washing. Unmatched dye lots are a significant problem to knitters and crocheters because the problem manifests after days or weeks of labor, by which time the supplier's stock of the original <b>dye</b> <b>lot</b> may have been depleted.|$|E

50|$|A <b>dye</b> <b>lot</b> is {{a record}} taken during the dyeing of yarn to {{identify}} yarn that received its coloration in the same vat at the same time. Yarn manufacturers assign each lot a unique identification number and stamp it on the label before shipping. Slight differences in temperature, dyeing time, and other factors can result in different shades of the same color between different dye lots of otherwise identical production. Although the component elements of a <b>dye</b> <b>lot</b> number are of interest only for internal business recordkeeping, retail yarn consumers {{have an interest in}} ensuring that they purchase a given color of yarn from identical dye lots.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{solution}} to the <b>dye</b> <b>lot</b> dilemma is to purchase sufficient skeins from the identical lot before beginning a project. Published craft designs provide estimated material quantities for this purpose. If the crafter neglects to check dye lots or a design underestimates the yarn requirement, or if a store lacks sufficient quantities of a single lot, then one compromise solution is to construct the item so that a contrasting color separates yarns from different lots. Other workarounds are to change stitch patterns for the odd lot, to use the odd lot for a border or other separate and contrasting element, or to conceal the juncture between two dye lots with a surface embellishment.|$|E

The colours given in the thread count are specified as in heraldry, although tartan patterns are not heraldic.

Theresearch program integrates the design, manufacturing and marketing {{functions of the}} textile product pipeline. Over the past two years, faculty and students from the departments of textile engineering, chemistry, and science, textile and apparel management, mechanical and aerospace engineering and industrial engineering have focused on three interdisciplinary projects to achieve the goal. One of the three projects focused on wet processing optimization and control. Improvement of the batch dyeing process through real-time data acquisition and control is the major goal of the project. Data acquisition in batch dyeing typically involves gathering information {{on the status of}} time, temperature, pressure and speed variables. Current state-of-the-art commercial dyeing produces shade variations which may require that each <b>dye</b> <b>lot</b> be handled separately. To control shade variation so that downstream mixing of lots is possible, additional variables-pH, conductivity and dye absorbance-must be sensed and controlled. A system that senses variables in real-time has been developed. The system includes a minicomputer to manage and graphically display the real-time data, a sampling system and four sensors. Absorbances of the dyes in the bath are measured by a microcomputercontrolled fiber optics spectrophotometer. The system has proven useful in both the study of the dyeing process and in the rapid determination of dye compatibility. Use of real-time data to control the dyeing process is anticipated...|$|E
