5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} <b>Fasciculus</b> Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

25|$|Conduction aphasia {{is caused}} by damage to the arcuate <b>fasciculus.</b> The arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> is a white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Patients with {{conduction}} aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. Patients with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors. The awareness of errors and the milder nature of conduction aphasia compared to other types contributes to a positive outcome. Additionally, a case study completed on a 54-year-old man with a large infarct in the arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> indicated that severe conduction aphasia can be successfully treated. Despite his global deficits, he made a full recovery after 30 months.|$|E
25|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} {{is caused by}} lesions in the {{inferior}} left temporal lobe of the brain located near Wernicke's area, and is usually due to minor hemorrhage or contusion in the temporal lobe, or infarcts of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). One function of the arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> is the connection between Wernicke’s and Broca’s area. In TSA Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas are spared, meaning that lesions do not occur in these regions of the brain. However, since the arcuate <b>fasciculus,</b> Wernicke's area, and Broca's area are secluded {{from the rest of}} the brain in TSA, patients still have intact repetition (as information from the arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> is relayed to Broca’s area), but cannot attach meaning to words, either spoken or heard.|$|E
25|$|Projections {{to areas}} caudal to the {{hypothalamus}} {{go through the}} medial forebrain bundle, the mammillotegmental tract and the dorsal longitudinal <b>fasciculus.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bilateral {{increases}} and unusual right-left asymmetry {{has been found}} in the planum temporale when comparing people who stutter and people who do not stutter. These studies have also found that there are anatomical differences in the Rolandic operculum and arcuate <b>fasciculus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Such {{children}} show marked {{differences in}} their brains, consistent with research upon experiment animals, compared to children from normally stimulating environments. They have reduced brain activity in the orbital prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, temporal cortex, and brain stem. They also showed less developed white matter connections between different areas in their cerebral cortices, particularly the uncinate <b>fasciculus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lesions (or {{the absence}} of) in {{associations}} between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> {{in the right}} hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal gyrus was {{the origin of the}} disorder.|$|E
25|$|Variations {{occur in}} the {{extension}} over the face and over the clavicle and shoulder; it may be absent or interdigitate with the muscle of the opposite side {{in front of the}} neck; attachment to clavicle, mastoid process or occipital bone occurs. A more or less independent <b>fasciculus,</b> the occipitalis minor, may extend from the fascia over the trapezius to fascia over the insertion of the sternocleidomastoideus.|$|E
25|$|Adults who stutter have {{anatomical}} {{differences in}} gyri within the perisylvian frontotemporal areas. A {{large amount of}} white matter {{is found in the}} right hemisphere of the brain, including the region of the superior temporal gyrus. This was discovered using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). On the other hand, lesser amounts of white matter are found in the left inferior arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> connecting the temporal and frontal areas in stuttering adults.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with {{conduction}} aphasia have {{deficits in}} {{the connections between}} the speech-comprehension and speech-production areas. This might be caused by damage to the arcuate <b>fasciculus,</b> the structure that transmits information between Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Similar symptoms, however, can be present after damage to the insula or to the auditory cortex. Auditory comprehension is near normal, and oral expression is fluent with occasional paraphasic errors. Paraphasic errors include phonemic/literal or semantic/verbal. Repetition ability is poor.|$|E
25|$|Entrepreneurial {{opportunities}} {{were common}} for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, {{and the production}} of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones. Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley. King James IV of Scotland, Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, and Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel all contracted alchemists. John's son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia and Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book <b>Fasciculus</b> Chemicus.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothetical}} cortical {{location of}} neural maps within the ACT model {{is shown in}} Fig. 6. The hypothetical locations of primary motor and primary sensory maps are given in magenta, the hypothetical locations of motor plan state map and sensory state maps (within sensory-phonetic processing module, comparable to the error maps in DIVA) are given in orange, and the hypothetical locations for the mirrored phonetic map is given in red. Double arrows indicate neuronal mappings. Neural mappings connect neural maps, which are not far apart from each other (see above). The two mirrored locations of the phonetic map are connected via a neural pathway (see above), leading to a (simple) one-to-one mirroring of the current activation pattern for both realizations of the phonetic map. This neural pathway between the two locations of the phonetic map {{is assumed to be}} a part of the <b>fasciculus</b> arcuatus (AF, see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).|$|E
500|$|The Liber physiognomiae {{was often}} bundled with other, topically-similar texts. For instance, some copies of Scot's book were {{combined}} with a work by pseudo-Albertus Magnus entitled De secretis mulierum (Concerning the Secrets of Women), which, according to the Dictionary of National Biography, suggests {{the opinion of the}} time was that Scot [...] "dealt with forbidden subjects, or at least subjects better left to medical science." [...] Extracts from the Liber physiognomiae also appear in many early printed versions of Johannes de Ketham's medical treatise <b>Fasciculus</b> Medicinae (although {{this is not the case}} for all early copies). Finally, in 1515 a compendium titled Phisionomia Aristotellis, cum commanto Micaelis Scoti was published, which featured the Liber physiognomiae of Scot, alongside physiognomical works by Aristotle and Bartolomeo della Rocca.|$|E

2500|$|Neurons {{that carry}} {{information}} about touch, vibration, and proprioception sensations {{from the lower}} body enter the spinal cord below spinal level T6, where they synapse in the dorsal horn to form reflex circuits, but also send axon branches through the gracile fascicle to the brainstem. Similarly, information from the upper body enters the spinal cord at level T6 and above, and ascend toward the brainstem in the Cuneate <b>fasciculus.</b> [...] Together the gracile and cuneate form the dorsal column in the spine.|$|E
2500|$|He made lasting, even if {{not entirely}} accurate, {{contributions}} to the fields of anatomy and physiology. Anathomia quickly became a classic text and, after his death, Mondino {{was regarded as a}} [...] "divine master" [...] {{to such an extent that}} anything differing from the descriptions in his book was regarded as anomalous or even monstrous. For three centuries, the statutes of many medical schools required lecturers on anatomy to use Anathomia as their textbook. Jacopo Berengario da Carpi, a 16th-century professor of anatomy at Bologna, wrote an extensive commentary on Mondino's work, and the text of Anathomia was incorporated into Ketham's 1493 text <b>Fasciculus</b> medicinae.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Wernicke {{identified}} a pathway between the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (a cerebral cortex region {{sometimes called the}} Wernicke's area) as a centre of the sound [...] "images" [...] of speech and its syllables that connected through the arcuate <b>fasciculus</b> with part of the inferior frontal gyrus (sometimes called the Broca's area) responsible for their articulation. [...] This pathway is now broadly {{identified a}}s the dorsal speech pathway, {{one of the two}} pathways (together with the ventral pathway) that process speech. The posterior superior temporal gyrus is specialized for the transient representation of the phonetic sequences used for vocal repetition. Part of the auditory cortex also can represent aspects of speech such as its consonantal features.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amygdala}} and frontal {{areas have}} been suggested as particularly important. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity between the white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (such as the uncinate <b>fasciculus).</b> The evidence suggested {{that the degree of}} abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors. Furthermore, changes in the amygdala have been associated with [...] "callous-unemotional" [...] traits in children. However, the amygdala has also been associated with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas, which may be due to methodological issues.|$|E
2500|$|In 725 Bede wrote The Reckoning of Time (De Temporum Ratione), using {{something}} similar to the anno Domini era (BC/AD dating system) created by the monk Dionysius Exiguus in 525, continuing to use it throughout Historia Ecclesiastica (731), becoming very influential in causing that era to be adopted thereafter in Western Europe. Specifically, he used anno ab incarnatione Domini (in the year from the incarnation of the Lord) or anno incarnationis dominicae (in {{the year of the}} incarnation of the Lord). He never abbreviated the term like the modern AD. Bede counted anno Domini from Christ's birth, not from Christ's conception. Within this work, he was also the first writer to use a term similar to the English before Christ. In book I chapter 2 he used ante incarnationis dominicae tempus (before the time of the incarnation of the Lord). However, the latter was not very influential—only this isolated use was repeated by other writers {{during the rest of the}} Middle Ages. The first extensive use of [...] "BC" [...] (hundreds of times) occurred in <b>Fasciculus</b> Temporum by Werner Rolevinck in 1474, alongside years of the world (anno mundi).|$|E
2500|$|Conduction aphasia {{affects a}} subject's ability to {{reproduce}} speech (typically by repetition), {{though it has}} no influence on the subject's ability to comprehend spoken language. This shows that conduction aphasia must reflect not an impairment of the ventral pathway but instead of the dorsal pathway. Hickok and Poeppel found that conduction aphasia can {{be the result of}} damage, particularly lesions, to the Spt (Sylvian parietal temporal). This is shown by the Spt's involvement in acquiring new vocabulary, for while experiments have shown that most conduction aphasiacs can repeat high-frequency, simple words, their ability to repeat low-frequency, complex words is impaired. The Spt is responsible for connecting the motor and auditory systems by making auditory code accessible to the motor cortex. It appears that the motor cortex recreates high-frequency, simple words (like cup) in order to more quickly and efficiently access them, while low-frequency, complex words (like Sylvian parietal temporal) require more active, online regulation by the Spt. This explains why conduction aphasiacs have particular difficulty with low-frequency words which requires a more hands-on process for speech production. [...] "Functionally, conduction aphasia has been characterized as a deficit in the ability to encode phonological information for production," [...] namely because of a disruption in the motor-auditory interface. Conduction aphasia has been more specifically related to damage of the arcuate <b>fasciculus,</b> which is vital for both speech and language comprehension, as the arcuate fasiculus makes up the connection between Broca and Wernicke's areas.|$|E
2500|$|Starting from cercopithecidae, the {{two sources}} from the basal ganglia system medial pallidum and nigra have distinct, {{spatially}} separate, thalamic territories. The pallidal territory arrives in evolution as a lateral {{addition to the}} nigal VA, forming a new nucleus individualized by another name : the nucleus ventralis oralis, VO. On the contrary {{there is no more}} VM (which receices convergent afferences in rodents and carnivora). VO receives its pallidal afferent axons from the medial pallidum. The trajectory of pallidal afferent axons is complex. Axons form first the ansa lenticularis and the <b>fasciculus</b> lenticularis which place the axons on the medial border of the pallidum. From there, the axons cross the internal capsule as the comb system. Axons arrives at the lateral border of the subthalamic nucleus. They pass over it as the H2 field of Forel (1877) then turn down at H and suddenly go up in H1 in direction to the inferior border of the thalamus. The distribution of pallidal axons within the territory is wide with terminal [...] "bunches" [...] (Arrechi-Bouchhioua et al. 1996,1997, Parent and Parent, 2004 [...] ). This offers few chance for a fine somatotopic organization. The territory is stained for calbindin. The mediator of the pallido-thalamic connection is the inhibitor GABA. The thalamocortical neurons send their axons to the supplementary motor area (SMA), preSMA, the premotordorsal and medial {{and to a lesser extent}} to the motor cortex.|$|E
60|$|The 'Antiquity of Man' {{came out}} in February 1863, some {{three years after the}} 'Origin of Species.' For some time {{speculation}} had been active over the strange hatchets which Boucher de Perthes had recently unearthed among the Abbeville drift--shapeless masses of chipped flint rudely fashioned into the form of an axe, which we now call palæolithic implements, and know to be the handicraft of preglacial men. But until Lyell's authoritative work appeared the unscientific public could not tell exactly what to think of these curious and almost unhuman-looking objects. Lyell at once set all doubts at rest; the magic of his name silenced the derisive whispers of the dissidents. Already, in the previous year, the first <b>fasciculus</b> of Colenso's famous work on the Pentateuch had dealt a serious blow from the ecclesiastical and critical side at the authenticity and historical truth of the Mosaic cosmogony. Lyell now from the scientific side completely demolished its literal truth, as ordinarily interpreted, by throwing back the primitive origin of our race into a dim past of immeasurable antiquity. In so doing he was clearing the way for Charles Darwin's second great work, 'The Descent of Man;' and by incorporating in his book Huxley's remarks on the Neanderthal skull, and much similar evolutionary matter, he advertised the new creed in the animal origin of our race with all the acquired weight of his immense and justly-deserved European reputation. As a matter of taste, Lyell did not relish the application of evolutionism to his own species. But, with that perfect loyalty to fact which he shared so completely with Charles Darwin, as soon as he found the evidence overwhelming, he gave in. By that grudging concession he immensely strengthened the position of the new creed. 'I plead guilty,' he writes to Sir Joseph Hooker, 'to going farther in my reasoning towards transmutation than in my sentiments and imagination, and perhaps for that very reason I shall lead more people on to Darwin and you, than one who, being born later, like Lubbock, has comparatively little to abandon of old and long-cherished ideas, which constituted the charm to me of the theoretical part of the science in my earlier days.' And to Darwin himself he writes regretfully. 'The descent of man from the brutes takes away much of the charm from my speculations on the past relating to such matters.' This very reluctance itself told powerfully in favour of Charles Darwin's novel theories: there is no evidence more valuable to a cause than that which it extorts by moral force, in spite of himself, from the faltering lips of an unwilling witness.|$|E
60|$|Reflecting the Sun with a Mirror.--To {{attract the}} notice of a {{division}} of your party, five or even ten miles off, glitter a bit of looking-glass in the sun, throwing its flash towards where {{you expect them to}} be. It is quite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will catch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt to know what it is. It is now a common signal in the North American prairies. (Sullivan.) It should be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than one that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer; therefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim. I find the steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly against the forehead, and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the same distant object. The glare of the sun that is reflected from each point of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose vertical angle is constant, and equal to that subtended by the sun. Hence when a flash is sent to a distant place, the size of the mirror is of no appreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the flash is visible. That area is the section of the <b>fasciculus</b> of cones that proceed from each point of the mirror, which, in the case we have supposed, differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single point. Hence, if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon a very near object, it will appear to him of the shape and size of the mirror; but as he retreats from the object, the edges of the flash become rounded, and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle, of precisely the same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun: it will, in short, look just like a very faint sun. The signaller has to cause this disc of light to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract. I will proceed to show how he can do so; but in the mean time it will be evident that a pretty careful aim is requisite, or he will fail in his object. The steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate, neither more nor less, as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was sufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at: for the object of the aim is of the same apparent size, but a movement of a mirror causes the ray reflected from it to move through a double angle.|$|E
