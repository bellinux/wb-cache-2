5|$|In 927, a {{peace treaty}} had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium, ending many years of warfare and {{establishing}} forty years of peace. Both states prospered during this interlude, but {{the balance of power}} gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines, who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed a web of alliances surrounding Bulgaria. By 965/966, the warlike new Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to renew the annual tribute {{that was part of the}} peace agreement and declared war on Bulgaria. Preoccupied with his campaigns in the East, Nikephoros resolved to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> by proxy and invited the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav to invade Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{war with}} Wales broke out again; {{this time it}} would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with paid forces, but the nobility insisted {{on the use of the}} feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 129495, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} with the {{establishment}} of a Constitution (which explicitly forbade the provinces from maintaining military forces of their own) and a national government recognized by all the provinces that the Army became a single force, absorbing the older provincial militias. The Army went on to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of the Triple Alliance in the 1860s together with Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay. After that war, the Army became involved in Argentina's Conquista del Desierto ("Conquest of the Desert"): the campaign to occupy Patagonia and root out the natives, who conducted looting raids throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Act, giving police access to {{military}} intelligence, infrastructure, and weaponry {{in the fight}} against drugs. Reagan subsequently declared drugs to be a threat to U.S. national security. In 1988 the Reagan administration encouraged Congress to create the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Program. The program modified existing federal aid structures to local police, making it easier to transfer money and equipment to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on Drugs. Police forces also received increased assistance from the DEA. The money resulted in the creation of many narcotics task forces, and SWAT teams became an important part of these forces.|$|E

The squadron worked in tandem with Coast Guard and other federal law enforcement agencies to combine and coordinate operations of counter-narcotics forces.

The squadron spends approximately four to five months per year forward deployed to bases near illegal drug traffic lanes.|$|E
25|$|For the 111 {{years that}} the Militia Act of 1792 {{remained}} in effect, it defined {{the position of the}} militia in relation to the federal government. The War of 1812 tested this uniquely American defense establishment. To <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of 1812, the republic formed a small regular military and trained it to protect the frontiers and coastlines. Although it performed poorly in the offensive against Canada, the small force of regulars backed by a well-armed militia, accomplished its defensive mission well. Generals like Andrew Jackson proved that, just as they had in the Revolution, regulars and militia could be effective when employed as a team.|$|E
25|$|Born on 18 January 1766 at Longueville, France, Musnier {{entered the}} {{military}} school of Paris on 22 August 1780 as a gentleman cadet.

Musnier became an aide-de-camp to General Alexis Magallon de Lamorlière of the Army of the Rhine in July 1792. The following year, he was assigned to the Army of the West to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in the Vendée. On 27 March 1795 he was named chef de bataillon (major) of the 1st Battalion of the 106th Line Infantry Demi Brigade.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-French War was a {{military}} conflict fought between France and Great Britain with their respective allies between 1778 and 1783. In 1778, France signed a treaty of friendship with the United States. Great Britain was then at war with France, and in 1779 it was also at war with Spain. As a consequence, Great Britain was forced to divert resources used to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in North America to theatres in Europe, India and the West Indies, and to rely on {{what turned out to}} be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations. From 1778 to 1783, with or without their allies, France and Britain fought over dominance in the English Channel, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|The Hessian War resumed in September 1645, with {{a failed}} Kassel attack on Giessen. Kassel claimed that its troops were seeking winter quarters, however little doubt was left about Amalie Elisabeth's {{intentions}} after Kassel artillery shelled Marburg a month later. In 1646, Geyso returned to Hesse taking Marburg on 15 January, whose defenders {{had put a}} fierce resistance. Darmstadt then hired Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein as their new commander in chief, his counter offensive liberated all lands previously lost to Kassel apart from Marburg. In the meantime, both Kassel and Darmstadt's allies were too preoccupied with other issues, allowing the two to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in relative isolation. On 20 November, Geyso defeated Eberstein in the Battle of Frankenberg forcing Darmstadt into a truce.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan Forces General Headquarters had {{declined}} to provide a substantial naval contingent {{for the defense of}} East Pakistan, for two reasons. First, they had an inadequate number of ships to challenge the Indian navy on both fronts. Second, the PAF in the east was not deemed strong enough to protect the ships from Indian airpower (i.e. both the IAF and the Indian Navy air arm). The fate of Pakistani naval vessels in December was ample proof of the soundness of this decision, and the repercussions of neglecting East Pakistan defense infrastructure, which was the reason the PAF could only station 1 squadron of planes there. Pakistan Eastern Command had planned to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> without the Navy, and faced with a hopeless task against overwhelming odds, the Navy planned to remain in port when war broke out.|$|E

25|$|Confederates did {{not need}} to invade and hold enemy {{territory}} to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win. Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could only continue to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the Copperheads and their peace platform.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, The Group, {{each with}} three or four flying squadrons, was the basic combat element of the Army Air Forces. This {{organization}} changed in 1947 when the new United States Air Forces. adopted the wing-base plan. Each combat group then active received a controlling parent wing of the same number and nomenclature. The new wing also controlled three additional groups with the same number to operate the airbase, maintain the aircraft and provide medical care at the base. When combat forces began to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in Korea, the USAF units did so in various organizational forms. In some cases, the combat arm of the wing plus a portion of the wing's supporting personnel deployed to the Korean theater, leaving the rest of the wing to operate the home base, to which the group returned after its tour of combat ended.|$|E
25|$|While Willson {{was in the}} region, {{settlers}} {{began to}} look at establishing a government in the unorganized area. These led to the holding of several meetings in 1841 and again in 1843. During the May 2, 1843, Champoeg Meeting, Willson served as secretary, and {{voted in favor of}} creating a provisional government, which passed with a 52-50 vote. He was also elected as the first treasurer of the new Provisional Government of Oregon at the election that adopted the Organic Laws of Oregon and served from July 5, 1843 to May 14, 1844. In 1845, he was elected {{as the president of the}} bench in the Champoeg District. During the Cayuse War of 1847 to 1850 he was appointed to the commission that worked to raise the money to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> that was born out of the Whitman Massacre. Willson participated in the Oregon Exchange Company in 1849 that minted the Beaver Coins prior to the arrival of U.S. authority in the region.

25|$|Numerically, Persian {{forces had}} a {{considerable}} advantage during the war: {{a ratio of}} 5 to 1 over their Russian adversaries. However, the Persian forces were technologically backwards and poorly trained - a problem that the Persian government did not recognize until a far later juncture. Despite these crippling disadvantages, fighting continued in northern Persia, Azerbaijan and in regions of Georgia. Persia was so enraged at Russia as to declare a jihad upon them, demanding that its people unite to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against them. Persia was actually losing the war and asked for military and financial aid from France’s Napoleon (with which they had a France-Persian Alliance), who promised to deliver French support regarding Iran's ambitions to regain its recently lost territory of Georgia, yet France's relations with Russia were more important to them after the two countries signed the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, resulting in France leaving Persia unassisted. The Battle of Aslanduz on 31 October 1812 was the {{turning point in the}} war, which led to the complete destruction of the Persian army, thus leaving Fath Ali Shah with no other option but to sign the Treaty of Gulistan.|$|E
25|$|After Iran's {{failure to}} capture Basra during the Second Battle of Basra (Operation Karbala-5), Iran's {{military}} entered {{a period of}} self-reflection, and possible decline. Iranian morale was decreasing, {{and many of their}} experienced infantry from the Revolutionary Guards (Pasdaran) became casualties. Consequently, the Iranians increasingly relied on their regular army to <b>fight</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> In addition to the army being conscription based, the Iranians became increasingly war-weary. The front in the south of Iraq had become a stalemate. Iran was unable to penetrate the massive Iraqi defenses. Meanwhile, Iraq for the time being remained unable to drive the Iranians back, but they had begun to rearm {{with the help of the}} United States and the west, and were practicing maneuvers in preparation for the upcoming operations against the Iranians. By 1988, Iraq grossly outnumbered Iran in men and military hardware. Nevertheless, Iranian commanders remained skilled and adept. They focused on tactics that would negate superior Iraqi firepower. Nevertheless, they were unable to capture cities in southern Iraq due to a combination of poor logistics, shortages of armor, and Iraqi firepower. Iran's leadership also announced that they would arm and support opposition groups inside of Iraq. One of those opponents was the Peshmerga, the Kurdistan resistance force, which primarily launch limited offensives of their own.|$|E
