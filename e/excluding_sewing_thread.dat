30|$|Prediction of <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the significant factors in thread procurement. In apparel industry both garment manufacturers and thread suppliers predict thread consumption per unit length of stitch for their thread purchasing and logistics processes. Inaccurate thread consumption predictions lead to inaccurate costing and reduction of warehouse utilization for both garment manufacturers and <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> manufacturers. Purchase of excess or shortage quantities of thread cones make suppliers to endure those excess or shortage thread quantities, so that both parties undergo inflexible logistic process (Jaouadi et al. 2006). In this context <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> manufacturers and garment manufacturers are looking for accurate method predicting <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> consumption for given stitch lengths so that wastages could be minimized.|$|R

Fabric formability was higher for the heavyweight fabrics and lower for the lightweight fabrics. The overall bending rigidity was the lowest for the denim with the lowest formability and weight.

Thread consumption formulae were derived by investigating the effect of thread tension for two basic types of stitches namely lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. Accuracy of those optimized formulae was measured through an error analysis by comparing theoretical and actual thread consumption values. The error percentage values of the newly developed formulae were compared with the other methodologies developed by other researchers and <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> manufacturers for calculating <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> consumption.|$|R

40|$|At present {{number of}} <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> of {{different}} varieties {{are available in}} the market and there is no single polyester based substrate. which satisfies the criteria of the complete <b>sewing</b> <b>thread.</b> The thread must be able to withstand ail of the stresses and strains applied to the <b>thread</b> during <b>sewing</b> and wear of the garment. Therefore selecting a proper thread to suite a particular fabric is very complex as it is important to minimize the sewing defects and improve the performance. // The core spun and spun polyester <b>sewing</b> <b>threads</b> are having different thread structures. which contribute to significant changes In their properties. Largely because of its low price and acceptable level of sewing performance, 100 % spun polyester <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> is the dominant product in sales volume.

When the thread is cotton wrapped it has very good needle heat resistance and polyester wrapped thread is excellent in physical properties and sewing performance. The fibrous surface of the core spun thread reduces shirr, look and contributes to superior frictional characteristics. // In to days competitive market cost is an important factor.

40|$|Sewn net-shape preform based {{composite}} {{manufacturing technology}} is widely accepted {{in combination with}} liquid composite molding technologies for the manufacturing of fiber reinforced polymer composites. The development of threedimensional dry fibrous reinforcement structures containing desired fiber orientation and volume fraction before the resin infusion {{is based on the}} predefined preforming processes. Various preform manufacturing aspects influence the overall composite manufacturing processes. Sewing technology used for the preform manufacturing has number of challenges to overcome which includes consistency in preform quality, composite quality, and composite mechanical properties. Experimental studies are undertaken to investigate the influence of various sewing parameters on the preform manufacturing processes, preform quality, and the fiber reinforced polymer composite quality and properties. <b>Sewing</b> <b>thread,</b> <b>sewing</b> machine parameters, shortcomings of sewing process, and remedies are explained according to their importance during preforming and liquid composite molding. The stitches and fiber free zone in the form of ellipse that are generated in the thickness direction were investigated by evaluating the laminate micrographs. Correlation between ellipse formation phenomenon, <b>sewing</b> <b>thread,</b> and <b>sewing</b> machine parameters is established. A statistical tool, analysis of variance, was used to emphasize the major preform processing factors influencing the preform imperfections. For assessing the preform quality, the observations of <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> requirements for preform and structural sewing were well documented during the experimental studies and explained according to their significance in the composite processing. Furthermore, selection criteria for <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> according to end application are discussed in detail. Investigations on polyester <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> as a high speed preform manufacturing element are also performed. Applicability of polyester <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> for the preform sewing and challenges to be overcome for its extensive utilization in the composite components are explained. Apart from this, influence of physical structure of <b>sewing</b> <b>thread</b> on the laminate quality and properties are explained and relationship between them is discussed in brief. Furthermore, challenges caused due to applied spin-finishes and sizing and remedies for the same are discussed. <b>Sewing</b> <b>threads</b> made of high performance fibers that are available in the market, e. g., carbon, glass, and Zylon are studied for effect of thread material on through-thethickness laminate properties. Threads made up of carbon or glass fibers are very rigid and produces number of defects, which is a major cause of concern. Optimized sewing procedure has been implemented to minimize the in-plane and through-thethickness imperfections and to improve mechanical properties and surface characteristics of composite laminate. Preform sewing process and final ready to impregnate preforms were analyzed for quality appearance. The sewing defects and their influence on composite structure are monitored. Preform compressibility before and after the sewing operations are intensively studied and correlation with sewing parameters is developed. Influence of sewing process parameters on the warpage and change in preform area weight are also explained in detail. Results of analytical experiments can help to improve further exploitation of sewn preforms for composite manufacturing and overall preform and laminate quality...|$|R
