40|$|The {{enhancement}} of bait {{for the control}} of <b>grass-cutting</b> ants was investigated using two species of <b>grass-cutting</b> ant, Atta bisphaerica (Forel) and Atta capiguara (Goncalves) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Bait was applied in loose piles to obtain a direct relationship between ant attraction and bait harvest. Enhancement with alarm pheromone compounds significantly increased the attractiveness and harvest of bait under certain conditions. A {{large proportion of the}} ants attracted to the enhanced bait were minor workers. These ants rarely transport bait because of their small size, and so {{it may be possible to}} increase the effect of bait enhancement by using smaller bait granules. Foragers of A. capiguara were less inclined to transport citrus-pulp bait than were those of Atta laevigata (Fr. Smith), a species that also harvests dicotyledonous plants. This emphasizes the importance of developing a bait matrix that is more acceptable to <b>grass-cutting</b> species. Nevertheless, the results suggest that alarm pheromone compounds have significant potential to improve the efficacy of baits for the control of <b>grass-cutting</b> ants...|$|E
40|$|Background: Foraging {{workers of}} <b>grass-cutting</b> ants (Atta vollenweideri) {{regularly}} carry grass fragments larger than their Fragment length {{has been shown}} to influence the ants' running speed and thereby the colony's food intake rate. We investigated whether and how <b>grass-cutting</b> ants maintain stability when carrying fragments of two different lengths but identical mass. Principal Findings: Ants carried all fragments in an upright, backwards-tilted position, but held long fragments more vertically than short ones. All carrying ants used an alternating tripod gait, where mechanical stability was increased by overlapping stance phases of consecutive steps. The overlap was greatest for ants carrying long fragments, resulting in more legs contacting the ground simultaneously. For all ants, the projection of the total centre of mass (ant and fragment) was often outside the supporting tripod, i. e. the three feet that would be in stance for a non-overlapping tripod gait. Stability was only achieved through additional legs in ground contact. Tripod stability (quantified as the minimum distance of the centre of mass {{to the edge of the}} supporting tripod) was significantly smaller for ants with long fragments. Here, tripod stability was lowest at the beginning of each step, when the center of mass was near the posterior margin of the supporting tripod. By contrast, tripod stability was lowest at the end of each step for ants carrying short fragments. Consistently, ants with long fragments mainly fell backwards, whereas ants carrying short fragments mainly fell forwards or to the side. Assuming that transporting ants adjust neither the fragment angle nor the gait, they would be less stable and more likely to fall over. Conclusions: In <b>grass-cutting</b> ants, the need to maintain static stability when carrying long grass fragments has led to multiple kinematic adjustments at the expense of a reduced material transport rate...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposures}} to hand-transmitted vibrations from <b>grass-cutting</b> machines {{have been associated}} with increasing occurrences of signs of occupational diseases related to the hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). However, there are no specific processes available that cover the objective and subjective health cause-effects of the hand arm vibration risk factors during onsite operations. Most of the existing vibration control measures have not extensively integrated administration and engineering techniques to be utilized as health prediction screening models. Therefore, the main objectives of this study are to integrate the engineering and administration control approach for reducing HAVS among hand-held <b>grass-cutting</b> workers and to determine the significant correlation of the objective and subjective measurement variables of the Hand Arm Vibration Exposure Risk Assessment (HAVERA) on hand arm vibration symptoms and disorders. The study was conducted in two stages: evaluation of the HAVERA variables (Stage 1) and development of the health prediction cause-effect model of the HAVERA process using multiple linear regressions and feed forward neural network programming (Stage 2). For the onsite measurement, the daily vibration value depicted an exceeded exposure action value of 2. 5 m/s 2 for both hands; and experiences of any finger colour change were claimed by 80 % of the 204 subjects. This shows that the HAVERA process provided a good indication of HAVS which are reported as vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal disorders. In the right and left hand prediction model development, the results of the neural network model demonstrated a higher reliability performance as compared to the linear model for hand grip strength and hand numerical scoring assessment.

40|$|Leaf-cutting ants are {{important}} economic pests of the Neotropics, {{and the most}} common method of control {{involves the use of}} insecticidal baits. Baits that are currently available exhibit low attractiveness to <b>grass-cutting</b> species, thus {{there is a need to}} develop improved baits. The potential for using alarm pheromone compounds to enhance the attractiveness and subsequent harvest of baits was examined for two economically important species of <b>grass-cutting</b> ant, Atta bisphaerica (Forel) and Atta capiguara (Goncalves). Compounds of the alarm pheromone were applied to rubber septa that were then sealed inside plastic sachets together with citrus pulp-based bait. The best candidate compound for bait enhancement was 4 -methyl- 3 -heptanone. This compound significantly increased the attractiveness of bait sachets to both species. It also appeared to improve the discovery of nearby unenhanced sachets. However, 4 -methyl- 3 -heptanone resulted in only a slight and non-significant improvement in bait harvest. Enhanced and unenhanced bait sachets were applied at a number of positions to obtain an improvement in harvest, but without success. The possible reasons for the lack of an enhancement of harvest and the potential for using alarm pheromone compounds as leaf-cutting ant bait enhancers are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Using {{of toxic}} baits made of {{dehydrated}} citric pulp to control <b>grass-cutting</b> ants {{can lead to}} unsatisfactory results because of the low attractiveness of the substrate to worker ants. This work aimed to identify attractive substances, with potential for incorporation in a matrix of granulated baits for <b>grass-cutting</b> ants, among several kinds of sugars and substances used in artificial sweeteners. Experiments were carried out in mature nests of Atta capiguara (Hym. : Formicidae) set in pasture. Studied substances were sucrose, fructose, soluble starch, raffinose, maltose, lactose, sorbose, cellobiose, arabinose, xylose, glucose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, melezitose, saccharine and cyclamate (at 5. 0 % w/v). Later, on maltose, xylose, sucrose, fructose and glucose solutions were included at 5. 0 %, 7. 5 %, 10. 0 % and 20. 0 % w/v, respectively. Cellulose rectangles were used as vehicle and number of rectangles carried into the colonies was evaluated. Carrying rates were very low with maximum means of 9. 6 % for lactose and 6. 0 % for arabinose and cyclamate, at the 5. 0 % concentration. No differences (P > 0. 05) were observed relatively to the control (distilled water). No effects were detected for solution, concentration and for the interaction of these factors.

40|$|Background: Acquisition of {{information}} about food sources is essential for animals that forage collectively like social insects. Foragers deliver two commodities to the nest, food and information, and they may favor the delivery of one at the expenses of the other. We predict that information needs should be particularly high {{at the beginning of}} foraging: the decision to return faster to the nest will motivate a <b>grass-cutting</b> ant worker to reduce its loading time, and so to leave the source with a partial load. Principal Findings: Field results showed that at the initial foraging phase, most <b>grass-cutting</b> ant foragers (Acromyrmex heyeri) returned unladen to the nest, and experienced head-on encounters with outgoing workers. Ant encounters were not simply collisions in a probabilistic sense: outgoing workers contacted in average 70 % of the returning foragers at the initial foraging phase, and only 20 % at the established phase. At the initial foraging phase, workers cut fragments that were shorter, narrower, lighter and tenderer than those harvested at the established one. Foragers walked at the initial phase significantly faster than expected for the observed temperatures, yet not at the established phase. Moreover, when controlling for differences in the fragment-size carried, workers still walked faster at the initial phase. Despite the higher speed, their individual transport rate of vegetable tissue was lower than that of similarly-sized workers foraging later at the same patch. Conclusions/Significance: At the initial foraging phase, workers compromised their individual transport rates of material in order to return faster to the colony. We suggest that the observed flexible cutting rules and the selection of partial loads at the beginning of foraging are driven by the need {{of information}} transfer, crucial for the establishment and maintenance of a foraging process to monopolize a discovered resource...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{issues of}} conflict between Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) and its human neighbors have been addressed in this research: firewood shortage, shortage of grazing land and fodder, and crop/livestock depredation by park wildlife. In addition, previous estimates of annual <b>grass-cutting</b> in the park have been revised. Out of 16 village units, or 144 wards, {{in the study area}} that are within 5 km of the RCNP (total study area about 598 sq. km) in the Chitwan District of Nepal, 14 wards were randomly selected for detailed investigation. The investigation included interviews of 140 randomly selected heads of households, livestock census, year-round monitoring of crop/livestock depredation by park wildlife, and monitoring of 11 patches of grassland/savanna (totalling 365 ha) in the nearby park-land for recording trespass grazing. In addition, 1818 randomly selected grass-cutters were interviewed to estimate the harvests of resources in the park. Major resources left remaining after the harvest were field-assessed. Information concerning the subsistence systems and ethnicity of local people has been described. Intensity of livestock grazing in the bordering grasslands/savannas inside the park was found to be 4. 1 heads/ha. The livestock biomass was estimated to have been growing by 2. 36 percent, and a change in the mix of livestock ownership, including an increase in buffalo and goats, was noticed. Rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) was found to be the principal crop raiding animal, followed by wild boar (Sus scrofa), and chital (Axis axis). Tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (Panthera pardus) were threats on livestock. Smaller carnivores also caused substantial damages to domestic birds. Annual losses of crop and livestock sustained by the average household have been estimated. No strong correlation between distance to park and crop or livestock damage could be found.
