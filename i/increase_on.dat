In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.|$|E
5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation.

5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a traffic census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures. The traffic volume gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded. The traffic volume decrease is somewhat more pronounced at interchanges serving Slavonski Brod and the A5 motorway (Sredanci). The seasonal traffic volume variation ranges from a 28% <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as measured on the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season traffic volume <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT ratio analysis does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT data available for the bypass.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, Nadine began {{weakening}} {{once again}} and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200UTC, on October1. Northwesterly winds began to <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> October3, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward. A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed, before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500UTC. Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October3, Nadine became devoid of any deep convection. At 0000UTC on October4, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while located about 195miles (315km) southwest of the central Azores. The low rapidly moved northeastward, degenerated into a trough of low pressure, and was absorbed by a cold front later that day.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase I, would not contribute funds for Phase II.|$|E

5|$|Convection {{began to}} <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> July 6, {{supported}} {{on the basis that}} many showers were observed {{to the north of the}} depression. An anticyclone—a large mass of air rotating clockwise—intensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds to the north of the center of the depression. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7, and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg). Cindy began to curve westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and drifted due west early on July 8 as a result of a maturing surface high to its north. Steady intensification continued throughout the day, and the storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.|$|E
