500|$|Following the game, Burrows accused Auger {{of having}} a {{personal}} vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month that had made him look bad. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury. Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: [...] "you made me look bad [...] so I'm {{going to get you}} back tonight." [...] He went on to tell reporters that Auger [...] "should stay out {{for the rest of the}} year making calls like that ... We <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> two points because of his officiating tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad, credited for programming on the album, assisted in its production. He cited the group's fusion of hip hop production and live instrumentation for Sons of Soul as {{the inspiration for}} his subsequent work {{as a member of}} A Tribe Called Quest and The Ummah. Muhammad discussed his experience recording Sons of Soul in a 1998 interview, saying that [...] "I'd just hooked this beat up, and [...] picked up their instruments and started playing. Raphael was singing, {{and as soon as he}} touched the bass, it <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> me away." [...] Raphael Wiggins explained how they valued instrumentation when recording the album, saying that [...] "We want everyone to have something to relate to; a drummer will get into the live drums and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|Buchanan {{described}} the song {{during an interview}} that was published on the group's official website, saying: [...] "Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song – it’s the most sexy song we’ve ever done. It came about when Orson had {{an idea for a}} song. [...] They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." [...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> us away – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{recording}} sessions, band members Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood conducted the session musicians, though Yorke lacks formal musical training. Yorke stated in an interview, [...] "the running joke {{when we were}} in the studios was, 'Just <b>blow.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>blow,</b> <b>just</b> <b>blow,</b> <b>just</b> blow'", referring to the chaotic wind section sound.

500|$|In 2003, McCartney persuaded Starr and Ono (as Lennon's widow) {{to release}} Let It Be... Naked, {{touted as the}} band's version of Let It Be remixed by {{independent}} producers. McCartney claimed that his long-standing dissatisfaction with the released version of [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] (and the entire Let It Be album) was in part {{the impetus for the}} new version. The new album included a later take of [...] "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. [...] With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version. This take is also the one seen in the film Let It Be and on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Starr said of the Let It Be... Naked version: [...] "There's nothing wrong with Phil's strings , this is just a different attitude to listening. But it's been 30-odd years since I've heard it without all that and it <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> me away." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Luton's cup win was the club's {{first major}} piece of {{silverware}} in its history. A jubilant Harford {{described it as}} [...] "the greatest win in my time at Luton," [...] having thought his team had lost the match when Smith scored. He commended his goalkeeper, saying: [...] "Considering all the circumstances, I think Dibble {{had to be the}} man of the match, and as for the young boy, [...] Black was sensational. He has so much talent." [...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee how long was left and he <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> the whistle." [...] Luton held a civic ceremony two days after the final, where the trophy was presented in front of the club's supporters. It was there the stem of the trophy had become noticeably damaged; Luton the following morning returned it to the competition's sponsors for repairs.|$|E

500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sugababes {{collaborated with}} members from Orson to produce two brand new tracks for the album, [...] "Easy" [...] and [...] "Good to Be Gone". Buchanan spoke upon the collaboration, saying: [...] "When we {{started working with}} the Orson guys the sound <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> us away – it's so fresh, but has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career. It's perfect for this album." [...] Range, however, {{explained}} how she initially {{did not like the}} song in comparison to [...] "Good to Be Gone". After leaving the studio, she called {{the other members of the}} group and spoke of her dissatisfaction with [...] "Easy". Range realised she enjoyed the song after listening to it the following day, and later named it one of her favourite songs by the group. Despite being titled The Singles Collection, the album does not contain all of the group's previous singles; [...] "New Year", [...] "Soul Sound", [...] "Angels with Dirty Faces" [...] and [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] are omitted, although [...] "Run for Cover" [...] is included as a bonus track on the UK version. [...] "Red Dress" [...] was re-recorded to feature the vocals of Berrabah instead of Buena following the latter's departure from the group.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{described}} the album as [...] "their most underrated, {{and on this}} set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record". KNAC.coms Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a [...] "grandiosity and imposing presence" [...] which makes the record [...] "so magnificent". Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song [...] "Silent Scream" [...] for the first time: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>blew</b> me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." [...] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood [...] "was just speed", South of Heaven proved that the group could write [...] "slow material as well". Metal Forces reviewer gives [...] "the band credit for at least {{making an effort to}} try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating [...] "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while". He remarks, however, that [...] "if you're expecting to hear Reign in Blood Part Two, you'll be in for a major disappointment".|$|E
