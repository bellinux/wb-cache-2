40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} characteristics of non-mandated standing <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in all 501 school districts in Pennsylvania from the perspective of each group‘s administrator or leader. For the {{purpose of this}} study, <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in school districts mandated by federal and state laws were excluded. ^ Given this large participant population, online research instruments were used. A survey was initially emailed to all school districts superintendents. A follow up questionnaire was then sent to the contact person for the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> if the superintendent indicated utilization. An interview was then conducted with the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> contact persons for each school district. ^ The results of this study were organized into three main categories: reasons for creating <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> outcomes of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> and best practices of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> The data in each category were coded and three themes emerged in each category. The themes for <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> include creation for a specific goal, creation for a specific problem, or creation for a means of communication. The themes for outcomes of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> were attainment of a goal, resolution of a problem, and dissemination of information about the district into the community. Finally, the themes for best practices of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> included selecting suitable <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> members, setting guidelines for meetings, and promoting attendance at meetings. Participants offered advice to school districts contemplating starting an <b>advisory</b> <b>group,</b> as well as tips for success. Some of these tips were scheduling meetings at times convenient for most participants, opening the group to diverse members including those who have opposition to an issue, and establishing rules and procedures for how the group operates. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{perceptions of}} family health service authorities and medical audit <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> of <b>advisory</b> groups' involvement in clinical audit and wider quality issues; {{communication with the}} authorities; and manager satisfaction. DESIGN [...] National postal questionnaire survey in 1994. SETTING [...] All family health services authority districts in England and Wales. SUBJECTS [...] Chief executives or other responsible authority officers and <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> chairpersons in each district. MAIN MEASURES [...] Priorities of <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> and authority for audit; involvement of <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> in wider quality issues; communication of information to, and contacts with, the authority and its involvement in planning the future work of the advisory group; and authorities' satisfaction. RESULTS [...] Both groups' views about audit were similar and broadly consistent with current policy. <b>Advisory</b> <b>group</b> involvement in wider quality issues was extensive, {{and the majority of}} both groups thought this appropriate. Much of the information about their activities collected by <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> was not passed on to the authority. The most frequent contact between the two <b>groups</b> was the <b>advisory</b> <b>group's</b> annual report, but formal personal contact was the most valued. Most authority respondents thought their views had been recognised in the <b>advisory</b> <b>group's</b> planning of future work; only a small minority were not satisfied with their <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> Dissatisfied respondents received less information from their <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> had less contact with them, and thought they had less input into their plans. There was some evidence that <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in the "dissatisfied districts" were less involved in clinical audit and with their authorities in wider quality issues. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> are developing their activities in clinical audit and have expanded their scope of work. The quality and availability of information about progress with audit is a cause for concern to both groups...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group,</b> an initiative that aspires to foster quality engagement between schools and their Māori communities in order to improve Māori student achievement. Executive summary The success of the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>group</b> initiative across diverse communities and contexts is determined by a set of key components including a core group of committed whānau with diverse skills and experiences and, the total support of the school’s principal. These components, in particular, provide the necessary platform for the ‘Whānau Advisory Group’ to progress, guided by realistic aims and objectives thereby providing a strong basis for recruiting and encouraging other whānau and community members to participate. While whānau members of the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> are both directly and indirectly involved in strategic decision-making as whānau or through positions of governance on boards of trustees, there is little evidence of a correlation between the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> and Māori educational achievement. However, schools claim a positive connection between Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> and Māori achievement but based on anecdotal evidence. Nonetheless, an improvement in Māori student educational achievement was definitely seen to be influenced by the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group.</b> The report emphasises the positive contribution of key whānau with skills and experiences to attract other whānau to the initiative, based on their standing and mana within a school’s community. Without these core members the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> would not succeed according to the initiative’s wider aims. Consequently, Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> success factors, engagement strategies and narrative evidence of Māori student achievement in addition to the support of the Ministry of Education and local Iwi rūnanga are recognised as effective pathways for establishing and sustaining the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> initiative. Finally, while the report also documents areas of limitations and the various contexts in which the seven Case Study schools are located, the overall findings support the Whānau <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> initiative as a worthwhile intervention to address the goals of Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013 – 2017 and Māori educational achievement...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and Department of Transportation (DOT) and Department of Energy (DOE) guidance require officials to check for duplication prior to filing a charter {{to establish a new}} or renew an existing FACA <b>advisory</b> <b>group.</b> However, GAO found that DOT and DOEs processes for assessing duplication are often informal, and neither agency has specific steps identified for making such an assessment. Using an informal approach without specific steps makes it more likely that agency assessments for duplication will be inconsistent or incomplete. In addition, while basic information about the 15 DOT and 21 DOE fiscal year 2010 FACA <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> is publicly available in the FACA database, including designated points of contact and the objectives of the groups, no such information is readily available for non-FACA <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> This limits the agencies ability to fully assess the universe of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> for particular topic areas. DOT and DOE officials faced some challenges identifying and collecting information for the 19 DOT and 33 DOE non-FACA <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> GAO reviewed, relying on various sources and Internet searches to gather basic information, since neither agency maintains an inventory of its non-FACA <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> and their activities. In addition, <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> often address complex and highly technical issues that span across agencies. For example, one <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> GAO identified focused on experimental and theoretical research in nuclear physics. Agency officials familiar with these types of technical topic areas and other potential stakeholders covering these same topics are best positioned to assess the potential for unnecessary duplication and would be even better positioned to do so if the departments develop specific assessment steps and enhance the visibility of non-FACA <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives [...] To {{determine}} {{the role of}} medical audit <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in audit activities in general practice. Design [...] Postal questionnaire survey. Subjects [...] All 104 <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in England and Wales in 1994. Main measures [...] Monitoring audit: the methods used to classify audits, the methods used by the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> {{to collect data on}} audits from general practices, the proportion of practices undertaking audit. Directing and coordinating audits: topics and number of practices participating in multipractice audits. Results [...] The response rate was 86 - 5 %. In 1993 - 4, 54 % of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> used the Oxfordshire or Kirklees methods for classifying audits, or modifications of them. 99 % of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> collected data on audit activities at least once between 1991 - 2 and 1993 - 4. Visits, questionnaires, and other methods were used to collect information from all or samples of practices in each of the <b>advisory</b> <b>group's</b> areas. Some <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> used different methods in different years. In 1991 - 2, 57 % of all practices participated in some audit, in 1992 - 3, 78 %, and in 1993 - 4, 86 %. 428 multipractice audits were identified. The most popular topic was diabetes. Conclusions [...] <b>Advisory</b> <b>groups</b> have been active in monitoring audit in general practice. However, the methods used to classify and collect information about audits in general practices varied widely. The number of practices undertaking audit increased between 1991 - 2 and 1993 1. The large number of multipractice audits supports the view that the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> have directed and coordinated audit activities. This example of a national audit programme for general practice may be helpful in other countries in which the introduction of quality assurance is being considered...|$|R
