5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|Sentries did detect boats {{moving along}} the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> without Vergor being notified. When the boats, loaded with the first wave lof British troops, were {{challenge}}d, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.|$|E
5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, was that he saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having observed common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the flood {{and the creation of}} the world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> as people took it with them, leading to modern-day myths. He thought the original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E

5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong crusade to win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to an orchestral format.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> since the 17th century {{in terms of}} legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed,</b> and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many aspects}} of rugby union, the scrum has evolved since the sport's invention.

5|$|On May 30, 2017, La Máscara and Máximo made a {{surprise}} appearance, confronting {{members of the}} La Rebelión stable. The cousins were originally announced as being booked to wrestle against L.A. Park and Dr. Wagner Jr. in the main event of a Lucha Libre Boom! show, but it was later announced that the match <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to L.A. Park vs. Dr. Wagner Jr. as Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) did not want wrestlers under contract with AAA (Wagner) to work with La Máscara and Máximo at the moment. In September, Rush and Pierroth arrived in The Crash, reuniting with La Máscara and kick starting a rivalry between Los Ingobernables and La Rebelión.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors and}} Barry Cunningham {{also decided to}} retitle the book Tunnels, to reflect that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> by some limited editing. With the {{announcement}} of the publication date, and press coverage in the UK, the price of the original self-published books jumped dramatically, with one copy selling for £950. Tunnels was released in the UK as a softcover on 2 July 2007, and in the United States as a hardcover on 10 December 2007, and as a paperback on 1 February 2009. In Canada, the book was released as a paperback on 7 July 2007, as a hardcover on 1 January 2008, and a mass market paperback on 1 February 2009. In the United States, Tunnels had an initial printing of 100,000 copies. In February and March 2008 it appeared on The New York Times Children's Chapter Books Best Seller List.|$|E
5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E

5|$|At the 1963 World Championships in Stockholm, the Soviet Union won {{the gold}} medal, {{beginning}} a streak of nine consecutive World Championship golds. The 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria {{marked the first time}} that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovaks. The procedure <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth. However, the Olympics also counted as the World Championships, and under IIHF rules, Canada should have won a bronze. In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal. However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|Elliott entered Ormond College, the Presbyterian hall of {{residence}} at the University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law. Between 1883 and 1896, law students had been required to first obtain a bachelor of arts degree before going on to study law. This <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed,</b> but Elliott, who was under no financial pressure to complete his degree quickly, elected to follow the old route and complete an arts degree first. He also represented Ormond College in football and athletics, and joined the University Officers' Training Corps. In March 1900, the Imperial authorities asked the Australian colonial governments to raise a force of 2,500 Imperial Bushmen for service in the South African War. Elliott decided to interrupt his studies to serve, {{and was one of}} 4,000 applicants for the 626 positions allotted to Victoria. He was accepted for the Victorian Imperial Bushmen, and trained at Langwarrin, Victoria, before embarking for South Africa on 1 May 1900.|$|E

5|$|Some teams {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake ducts. Williams team changed their brake ducts at the front to improve airflow inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake ducts, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at the front wing endplate to improve airflow outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10. As in Suzuka, Toro Rosso ran an F-duct system in the Friday practice sessions.|$|E
5|$|This latter {{theory is}} not heraldically tenable as the {{quarters}} in an achievement {{after the first}} and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist {{on their own to}} represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the College really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building {{on the south side of}} the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.|$|E
