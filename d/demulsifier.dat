The population balance predicts the dynamic and spatial evolution of the dropsize distribution across the entire batch separator. The model was used to fit data for local fractions from experimental data in order to compare the model results with actual experimental results. The prediction of the dynamic and spatial evolution of the drop size distribution allows one to calculate the backflow of the continuous phase and drop growth rate (the first moment of the volume weighted coalescence birth function). These two calculated values allow one to make a semi-quantitative description of the individual sedimentation and binary coalescence rates, based on the types and concentration/composition of demulsifiers or mixtures of demulsifiers used for separation. The experiment consisted of an water in crude oil emulsion with added <b>demulsifier.</b> Five experiments were tested, with varying ratios of the two different demulsifiers, <b>Demulsifier</b> 1 and <b>Demulsifier</b> 2. The results for the different demulsifiers demonstrated that pure <b>Demulsifier</b> 2 provided the fastest separation of this water in oil emulsion, this was due to the large initial droplet size in this mix.

This {{formation of}} emulsion has been identified to be stabilised by natural surfactants consisted of carboxylic acids, phenols, asphaltenes, resins, and waxes. Several techniques {{have been used to}} destabilise the emulsion such as by using demulsifiers. However, so far, the selection of a <b>demulsifier</b> has been based on the trial and error method, which is very tedious. In order to develop the <b>demulsifier</b> selection method, a comprehensive knowledge of crude oil emulsion stability and how the <b>demulsifier</b> destabilises the crude oil emulsion is crucial, which needs to be studied. Therefore, this study is aimed to address this fundamental aspect by analysing the stability of six different crude oil samples, carrying out chemical demulsification study to develop a method for characterising and selecting the demulsifiers systematically, and determining the rate and mechanism of demulsification process. The stability study was carried out by analysing the water concentration and hold-up profiles, and the sedimentingcoalescing interface behaviour. It was found that there exists a correlation between the chemical properties of the crude oil such as resin-asphaltene ratio, asphaltene and solid contents, with emulsion formation and stability. A chemical demulsification experiment of crude oil emulsion was carried out using a wide range of demulsifiers used as a single demulsifiers. The <b>demulsifier</b> characteristics and <b>demulsifier</b> performance indicators were used as indicators for <b>demulsifier</b> selection. The results show that several indicators such as functional group, HLB number, <b>demulsifier</b> solubility, <b>demulsifier</b> effectiveness, partition coefficient, interfacial pressure, and interfacial activity have a significant correlation to the percentage of water and oil separations, which can be used to develop a method for screening the demulsifiers. By developing a mathematical model, both flocculation and coalescence rate constants, and the rate constant ratios (ano/K) can be predicted to determine the mechanism of emulsion breaking. It was found that higher (> 7) and lower (< 1) of the rate constant ratios demonstrate that the rate controlling step is determined by the coalescence and flocculation process respectively. While the rate constant ratios between 1 and 7 the rate controlling step is determined by both processes. The model validation by experimental data for various systems shows that the proposed model is applicable for both crude and synthetic oil emulsions. In order to obtain deeper understanding several recommendations such the effect of high pressure and temperature on emulsion formation and stability, the effect of composite demulsifiers on demulsification performance, and the thermodynamic modeling of chemical demulsification process are suggested for further studies. ...|$|E
