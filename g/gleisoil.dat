40|$|Due to mineral {{prospecting}} {{activity at}} Amazon Basin Southwest (Rondonia) a high amount of mercury (Hg), a chemical element extremely harmful to environment and mankind, was released at aquatic, atmospheric and terrestrial regional ecosystems. This fact {{is becoming a}} current research object, especially at the environmental matrix soil. The present study had the aim to analyze the spatial variability [Hg] at 17 soil profiles at Mutum Parana River Basin, Rondonia, Brazil. There were used four analysis methods: i) images processing and interpretation, ii) soil morphology description, iii) soil gradation analysis per total dispersion, iv) atomic absorption spectrometry to Hg. At the basin three pedologic classes are predominant: latosoil, argisoil and <b>gleisoil.</b> There were observed median concentrations of 106, 62 &# 61549;g. Kg- 1 Hg at argisoil profiles, while the <b>gleisoil</b> profiles presented 66, 10 &# 61549;g. Kg- 1 Hg. The higher Hg concentrations were registered at Mutum Parana river nascent area, distant from the contamination fount. However, at estuary area, where still exists gold prospecting activity, there were registered the lowest Hg levels at soil. Pages: 4129 - 413...|$|E
