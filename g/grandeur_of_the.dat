5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained {{the traditions of the}} waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Jarre {{was invited}} by the musical {{director}} of the Houston Grand Opera to perform a concert celebrating Texas's 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he was busy with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by the visual <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary of {{the foundation of the}} Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.|$|E
25|$|His {{music was}} much esteemed, {{especially}} in Italy, where it represented perhaps the popular aesthetic {{as opposed to}} the contrapuntal, but foreign <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composers from the Low Countries.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Louis XIV in 1715, <b>the</b> aristocrats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French court {{abandoned}} <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Versailles for <b>the</b> {{more intimate}} townhouses of Paris where, elegantly attired, they could play and flirt {{and put on}} scenes from the Italian commedia dell'arte.|$|R
50|$|Balsall Heath {{initially}} had {{a reasonably}} affluent population, which {{can still be}} seen in <b>the</b> dilapidated <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to Bristol line) led to further expansion, and <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small terraced houses.|$|R
5|$|The Abercromby baronets owned a {{significant}} amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited {{on the other side of}} the River Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of}} the old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E

50|$|Cassie McFarland {{works in}} <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> figurative {{painting}} and photography. There {{is a strong}} narrative tendency to her work, shaped by personal nostalgia and <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> and sweep <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American landscape.|$|R
50|$|According to {{historical}} records, {{there was once}} a castle in this city by <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Haft Hessar (Seven Walls) which had a thousand rooms and its <b>grandeur</b> equalled that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Babylon Tower.|$|R
5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and <b>Grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seas had {{to alter}} their courses due to the {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of compositional style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several important differences. The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle-period sonatas gives way to a more intimate writing that resembles a string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. The harmonic language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the compositional craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new monuments, {{the center}} of the city at the {{beginning}} of the 18th century was overcrowded, dark, unhealthy, and had little light, air, or drinking water. It was also dangerous, despite the addition of the first metal lanterns on the main streets and the enlargement of the police night watch to four hundred men.|$|E
50|$|Bérulle is {{generally}} regarded as being an initiator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French School <b>of</b> Spirituality, a powerful spiritual, missionary, and reform movement that animated the Church in France in the early seventeenth century. The movement was characterized by: a deep sense <b>of</b> God’s <b>grandeur</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church as <b>the</b> Body <b>of</b> Christ, a certain pessimistic Augustinian view of man that nonetheless stresses positive potential through God, and a strong apostolic and missionary commitment.|$|R
50|$|During Kamloops' {{evolution}} in the 19th century, the West End was <b>the</b> main site <b>of</b> residential settlement in the growing town. <b>The</b> name <b>of</b> Nicola Wagon Road in the neighbourhood bears witness {{to the fact that}} the West End was <b>the</b> first concentration <b>of</b> inhabitation in what would become one of British Columbia's most spread-out cities.The West End was home to many of Kamloops' most prominent early citizens, as demonstrated by <b>the</b> size and <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homes. While a number of more modern houses have encroached upon the neighbourhood's elegant atmosphere, wood-panelled and stucco homes remain the norm.|$|R
25|$|While <b>the</b> {{architecture}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus at Fu Tei is modelled on {{the original}} in Guangzhou, it has also incorporated novelties with black, white and grey schemes forming its unique colour spectrum. <b>The</b> <b>grandeur</b> and solemnity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus building suggest qualities of perseverance and determination.|$|R
25|$|Above the doorways are {{classical}} Ionic order columns that ostensibly {{hold up the}} frieze and pediment. Uncommon for Ionic order columns is {{the lack}} of fluting, which is usually used to draw the eye upward, increasing the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facade. The numerous projections and recessions on the façade attribute to the planar quality of the building, while also creating interesting shading and lighting patterns on the stone and within the building.|$|E
25|$|Sam and Joe Meyer, who had {{previously}} been successful in the grocery business, became determined to build a hotel to express the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing city. In 1927 they built the eleven-story (then considered a skyscraper) Lamar Hotel, {{on the corner of}} 5th Street and 21st Avenue. The hotel was named after Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II, a former U.S. Senator from Mississippi, cabinet member, and member of the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|During this period, rulers often {{embarked}} on ambitious attempts at redesigning their capital cities as a showpiece for the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Disasters were often a major catalyst for planned reconstruction. An {{exception to this}} was in London after the Great Fire of 1666 when, despite many radical rebuilding schemes from architects such as John Evelyn and Christopher Wren, no large-scale redesigning was achieved due to the complexities of rival ownership claims. However, improvements were made in hygiene and fire safety with wider streets, stone construction {{and access to the}} river.|$|E
2500|$|Within Temptation's {{brand of}} gothic metal {{combines}} [...] "the guitar-driven force of hard rock with <b>the</b> sweep and <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> symphonic music". <b>The</b> critic Chad Bowar of About.com describes their style as [...] "the optimum balance" [...] between [...] "the melody and hooks <b>of</b> mainstream rock, <b>the</b> depth {{and complexity of}} classical music and <b>the</b> dark edge <b>of</b> gothic metal". <b>The</b> commercial success <b>of</b> Within Temptation has since resulted in <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> {{a large number of}} other female-fronted gothic metal bands, particularly in the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Corrigan {{pinpoints}} restlessness as a quintessential American quality, one she perceives in Fitzgerald’s knowing {{depiction of}} New York City, the great mecca for dreamers with its promise of freedom, new identities, success, and “unsentimental sex.” She explains why she considers The Great Gatsby to be “America’s greatest novel about class” {{as well as}} <b>the</b> vanquishing <b>of</b> God and <b>the</b> worship <b>of</b> idols in <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> World War I, the fantasy that one can truly reinvent one’s self, <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> longing, and <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> illusion.|$|R
50|$|Chavchavadze’s {{contradictory}} career - {{his participation}} {{in the struggle against}} <b>the</b> Russian control <b>of</b> Georgia, on one hand, and the loyal service to the tsar, including <b>the</b> suppression <b>of</b> Georgian peasant revolts, on the other hand - found a noticeable reflection in his writings. The year 1832, when the Georgian plot collapsed, divides his work into two principal periods. Prior to that event, his poetry was mostly impregnated with laments for <b>the</b> former <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Georgia, <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> national independence and his personal grievances connected with it; his native country under the Russian empire seemed to him a prison, and he pictured its present state in extremely gloomy colors. <b>The</b> death <b>of</b> his beloved friend and son-in-law, Griboyedov, also contributed to <b>the</b> depressive character <b>of</b> his writings of that time.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, {{the current}} Pennsylvania Station was renovated by Amtrak, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and New Jersey Transit, {{to improve the}} {{appearance}} of the waiting and concession areas, sharpen the station information systems (audio and visual) and remove much of the grime. Recalling the erstwhile <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bygone Penn Station, an old four-sided clock from the original depot was installed at the 34th Street Long Island Rail Road entrance. The walkway from that entrance's escalator also has a mural depicting elements of the old Penn Station's architecture.|$|E
25|$|From 1838 to 1851, Thon was {{employed}} in {{construction of the}} Neo-Russian Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow. The grandiose palace, famed for opulent interiors of its 700 rooms and halls, was meant to symbolize the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian state. It was a daring design which incorporated parts of earlier structures that had been standing on the spot. The palace has served successively as an official residence for the Russian tsars, Soviet rulers, and the Presidents of the Russian Federation. At the same time, Thon rehabilitated the abandoned Izmaylovo Estate into an almshouse for the veterans of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the first European {{settlers}} arrived in the area, smallpox had already spread to the region, decimating Native American populations. The first European settler to homestead in the area was Hale Tharp, who famously built a home out of a hollowed-out fallen giant sequoia log in the Giant Forest next to Log Meadow. Tharp allowed his cattle to graze the meadow, {{but at the same}} time had a respect for the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest and led early battles against logging in the area. From time to time, Tharp received visits from John Muir, who would stay at Tharp's log cabin. Tharp's Log can still be visited today in its original location in the Giant Forest.|$|E
50|$|From {{different}} parts of world many envoys, merchants, travellers etc. visited Bijapur in its heyday <b>of</b> magnanimity and <b>grandeur,</b> and they left behind their valuable accounts of past grandiosities of Bijapur.In 1013 corresponding to (1604-1605) the Mughal Emperor Akbar, commissioner Mirza Asad Baig, one of grandees of his court to Bijapur for diplomatic dealings. He {{was a person who}} saw Agra and Delhi in their glorious days. He wrote his account called, “Haalat-e-Asad Baig or Wakiat-e-Asad Baig”. From his account we shall be able to form some idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position which Bijapur occupied among <b>the</b> wonder cities <b>of</b> India in <b>the</b> Medieval Ages. He cites in his impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city; <b>the</b> <b>grandeurs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adil Shahi court and its customs in the following striking words:Mirza Asad Baig left Bijapur on 24 January 1604. His graphic account of Bijapur tells us how this city was prosperous, rich and flourishing.Another traveller Manctelslo, who visited the Deccan in 1638 writes, Similarly, Jean Baptiste Tavernier, who visited India between 1631 and 1667, was a jeweller, probably he had been to Bijapur for selling some of his jewels. He has left for us an account, in which he describes Bijapur was a great city... in its large suburbs many goldsmiths and jewellers dwelt... the king's palace (Arkillah or citadel) was vast, but ill-built and the access to it was very dangerous as the ditch with which it was girt was full <b>of</b> crocodiles,. in <b>the</b> same way, the Dutch traveller, Baldeous, the English geographer, Ogilby and others praise <b>the</b> greatness <b>of</b> Bijapur.|$|R

50|$|I Really Hate My Job is <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> {{five women}} stuck {{working in a}} second-rate London {{restaurant}} with delusions <b>of</b> <b>grandeur.</b> <b>The</b> action takes place over a single evening. Customers come and go, unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real concerns <b>of</b> these women: a rat {{or two in the}} kitchen, bitter arguments about life and art, as well as a coup d'état in the kitchen, all overshadowed by <b>the</b> anticipation <b>of</b> a booking by a famous Hollywood film star.|$|R
25|$|The <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mansion and}} its handsomely {{landscaped}} grounds served {{to match the}} impressive scale of the estate, which at 1,700 acres was unusually large by Valley standards. The wide, spacious lawn, dotted with large tress, slopes gently towards a spring-fed brook that arises {{on the grounds of}} the estate less than a mile away and meanders gently towards Smith Creek, which also runs through the estate. Smith Creek was used to power the plantation's mill, which produced flour and other products that were transported up and down the Great Wagon Road. The estate remained in the Moore family until 1879, when Oscar Fitz Allen Moore, grandson of Reuben Moore, Jr., sold the estate to William C. & George H. Harrison.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Italy, {{prepared}} viae were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building viae was a military responsibility and thus came {{under the jurisdiction of}} a consul. The process had a military name, viam munire, as though the via were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called viae vicinales. The beauty and <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roads might tempt us to believe that any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} direct routes {{begin at}} either end of the Walna Scar Road, making for the summit from the top of the pass. Ascents can be made from Seathwaite Tarn (pathless) or to the north of Goat's Hawse, but these give no clue to the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crag on the eastern side of the ridge. For this the walker will leave the Walna Scar Road at The Cove, or climb to this point from Torver. From here Goat's Water is the next objective for a stunning view of Dow Crag. Two choices now present themselves- easy via Goat's Hause, or steep via the South Rake (see below). Many walkers will also reach the fell using the good paths from The Old Man of Coniston and Brim Fell.|$|E
25|$|Muybridge {{established}} his reputation in 1867, with photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yosemite Valley wilderness (some <b>of</b> which used <b>the</b> same scenes taken by his contemporary Carleton Watkins) and areas around San Francisco. Muybridge gained notice for his landscape photographs, which showed <b>the</b> <b>grandeur</b> and expansiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West; if human figures were portrayed, they were dwarfed by their surroundings, as in Chinese landscape paintings. He signed and published his {{work under the}} pseudonym Helios, which he also used as <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> his studio.|$|R

Evocative and timeless, these lyrical images capture the enduring spirit, <b>grandeur,</b> and beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land that lies at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu Kush.
