This {{construction is}} meant to produce smooth action without the friction commonly found in classic tremolo systems. With a gear-driven <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> adjuster, the BB1 can allow regulation of the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> without removing the instrument's rear cover plate.|$|R

50|$|To {{understand}} how an iso-elastic system works, {{we must first}} {{understand how}} <b>springs</b> work. The <b>tension</b> (elastic force) in a spring is proportional to its extension according to Hooke's law. This means that if a weight is hung on a spring it will oscillate with simple harmonic motion. This is because when the weight is above the balance point, the <b>spring's</b> <b>tension</b> is reduced so the weight falls due to gravity, and when the weight is below the balance point the <b>spring's</b> <b>tension</b> will pull it back upwards.|$|R

5000|$|The slider {{can also}} have a two-piece hinge {{assembly}} attaching the handle to the slider, with {{the base of the}} hinge under <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> and with protruding pins on the bottom that insert between the zipper teeth. To move the zipper, the handle is pulled outward against <b>spring</b> <b>tension,</b> lifting the pins out from between the teeth as the slider moves. When the handle is released the pins automatically engage between the zipper teeth again. They are called [...] "auto-lock sliders".|$|R

50|$|The Whip-a-way is a seven-section, tubular, folding whip antenna. A plastic-covered cable (or braided plastic cord) under <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> is {{threaded}} through the sections {{to keep them}} together when assembled for operation and prevent their separation or loss when disassembled. <b>Spring</b> <b>tension</b> is provided by a spiral spring in the base section. An antenna top cap installed {{on the tip of}} the antenna provides protection for personnel. The construction is the same as is used for sectional fishing poles. The base has a male 3/8-24 thread which is the same as is used on most ham radio and CB antennas.|$|R
40|$|Kinetochores are multi-protein {{machines}} that control chromosome movements by regulating {{the dynamics of}} attached microtubules. In human cells chromosome movements are orchestrated by the leading kinetochore tracking a shrinking microtubule whilst its sister tracks a growing microtubule. Directional switches occur when (both) kinetochore-attached microtubules fl ip between these two states, adaptive and coordinated switching then giving rise to the oscillations observed during metaphase. However the mechanisms (and rules) controlling directional switching are poorly understood. This work demonstrates that by tracking kinetochores with sub-pixel resolution in HeLa cells and fitting stochastic mathematical models that a sensor on the leading sister triggers switching when the tension across the centromeric spring connecting the sisters builds up sufficiently rapidly. Further it is shown that the trailing sisters polymerisation state is stabilised by high <b>spring</b> <b>tension.</b> These mechanisms pre-empt trail-first switching that would otherwise impose abnormal pulling forces between sister chromatids. As a consequence sister-switching is biased towards lead-first switching, switching of the trailing sister rapidly following as the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> falls, this removing the force dependent stabilisation of the trailing sisters K-fibre (kinetochore bound microtubules). This model explains how switching events are initiated and resolved, the centromeric <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> providing a means for inter-sister communication and cross regulation that results in coordinated oscillations within a context of low <b>spring</b> <b>tension.</b> This study demonstrates that high throughput analysis and modelling pipelines can provide novel mechanistic insight into mechanochemical systems...|$|R

25|$|In {{electromechanical}} regulators, {{voltage regulation}} is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire {{to make an}} electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, so does the current, releasing <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> or {{the weight of the}} core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.|$|R

50|$|Changing the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> {{can help}} reduce bumping. A few sources inside the {{industry}} offer stronger top springs for conventional pinned locks. Changing one or two top springs to a firmer spring changes the ricochet tuning of the top pins, {{making it hard to}} bump.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R

25|$|Planer {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it slides down the fishing line to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|R

25|$|Balbus and Hawley (1991) {{proposed}} a mechanism which involves magnetic fields {{to generate the}} angular momentum transport. A simple system displaying this mechanism is a gas disk {{in the presence of}} a weak axial magnetic field. Two radially neighboring fluid elements will behave as two mass points connected by a massless <b>spring,</b> the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> playing the role of the magnetic tension. In a Keplerian disk the inner fluid element would be orbiting more rapidly than the outer, causing the spring to stretch. The inner fluid element is then forced by the spring to slow down, reduce correspondingly its angular momentum causing it to move to a lower orbit. The outer fluid element being pulled forward will speed up, increasing its angular momentum and move to a larger radius orbit. The <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> will increase as the two fluid elements move further apart and the process runs away.|$|R
50|$|The Parker Fly has a vibrato {{system that}} allows the player to select from a fixed-bridge mode, a bend-down-only mode, and a free-float mode. The vibrato system uses a flat spring {{allowing}} the user to easily adjust the <b>tension.</b> The <b>spring's</b> natural <b>tension</b> is selected according to the gauge of strings used by the guitar player. The original Fly design incorporated a wheel {{on the face of}} the guitar to adjust the <b>spring</b> <b>tension,</b> while more recent models have moved the tension adjustment to inside the guitar. The tremolo bridge has been designed to stay in perfect tune, even with heavy use of the bar.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the common}} use of {{electronic}} clocks in automobiles, automobile clocks had mechanical movements, powered by an electric remontoire.
