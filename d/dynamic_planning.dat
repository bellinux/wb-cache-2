Although the static 8 -node plan allocates {{substantially}} more with surplus resources, it still causes three QoS violations during the experiment. The 9 -node static plan meets the QoS target all the time except the 19 th hour, and it costs 29.63 % more total resources than the <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan.</b> The 10 -node static plan is the only static plan that meets the QoS target all the time, but it costs 36.67 % more total resources than the <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditional query optimizers assume {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} run-time parameters such as selectivities and resource availability during plan optimization, i. e., at compile-time. In reality, however, this assumption {{is often not}} justified. Therefore, the “static ” plans produced by traditional optimizers may not be optimal for many of their actual run-time invocations. Instead, we propose a novel optimization model that assigns {{the bulk of the}} optimization effort to compile-time and delays carefully selected optimization decisions until run-time. Our previous work defined the run-time primitives, “dynamic plans ” using “choose-plan” operators, for executing such delayed decisions, but did not solve the problem of constructing <b>dynamic</b> <b>plans</b> at compile-time. The present paper introduces techniques that solve this problem. Experience with a working prototype optimizer demonstrates (i) that the additional optimization and start-up overhead of <b>dynamic</b> <b>plans</b> compared to static plans is dominated by their advantage at run-time, (ii) that <b>dynamic</b> <b>plans</b> are as robust as the “brute-force” remedy of run-time optimization, i. e., <b>dynamic</b> <b>plans</b> maintain their optimality even if parameters change between compile-time and run-time, and (iii) that the start-up overhead of <b>dynamic</b> <b>plans</b> is signifmantly less than the time required for complete optimization at run-time. In other words, our proposed techniques are superior to both techniques considered to-date, namely compile-time optimization into a single static plan as well as runtime optimization. Finally, we believe that the concepts and technology described can be transferred to commercial query optimizers in order to improve the performance of embedded queries with host variables in the query predicate and to adapt to run-time system loads unpredictable at compile-time. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{data stream}} {{management}} system executes {{a large number}} of continuous queries in parallel. As stream characteristics and query workload change over time, the plan initially installed for a continuous query may become inefficient. As a consequence, the query optimizer will re-optimize this plan based on the current statistics. The replacement of the running plan with a more efficient but semantically equivalent plan at runtime is called <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> migration. In order to have a sound semantic foundation for query optimization, we investigate <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> migration for snapshot-equivalent plans. We develop a general method for <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> migration that treats the old and new plan as snapshotequivalent black boxes. This enables the query optimizer to apply the conventional transformation rules during re-optimization. As a consequence, our approach supports the dynamic optimization of arbitrary continuous queries expressible in CQL, whereas existing solutions are limited in their scope...|$|R
30|$|For {{evaluating}} {{transient voltage}} stability, some assessment indexes such as voltage dip index [6] and transient voltage severity index [7] have been proposed. They {{can be used}} in transient voltage stability analysis and dynamic VAR optimization. <b>Dynamic</b> VAR <b>planning</b> optimization is an approach to enhance transient voltage stability. However, some transient voltage stability indexes are not suitable for <b>dynamic</b> VAR <b>planning.</b> Therefore, a good and suitable transient voltage stability can be well used in the <b>dynamic</b> VAR <b>planning</b> optimization and enhance failure recovery for power system after faults.|$|R
40|$|When a plan {{involves}} {{hundreds or}} thousands of events over time it can be difficult or impossible to tell whether those events are unfolding "according to plan" and {{to assess the impact of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> modifications. Pathological states may arise in which goals cannot be attained or are attained too slowly. Plan steering is an agent-based approach to this problem. The agent monitors an unfolding plan, detects and predicts pathological situations, and develops <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> modifications that will steer the plan around the problem. We present results for such a system that performs the related task of schedule maintenance in the transportation planning domain. The agent uses limited domain knowledge and simple heuristics and is able to improve throughput significantly. 0 This research is supported by ARPA-AFOSR contract F 30602 - 91 -C- 0076. 2 1 Introduction The world in which we operate is tremendously complex and unpredictable.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>dynamic</b> trajectory <b>planning</b> {{which is}} defined as trajectory planning for a robot subject to dynamic constraints and moving in a dynamic workspace, i. e. with moving obstacles. To begin with, we propose the novel concept of state-time space {{as a tool to}} formulate <b>dynamic</b> trajectory <b>planning</b> problems. The state-time space of a robot is its state space augmented of the time dimension. It permits to study the different aspects of <b>dynamic</b> trajectory <b>planning</b> in a unified way. Thus the constraints imposed by both the moving obstacles and the dynamic constraints can be represented by static forbidden regions of state-time space. Besides a trajectory maps to a curve in state-time space hence <b>dynamic</b> trajectory <b>planning</b> simply consists in finding a curve in state-time space. Then we apply this new concept in order to determine a time-optimal trajectory for a car-like robot subject to dynamic constraints and moving along a given path on a dynamic planar workspace. We present a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Progress in {{cognitive}} robotics can come either from {{efforts to provide}} physical robots with more autonomy, or from efforts to make AI techniques more generally applicable {{to the needs of}} robotic agents. We are conducting research on <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> management, which is an instance of the latter type of effort. In this paper, we provide an overview of our research project. Plan management is the process (or set of related processes) by which a goal-directed agent coordinates, updates, and monitors its plans in response to ongoing changes in its environment. We discuss the main challenges in automating plan management, and then illustrate our approach by focusing on one plan management task: evaluating options for action in the context of existing plans. We also briefly describe the Plan Management Agent (PMA), a system we are building as a testbed for our plan management theories. Although PMA is not a robotic system, we are interested in also applying <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> management techniques to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{data stream}} environments, the initial plan of a long-running query may {{gradually}} become inefficient due to {{changes of the}} data characteristics. In this case, the query optimizer will generate a more efficient plan based on the current statistics. The online transition from the old to the new <b>plan</b> is called <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> migration. In addition to correctness, an effective technique for <b>dynamic</b> <b>plan</b> migration should achieve the following objectives: 1) minimize the memory and CPU overhead of the migration, 2) reduce {{the duration of the}} transition, and 3) maintain a steady output rate. The only known solutions for this problem are the moving states (MS) and parallel track (PT) strategies, which have some serious shortcomings related to the above objectives. Motivated by these shortcomings, we first propose HybMig, which combines the merits of MS and PT and outperforms both in every aspect. As a second step, we extend PT, MS, and HybMig to the general problem of migration, where both the new and the old plans are treated as black boxes. Index Terms—Query processing. ...|$|R
