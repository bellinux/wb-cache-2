5000|$|Precipitation {{hardening}} alloys {{first came}} into use during the early 1900s. Most <b>heat-treatable</b> alloys fall {{into the category of}} precipitation hardening alloys, including alloys of aluminum, magnesium, titanium and nickel. Several high-alloy steels are also precipitation hardening alloys. These alloys become softer than normal when quenched, and then harden over time. For this reason, precipitation hardening {{is often referred to as}} [...] "aging." ...|$|E
50|$|In ferrous alloys, {{annealing}} {{is usually}} accomplished by heating the metal beyond the upper critical temperature and then cooling very slowly, {{resulting in the}} formation of pearlite. In both pure metals and many alloys that can not be heat treated, annealing is used to remove the hardness caused by cold working. The metal is heated to a temperature where recrystallization can occur, thereby repairing the defects caused by plastic deformation. In these metals, the rate of cooling will usually have little effect. Most non-ferrous alloys that are <b>heat-treatable</b> are also annealed to relieve the hardness of cold working. These may be slowly cooled to allow full precipitation of the constituents and produce a refined microstructure.|$|E
50|$|While {{the high}} {{strength}} of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martinsite), most <b>heat-treatable</b> alloys are precipitation hardening alloys, {{that depend on}} the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming intermetallic phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases (carbide and ferrite), precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneously, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906, {{precipitation}} hardening alloys were discovered by Alfred Wilm. Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of aluminium, titanium, and copper, are <b>heat-treatable</b> alloys that soften when quenched (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and magnesium, Wilm {{discovered that the}} alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature. Although {{an explanation for the}} phenomenon was not provided until 1919, duralumin {{was one of the first}} [...] "age hardening" [...] alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium alloys (or {{aluminum}} alloys; see spelling differences) are alloys {{in which}} aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal. The typical alloying elements are copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, tin and zinc. There are two principal classifications, namely casting alloys and wrought alloys, {{both of which}} are further subdivided into the categories <b>heat-treatable</b> and non-heat-treatable. About 85% of aluminium is used for wrought products, for example rolled plate, foils and extrusions. Cast aluminium alloys yield cost-effective products due to the low melting point, although they generally have lower tensile strengths than wrought alloys. The most important cast aluminium alloy system is Al-Si, where the high levels of silicon (4.0-13%) contribute to give good casting characteristics. Aluminium alloys are widely used in engineering structures and components where light weight or corrosion resistance is required.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary <b>heat-treatable</b> steels did not exist or were in their infancy. Soft, low-carbon steel was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when soft steels were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is removed from the oven and positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil {{in the bottom of the}} bath. The bottom of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In the paper, {{influence}} of hydrogen on mechanical properties of welded joints from <b>heat-treatable</b> structural XABO 960 steel plates was investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment of welded plate specimens was performed, {{and then the}} specimens were charged with hydrogen electrolytically generated from 1 N H 2 SO 4 solution. The following studies were carried out: static tensile test, hardness investigations, macroscopic metallographic investigations as well as investigations {{with the use of}} a scanning microscope. Findings: Hydrogen embrittlement of welded joints from XABO 960 steel plates was revealed by a distinct decrease of ductility and a slight decrease of strength. On the basis of metallographic investigations, it was found that in a fracture region there are fine pores created by the presence of hydrogen and its displacement due to formed stresses and plastic deformation. It was shown that welded joints are susceptible to hydrogen cracking in the heat affected zone and in the fusion zone.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{aluminium}} alloys and particulate reinforced aluminium metal matrix composites has been tested in an apparatus which simulates the erosive-corrosive action of a slurry. The slurry consisted of silica sand suspended in either distilled water or synthetic mine water. Several steels were also tested in order to clarify certain concepts relating to the synergistic effects of erosion and corrosion. In general both the <b>heat-treatable</b> and non <b>heat-treatable</b> aluminium alloys exhibit lower slurry erosion rates with increasing hardness and work to fracture values. The slurry erosion rates of the aluminium matrix alloys increase with increasing amounts of reinforcement particles. For the steels a good work hardening capacity and/or high hardness values are found to promote good slurry erosion resistance. All the steels exhibit lower slurry erosion rates than the aluminium alloys. A corrosion cell was developed to allow in situ electrochemical measurements to be made. The addition of corrosive ions to the distilled water results in increased material removal rates, increasing {{by as much as}} 40 % for some of the aluminium alloys and 41 %for the 304 stainless steel.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{evaluates the}} abrasive-corrosive wear behaviour {{of aluminium alloys}} {{with the aim of}} establishing a data base of performance and guide lines for material optimisation. Wear test apparatus and standard tests developed by previous research programmes were utilised (Noel and Allen, 1981; Barker, 1988). Further tests were then devised for a more detailed characterisation of wear behaviour. Tests conducted showed that aluminium alloys have approximately a quarter to half the abrasion resistance of mild steel. Poor microfracture properties of Al-Si cast alloys were observed as a result of coarse and brittle silicon rich phases contained in the aluminium matrix. Non <b>heat-treatable</b> wrought alloys exhibit ductile micro-deformation characteristics whilst <b>heat-treatable</b> alloys, having the best abrasion resistance, possess better combinations of strength, hardness and toughness. Tests with combined corrosion and wear showed that most aluminium alloys are subject to pitting corrosion due to localised differences in electrode potentials at constituent sites. Higher series alloys with a large number of constituent particles exhibit higher pitting densities. Due to the high electrode potentials of silicon phases and copper and zinc solid solutions, the alloys LM 6 +Sr, 2014 and 7075 have poor corrosion resistance and are subject to localised and pitting attack. As a consequence the alloys 2014, 7075 and LM 6 +Sr show a decrease in wear performance under abrasive-corrosive conditions. In contrast the good corrosion resistance of the alloys 5083, 6261 and 7017 provide a significant improvement in wear performance under conditions of long corrosion periods with light abrasive intervals. This study concludes that the abrasion resistance of wrought alloys may be optimised by designing an alloy with a good combination of tensile strength, fracture toughness and hardness together with an intermediate microstructural size distribution of second phase particles in the aluminium matrix. Ageing of heat treatable alloys improves abrasion resistance significantly, peak hardness and strength conditions resulting in optimum abrasion properties...|$|E
