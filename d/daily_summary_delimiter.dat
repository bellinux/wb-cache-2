40|$|Postprocessing {{programs}} {{written to}} analyze {{the results of a}} general circulation model are described. The model history data is interpolated to pressure surfaces, converted from 64 -bit Cyber words to 32 bit IBM words, and transferred to tape for further analysis. The time average program reads the interpolation output tape and produces 15 -day time averages. The model outputs a very detailed record for selected grid points. This data is sent to a tape in Cyber full words. The conversion program changes the format of the tape from 64 bit Cyber words to 32 bit IBM words, processing a month of data at a time. The grid-point history sorting program inputs the converted grid point history tape and sorts it by time. The end product is a tape with a time history of each field for every point. After the PBP data has been stored, it can be plotted. The plotting package is flexible, and allows the choice of fields and grid points. The one-dimensional fields are plotted as functions of time, and a <b>daily</b> <b>summary</b> is also produced. For the two-dimensional fields, time-height cross sections and <b>daily</b> <b>summaries</b> are produced. The model plotting package produces plots for all fields on the time average and pressure tapes. These plots include world maps, polar projections, zonal means, vectors, streamlines, and latitude-height plots...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{constructing}} the hedge component in Merton’s ICAPM {{that uses a}} <b>daily</b> <b>summary</b> measure of economic activity to track time-varying investment opportunities.

We find that the new conditional covariance risk measure {{plays an important role}} in explaining time variation in the equity risk premium. Specification tests as well as out-of-sample forecasts of aggregate stock returns suggest that the new covariance risk measure performs well compared to alternative covariance measures previously proposed in the literature...|$|R
