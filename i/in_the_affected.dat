A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E

It {{was also}} the second-strongest October hurricane in any season, and the third strongest Pacific hurricane overall. In San Blas, Nayarit, 8,800people were affected; 1,540houses were damaged or destroyed, which was 80% to 90% of houses in the town. In Santiago Ixcluintla, 3,770houses were damaged. Agriculture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> area was disrupted. Farmers required aid, and many fruit crops were destroyed.

5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} affected 123,320people across Veracruz and Hidalgo, prompting {{the declaration of}} a state of emergency in 112municipalities. The declaration allowed the usage of emergency resources for the affected people. There were a total of six deaths in the country, five of which in Puebla. By about three days after the storm, all schools were reopened. The Mexican government distributed food, water, and construction materials for the areas most affected in Veracruz. Following the storm, about 500power workers were dispatched in Veracruz to restore electricity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus.

Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|THSRC has {{established}} a system to respond to natural disasters and unexpected intrusion onto the right-of-way, called DWS (Disaster Warning Systems).

5|$|After {{the passage}} of the cyclone, the Iran chapter of the Red Cross and its volunteers worked in {{conjunction}} with the military to distribute relief supplies to villages using trucks and helicopters. The branch in Sistan and Baluchestan Province distributed over 10,000blankets, 1,300tents, 400clothing items, 82,000loaves of bread, and 87,000bottles of water to affected citizens. In total, 61,558families received aid from the Red Cross in Iran. The Iranian government provided monetary relief to the affected people. Officials worked to restore roads, bridges, and power systems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> areas, although repairs were more difficult in some locations; by a week after the storm, several villages remained surrounded by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Because Howard {{remained}} {{away from}} land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. One ship, the Strong Virginian, reported sustained winds 42mph (68km/h) at 0600UTC on September4. Along the Baja California Peninsula, 1618ft (4.85.4m) swells were reported. All ships {{were required to}} remain at port due to the rough seas. Heavy rains in the mountainous and Pacific coastal areas of Baja California produced flooding which washed out several roads in San José del Cabo. The rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in Baja California. An estimated 2,000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by the storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities. State and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> areas. The State Civil Protection in Mexico provided rehabilitation {{for a total of}} 393 homes affected by Howard.|$|E

Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired.

5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, an American {{company had}} gained a {{concession}} for a railroad between Hankow and Szechuan, but the Chinese revoked the agreement in 1904 {{after the company}} (which was indemnified for the revocation) breached the agreement by selling a majority stake outside the United States. The Chinese imperial government got {{the money for the}} indemnity from the British Hong Kong government, on condition British subjects would be favored if foreign capital was needed to build the railroad line, and in 1909, a British-led consortium began negotiations. This came to Knox's attention in May of that year, and he demanded that U.S. banks be allowed to participate. Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent, Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and was successful in gaining U.S. participation, though agreements were not signed until May 1911. However, the Chinese decree authorizing the agreement also required the nationalization of local railroad companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> provinces. Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders, and these grievances were among those which touched off the Chinese Revolution of 1911.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, officials enacted a curfew for Belize City, Caye Caulker and San Pedro to curtail looting, {{and the latter}} two areas were declared disaster areas. The entirety of the northern three districts (out of six total) were also declared disaster areas. There were initial difficulties in determining the needs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> residents, due to cut communications. The government sent planes with emergency supplies to the most affected offshore islands. Several emergency teams were sent to Caye Caulker and San Pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it. Widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after Keith's occurrence. The Belize International Airport was back online by the morning of October 4, only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area. By that time, boat service was re-instated with the most affected areas to pick up stranded tourists. Workers quickly restored power and water in Belize City. In {{the days after the}} storm struck, residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease. In Orange Walk and Cayo District, residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid bites from poisonous snakes.|$|E
