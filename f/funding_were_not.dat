500|$|Phase 2 of the Fens Waterway project {{involves}} {{the link between}} Donington Bridge and Crowland and Cowbit Washes, which are located on the River Welland near Spalding. In {{order to make the}} financing of the phase more viable, it was split into two halves, with phase 2a covering the section from Donington to Surfleet Seas End on the River Glen, and phase 2b covering from there onwards. The initial technical assessment and obtaining of planning permission for phase 2, which involved widening of the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to a new road crossing under the A151, a new lock and a junction with the River Glen at Guthram Gowt was funded by the East Midlands Development Agency. This section would involve changes at Black Hole Drove pumping station, which has been built across the drain and hence would prevent navigation. Major contracts for this phase were expected to be awarded in April 2009, but appraisal of the technical assessment revealed that more than one route needed to be considered before the best solution could be selected. While the obvious solution would be to connect the Glen and the drain where they are only a short distance apart, the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership also considered the creation of new channels up to [...] long to form the link.

50|$|The cost of {{construction}} rose considerably during the build phase, {{not just as}} a result of the increase in dam height, but also other factors: in the end the Oderteich dam cost around 11,700 Reichstalers, almost four times the originally estimated and approved cost.

By 1999, Diamond had begun laying new track for the project, but in 2003 transportation officials elected to revoke Diamond’s rights to the route’s right of way, instead intending to sell them to the highest bidder in the event that the project ever moved forward.

40|$|Since WWII, {{the federal}} {{government}} has {{played a significant role in}} funding basic and applied research at universities. During the initial growth of research funding, the issues surrounding which universities would be the recip-ients of federal <b>funding</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> addressed by the government. As such, by the late 1970 s, a majority of research funding was concentrated in a few universi-ties located within a few states. This article examines two politically motivated methods used since 1980 to affect the distribution of funding on research activi-ties, namely, congressional earmarks and set-aside programs. The results sug-gest that there has been a modest change in the distribution of research funding across research and doctoral universities, especially since 1990. Funding from earmarked appropriations has increased the quantity of academic publica-tions but decreased the quality of these publications as measured by citations per publication. At those universities that qualified for funding under the set-aside programs, however, the quality of publications has increased whereas the quantity of publications has decreased...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The F- 22 A and legacy modernization programs GAO reviewed were rooted in different development strategies. The F- 22 A began as a single-step program and did not anticipate the need for future modernization, while the legacy programs each began {{with the expectation that}} their aircraft would be incrementally upgraded over time. F- 22 A modernization began in reaction to a major shift in the aircrafts basic mission, which required the development of new capabilities that had not been planned for as part of the initial development program. In contrast, the legacy modernization programs made planned incremental improvements to existing mission capabilities. All of the modernization programs began {{at about the same time}} in development and procurement. The F- 22 A program is developing and retrofitting new capabilities onto a complex stealth aircraft, which is costlycurrently estimated at $ 9. 7 billion total. Legacy modernization programs were less complex, and thus less costly, and incorporated mature technologies onto new production aircraft. Accurately identifying and comparing the total cost of each modernization program is difficult. Each of the programs, including the F- 22 A, initially managed and funded modernization as a continuation of its baseline program, so modernization costs and <b>funding</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> clearly identified in selected acquisition reports or budget documents. ...|$|E
