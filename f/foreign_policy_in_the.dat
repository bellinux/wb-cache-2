5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see American <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region as a threat. Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of rapidly}} {{mounting}} British pressure and an ensuing armed conflict over {{the position of}} the Uitlanders and economic control over the Witwatersrand gold fields, <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South African Republic was eventually determined by a triumvirate: State President Kruger, State Secretary Reitz, and State Attorney General J.C. Smuts. During 1899 they decided that an offensive attitude towards British demands was the only way forward, despite the risks this entailed. Reitz sought and received the support of the Orange Free State for this approach. On 9 October 1899 the South African Republic and the Orange Free State issued a joint ultimatum to the British government to retract their demands.|$|E
5|$|The Device Forts {{emerged as}} a result of changes in English {{military}} architecture and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 16th century. During the late medieval period, the English use of castles as military fortifications had declined in importance. The introduction of gunpowder in warfare had initially favoured the defender, but soon traditional stone walls could easily be destroyed by early artillery. The few new castles that were built during this time still incorporated the older features of gatehouses and crenellated walls, but intended them more as martial symbols than as practical military defences. Many older castles were simply abandoned or left to fall in disrepair.|$|E

5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went {{a step further and}} used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1320s. After being {{defeated by the}} united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed {{into the dining room}} of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E
