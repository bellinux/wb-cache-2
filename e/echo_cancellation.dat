They are also attractive in acoustic applications where long impulse responses are encountered. A limitation of these algorithms is their degraded performances in an impulsive noise environment. This paper proposes new robust counterparts for the S-LMS family based on M-estimation. The proposed sequential least mean M-estimate (S-LMM) family of algorithms employ nonlinearity to improve their robustness to impulsive noise. Another contribution {{of this paper is}} the presentation of a convergence performance analysis for the S-LMS/S-LMM family for Gaussian inputs and additive Gaussian or contaminated Gaussian noises. The analysis is important for engineers to understand the behaviors of these algorithms and to select appropriate parameters for practical realizations.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, new echo and NEXT cancellers are {{proposed}} for <b>echo</b> and NEXT <b>cancellation</b> in full-duplex digital transmission over 10 GBASE-T system. The proposed cancellation schemes inherit {{the concept of}} the adaptive interpolated FIR (AIFIR) -based crosstalk canceller, where the long portion is modeled by an adaptive sparse FIR filter. Furthermore, we also employ the channel shortening technique to shorten the impulse response of crosstalk interference. Hence, the complexity of echo and NEXT cancellers can be greatly reduced. Simulations show that compared with the conventional architecture, although the performance is degraded by 1. 5 dB, it still meets the SNR requirement in 10 GBASE-T system. The complexity reduction of the proposed <b>echo</b> and NEXT <b>cancellation</b> schemes in arithmetic is about 70 % and 65 % respectively.

This ad-hoc method can also be interpreted {{as the result of}} minimizing a regularized underdetermined least squares criterion. Moreover, by relating this criterion to linear minimum mean square error estimation, we can derive MSE optimal APA and NLMS algo-rithms, which feature a regularization matrix that is not neces-sarily a scaled identity matrix.

40|$|Abstract:- During {{the last}} decade echo cancellers became an {{integral}} part of many telecommunication systems commercially available. Testing and standardization of such systems, however, is still under development and there are many aspects which have not been counted in. Above all standardization bodies dealing with line <b>echo</b> and its <b>cancellation</b> stands the ITU-T, which has developed and deployed the G. 168 Recommendation. The recommendation itself represents a comprehensive set of tests for echo-canceller evaluation. This article addresses problems which might arise during practical implementation of G. 168. It also discusses possibilities how to overcome them using Matlab-GUIDE and other tools. In particular, today’s evaluation systems are real-time hardware systems (embedded systems) which are controlled from a local PC or similarly. They are powerful and efficient but they are also very expensive. If we don’t need a real-time solution and if we accept the fact that the process of echo canceller testing would require much more time, we can do all the work off-line using Matlab.

40|$|Adaptive Filtering is an {{important}} concept {{in the field of}} signal processing and has numerous applications in fields such as speech processing and communications. Examples in speech processing include speech enhancement, <b>echo</b> and interference <b>cancellation</b> and speech coding. An Adaptive filter is a filter that self-adjusts its transfer function according to an optimizing algorithm. Because of the complexity of the optimizing algorithms, most adaptive filters are digital filters that perform digital signal processing and adapt their performance based on the input signal. An Adaptive filter is often employed in an environment of unknown Statistics for various purposes such as system identification, inverse modeling for channel equalization, adaptive prediction and interference canceling. Knowing nothing about the environment, the filter is initially set to an arbitrary condition and updated in a step by step manner towards an optimum filter setting. For updating, the least meansquare algorithm is often used for its simplicity and robust performance. However, the L MS algorithm exhibits slow convergence when used with an ill-conditioned input such as speech and requires a high computational cost, especially when the system to identified has a long impulse response. Simulations show that the proposed structure converges faster than both an equivalent full band structure at lower computational complexity and recently proposed SAF structures for a colored input. The analysis is done using MATLAB, a language of technical computing, widely used in Research, Engineering and Scientific computations...|$|R
40|$|In {{areas of}} signal {{processing}} and communications such as antenna array beamforming, adaptive filtering, multi-user and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection, channel estimation and equalization, <b>echo</b> and interference <b>cancellation</b> and others, solving linear systems of equations often provides an optimal performance. However, {{this is also}} a very complicated operation that designers try to avoid by proposing different sub-optimal solutions. The dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) algorithm allows linear systems of equations to be solved with high computational efficiency. It is a multiplication-free and division-free technique and, therefore, it is well suited for hardware implementation. In this thesis, we present architectures and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations of two variants of the DCD algorithm, known as the cyclic and leading DCD algorithms, for real-valued and complex-valued systems. For each of these techniques, we present architectures and implementations with different degree of parallelism. The proposed architectures allow a trade-off between FPGA resources and the computation time. The fixed-point implementations provide an accuracy performance which is very close to the performance of floating-point counterparts. We also show applications of the designs to complex division, antenna array beamforming and adaptive filtering. The DCD-based complex divider is {{based on the idea that}} the complex division can be viewed as a problem of finding the solution of a 2 x 2 real-valued system of linear equations, which is solved using the DCD algorithm. Therefore, the new divider uses no multiplication and division. Comparing with the classical complex divider, the DCD-based complex divider requires significantly smaller chip area. A DCD-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer employs the DCD algorithm for multiplication-free finding the antenna array weights. An FPGA implementation of the proposed DCD-MVDR beamformer requires a chip area much smaller and throughput much higher than that achieved with other implementations. The performance of the fixed-point implementation is very close to that of floating-point implementation of the MVDR beamformer using direct matrix inversion. When incorporating the DCD algorithm in recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive filter, a new efficient technique, named as the RLS-DCD algorithm, is derived. The RLS-DCD algorithm expresses the RLS adaptive filtering problem in terms of auxiliary normal equations with respect to increments of the filter weights. The normal equations are approximately solved by using the DCD iterations. The RLS-DCD algorithm is well-suited to hardware implementation and its complexity is as low as O(N 2) operations per sample in a general case and O(N) operations per sample for transversal RLS adaptive filters. The performance of the RLS-DCD algorithm, including both fixed-point and floating-point implementations, can be made arbitrarily close to that of the floating-point classical RLS algorithm. Furthermore, a new dynamically regularized RLS-DCD algorithm is also proposed to reduce the complexity of the regularized RLS problem from O(N^ 3) to O(N^ 2) in a general case and to O(N) for transversal adaptive filters. This dynamically regularized RLS-DCD algorithm is simple for finite precision implementation and requires small chip resources. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August, 2008. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Keshab K. Parhi. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 173 pages. This thesis investigates efficient VLSI architectural design {{aspects of a}} digital signal processing (DSP) transceiver in high speed multi-pair wireline communication systems, such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet over copper (10 GBASE-T), with the goal to reduce the hardware complexity and power consumption of various DSP components while maintaining the speed and performance requirements. The covered topics mainly include efficient far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellers, novel multi-input multi-output (MIMO) equalizers combined with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP), low complexity echo and near-end crosstalk (NEXT) cancellers. A novel feedforward delayed FEXT canceller in a THP based system is developed to remove FEXT as noise. Unlike conventional techniques on FEXT cancellation, the proposed FEXT canceller can mitigate the non-causal part of FEXT; thus it can achieve better cancellation performance. In addition, a modified design is developed by eliminating the feedback loops in the FEXT cancellers such that the resulting feedforward FEXT canceller is suitable for high speed applications. FEXT {{has been found to}} contain information about the symbols transmitted from remote transmitters and thus MIMO equalization technique is proposed to jointly process ISI and FEXT such that the useful information in FEXT can be utilized. It is shown that the proposed architecture overcomes the limitation of the traditional equalization schemes and can achieve a better system performance and lower hardware complexity. A computationally efficient approach for calculating the optimal tap coefficients of MIMO equalizers and cancellers is also proposed to speedup the computation. Furthermore, a practical equalization scheme which combines the MIMO equalization technique and TH precoding technique is proposed for the real application of high speed Ethernet systems. Different from existing work on MIMO equalization, the proposed scheme exactly complies with the current 10 GBASE-T standard and can be easily pipelined for high speed implementation. Hardware complexity reduction schemes by utilizing the increased decision point SNR (DP-SNR) are also considered. Gigabit and multi-gigabit transceivers require very long adaptive filters for <b>echo</b> and NEXT <b>cancellation.</b> Implementation of these filters not only occupies large silicon area but also consumes significant power. This thesis considers the problems of designing cost-efficient echo and NEXT cancellers mainly from two different aspects: one is {{to reduce the number of}} taps used in these noise cancellers; the other is to reduce the word-length used to represent data in a VLSI system. First, the sparse characteristics of the echo and NEXT channel impulse responses is exploited to reduce computational cost of adaptive echo and NEXT cancellers. Second, a novel word-length reduction scheme is proposed by replacing the original input to the echo and NEXT cancellers with a finite-level signal, which is then recoded to have shorter word-length. To further reduce the complexity of these cancellers, an improved design is proposed by exploiting the property of the compensation signal. Compared with the traditional design, the proposed echo and NEXT cancellers have exact input and do not suffer from the quantization problem, and thus they are more suitable for VLSI implementation. The design issues of adaptive noise cancellers by using the proposed word-length reduction method are also considered and modified designs of the adaptive cancellers are developed to further reduce the overall hardware cost of echo and NEXT cancellers with acceptable cancellation performance. Finally, the design approach for stable pole-zero modeling of long finite impulse response (FIR) filters is proposed...|$|R
