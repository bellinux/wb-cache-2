40|$|Research PaperThe {{objective}} of the paper is to briefly present a comparative analysis of trends in the characteristics of selected European fleets, observed over the last fifteen years, as an introduction to three empirical studies of the behavioural determinants of these trends. The analysis presented aims at (i) describing changes observed in the characteristics and production of the selected fleets; and (ii) gaining some insights as to the factors driving these changes. Fleets {{included in the analysis}} are the Galician fleets operating in the Celtic Sea, the Basque trawler fleets, the South-Brittany trawler fleets, the UK North-Sea beam trawler fleets, and the Dutch large cutter and <b>Eurocutter</b> fleets. Results show that despite their diversity in terms of size, technical characteristics, and production, most of these fleets have been decreasing in size, with an associated stagnation or decrease in total landed value. In most of the fleets, there has been a tendency for the average power and tonnage of vessels to at least be maintained, and often to increase. The presentation serves as an introduction to three empirical studies of behaviour, focusing on explaining changes in the characteristics, activity and/or production of the fleets based on an analysis of behaviour...|$|E
40|$|By {{integration}} of pulse-technique in SumWing gear (“flat beam”) a new, working and marketable pulsewing fishing gear {{model has been}} developed. This as an alternative gear for beam trawl, specifically suitable for catching sole. Economic results of pulsewing seems {{to be better than}} the results of using beam trawl and SumWing and impact on ecology is considerably less. Compared to beam trawl, less fish was landed and a lower revenues were realised per day at sea, but less fuel consumption {{and as a result of}} that lower costs shows better margins to pay other costs. Fuel consumption related to landed fish (per kilogram) shows also lower figures. In this report just calculations are made for fishing vessels of 2. 000 hp. Till 2011 no smaller vessels (<b>Eurocutters,</b> 300 hp) were active with pulsewing fishing gear...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{two recent}} economic studies which undertook a first attempt in evaluating possible alternative vessel types and fishing methods for diversifying the Belgian overspecialised fleet. This diversification is necessary because the current beam trawling fleet lacks economic stability. The first study starts with unveiling {{the differences in}} 1) catch composition, 2) fuel efficiency and 3) profitability {{of different kinds of}} beam trawlers and set netters. Further on, this study examines how set netters perform relatively to beam trawlers. The second study evaluates the option of introducing handlining to the Belgian fleet. Special attention is drawn the comparson of differences in costs structure between handliners and <b>eurocutters.</b> The results of these two studies indicate that set netters and handliners can be profitable, but further research is needed...|$|R
