5|$|In the Market Square {{stands the}} Gothic St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). It was rebuilt in the 14th-century and {{features}} the famous wooden altar (Altarpiece of Veit Stoss), the largest Gothic altarpiece in the world, carved by Veit Stoss. From the church's main tower a trumpet call (hejnał mariacki), is sounded every hour. The melody, {{which used to}} announce the opening and closing of city gates, ends unexpectedly <b>in</b> <b>midstream.</b> According to legend, the tune was played during the 13th-century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack. He was shot by an archer of the invading Tatar forces whilst playing, the bugle call breaking off {{at the moment he}} died. The story was recounted in a book published in the late-1920s called The Trumpeter of Krakow, by Eric P. Kelly, which won a Newbery Award.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} April 1921, Member of Parliament J. H. Thomas {{successfully}} sued The Communist for libel, naming its editors, printer, {{and publisher}} in the action.

The Independent Labour Party's printing house abruptly stopped production of an issue of the paper <b>in</b> <b>midstream</b> after coming to an agreement with the Director of Public Prosecutions not to produce any more Communist material.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss for {{the third}} {{successive}} year and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] The race commenced at 1.17pm. [...] Despite the conditions favouring the Light Blues, Oxford were ahead from the start and led by two seconds the Mile Post in a record-equalling time of 3 minutes 47 seconds. [...] According to Legget, Cambridge [...] "were untidy and rather rushed". [...] Near Harrods Furniture Depository, the crews nearly clashed oars, but Oxford held firm and reached Hammersmith Bridge with a three-second lead. [...] Rounding the corner, Cambridge chose to stay on the tide, while Oxford headed for shelter towards the Surrey shore. [...] The Light Blues reduced the lead marginally but by Chiswick Steps, Oxford were six seconds ahead and moved back to the Middlesex shore, with Cambridge resolute <b>in</b> <b>midstream.</b> [...] Oxford briefly left the shelter of the shoreline to shoot Barnes Bridge through the centre arch, before heading back, with a lead of eight seconds. [...] Despite pushing their rating to 36 strokes per minute, Cambridge could not reduce the deficit, and as Oxford accelerated to a rating of 38, they passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead, in a time of 18 minutes 52 seconds. [...] It {{was the first time in}} 54 years that Oxford had won three consecutive Boat Races. [...] Upon the conclusion of the race, the Oxford boat club president Mullard hailed his coaches from the boat: [...] "Thanks Ronnie, thanks Jumbo".|$|E

2500|$|Powell's rhetorical gifts {{were also}} employed, with success, beyond politics. He was a poet of some accomplishment, with four {{published}} collections to his name: First Poems; Casting Off; Dancer's End; and The Wedding Gift. His Collected Poems appeared in 1990. He translated Herodotus' Histories and published many other works of classical scholarship. He published {{a biography of}} Joseph Chamberlain, which treated the split with William Gladstone over Irish Home Rule in 1886 as the pivotal point of his career, rather than the adoption of tariff reform, and contained the famous line: [...] "All political lives, unless they are cut off <b>in</b> <b>midstream</b> at a happy juncture, end in failure, {{because that is the}} nature of politics and of all human affairs". His political publications were often as critical of his own party as they were of Labour, often making fun of what he saw as logical fallacies in reasoning or action. His book Freedom & Reality contained many quotes from Labour party manifestos or by Harold Wilson that he regarded as nonsensical.|$|E
2500|$|A {{bridgehead}} {{was to be}} made across Entrance Creek, about half-way {{between the}} Island and the Triangle, with the attack pressing through the Government Gardens and bypassing the Triangle. A crossing {{was made by the}} III/127th Battalion in assault boats on the night of 21 December and a bridge was built by which five companies were able to cross on 24 December. A bridge at the south-west end of Musita Island was repaired and the occupation of the Island by midday on 23 December was uneventful. An advance across the Government Gardens along an axis slightly north of east on 24 December was planned and the attack became a small unit action by companies without a clear distinction between battalions. On 24 December, the right and centre attacks bogged down. However, on the left, a platoon advanced to the sea but when it found itself isolated, out of contact and under fire from its own guns, it was forced to withdraw. A renewed effort was joined by parts of the I/127th Battalion which was just arriving. The attack on 25 December produced a similar result to the previous day but this time, two companies were able to establish a perimeter about [...] from the sea and [...] from the Government Station. The position was isolated and strongly contested by the Japanese. By 28 December, the position had been consolidated and progress had been made in the centre and on the right. By this time, it had been found that the Japanese had abandoned the Triangle. Also on 28 December, the III/128th Battalion tried to force a bridgehead from Musita Island in assault boats but this failed when the artillery cover lifted while the boats were <b>in</b> <b>midstream.</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the reorganization of Kinder Morgan’s (KMI) master limited partnership (MLP) structure. In October 2014, four publicly traded companies – Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. (NYSE: KMP), Kinder Morgan Management, LLC (NYSE: KMR), and El Paso Pipeline Partners, L. P. (NYSE: EPB) – were merged under the Kinder Morgan, Inc. name. This study analyzes the consolidation of KMI through the use of qualitative and quantitative research. The qualitative research involves the study of the company’s 10 -K reports, earnings call transcripts, and energy sector reports. The quantitative research includes the creation of a target price model and the study of Kinder Morgan’s financial statements from years 2008 - 2014, using the Bloomberg database and Morningstar Direct. The current trend <b>in</b> the <b>midstream</b> energy industry is the creation of MLPs, but Kinder Morgan has decided to contradict this movement after many years of use. Results suggest that the KMI’S consolidation into one C-corporation entity will have a positive effect on future growth <b>in</b> the <b>midstream</b> oil and gas industry. In conclusion, the target price model and qualitative research suggest KMI is undervalued at its current stock price. This means Kinder Morgan, Inc. stock is a good buying opportunity after the merger...|$|R
