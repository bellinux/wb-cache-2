Films such as Honey, Save the Last Dance, You Got Served, the Step Up film series, StreetDance 3D, Hype Nation, Saigon Electric, Berlin Dance Battle 3D, and [...] showcase {{all forms of}} hip-hop dance, especially new style hip-hop. Rize, The Heart of Krump, and Shake City 101 are documentaries about krumping. All of these movies and documentaries are examples of films where the plot and theme surround hip-hop dance and how it affects the characters' lives. Bouncing Cats {{is the story of}} b-boy Abraham [...] "Abramz" [...] Tekya who uses b-boying to empower youth in Uganda. In 2010, the film won [...] "Outstanding Achievement in Documentary Filmmaking" [...] at Newport Beach Film Festival and [...] "Best Documentary Feature" [...] at Urbanworld Film Festival. Saigon Electric was Vietnam's first hip-hop film. It was written, produced, and directed by Vietnamese-American filmmaker Stephane <b>Gauger.</b> The film is about two female dancers (a ribbon dancer and a hip-hop dancer) and how their respective romances, the threat of their community center being torn down, and the stress of an upcoming dance battle affects their friendship. The film was choreographed by Viet Max and Ricky Cole. In 2012, it won a Golden Kite Prize (the Vietnamese equivalent of The Oscars/BAFTAs) for [...] "Best Film" [...] and [...] "Best Actress".|$|E

500|$|The {{area that}} would become Monte Ne was known to have had two establishments often {{considered}} essential to a pioneer settlement, a grist mill and a distillery. It is unknown when the distillery was built. It was owned in the 1830s by Abe McGarrah and his brother-in-law; they also operated a small store. The distillery's output each day was given as thirty gallons by the Federal whiskey <b>gauger</b> who resided in the area. The grist mill was built in 1856, and was owned by J.R. Pettigrew. It would later be owned by James Wyeth and Amelia Crowder Blake, the parents of Betty Blake, who {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "Leading Lady" [...] of Rogers, and who married entertainer Will Rogers in 1908. In 1875, the post office in the area changed its name from Mountain Springs to Pettigrew's Mill. The Blakes owned the mill until 1882, when James Blake died. The mill was later operated by David Portnell from 1889 to 1895. He sold his interest in the mill to a retired Congregational minister J.G. Bailey. Bailey later became postmaster. He petitioned the Post Office Department to change the name of the office to Vinola, in honor of a well-known vineyard that belonged to his neighbor Carl A. Starek. The letter was written in longhand, and the o and l were spaced too close together. As a result, the clerk misread the name as [...] "Vinda", which is how it was recorded. The area's name was later changed to Silver Springs. Bailey sold 325 acres of land and a cabin to Harvey.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} from Edinburgh in February 1788, he resumed his {{relationship}} with Jean Armour and took a lease on Ellisland Farm, Dumfriesshire, settling there in June. He also trained as a <b>gauger</b> or exciseman in case farming continued to be unsuccessful. He was appointed to duties in Customs and Excise in 1789 and eventually gave up the farm in 1791. Meanwhile, in November 1790, he had written [...] "Tam O' Shanter".

During his time there, he rented a room from George Stillman Hillard, business partner of Charles Sumner. Hawthorne wrote in the comparative obscurity of what he called his [...] "owl's nest" [...] in the family home. As he looked back on this period of his life, he wrote: [...] "I have not lived, but only dreamed about living." [...] He contributed short stories to various magazines and annuals, including [...] "Young Goodman Brown" [...] and [...] "The Minister's Black Veil", though none drew major attention to him. Horatio Bridge offered to cover the risk of collecting these stories in the spring of 1837 into the volume Twice-Told Tales, which made Hawthorne known locally.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] A supersymmetric {{model with}} U(1) <b>gauge</b> {{symmetry}} {{will be discussed}} in this paper. The model has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry and supersymmetry simultaneously. Besides, there is a massive U(1) <b>gauge</b> field contained in the model. According to the conventional notion, if a system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the mass of <b>gauge</b> field in the lagrangian must be zero [1]. With the development of the <b>gauge</b> theory, this notion has already been changed. In the <b>gauge</b> theory developed by Wu [2], under the precondition that the system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the theory contains massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. In fact, this result holds not only in the usual quantum field theory, but also in the supersymmetric quantum field theory. In other words, we could construct a supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field model with massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. Supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field models have been extensively discussed in the literature [3 - 5]. Similar to the conventional <b>gauge</b> model, in all these supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> models, the masses of <b>gauge</b> fields is zero. In this paper, we will construct a <b>gauge</b> field model which has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry, supersymmetry and one massive <b>gauge</b> field...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a complete, self-contained {{list of the}} renormalization constants Z in unified <b>gauge</b> models to second order in the <b>gauge</b> coupling constant g for four <b>gauge</b> choices. These are the Lorentz covariant (parameter c) <b>gauges,</b> the axial and Coulomb <b>gauges,</b> and a general non-covariant <b>gauge</b> (parameter a 2 /b 2). Specific details of the calculation of the one-loop infinities are provided. It is thus possible to explicitly verify the Ward-Slavnov-Taylor identities to this order. Comparisons are made which suggest parallelisms between the non-covariant <b>gauges</b> and certain covariant <b>gauges.</b> For instance, the infinities in the axial <b>gauge</b> are exactly what one would find in the Lorentz <b>gauge</b> with c = - 3. Similarly, less clear correspondences are found between the Coulomb and Fermi (c = 1) <b>gauges,</b> and between a general non-covariant <b>gauge</b> with a 2 /b 2 = - 3 and the Landau (c = 0) <b>gauge.</b> Finally, {{we are able to}} present for every Lorentz <b>gauge</b> an 'equivalent' non-covariant <b>gauge,</b> and viceversa...|$|R
