The operation <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> the results hoped for; the successes of the attacking force were not sufficiently commensurate with the losses sustained.|$|E

He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops. But Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940.

Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E

He is characterized as a sinister character who tried hard to further his own ambitions.

A part of the Croatian reinforcements, which had just arrived from Bugojno and Uskoplje, fled after coming under attack near Zlosela.

Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.|$|E

Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.|$|E
