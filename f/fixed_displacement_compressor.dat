40|$|The ECS and the {{anti-ice}} {{systems are}} two of the energy consumers for an aircraft; they absorb together two times the sum of the power of all the other systems (electrical, mechanical and hydraulic). More efficient ECSs and a more efficient anti-ice sub-systems would reduce the aircraft fuel consumption increasing the operative radius of the vehicle and also increasing the maximum useful load. The anti-ice sub-system is not only a key energy consumer {{but it is also a}} system critical for the flight safety: a failure of this system means a mission abort and the landing on the nearest airport. This thesis presents the results of several mathematical models which have been developed to study the performance of the aforementioned systems and the strategies to reduce their impacts on the aircraft fuel consumption. The models have been developed using AMEsim and Simulink. In particular a mathematical model, which describes the behavior of the inline pneumatic valves, have been created. The model uses the fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical differential equations to simulate the dynamic behavior of the valves. The mathematical model reproduces the results of the experimental tests within their uncertainty. The validated model has been used to explore the behavior of the valve and its own subcomponents proposing two possible solutions to increase the operative range of the valves and to decrease the influence of the pressure and temperature on the regulated pressure. The second detailed mathematical model created calculates the performance of the plate and wavy fins compact heat exchangers. The model, based on the work of Kays & London, includes some improvements related to the description heat exchanger geometry and related to the empirical correlations used to calculate the number of Stanton. The tests performed on three different heat exchangers have been used to validated the developed model; the mathematical model is able to predict the performance of the performance of the HXs with an accuracy compatible with most the industrial applications. The developed detailed models have been used to simulate the behavior of the system where they are installed. The behavior of an anti-ice system at extreme high bleed air temperature has been analyzed. An innovative architecture for anti-ice system is studied and the benefits on aircraft fuel consumption for a standard day mission are shown. The performance of an reverse Brayton-Joule cycle has been analyzed and a new possible control strategy based on a line installed in series to the air cycle machine is proposed. The limits of the proposed architecture are exposed studying the case of a system used to cool some electronic equipment. The benefits of the use of a reverse Brayton-Joule system which does not use the air bled from the engine (bleedless approach) are detailed with particular attention to the gain in terms of fuel penalty. The thesis ends with the results of the VCS simulations. Some technical solutions to fit a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> architecture into an aircraft are explained; the solutions are oriented to increase the reliability of the compressor avoiding a continuous switch on and off even with low heat loads. A variable displacement compressor improves the overall efficiency of the system on a full mission profile (high COP in the cruise phase). Two strategies, one for passenger compartments and one for electronic cooling, which are able to expand the working envelope (in terms of minimum heat load) of the variable displacement compressor architecture are proposed...|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, no basic {{differentiation}} {{of the energy}} balance is made between a displacement and working piston because that has only a constructive meaning. The appearing leaky mass flow about the piston seals (which can be predicted mathematically only inexactly) is extremely low at a <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> due to the lower pressure differences, and the effects for the process can be neglected.|$|R

Understanding the advantages and drawbacks {{of each of these}} technologies is important in order to identify the ranges of cooling capacities at which a specific compression technology is more efficient. This paper presents a comparative analysis between two positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> (rolling piston and scroll) designed for air conditioning applications. The compressors operate with R- 22 and present a nominal cooling capacity of 18000 BTU/h at the AHRI-A checkpoint condition. First, the compressors were tested in a hot-cycle test bench to measure the mass flow rate and power consumption for MBP and HBP operating conditions. The results showed that the most efficient compressor depends on the operating condition. Â After this, simulation models for each compressor were validated against the experimental data, showing good agreement. Therefore, through the simulation models, it was possible to evaluate the effect of different aspects, such as leakage, heat transfer and discharge process, on the efficiency of each compressor...|$|R

Therefore, multiplication nonlinear law works here. As for this problem, small signal linearization method is adopted to analyze a fixed displacementvariable motor system transfer function and obtain the relationship among natural frequency, damping ratio and the pivot angle of the motor.

In the current context, under geometry simulation, values of working compressor volumes, as well as cross-sections of port openings, at different shaft (rotor) angles are considered. In the current paper, as an example, the Greene formula approach was applied to a geometry simulation of a single screw compressor. Working chamber geometry was defined by “cutting “ it with the gate rotor blade; flute volume was computed using Greene formula; suction and discharge ports were intersected with this volume so that port opening contours were defined and their respective cross sectional areas were calculated. The results of this geometry simulation were applied for a thermodynamic model of a single screw compressor. Experimental investigation of a single screw working process using pressure transducers has been conducted. Geometry simulation data was applied to calculate compression work from experimental pressure traces. Pressure-volume diagrams obtained experimentally were compared to the simulated ones. Also, indicator work obtained from simulation and experiment, was compared to the power input to the shaft, and demonstrated good correlation...|$|R

"December 2012 "Pumps and motors are commonly connected hydraulically to create hydrostatic drives, also known as hydrostatic transmissions. A typical hydrostatic transmission consists of a variable displacement pump and a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> motor. Maximum efficiency is typically created for the system when the motor operates at maximum volumetric displacement. The objective of this research is to determine if a hydrostatic transmission with a variable displacement motor can be more efficient than one with a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> motor. A work cycle for a Caterpillar 320 D excavator was created and the efficiency of the hydrostatic drive system, controlling the swing circuit, with a <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> motor was compared to the efficiency with a variable displacement motor. A PID and an H∞ controller were designed for a position control model, as well as velocity control. It was found that while it may seem obvious to achieve maximum efficiency at maximum displacement, there are some cases where maximum efficiency is achieved at a lower displacement. It was also found that for the given work cycle, a hydrostatic transmission with a variable displacement motor can be more efficient...|$|R
