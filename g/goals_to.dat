40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} hypothesis that situational achievement cues can elicit achievement or fun goals depending on chronic differences in achievement motivation. In 4 studies, chronic differences in achievement motivation were measured, and achievement-denoting words were used to influence behavior. The effects of these variables were assessed on self-report inventories, task performance, task resumption following an interruption, {{and the pursuit of}} means relevant to achieving or having fun. Findings indicated that achievement priming (vs. control priming) activated a <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> achieve and inhibited a <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> have fun in individuals with chronically high-achievement motivation but activated a <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> have fun and inhibited a <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> achieve in individuals with chronically low-achievement motivation...|$|R

Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
