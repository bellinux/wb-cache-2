5000|$|AN-6530 lenses are <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> optical <b>glass,</b> {{approximately}} [...] {{of an inch}} (2.4 mm) thick. These {{share their}} design with B-7, Navy Mk-II and commercial 'Skyway' brand goggles. They were produced in clear, amber, green, and a high-density dark green for gunnery to facilitate spotting targets against the sun. Lens contractors were Americal Optical, Bausch & Lomb Optical and Libby-Owens-Ford. Small quantities of clear plastic lenses were produced in response to lenses being shattered by flying debris during combat use.|$|R

5000|$|Belgium was the world’s top {{exporter}} of glass during the 19th century, {{and was considered}} one of the leading makers of flat glass. [...] Belgian craftsman, such as Fourcault and Bicheroux, continued the Belgian glassmaking excellence by making significant contributions to glassmaking processes during the beginning of the 20th century.

40|$|In {{process and}} quality {{control is a}} strong demand for the {{recognition}} and classification of surface structures and defects. Makyoh imaging ("Ma-Kyoh", Japanese for magic mirror) is a highly sensitive optical characterization tool for large-area analysis. Under collimated illumination, local convex and concave structures affect {{the intensity of the}} reflected beam. Based on a realized Makyoh set-up at the Fraunhofer IOF it is shown {{that it is possible to}} obtain fast qualitative and quantitative conclusions on surface structure and defects from the reflected beam.

40|$|Copper {{aluminosilicate}} (composition Cu₂O·Al₂O₃· 6 SiO₂) {{glass was}} melted in an alumina crucible at 1500 °C and air cooled in situ. A layer of cupric oxide was grown on the <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> surface <b>and</b> its thickness measured using a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The thickness of the oxide layer was found to increase parabolically with time, with a temperature dependency that was compatible with the diffusion of copper through the layer. The cupric oxide layer was reduced to copper on roughened <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> surfaces using a gas mixture of 3 % H₂ and 97 % N₂, resulting in a glass substrate coated by copper. Adherence of the copper layer to the <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> substrate {{was found to be}} poor. However, adherence was found to increase by roughening the surface before oxidation. Additions of NiO and CaO to the base glass were not detrimental to the production of the copper film...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{there is}} only one surface that needs to be <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> into a complex shape, overall {{fabrication}} is much simpler than other telescope designs (Gregorians, cassegrains, and early refractors had two surfaces that need figuring.

50|$|Polished {{plate is}} a type of hand-made glass.

50|$|The {{finish of}} the rolled product is {{controlled}} by using rolls having a variety of surface finishes designed to impart the desired finish to the product.

40|$|Changes in surface {{characteristics}} of <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> human enamel after adsorption of {{two types of}} aminefluorides (AmF 297 and AmF 335) have been studied. After adsorption of aminefluorides from solutions with concentrations up to 10 mM for 2 min followed by rinsing of the surface with distilled water, contact angle measurements were carried out to yield surface free energies and ellipsometry was performed to yield the adsorbed layer thickness. In a separate experiment on powdered enamel, set up in an analogous way, zeta potential changes after adsorption of aminefluorides were determined in a 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7 · 0. Surface free energies decreased from 88 erg·cm− 2 to 52 erg·cm− 2 and 35 erg·cm− 1 after adsorption of AmF 297 and AmF 335 respectively at c = 1 mM. Increasing the aminefluoride concentration in solution {{did not affect the}} values obtained. Zeta potentials, originally − 36 mV, became positive after adsorption, while ellipsometry indicated the buildup of adsorbed layers with a thickness between 3 run and 12 nm. All three types of experiments indicated that both AmF 297 and AmF 335 form an adsorbed monolayer on <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> enamel at a concentration of 1 mM. Negligible additional adsorption takes place at higher concentrations under the present experimental circumstances. In vivo, adsorbed aminefluoride layers will be rapidly covered by adsorbed protein layers, shielding both the adsorbed aminefluoride layer as well as its physicochemical characteristics. This effect has been studied in vivo by measuring surface free energy changes of <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> enamel, with AmF 297 and AmF 335 adsorbed at c = 2 · 5 mM {{as a function of the}} time, these samples were carried by test persons in partial dentures. On both types of AmF-coated enamel the surface free energies increased within 30 min to values approaching the one obtained previously for pellicle-coated <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> enamel (110 ± 9 erg·cm− 2) ...|$|R
