5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E

40|$|Implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> {{attitude}} {{tests are}} often weakly correlated, leading some theorists {{to conclude that}} implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> cognition are independent. Popular implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> tests, however, differ in many ways beyond implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> cognition. The authors examined in 4 studies whether correlations between implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> tests were influenced by the similarity in task demands (i. e., structural fit) and, hence, the processes engaged by each test. Using an affect misattribution procedure, they systematically varied the structural fit of implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> tests of racial attitudes. As test formats became more similar, the implicit–explicit correlation increased until it became higher than in most previous research. When tests differ in structure, they may underestimate the relationship between implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> cognition. The authors propose a solution that uses procedures to maximize structural fit...|$|R

5|$|The Ninth Amendment {{declares}} {{that there are}} additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> exhaustive list of individual rights. It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement of the right of marital privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> formal education.|$|E
40|$|Among {{possible}} critieria for distinguishing separate memory {{systems for}} implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> memory {{is that of}} substantial differences ineither the form or rate of forgetting. Prior literature has claimed both differential forgetting and equivalent forgetting for implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> tasks. Existing experimental data for word-stem completion <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> control tasks were reviewed and shown to be inconclusive. Our experiments measure forgetting in comparable implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> memory tasks of stem completion and stem cued recall, The form {{and the rate of}} forgetting are essentially the same for these implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> tasks. Levels of processing and task conditions differ only in the level of initial learning or availability. Thus, either the implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> ask reflect races in the same memory system or they reflect traces in different systems that have identical forgetting dynamics. The goal {{of this article is to}} evaluate the form and rate of forgetting in implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> memory for words. Claims about differential forgetting in impficit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> memory are evaluated in a review of the relevant literature and in four new experiments...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the authors}} {{questioned}} the statistical independence of implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> motives. Their first {{aim was to}} identify a methodological factor that may have weakened implicit–explicit motive correlations in past research. Their second aim was to identify personality traits that moderate implicit–explicit motive congruence. They found that implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> need for achievement (nAch) are significantly correlated, {{but only if the}} implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> measures are matched in content. Three traits were found to uniquely moderate the relationship between implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> nAch: private body consciousness, self-monitoring, and preference for consistency. These findings indicate that implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> nAch are systematically related and suggest that some individuals may use implicit nAch as a foundation for the development of explicit nAch.

5|$|The {{release of}} Ultime grida dalla savana {{initiated}} a rivalry between Climati and Morra {{and two other}} Italian Mondo film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre {{in the late seventies}} and early eighties. The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence. The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> shocking content.|$|E

That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with Amii Lorin's The Tawny Gold Man, becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually <b>explicit)</b> <b>and</b> Special Edition (sexually <b>explicit</b> <b>and</b> longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90–100% sellout rate each month.|$|E

The results indicated that the relationship between implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> attitudes was only significant under Bogus Pipeline conditions, while implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> attitudes were largely dissociated when they were measured under normal circumstances. Thus, it appeared that as the motivation to accurately report explicit attitudes increased, the implicit-explicit relationship strengthened and the dissociation between implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> racial attitudes was substantially reduced. The results indicate that Whites' implicit <b>and</b> <b>explicit</b> attitudes toward African-Americans may not be as greatly dissociated as some theories of racial attitudes have presumed...|$|R

Explicit solvent particles (such as the TIP3P, SPC/E and SPC-f water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach.

But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce chemical kinetics.|$|E
