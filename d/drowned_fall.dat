30|$|Injuries are an {{important}} public health problem worldwide. More than 5 million people die each year {{as a result of}} injuries.

40|$|Irish {{people are}} being left ‘almost {{completely}} in the dark' about the role that alcohol plays in many deaths every year because newspapers are failing to report on this, a new study suggests.

The research focused on the way in which newspapers reported on alcohol-related deaths in Ireland over a two-year period. Alcohol-related deaths were due to alcohol poisoning or trauma, such as road traffic accidents, <b>drowning,</b> <b>falls</b> and choking, where alcohol was identified as ‘a causal contributor to death'.

5000|$|In this mode, {{players have}} to gather natural {{resources}} (such as wood and stone) {{found in the}} environment in order to craft certain blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring the player to build a shelter at night. The mode also features a health bar which is depleted by attacks from monsters, <b>falls,</b> <b>drowning,</b> <b>falling</b> into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game, except in [...] "Peaceful" [...] difficulty, in which the hunger bar does not drain. If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar, and also regenerates regardless of fullness if players play on the [...] "Peaceful" [...] difficulty.|$|R
40|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of issues}} in the public health and we have to {{consider}} many things for improving the people’s health. In the world, World Health Report was published and in the Unites States, Healthy People 2010 was published. In the Healthy People 2010, US have 10 targets as the health indicators. Among them, the issue of injury and violence prevention is mentioned. Injury and violence include a lot of topics. For example, traffic accidents, child abuse, homicides, burns, <b>drowning,</b> <b>falls,</b> and so on. These topics are very close to our daily life. Many people have cars or motorbikes, so there is high possibility to have traffic crashes. In the gun society, they could have many homicides with it.

In the World Health Report, mortality caused by the road traffic accidents is about 1 million in the world 1). This is ranked 9 th cause of mortality and DALYs 2) in 2002.
