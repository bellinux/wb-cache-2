5|$|In {{its first}} game of the season, however, eighth-ranked Virginia Tech almost let those {{expectations}} <b>fall</b> <b>short.</b> At North Carolina State, the Hokies trailed at halftime and were tied {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter before eking out a 20–16 win in the final minutes. The Hokies bounced back from the close contest in their second game of the season—against the Duke Blue Devils—as Tech raced to a 45–0 victory. The Hokies held Duke to just 35yards of total offense, Tech's best defensive performance in the modern era.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, each team scored onefield goal and one touchdown, {{although}} Texas missed their extra point so {{they won the}} game 51–10.

After the game, Charles said that {{his goal was to}} rush for 200yards each game but that he was not disappointed to <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> of 200yards rushing because he hit his goal of rushing for threetouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA {{to focus}} better on its main role of {{recruiting}} for the Waffen-SS, creating separate sections {{to deal with}} recruiting {{inside and outside the}} Reich. The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the SS-Führungshauptamt (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) SS-Brigadeführer Hans Jüttner on Hitler's expectations of the Waffen-SS for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the Waffen-SS would <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.|$|E

5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
5|$|He was demoted to {{the reserve}} side soon {{thereafter}} by manager Míchel, who had replaced Bielsa {{early in the}} season, and made only one more senior appearance for the campaign. Much of his absence {{in the second half}} of the season also came as a result of him suffering from glue ear, a condition which traps liquid behind the eardrum and affects hearing. Míchel confirmed that Sparagna had been suffering from the condition since the start of the season and had unsuccessfully undergone treatment in late 2015. In April he began a new cortisone treatment but was unable to return to the pitch for fear that he would <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> of doping regulations as a result of the medication. Míchel later revealed that his reluctance to play Sparagna, despite the risks involved had he done so, ultimately contributed towards him being sacked by Vincent Labrune and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who at the time were the president and owner of the club respectively. Sparagna ultimately made 15 appearances across all competitions as Marseille ended the season in 13th position in Ligue 1 and as runners-up in the Coupe de France.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Bridges {{signed for}} Conference South side Chelmsford City on a free transfer. He made his debut {{for the club}} in a 3–2 home win over Bromley on 25 August. Bridges scored his first goal for Chelmsford in the club's 2–2 draw with East Thurrock United in the FA Cup in October 2012, {{sweeping}} the ball through a crowded penalty area after East Thurrock had failed to clear a corner. It took Bridges seven months to open his goalscoring account for the league season, netting on the hour mark in a 6–0 home victory over Farnborough on 18 March 2013, {{a game in which}} he also assisted two other goals. It proved to be his only league goal of the campaign, in a season where Chelmsford would once again make the Conference South play-offs, but ultimately <b>fall</b> <b>short.</b> They lost 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to Salisbury City, with Bridges playing in both games. He made 36 appearances in all competitions during the season, scoring two goals.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} his {{performances}} with the Services team and his seniority in Australian cricket, Hassett appeared certain to succeed Bradman as captain; his only rival for the position was NSW captain Arthur Morris, the third selector during the tour of England. The season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team, started with Bradman's testimonial match, in which Hassett led a team against the retiring Australian leader. Hassett scored 35 and 102 and the match ended with the scores tied. Bradman's outfit managed to <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> of the victory by the smallest possible margin, ending one run short of their target with one wicket remaining {{at the end of}} the final over. Hassett continued his liking for the Queensland attack, scoring 104 and 205 in Victoria’s two matches against their northern opponents for the year. Victoria did not do so well as a team, winning two and losing one of the six matches in which Hassett played, as New South Wales took the title. The summer finished with Hassett captaining a team against an eleven led by Morris. The match was designated as a trial for the selection of the Australian team to tour South Africa the following summer. Hassett scored 73 and 159 and top-scored in both innings; Morris 66 and 12. However, Hassett’s effort was not enough to stop an eight-wicket defeat after Morris’s men took a 377-run first innings lead. Morris and Hassett were the first and third highest run-scorers for the 1948–49 season. Hassett ended the season with 855 runs at 61.07.|$|E
5|$|During the 2000 Copa Libertadores, Boca Juniors {{returned}} {{to the top of}} the continent and raised the Copa Libertadores again after 22 years. Led by Carlos Bianchi, the Virrey, along with outstanding players like Mauricio Serna, Jorge Bermúdez, Óscar Córdoba, Juan Roman Riquelme, and Martín Palermo, among others, revitalized the club to establish it among the world's best. The Xeneizes started this legacy by defeating defending champion Palmeiras in the final series. Boca Juniors won the 2001 edition after, once again, defeating Palmeiras in the semifinals and Cruz Azul in the final series to successfully defend the trophy. Cruz Azul became the first ever Mexican club to reach the final after great performances against River Plate and an inspired Rosario Central. Like their predecessors from the late 1970s however, Boca Juniors would <b>fall</b> <b>short</b> of winning three consecutive titles. As with Juan Carlos Lorenzo's men, the Xeneizes became frustrated as they were eliminated by Olimpia, this time during the quarterfinals. Led by World Cup winner-turned manager Nery Pumpido, Olimpia would overcome Grêmio (after some controversy) and surprise finalists São Caetano. Despite this triumph, Olimpia did not create the winning mystique of its past golden generations and bowed out in the round of 16 the following season, after being routed by Grêmio 6–2, avenging their controversial loss from the year before.|$|E
