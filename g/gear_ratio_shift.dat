2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of evidence, Irish and Dutch {{investigators}} could not pinpoint a probable cause for the accident. They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is believed to be a malfunctioning overspeeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing oil feed line regulator valves. [...] The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (<b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>shifted).</b> The malfunctions of the propeller pitch might have provoked a flight disturbance and as a consequence the propeller may have sheared off.|$|R

5000|$|The NuVinci CVT {{gear system}} uses {{a set of}} {{rotating}} and tilting balls positioned between the input and output discs of a transmission.

40|$|AbstractAir {{pollution}} problems persist {{in many cities}} throughout the world, despite drastic reductions in regulated emissions of criteria pollutants from vehicles when tested on standardised driving cycles. New vehicle emissions regulations in the European Union and United States {{require the use of}} OBD and portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) to confirm vehicles meet specified limits during on-road operation. The resultant in-use testing will yield a large amount of OBD and PEMS data across a range of vehicles. If used properly, the availability of OBD and PEMS data could enable greater insight into the nature of real-world emissions and allow detailed modelling of vehicle energy use and emissions. This paper presents a methodology to use this data to create engine maps of fuel use and emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> gearbox <b>shift</b> envelopes, candidate engine maps and a set of vehicle configurations are simulated over driving cycles using the ADVISOR powertrain simulation tool. This method is demonstrated on three vehicles – one truck and two passenger cars – tested on a vehicle dynamometer and one driven with a PEMS. The optimum vehicle configuration and associated maps were able to reproduce the shape and magnitude of observed fuel use and emissions on a per second basis. In general, total simulated fuel use and emissions were within 5 % of observed values across the three test cases. The fitness of this method for other purposes was demonstrated by creating cold start maps and isolating the performance of tailpipe emissions reduction technologies. The potential of this work extends beyond the creation of vehicle engine maps to allow investigations into: emissions hot spots; real-world emissions factors; and accurate air quality modelling using simulated per second emissions from vehicles operating in over any driving cycle...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} if <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> selection would have an effect on peak power and time to peak power production in elite Bicycle Motocross (BMX) cyclists.
