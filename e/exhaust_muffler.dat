40|$|Noise {{reduction}} is mostly limited to light helicopters whose noise signature {{is dominated by}} their tail rotors. It is primarily hardware oriented. Well known noise reduction techniques such as reduction of rotor speeds with an accompanying increase in solidity to maintain performance, engine noise reduction {{with the use of}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>mufflers,</b> and acoustic blanketing of transmission and engine compartment are used. The concept of blade phasing as a means of reducing tail rotor noise is also used. Engine noise (exhaust noise), power train noise and airframe noise becomes important at low rotor tip speeds and means must be found to reduce these noise sources if further noise reductions are desired. The use of a special test rig aids in isolating the various noise sources and arriving at the penalties (performance or payload) involved in quieting them. Significant noise reduction are achieved for the light helicopter with minimum performance or weight penalties because of the dominance of a single noise source (the tail rotor) ...|$|R

The stainless steel sheet was perforated and folded to frustum shape to achieve aero dynamic shape and used as protective cover on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> to protect the leg from burns. The burn protector produced was mounted on Jincheng AX 100 motor cycle and driving test carried out for 15 days using operational periods of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes to determine its effectiveness. Cole Palmer thermocouple digital meter was used to measure the surface temperatures of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> and burn protector {{at the end of each}} operation cycle and data generated was averaged. The experimental results show that the longer the driving period the higher the temperatures of both the <b>exhaust</b> <b>muffler</b> and exhaust burn protector.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to demonstrate the homogenization approach applied to modelling the acoustic transmission on perforated interfaces embedded in the acoustic fluid. We assume a layer, with periodically perforated obstacles, separating two half-spaces filled with the fluid. The homogenization method provides limit transmission conditions which can be prescribed at the homogenized surface representing the "limit" interface. The conditions describe relationship between jump of the acoustic pressures and the transversal acoustic velocity, on introducing the "in-layer pressure" which describes wave propagation in the tangent directions {{with respect to the}} interface. This approach may serve as a relevant tool for optimal design of devices aimed at attenuation of the acoustic waves, such as the engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>mufflers</b> or other structures fitted with sieves and grillages. We present numerical examples of wave propagation in a muffler-like structure illustrating viability of the approach when complex 3 D geometries of the interface perforation are considered...|$|R
