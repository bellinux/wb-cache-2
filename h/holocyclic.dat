50|$|In the {{southern}} {{half of the}} USA, {{as far north as}} Arkansas, sexual reproduction of the cotton aphid is not important. Females continue to produce offspring without mating so long as the weather is favourable for feeding and growth. Further north, the cotton aphid can be <b>holocyclic</b> and involve two host species, with a broadleaved tree such as Catalpa, Rhamnus or Hibiscus acting as the primary host. In Europe it reproduces exclusively by asexual reproduction and can produce nearly fifty generations a year under favourable conditions. In Russia various wild plants are hosts to the overwintering eggs. Winged forms then migrate to secondary host species in the families Rosaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Malvaceae, Cruciferae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Compositae and others. Parthenogenesis on these hosts allows large populations of aphids to build up quickly. The life span of a parthenogenic female is about twenty days in which time it can produce up to 85 nymphs. These mature in about twenty days at 10 °C and in about four days at 30 °C. As autumn approaches, the winged forms migrate back to the primary hosts. Here, both males and sexual females are produced, mating takes place and the females lay eggs which overwinter, ready to repeat the life cycle the following year.|$|E

40|$|During {{the years}} 1995 - 1999 {{the life cycle}} {{category}} of 2797 clones of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was examined. The clones originated from primary and secondary hosts from different localities of North and Central Greece and the island of Crete in the south. Four different overwintering life cycle strategies were found that have also been described for M. persicae and other heteroecious species previously. A geographical variation {{was found in the}} proportion of <b>holocyclic</b> clones from tobacco and other secondary hosts associated with the abundance of the primary host in the sampling regions. In Central Macedonia, around the main peach-growing regions, the proportion of <b>holocyclic</b> clones was mostly above 50 % and in some cases reached 100 %. In localities of East Macedonia, <b>holocyclic</b> clones were also frequent. On the other hand, further south or in north-eastern Greece, where peach is not common, the proportion of <b>holocyclic</b> clones varied between 0 and 33 %. Fifty seven percent of examined anholocyclic clones produced males under short day conditions, suggesting that androcyclic clones in Greece represent an important factor of genetic variability. Intermediate clones were sampled from all host-plants but at low frequencies (3. 6 % of total examined clones and 6. 9 % of nonholocyclic ones). Moreover, a regional variation was found in different colour forms feeding on tobacco plants.

Our results support the existence in the area under study of two main aphid maternal lineages strikingly coincidental with the two main reproductive categories displayed by this species. Those aphid clones possessing an incomplete life cycle that lacks the sexual phase (anholocyclic or androcyclic clones) show mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype I and plasmid haplotype I, whereas those clones displaying the complete life cycle (<b>holocyclic</b> clones) posses some other distinct mtDNA haplotypes closely related to each other and plasmid haplotype II. While restriction-site analysis of maternally inherited markers points to a relatively ancient origin of anholocycly/androcycly (between 460 000 and 1 400 000 years) followed by interrupted gene flow with respect to the ancestral <b>holocyclic</b> population, mtDNA size variation also suggests that historical stochastic processes have a different effect on the evolution of both main aphid lineages.

The time required for the first penetration and first cell puncture of the non-vascular tissues was shorter in apterae than in gynoparae and males. Apterae more often showed phloem activities and sustained sap ingestion (100 %) than winged morphs (ca. 25 %). In addition, phloem ingestion was much longer in apterae than in winged morphs, 3458 s and 25 - 70 s respectively. In contrast, winged morphs spent 14 - 21 % of the available time ingesting sap from xylem while in apterae xylem sap uptake was only for 2 % of the time.

40|$|ABSTRACT The soybean aphid,Aphis glycinesMatsumura, has a heteroecious, <b>holocyclic</b> life cycle. Soybean aphids overwinter as eggs, hatch in the spring, {{reproduce}} asexually, and undergo {{three or}} more generations on buckthorn,Rhamnus spp., before migrating to a secondary host such as soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. The ability of different soybean aphid life stages to survive low temperatures potentially experienced during fall or winter is not known. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the supercooling point (SCP) of various soybean aphid life stages and to determine the annual probability that winter temperatures within the North Central region of the United States would equal or fall below the mean SCP of soybean aphid eggs. Aphid eggs are considered the most cold-hardy stage; therefore, their SCP {{can be used as a}} conservative estimate for aphid overwintering mortality. In our study, eggs had the lowest mean SCP (approximately 34 C) among all life stages, whereas gynoparae and oviparae had the highest mean SCPs (approximately 15 C). During the winter, extreme low air temperatures are likely to reach or exceed the mean SCP of soybean aphid eggs in portions of northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Thus, widespread successful overwintering in the northern United States and southern Canada is les...|$|E
40|$|Pemphigus betae Doane (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a {{sporadic}} pest {{of sugar}} beet (Beta vulgaris L. var. vulgaris) in all major sugar beet production regions of North America. These oval-shaped, pale-yellowish insects, {{with a body}} length ranging from 1. 9 – 2. 4 mm, secrete a waxy material, giving their subterranean colonies a moldy appearance. Poplars in the genus Populus L. are the preferred primary hosts, while sugar beet and certain weed species, such as common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and kochia (Kochia scoparia (L.)), are among the secondary hosts. Pemphigus betae has a complex and varied life cycle and is usually heteroecious and <b>holocyclic,</b> although anholocyclic apterae are known to overwinter in the soil. Heavy infestations of this aphid can induce significant reductions in yield, sugar content, and recoverable sugar. Under conditions of extreme stress and heavy infestations, the alienicolae can induce stunting, chlorosis, wilting, and even death of sugar beet plants. Accurately establishing population densities for sugarbeet root aphids presents a challenge, because the economic important stage of this insect is subterranean. However, use of a fall root rating index aids in estimating relative population densities. Furthermore, root aphids are especially difficult to control by means of conventional insecticides. For this reason, integrated pest management tactics, {{including the use of}} host plant resistance, cultural control techniques, and the use of natural enemies, should take precedence...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{of males and}} females by apterae of a <b>holocyclic</b> clone of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was studied in the laboratory by transferring apterous virginoparae from long day to short day conditions at different stages of their pre- and post-natal development. Prenatal exposure was also examined in nine additional clones coming from different regions of Greece. By increasing the number of short day cycles at 17 degreesC, the aphids switched to male production earlier and produced more males. The highest mean number of male progeny was observed in apterae that were transferred to short day conditions 13 - 14 days prenatally. Apterae that were transferred to short day conditions after the fourth nymphal instar produced only females. Apterous virginoparae were produced by aphids that were transferred to short day conditions 0 - 1 days prenatally or postnatally. Aphids, given short days prenatally or in the first instar, produced alate female progeny that were all gynoparae. The later the instar aphids were transferred to short day conditions the fewer the gynoparae produced among their female progeny. A reduction in the total number of progeny and embryos per ovariole was observed as aphids were transferred to short day conditions in earlier stages of their development. The increase in male production, which follows the increase in the duration of long night exposure, was also observed in the additional eight out of nine examined clones...|$|E
40|$|Multivariate morphometric {{analysis}} (method of canonical variates) {{was used}} to compare 38 parthenogenetic lineages and three field collections of aphids of the Myzus persicae (Sulzer) group sampled on peach and tobacco in the Caserta region of southern Italy. Comparisons were also made with the morphology of lineages collected on peach in Lehonia, in central eastern Greece away from tobacco-growing regions, and on tobacco in Naphplion, in southern Greece. The lineages were measured after parthenogenetic rearing for one to three generations on the same host (potato) under constant conditions. As in previous work, the multivariate morphometric approach separated the aphids from peach from those feeding on tobacco. The life cycle category of the lineages was also examined. Almost all the lineages from peach in Caserta were <b>holocyclic,</b> yet the lineages from tobacco in the same region were unable to produce sexual morphs. The results suggest that tobacco-adapted and non-tobacco-adapted forms co-exist in the same region in southern Italy, not only because they colonize different host plants, but also because they have different life cycles. This is in complete contrast to the situation in peach-growing areas of northern Greece, and shows that the ecology and population structure of M. persicae is different in neighbouring counties of the Mediterranean area, even where climatic conditions and cultivated crops are similar...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} the {{population}} genetics of the Russian wheat aphid (RWA) (Diuraphis noxia), {{one of the}} world’s most invasive agricultural pests, in north-western China. We have analysed the data of 10 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial sequences from 27 populations sampled over 2 years in China. The results confirm that the RWAs are <b>holocyclic</b> in China with high genetic diversity indicating widespread sexual reproduction. Distinct differences in microsatellite genetic diversity and distribution revealed clear geographic isolation between RWA populations in northern and southern Xinjiang, China, with gene flow interrupted across extensive desert regions. Despite frequent grain transportation {{from north to south}} in this region, little evidence for RWA translocation as a result of human agricultural activities was found. Consequently, frequent gene flow among northern populations most likely resulted from natural dispersal, potentially facilitated by wind currents. We also found evidence for the longterm existence and expansion of RWAs in China, despite local opinion that it is an exotic species only present in China since 1975. Our estimated date of RWA expansion throughout China coincides with the debut of wheat domestication and cultivation practices in western Asia in the Holocene. We conclude that western China represents the limit of the far eastern native range of this species.

Twenty-one enzyme systems were tested using starch-gel techniques. The electromorph variation within species was low, as expected for parthenogenetic organisms. Frequency of heterozygotes was also relatively low for most populations. The percentage of polymorphic loci ranged from 0 % to 27. 3 % in R. padi, but it was lower (0 % to 18. 2 %) in the completely an <b>holocyclic</b> R. maidis.

High within and between lineage variation was detected. Most (81 %) of the clonal lineages produced few males (0 - 5 males per parent) and only 6 % had male production (10 - 16 males per parent) comparable to that (12 - 23 males per parent) of seven lineages with a sexual phase (<b>holocyclic)</b> which were examined under the same conditions. The length of prenatal exposure to 10 L : 14 D increased the production of males. Continuous rearing under 10 L : 14 D at 12 degrees C adversely affected male production in another intermediate clonal lineage. Temperature was found to affect the production of sexuals and to modify the short day photoperiodic response. The production of males and mating females was higher at 12 degrees C than at 17 degrees C in most of the 20 aforementioned clonal lineages with a partial loss of sexuality. Six lineages were permanently parthenogenetic at 17 degrees C, but two of them produced a few males and the other four a few males and mating females at 12 degrees C. Seven lineages which produced a few males at 17 degrees C, also produced some mating females at 12 degrees C. Lastly, photoperiod similarly affected the production of sexuals in two of the aforementioned clonal lineages, one with a sexual phase and one intermediate, although the regimes for the peak of sexuals were different.

Sci., 72 : 2313 ??? 2320, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. BACKGROUND We used molecular assays to diagnose resistance to pyrethroids and pirimicarb in samples of Myzus persicae from field crops or an insect suction trap in Tunisia. Genotypes for resistance loci were related to ones for polymorphic microsatellite loci in order to investigate breeding systems and patterns of genetic diversity, and to inform resistance management tactics. RESULTS The kdr mutation L 1014 F conferring pyrethroid resistance was found in all samples. The M 918 T s-kdr mutation also occurred in most samples, but only in conjunction with kdr. We discovered a previously unreported genotype heterozygous for L 1014 F but homozygous for M 918 T. Samples with modified acetylcholinesterase (MACE) conferring resistance to pirimicarb were less common but widespread. 16 % of samples contained both the kdr and MACE mutations. Many unique microsatellite genotypes were found, suggesting that M. persicae is <b>holocyclic</b> in Tunisia. There were no consistent associations between resistance and microsatellite markers. CONCLUSION This first study of insecticide resistance in M. persicae in North Africa showed genetic variation in insecticide resistance within microsatellite multilocus genotypes (MLGMs) and the same resistance mechanisms to be present in different MLGMs. This contrasts with variation in northern Europe where M. persicae is fully anholocyclic.

40|$|Since its {{detection}} in 2000, the soybean aphid Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), {{has been}} a serious pest in cultivated soybean Glycine max, (L) Merr. The soybean aphid has a heterocious <b>holocyclic</b> life cycle that alternates between hosts for sexual reproduction. The annual alternation involves a primary host (buckthorn) used for sexual reproduction and the secondary host (soybeans) colonized by parthenogenetic morphs. Eggs of the soybean aphid are deposited {{on the margins of}} the buds of the primary hosts where they overwinter from October to late March or when warmer and optimal conditions for spring migration are reached. Prior to this study the rates of survival and sources of mortality on these overwintering hosts are not well known. ^ Studies were conducted from October, 2006 to March, 2009 in two Indiana locations to monitor the abundance and survival of the soybean aphid eggs on its overwintering host, Rhamnus cathartica. Study sites were located in the northeastern part of Indiana (Rome City), and a second site in west central Indiana (West Lafayette). To determine effects of predation on this host, the survival of caged and exposed soybean aphid eggs was observed and recorded throughout fall and spring. Mortality rates were high in both locations throughout the experiment in caged and exposed treatments. Exposed eggs experienced greater mortality (85 %) than eggs protected with cages (55 %). This difference in soybean aphid overwintering mortality was attributed to biotic and abiotic factors. The numbers of predators observed during fall observations suggest that natural enemies contributed significantly to overwintering aphid egg mortality. During the fall of 2008, predators arrived at R. cathartica with soybean aphid migrants, lowering the aphid population to less than detectable levels. In the absence of natural enemy activity during the winter months, mortality of eggs continued to increase reaching an overall mortality as high as 100 % in 2007. The study suggests that both abiotic and biotic causes of mortality influence the overwintering populations of the soybean aphid in Indiana. ...|$|E
40|$|Insects are ectotherms {{and have}} limited ability to {{regulate}} body temperature {{above or below}} ambient and are consequently greatly affected by temperature. The aphid Myzuspersicae has an extensive distribution throughout Europe from Scandinavia to Southern Spain, representing three distinct climatic regions: sub-Arctic, temperate and Mediterranean. The aphid also has genetically distinct clones within its <b>holocyclic</b> (sexual) and anholocyclic (asexual) life cycles. This {{raises the possibility that}} aphids are regionally-adapted to distinct climatic zones along the latitudinal cline of its European distribution. Genetically distinct clones of M. persicae were collected from Sweden, UK and Spain. Indices of temperature tolerance (upper and lower lethal temperature 50, coma temperatures and mobility thresholds) were determined for each aphid clone at different rearing temperatures. Acclimation at 10 °C for one generation increased cold tolerance by depressing lower lethal, chill movement and chill coma temperatures when compared to 20 °C and 25 °C and further enabled mobility to be maintained to lower temperatures. Acclimation at 25 °C for one generation increased heat tolerance by raising upper lethal, heat movement and heat coma temperatures when compared to 10 °C and 20 °C. Acclimation at 10 °C also acted to raise upper lethal temperatures, indicating that the physiological processes conferring heat tolerance are induced at both high and low temperatures. Data did not support intergenerational acclimation to higher or lower temperatures. Lower thermal limits were more plastic than upper limits, enabling tolerance ranges to be increased following acclimation at 10 °C, but reduced on acclimation at 25 °C. Rates of change varied between clones, suggesting that certain clones could be more affected by climate change. A relationship between thermal tolerance range and latitude was not supported by data on thermal traits investigated with the exception of heat coma temperature. This suggests that clonal mixing across Europe is extensive and prevents local adaptation, although long term populations could persist in the Mediterranean allowing increased heat tolerance. Clonal type, as identified by microsatellite analysis, did show a relationship with thermal tolerance, suggesting that clonal types could respond independently to climate change, affecting relative proportions of clones within populations.

40|$|Aploneura lentisci Pass. is {{endemic to}} the Mediterranean region {{where it is}} <b>holocyclic,</b> forming galls on its primary host, Pistacia {{lentiscus}} and alternating over a 2 year period between Pistacia and secondary hosts, principally species of Graminae. This aphid is widely distributed in Australia and New Zealand on {{the roots of the}} common forage grasses, ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) where it exists as permanent, anholocyclic, parthenogenetic populations. Previous studies have indicated that infestations of A. lentisci significantly reduce plant growth and may account for differences in field performance of Lolium perenne infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae var lolii. These obligate biotrophs protect their host grasses from herbivory via the production of alkaloids. To confirm the hypothesis that growth of L. perenne is associated with the effect of different endophyte strains on aphid populations, herbage and root growth were measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control. In both pot trials, aphid numbers were lowest on plants infected with endophyte strain AR 37 at all sampling times. In plants infected with a common toxic strain naturalized in New Zealand, aphid numbers overall were lower than on uninfected plants or those infected with strain AR 1, but numbers did not always differ significantly from these treatments. Populations on AR 1 -infected plants were occasionally significantly higher than those on endophyte-free. Cumulative foliar growth was reduced in AR 1 and Nil treatments relative to AR 37 in association with population differences of A. lentisci in both trials and root dry weight was reduced in one trial. In four Petri dish experiments survival of A. lentisci on plants infected with AR 37 declined to low levels after an initial phase of up to 19 days during which time aphids fed and populations were similar to those on plants without endophyte. Aphids on AR 37 -infected plants became uncoordinated in their movement and developed tremors before dying suggesting a neurotoxin was responsible for their mortality. Results support the hypothesis that differences in A. lentisci populations due to to endophyte infection status and strain affects plant growth...|$|E
40|$|Aphids have {{a strong}} {{seasonal}} response, namely {{the development of a}} sexual morphs triggered by the shortening of photoperiod in autumn that produce an overwintering egg in which an embryonic diapause takes place. From this egg, an asexual parthenogenetic female emerges giving way to the asexual phase of the aphid life cycle in which several asexual generations occur. Based on the response to short photoperiods, two strains of aphids can be found: the <b>holocyclic</b> develop the seasonal response under short photoperiods, while the anholocyclic do not. The sequencing of the genome of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum places this species as an excellent model to investigate the the involvement of the circadian clock in the seasonal response. In the present thesis, the characterisation of the circadian clock genes revealed an extensive alternative splicing, although it could not be associated to any of the strains or photoperiods. Moreover, the expression of circadian clock genes analysed at different moments of the day showed a robust cycling of period and timeless. Furthermore, the rhythm in expression of period and timeless was rapidly dampened under DD (continuous darkness conditions), thus supporting the model of a seasonal response based on a heavily dampened circadian oscillator. Additionally, changes in expression of some of the circadian clock genes were associated to the induction of the seasonal response. The localisation of transcripts of period and timeless in the aphid brain revealed two groups cells: the Dorsal Neurons (DN) and the Lateral Neurons (LN) in the protocerebrum. The location of DN coincided with a region previously described as essential for the sesasonal response. The involvement of several elements that may participate as output of the circadian clock were also studied. We failed to detect the aphid Pdf gene in the genome and PDH with antibodies, suggesting that PDF may be genuinely absent in aphids. We show the localisation of melatonin in the aphid nervous ganglia, which is the second report of in situ localisation of melatonin in insects and the first in Hemimetabola. Moreover, we observed an increase of melatonin content associated to the induction of the seasonal response. The analysis of the aphid AANAT genes, candidates to regulate the synthesis of melatonin, revealed concomitant levels of expression with those of melatonin in some cases. Furthermore, despite the localisation of some of the AANAT transcripts in the nervous ganglia, none of them colocalised with melatonin. Finally, the aphid Ptth gene was identified and characterised showing typical insect PTTH features. Additionally, Ptth transcripts were localised in two pairs of neurons in the aphid brain allowing to identify them as the NSC group II and consequently discarding them as essential for the seasonal response. The results presented in this thesis provide support to the involvement of {{at least some of the}} circadian clock elements in the seasonal response...|$|E
40|$|Para estudar as variações sazonais do número de migrantes de Myzus persicae (Sulz.) em Campinas, foram utilizadas armadilhas de dois tipos, para a sua coleta: a de sucção e a de água. Fêmeas vivíparas, partenogenéticas, aladas, da espécie, foram coletadas em todas as semanas durante os anos de 1967, 1968 e 1969. A presença de alguns raros machos foi também registrada. A armadilha de água coletou sempre maior número de indivíduos do que a de sucção, durante todo o período de observações. Entretanto, as curvas que representam as variações semanais e mensais do número de migrantes da espécie, construídas com as amostras obtidas por ambos os tipos de armadilhas, têm a mesma forma. As maiores migrações se deram nos meses de maio a setembro. A proporção de exemplares de M. persicae em relação ao total das espécies coletadas foi sempre maior na armadilha de água do que na de sucção. _________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTA {{study was}} made of the seazonal {{variations}} in the numbers of migrants of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) at Campinas, State of São Paulo, by sampling aerial populations from 1967 through 1969, with a suction trap and a yellow water trap. Weekly catches were recorded for both traps and summed up to give month totals. Alate viviparous parthenogenetic females of Myzus persicae were caught every week of the years of 1967 to 1969. This is an evidence that in the Campinas region (22 ° 50 ' S) there was no limiting factor to suppress parthenogenetic reproduction and inhibit flight during the period of observations. However, the trapping of males seems to indicate that an <b>holocyclic</b> multiplication of Myzus persicae may also exist. Where the oviparous female or other morphs of the species does also accur at Campinas, is not known. The period when most of migration took place as revealed by samples taken by both traps occurred from May to September. The yellow water trap caught more Myzus persicae than the suction trap, but curves of annual distribution of alates trapped have the same shape. The ratio between the numbers of this aphid in the two types of traps remained rather constant, throughout two years, varying from 2. 3 to 6. 0. This means that water trap catches were related to estimates of aerial density produced by the suction trap, a more precise apparatus for this determination, which does not exert attraction to the aphid species (20). Thus water trap may be used to the best advantage to collect Myzus persicae where an electricity supply to run the suction trap is lacking and / or when numbers of alate in the air are low. The proportion of Myzus persicae in relation to the total of species caught was also higher for the yellow water trap. In February, March, June, July and October of 1967 and June and July of 1968, 50 % of aphid species caught in the water trap were Myzus persicae. It represents 35 % of total caught from May to October of 1969. In the suction trap the highest proportion of this species was 20 % in June, 1968. This difference is attributed to the selective attractiveness of yellow color to aphia species...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{method of}} culturing Eriosoma pyricola on {{detached}} root pieces {{was developed to}} ensure a regular supply of aphids for experimental work. Another method was designed for studying the alate sexuparae formation in woolly pear aphid, whereby growing plants were infested so that the aphids or their progeny could be recovered later. Sexuparae were produced in woolly pear aphid colonies on the roots of "Domestic Bartlett" seedlings treated to induce dormancy, indicating E. pyricola is <b>holocyclic</b> in Oregon. No sexuparae were found while shoot growth continued. Shoot growth of pear seedlings ceased when the plants were exposed to 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Growth continued for a much longer time when plants were kept under 16 -hour photoperiods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. However, aphids did not produce sexuparae when cultured on detached root pieces from plants treated for four weeks under 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Also, sexuparae were not found in aphid colonies on root pieces of dormant plants from the field. All these results agree with our field observations. In the field, sexuparae are produced for about two months in late summer and early fall on the roots of infested plants. After this, no more sexuparae appear in the remaining aphid populations which continue as apterous virginoparae on pear roots until autumn of the following year. Experiments on growth cessation in pear plants indicated that short day-length was not the critical factor responsible for the induction of growth cessation in pear seedlings. These experiments also showed that constant temperatures were {{more important in the}} regulation of growth in this pear variety. The direct effect of photoperiods and temperatures on sexuparae production in this aphid was also investigated. Aphids on detached root pieces did not produce sexuparae when exposed to 10 -hour photo-periods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. Aphid cultures on detached root pieces were kept under different combinations of 10 - and 16 -hour photoperiods and 15 ° and 18 °C constant temperatures. But the treatments had no effect on sexuparae formation. No sexuparae were found in aphid colonies on root pieces kept in continuous darkness at constant temperatures of 15 °, 18 °, 21 °, 24 ° and 27 °C for periods of 14 to 49 days. Also, sexuparae were not produced when aphid cultures on root pieces were alternated between 15 ° and 24 °C every 12 hours for 47 days. Sexuparae were not found in our stock cultures maintained at 21 °C for about three years. Direct effect of different temperatures on the development and increase in numbers of woolly pear aphid was also studied. Apterous E. pyricola on detached roots developed and reproduced normally at 24 °C, but failed to reproduce and died within two weeks when kept at 27 °C. Apterous from stock culture and alate virginoparae from elm galls were transferred to the detached roots of "Domestic Bartlett" pear, Amelanchier florida Lindl., Sorbus sitchensis, Crataegus species, Ribes sativum and Red Delicious apple. The aphids did not survive except on the pear roots...|$|E
