40|$|Considering {{an economy}} with two goods {a private <b>good</b> and a <b>household</b> <b>good</b> with a {{variable}} degree of publicness {and identical individuals, the paper investigates {{the implications for}} economies of size of two extreme households' decision rules: (i) the cooperative model, where households maximize the welfare of their members, and (ii) the non-cooperative model, where each household's member maximizes her own utility. Under the cooperative rule, publicness of the <b>household</b> <b>good</b> is necessary and sufficient for positive economies of size and for these to increase with family size. This no longer holds true under the non-cooperative rule where negative economies of size may appear even in the case where the <b>household</b> consumption <b>good</b> is purely public. The results {{suggest that it is}} the inefficiency of the non-cooperative rule that is at the origin of the problem. Furthermore comparison of the scale factors' values indicates that the cooperative rule leads to less generous scales than the non-cooperative one.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of gender-based income taxation in a non- cooperative model of a couple's time allocation between market work and providing a <b>household</b> public <b>good.</b> We find that the optimal structure of differential taxation by gender is solely determined by spouses' relative marginal rates of substitution between the public <b>household</b> <b>good</b> and private consumption. Breaking down this general rule into the primitives of the model, the spouse with a lower personal valuation of the public <b>household</b> <b>good</b> should be taxed at a higher rate. If these valuations are identical, a comparative advantage in home production relative to market work will imply a higher marginal tax rate. Using a realistic calibration, we show that these two results may combine to imply a higher optimal tax rate on female labor supply. This result stands {{in sharp contrast to}} previous models of gender-based taxation in which households select Pareto efficient allocations. Extending the model to include altruistic preferences, leisure, or human capital accumulation reduces optimal tax rates, while sequential labor supply decisions affect the optimal tax rate of the primary earner in an ambiguous direction...|$|R

On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash.

5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her <b>household</b> <b>goods</b> to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E

40|$|I derive {{the value}} of {{marginal}} changes in a public <b>good</b> for two-person <b>households,</b> measured alternatively by household member i’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the good {{on behalf of the}} household, WTPi(H), or by the sum of individual WTP values across family members, WTP(C). Households are assumed to allocate their resources in efficient Nash bargains over one private good for each member, and one common <b>household</b> <b>good.</b> WTPi(H) is then found by trading off the public <b>good</b> against the <b>household</b> <b>good,</b> and WTP(C) by trading the public good off against the private goods. I show that WTPi(H) is on average a correct representation of WTP(C), but is higher (lower) than this average when member 1 has a higher (lower) marginal public good value than member 2. Pure and paternalistic altruism (the latter attached to consumption of the public good) both move each member’s WTP on behalf of the household closer to the true aggregate WTP, while only the latter raises aggregate WTP. The results have important implications for interpretation of results from contingent valuation surveys of public-goods. In a large sample, individuals tend to represent households correctly on average when asked about household WTP, and counting all members’ WTP answers on behalf of the household will lead to double counting.
