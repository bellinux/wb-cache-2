Its development followed basic experimental studies and the development and evaluation of a prototype device in the 1970 's. Following safety studies and a successful clinical trial, the Melbourne/Cochlear <b>multichannel</b> <b>implant</b> was approved for use in adults by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1985. More than 3000 patients throughout the world have since been implanted with this device, many being able to understand a significant amount of unfamiliar, connected speech without lipreading Following miniaturization of the implant, it became suitable for use with children. In 1990, after additional biological safety and clinical investigations, the FDA approved the use of the Melbourne/Cochlear <b>multichannel</b> <b>implant</b> for profoundly deaf children above the age of two years.

40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Australian Journal of Audiology 1994. This version is reproduced with permission from the publisher, Australian Academic Press. [URL] cochlear implants have been in use for adolescents for 8 years and for children for 6 years. Due to the substantial benefits obtained by postlinguistically deafened adults using <b>multichannel</b> <b>implants,</b> there was a degree of optimism about the potential benefits for profoundly hearing impaired children using these devices. It was speculated that children may adapt more quickly and learn to use information from implants more effectively than adults. On the other hand, there were cautionary predictions {{that there may be a}} "critical age", particularly for congenitally or early deafened children, that, once passed, would preclude effective use of auditory information from implants. This age was variously predicted to be anywhere from 2 to 12 years, based on neurophysiological, developmental or psychological arguments. With some years of experience with implanted children, it can now be said that neither the optimistic nor the more cautionary "critical age" predictions have been supported. As with many areas of clinical science, the situation appears to be far more complex than first thought. This paper will discuss the results obtained for 100 children using the <b>multichannel</b> cochlear <b>implant</b> in Sydney and Melbourne in terms of predictive factors, and the potential for the future application of <b>multichannel</b> cochlear <b>implants</b> in children. The results suggest that experience with implant, the number of years of auditory deprivation, the amount of preoperative residual hearing, and the postoperative educational environment may have a significant effect on speech perceptual abilities in implanted children. In addition, approximately 60 % of all implanted children show significant open-set speech perception ability with auditory input alone. It is now possible for <b>multichannel</b> cochlear <b>implants</b> to provide auditory skills sufficient for young children to develop functionally normal speech and language through audition, provided consistent, long term habilitation is available.

Increasingly higher stimulation currents evoked increasingly larger response areas resulting in decreasing spatial, i. e. cochleotopic selectivity, however, we observed no or little positional shifts of the focal zones of activity.

Postoperative plain film x-rays are necessary in all <b>multichannel</b> cochlear <b>implant</b> patients to confirm intracochlear position, detect possible electrode kinking, and provide a reference if postoperative slippage occurs. In addition, precise documentation of multichannel intracochlear electrode insertion depths is necessary for comparison of speech recognition results among patients and may be of use for future speech processing strategies.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in multichannel intracochlear implantation have generated interests in correlating individual stimulating electrodes to pitch perception. An appropriate radiographic technique {{is required to}} precisely document {{the location of the}} implanted intracochlear electrode array. Anatomical studies, including the measurements of the temporal bone using high-resolution CT films and 3 D reconstruction from the petrous bone sections, were conducted to define the spatial position of cochlea in the skull. Thus, a "Cochlear View" was designed and introduced for postoperative radiological evaluation of multichannel intracochlear implantation. In this paper, a detailed radiographic method and radiological interpretation of the "Cochlear View" are described. A plain radiograph of the "Cochlear View" was taken of 120 patients who had received the Nucleus <b>multichannel</b> <b>implant.</b> Studies have shown that a plain radiograph of the "Cochlear View" provides sufficient information to correctly evaluate the results of implantation, including the insertion depth and position of individual electrodes.

[URL] production results are reported for a group of 15 children, adolescents and prelinguistically deafened adults implanted with the 22 -electrode cochlear implant. Age at implantation ranged from 5 years to 20 years and implant experience ranged from 1 year to 4 years, 7 months. On a speech intelligibility test using sentences seven implant users improved significantly over time. Mean group performance (n = 11) improved from 18 % preoperatively to 43 % postoperatively. Similarly on a test of articulation, eight implant users improved significantly over time and the group mean postoperative performance (n = 11) exceeded the preoperative performance (55 % compared to 38 %).

40|$|The {{cochlear}} implant (CI) {{is one of}} the most successful neural prostheses developed to date. It offers artificial hearing to individuals with profound sensorineural hearing loss and with insufficient benefit from conventional hearing aids. The first implants available some 30 years ago provided a limited sensation of sound. The benefit for users of these early systems was mostly a facilitation of lip-reading based communication rather than an understanding of speech. Considerable progress has been made since then. Modern, <b>multichannel</b> <b>implant</b> systems feature complex speech processing strategies, high stimulation rates and multiple sites of stimulation in the cochlea. Equipped with such a state-of-the-art system, the majority of recipients today can communicate orally without visual cues and can even use the telephone.

In Switzerland, the first implantation was performed in 1977 and, as of 2012, over 2, 000 systems have been implanted with a current rate of around 150 CIs per year.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that many profoundly deaf {{patients}} using <b>multichannel</b> cochlear <b>implants</b> are able to understand significant amounts of conversational speech using the prosthesis without the aid of lipreading. These results are usually obtained under ideal acoustic conditions but, unfortunately, the environments in which the prostheses are most often used are rarely perfect. Some form of competing signal is always present in the urban setting, from other conversations, radio and television, appliances, traffic noise and so on. As might be expected, implant users in general find background noise to be the largest detrimental factor in their understanding of speech, both with and without the aid of lipreading. Recently, some assessment of implant patient performance with competing noise has been attempted using a four-alternative forced-choice spondee test (1) at Iowa University. Similar testing has been carried out at the University of Melbourne with a group of patients using the Nucleus multichannel cochlear prosthesis.
