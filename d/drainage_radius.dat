By assuming logical values for <b>drainage</b> <b>radius,</b> corresponding skin factor was computed using Eq. (9) and summarized in Table  17 as group (B) Results of this table show that for <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> range of 3000 – 20, 000 ft, the skin factor is variable between 11 and 12.9, quite high for the investigated gas condensate well.

30|$|As <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> increases, the {{production}} rate at first declines rapidly, then declines more smoothly.

40|$|Gob gas ventholes (GGVs) {{are used}} to control methane inflows into a {{longwall}} mining operation by capturing the gas within the overlying fractured strata before it enters the work environment. Using geostatistical co-simulation techniques, this paper maps the parameters of their rate decline behaviors across the study area, a longwall mine in the Northern Appalachian basin. Geostatistical gas-in-place (GIP) simulations were performed, using data from 64 exploration boreholes, and GIP data were mapped within the fractured zone of the study area. In addition, methane flowrates monitored from 10 GGVs were analyzed using decline curve analyses (DCA) techniques to determine parameters of decline rates. Surface elevation showed the most influence on methane production from GGVs and thus was used to investigate its relation with DCA parameters using correlation techniques on normal-scored data. Geostatistical analysis was pursued using sequential Gaussian co-simulation with surface elevation as the secondary variable and with DCA parameters as the primary variables. The primary DCA variables were effective percentage decline rate, rate at production start, rate {{at the beginning of}} forecast period, and production end duration. Co-simulation results were presented to visualize decline parameters at an area-wide scale. Wells located at lower elevations, i. e., at the bottom of valleys, tend to perform better in terms of their rate declines compared to those at higher elevations. These results were used to calculate <b>drainage</b> <b>radii</b> of GGVs using GIP realizations. The calculated <b>drainage</b> <b>radii</b> are close to ones predicted by pressure transient tests.

30|$|Actual {{operating}} conditions of target well {{are reported in}} Table  14. Figure  10 shows results of nodal analysis for the objective well and comparison of real and calculated operating points. According to this figure, actual production rate has a remarkable difference with calculated production rate by nodal analysis. Rock properties, fluid properties, reservoir specifications, well geometry and well flowing pressure are principal factors affecting the IPR curve. TPR curve depends on wellhead pressure and physical conditions of the tubing (Beggs 1980). In this research, all these effectual factors were considered using real conditions of target well. However, uncertainty exists in the values of <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> and skin factor of investigated reservoir. In the prior sections, the constructed reservoir model was run for <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> and skin factor of 3280 ft and 0, which are suspected to cause significant difference in well performance in real reservoir. Effects of these parameters on IPR curve and operating point were studied through sensitivity analysis. Variations of <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> and skin factor were divided into four groups (1, 2, 3 and 4) presented in Table  15. Skin factor is set {{to change in the}} range of 0 – 40.

40|$|Interactions between {{alluvial}} {{fans and}} their drainage basin {{have been studied}} in the literature, but several questions remain unanswered. In particular, understanding which controls determine dominant depositional processes on alluvial fans has proved quite difficult. The extremely rare runoff and total absence of vegetation in the Coastal Cordillera of the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) offer perfect conditions {{for the analysis of}} geomorphological and geological controls on alluvial fans and drainage basins. In this study, a complete analysis has been carried out on all the geomorphic and geological characters of alluvial fans developed along the Coastal Cordillera. Both coastal fans (37) and fans located farther inland (10) have been investigated for 39 different geomorphological and geological variables. The number of examined variables is considerably higher than in previous studies. Analyses have been conducted by integrating data from satellite images, a geological map of Chile, and elaborations on a Geographical Information System (GIS). Five principal types of fan-surface morphologies have been distinguished in the Coastal Cordillera, controlled by primary depositional (sediment-gravity and fluid-gravity) processes and secondary reworking processes. Since climate, tectonics and catchment geology (lithology) are generally similar for all of the studied fans, catchment geomorphology is probably the ultimate control on different types of depositional processes and fan-surface morphologies. Mass-flow-dominated fans are characterized by small fan areas, steep fan slopes, small basin areas, great basin slopes, high relief, high basin Melton-ratio, low highest stream-order, low BA/BP ratio, a low sinuosity for the feeder channel and stepped hypsometric curves. Deposits are also important to differentiate between types of fan-surface morphology, but visual inspection by GIS fails when surfaces are reworked. Based on statistical analysis, the main discriminants between different types of surface morphology are, in decreasing order of importance: the BA/BP-ratio, basin slope, basin area, <b>drainage</b> density, fan <b>radius,</b> fan slope, fan width and fan area. This means that for alluvial fans in the Coastal Cordillera the stage of catchment development is very important, since larger, well-developed catchments have a more pronounced round shape (high BA/BP-ratio), and smaller undeveloped basins have a rectangular shape (low BA/BP-ratio). The most influential geomorphological relationship is between basin slope and drainage density...|$|R

30|$|In this study, a {{novel and}} {{integrated}} strategy is proposed {{to investigate the}} problem of low production rate of gas well in a supergiant gas condensate reservoir. In this strategy, the nodal analysis approach is applied for production optimization and performance assessment of a real inclined well. A multi-layered gas condensate reservoir model was constructed and simulated using actual reservoir rock and fluid properties. Effects of reservoir rock and fluid model simplification on inflow performance relationship (IPR) curves were investigated. Also, five different tubing pressure drop models were evaluated using extracted pseudo spontaneous potential (PSP) data from reservoir model to select the most accurate one for computing tubing performance relationship (TPR) data. Then, accuracy of nodal analysis in prediction of well operating point was investigated through comparing with reservoir simulator results. Results of nodal analysis for this well indicated that a significant discrepancy exists between calculated and actual production rate. Sensitivity analysis on uncertainty parameters, skin factor and <b>drainage</b> <b>radius,</b> shows that skin factor of the investigated well varies between 11 and 12.9 for <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> {{in the range of}} 3000 – 20000 ft. Therefore, the problem of low well production rate was attributed to high skin factor as a result of formation damage. Also, results demonstrated that reduction of skin can lead to maximum 73 % enhancement in daily volumetric gas production rate of well.|$|E
40|$|Object-based {{stochastic}} modelling {{techniques are}} routinely employed to generate multiple realisations of the {{spatial distribution of}} sediment properties in settings where data density is insufficient to construct a unique deterministic facies architecture model. Challenge is to limit {{the wide range of}} possible outcomes of the stochastic model. Ideally, this is done by direct validation with the ‘real-world’ sediment distribution. In a reservoir setting this is impossible because of the limited data density in the wide-spaced wells. In this paper this uncertainty is overcome by using size, shape and facies distributions of tidal channel and tidal flat sand bodies in a highly data-constrained lithofacies architecture model as input for the object-based stochastic model. The lithofacies architecture model was constructed from a densely perforated (Cone Penetration Tests and cored boreholes) tidal estuarine succession of the Holocene Holland Tidal Basin in the Netherlands. The sensitivity of the stochastic model to the input parameters was analysed with the use of varying tidal channel width and thickness values and calculating the connected sand volume per well for the different scenarios. The results indicated that for a small well <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> the difference in drainable volumes between the narrowest and the widest channel scenarios is large, and that for a large well <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> the tidal channel width hardly influenced the drainable volume.

This designed grid model has 100 grid blocks in radial direction and their size increases logarithmically with distance from well. In other words, fine grid blocks were used in near wellbore region to accurately model the effect of condensate banking and two-phase flow on well productivity. The coarse grids were employed at distances far from well where single-phase flow regime prevails. Water phase in reservoir is in an immobile state. Relative permeability curves of gas and condensate phases are illustrated in Fig.  2. <b>Drainage</b> <b>radius</b> and skin factor of the reservoir are 3280 ft and 0, respectively.

Based on the features of channel sand formation, a mathematical model has been established considering anisotropy of permeability.

For vertically fractured well, artificial fracture direction, <b>drainage</b> <b>radius,</b> permeability ratio and fracture half-length have considerable influence on production rate. The optimum fracture direction should be deviated less than π/ 8 from the maximum permeability direction (or the channel direction).

30|$|In recent years, {{improving}} {{oil recovery}} (IOR) {{has become an}} important subject for the petroleum industry.

Determining the appropriate location for the infill wells is very challenging and greatly depends on different {{factors such as the}} reservoir heterogeneity. This study aims to investigate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on the location of infill well. In order to characterize the effect of heterogeneity on infill well locations, some geostatistical methods, e.g., sequential gaussian simulation, have been applied to generate various heterogeneity models. In particular, different correlation ranges (R) were used to observe the effect of heterogeneity. Results revealed that an increase in correlation ranges will lead to (1) a higher field oil production total, and (2) a faster expansion of the <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> which consequently reduced the need for infill wells. The results of this study will help engineers to appropriately design infill drilling schemes.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the reasons for low production rate in a producing well of a supergiant gas condensate reservoir. An integrated strategy was proposed and employed for production optimization and troubleshooting the well problem. In this strategy, nodal analysis approach was used for investigation of well performance. IPR and TPR curves were plotted through reservoir and well simulation. Effects of simplifying reservoir rock and fluid model on IPR curves were assessed due to difficulties and the high amount of time consumed when extracting IPR curves from compositional simulation of 28 -layer model. It was found that oversimplification of a multilayer reservoir into a single layer leads to a non-realistic IPR model which may result in an operating point different from that observed in a gas well. Also, different pressure distributions caused a significant difference between the estimated well production rates from single-layer and 28 -layer model. This difference increased by decreasing reservoir pressure. The 4 -layer model had high accuracy compared to real reservoir model and showed pressure distribution approximately similar to the 28 -layer model. Five different tubing pressure drop models were examined using the rational elicited PSP data from reservoir model for selecting the optimal model. Among these correlations, the Gary’s model was found as the optimum pressure drop model for computing TPR curves. Nodal analysis accuracy in prediction of well operating point was confirmed through its good agreement with the results gained from running base constructed reservoir and well models. Results of nodal analysis for real inclined well indicated that a striking difference exists between calculated and actual production rate. Sensitivity analysis conducted on two uncertain parameters including skin factor and <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> indicated that skin factor of investigated well is 11.67 for <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> of 10, 000 ft. Therefore, the problem of low well production rate was attributed to this high skin factor as a result of formation damage skin near wellbore. Also, results indicated that maximum 73 % increment in gas production of the well can be achieved by reduction of this skin factor.|$|E
30|$|Based on Table  17 (group B), skin {{factor is}} 11.67 for <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> of 10, 000 ft. In this case, if skin factor reduces {{to the values}} of 5 or 0, the gas {{production}} rate increases from 118 MMSCFD to 160 and 204 MMSCFD by considering the current value of bottom-hole pressure and average reservoir pressure in Eq. (8). In other words, the daily volume of gas production of this well would increase to 42 – 86 MMSCFD (maximum 73 %). Hence, finding the reason for this high skin factor is essential as the first step before suggesting a suitable remedy for this problem. Accordingly, five different skin factors will be introduced and their existence evaluated for the objective well. In the ideal conditions, a vertical well which is completed as open-hole, produces single-phase fluid from formation with no damage at a rate determined by Darcy’s law (Ahmed and McKinney 2011). There are five types of skin factor observed in real cases, including mechanical skin, completion pseudoskin, geometrical pseudoskin, multiphase pseudoskin, and rate-dependent skin frequently occur in hydrocarbon reservoirs (Ahmed and McKinney 2011; Ezenweichu and Laditan 2015; Jianchun et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|Another {{option for}} {{alleviating}} {{the number of}} reservoir layers is reconstruction of the 28 -layer as 4 -layer model. Table  2 shows that layers 5, 9 and 18 have very low vertical permeability. These low permeable layers act as a barrier for exchanging flow between reservoir layers. Therefore, {{it is expected that}} adjoining layers have different pressure distribution along the reservoir <b>drainage</b> <b>radius.</b> However, embedded layers between two low permeable layers have almost the same pressure distribution due to their high vertical permeability. So, these layers can be considered as one main layer. That is to say, the actual 28 -layer model was restored as 4 -layer. Like single-layer model, average specifications of 4 -layer model were determined by utilizing Eqs. (1)–(3). Characteristics of 4 -layer model as well as sub-layer of each main layer are presented in Table  7. It is vital to note that simplification of 28 -layer reservoir model to 4 -layer decreased runtime in compositional simulator slightly. Considering the fact that each point of IPR curves is achieved in separate runs, likewise, extracting IPR curves from compositional simulation of 4 -layer model were time-consuming and difficult. Modified black-oil simulator with acceptable error required less runtime for both 4 - and 28 -layer reservoir models.|$|E

40|$|The well {{drainage}} {{pressure and}} radius are key parameters of real-time well and reservoir performance optimization, well test design and new wells' location identification. Currently, the primary {{method of estimating}} the well <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> is buildup tests and their subsequent well test analysis. Such buildup tests are conducted using wireline run quartz gauges for an extended well shut-in period resulting in deferred production and risky operations. A calculation method for predicting well/reservoir drainage pressure and radius is proposed based on a single downhole pressure gauge, flowing well parameters and pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data. The proposed method uses a simple approach and applies established well testing equations on the flowing pressure and rates of a well to estimate its drainage parameters. This method of estimation is therefore not only desirable, but also necessary to eliminate shutting-in producing wells for extended periods; in addition to avoiding the cost and risk associated with the wireline operations. The results of this calculation method has been confirmed against measured downhole shut-in pressure using wireline run gauges as well as dual gauge completed wells, in addition to estimated well parameters from buildup tests.

In this work, a novel pseudo state diffusion and convection model is firstly developed to describe CBM transport in matrix systems. Subsequently, based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, pseudo state diffusion and convection in matrix systems and Darcy flow in cleat systems, the production model of a CBM well with a finite conductivity fracture is derived and solved by Laplace transform. Advanced production decline type curves of a fractured well in CBM reservoirs are plotted through the Stehfest numerical inversion algorithm and computer programming. Six flow regimes, including linear flow regime, early radial flow in cleat systems, interporosity flow regime, late pseudo radial flow regime, transient regime and boundary dominated flow regime, are recognized. Finally, the effect of relevant parameters, including the storage coefficient of gas in cleat systems, the transfer coefficient from a matrix system to the cleat system, the modified coefficient of permeability, dimensionless fracture conductivity and dimensionless reservoir <b>drainage</b> <b>radius,</b> are analyzed on type curves. This paper does not only enrich the production decline type curves model of CBM reservoirs, but also expands our understanding of fractured well transport behaviors in CBM reservoirs and guides to analyze the well's production performance...|$|E
40|$|Carbonate matrix {{acidization}} extends a well's effective <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> by dissolving {{rock and}} forming conductive channels (wormholes) from the wellbore. Wormholing {{is a dynamic}} process that involves balance between the acid injection rate and reaction rate. Generally, injection rate is well defined where injection profiles can be controlled, whereas the reaction rate {{can be difficult to}} obtain due to its complex dependency on interstitial velocity, fluid composition, rock surface properties etc. Conventional wormhole propagation models largely ignore the impact of reaction products. When implemented in a job design, the significant errors can result in treatment fluid schedule, rate, and volume. A more accurate method to simulate carbonate matrix acid treatments would accomodate the effect of reaction products on reaction kinetics. It is the purpose of this work to properly account for these effects. This is an important step in achieving quantitative predictability of wormhole penetration during an acidzing treatment. This paper describes the laboratory procedures taken to obtain the reaction-product impacted kinetics at downhole conditions using a rotating disk apparatus, and how this new set of kinetics data was implemented in a 3 D wormholing model to predict wormhole morphology and penetration velocity. The model explains some of the differences in wormhole morphology observed in limestone core flow experiments where injection pressure impacts the mass transfer of hydrogen ions to the rock surface. The model uses a CT scan rendered porosity field to capture the finer details of the rock fabric and then simulates the fluid flow through the rock coupled with reactions. Such a validated model can serve as a base to scale up to near wellbore reservoir and 3 D radial flow geometry allowing a more quantitative acid treatment design...|$|E

In this article, a new profile control design based on quantitative identification of steam breakthrough channel is introduced. Firstly, dual-sandpack experiments are conducted to study the characteristics and influencing factors of steam breakthrough. Then based on the experimental results as well as pretreatment and combination of geological parameters and production data, comprehensive identification parameter (CIP) is achieved through the analytic hierarchy process to quantitatively describe the degree of steam breakthrough. Afterward, the breakthrough types of production wells are determined by CIP and the volume of breakthrough channels and profile control parameters among the injector and the producers are calculated according to the tapering distribution of steam breakthrough in the process of steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. The experiment results show that there exists a large difference between breakthrough channels and non-breakthrough areas in temperature and oil recovery. Permeability contrast is an important factor, which influences the direction of steam breakthrough, and temperature has a great correlation with oil recovery under the heterogeneous condition. The determination of CIP is an attempt to quantify the degree of breakthrough and it combines many factors, which show the difference between the injector and the producer, as well as the difference between producers. All producers of the steam flooding well group can be divided into complete breakthrough wells with CIP over 0.5 and incomplete breakthrough wells with CIP below 0.5 for calculating conveniently.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Interpreting a pressure transient test from an acidized well in the framework of the thin skin concept is not straightforward for several reasons. First, the effect of stimulation cannot be considered to be localized in an infinitesimal region near the wellbore. Second, even if an equivalent skin factor can be defined, it will not be constant during the transient period. Third, the negative skin factor does not allow for a rigorous solution of the transient problem in the presence of wellbore storage, and hence, type curves can be generated only using "equivalent" fractured well models. In this paper we introduce a theoretically rigorous approach for the case when the effect of stimulation or damage can be represented using a power-law model to represent the reservoir permeability (as a function of the radial distance from the well). The well-reservoir system is described using three parameters-the areal average permeability, the power-law exponent (positive for damaged and negative for stimulated wells) and the wellbore storage coefficient. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} this problem has been addressed in the technical literature. The model is solved rigorously in the Laplace domain. We used numerical inversion of the Laplace domain solution to generate type curves. Two sets of type curves are presented for interpreting pressure transient tests from nonstimulated wells and stimulated (acidized) wells. From a practical point of view- however, the newly developed type curve for nonstimulated wells do not provide any substantial advantages over the existing methods, and in fact, this case is simply a reproduction of the Bourdet, et al. type curve for an infinite-acting homogenous reservoir. On the other hand, our new type curve for a stimulated well differs from any previous results discussed in the literature and constitutes the substantive contribution of this work. Data analyses verify that the new generated type curves can be implemented as a new interpretation methodology-particularly for the stimulated well case. An apparent disadvantage of the new type curves is that the <b>drainage</b> <b>radius</b> is a component of the type curve "family parameter," and hence, the concept of an "infinite-acting" reservoir is not applicable. Ideally, practicing engineers need to have a good understanding of the drainage area to obtain a realistic value of the power-law exponent (of the permeability profile). The proposed methodology may be particularly attractive for the evaluation of nontraditional "reservoir stimulation" treatments (e. g., high-rate water fracturing without proppant), where the geometric containment of the stimulation effect is not known...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen CO 2 is {{injected}} {{in a deep}} saline aquifer {{on the scale of}} tens of millions of tonnes, pressure buildup in the aquifer during injection will be a critical issue. Fracturing, fault activation and leakage of brine along pathways such as abandoned wells occur at various threshold fluid pressures, so operators and regulators will be concerned with pressure elevation at considerable distances from the injection well. Thus a critical contour of overpressure (CoP) is a convenient proxy for risk. The location of this contour varies depending on the target aquifer properties (porosity, permeability etc.) and the geology (presence and conductivity of faults). The CoP location also depends on relative permeability, and we extend the three-region injection model to derive analytical expressions for a specific CoP as a function of time. The risk of pressure-induced leakage from the aquifer can therefore be cast in terms of phase mobilities and speeds of saturation fronts. We consider two boundary conditions at the aquifer <b>drainage</b> <b>radius,</b> constant pressure or an infinite aquifer. The model provides a quick tool for estimating pressure profiles. Such tools are valuable for screening and ranking sequestration targets. Because pressure profiles are relatively insensitive to spatial variability in aquifer permeability, a simple model can provide as good an estimate of pressure buildup as a sophisticated simulation that requires much longer to set up and to run. Relative permeability curves measured on samples from seven potential storage formations are used to illustrate the effect on the CoPs. The relative permeability curve with the largest two-phase region mobility (MBL) gives the smallest pressure buildup, so that a given CoP is nearest to the injector. All else being the same, decreasing the two-phase-region mobility increases the risk associated with pressure elevation during injection. Thus characterizing relative permeability {{should be included in the}} implementation of CO 2 storage projects. In the case of a constant pressure boundary, the CoP for small overpressures is time-invariant and independent of relative permeability. This result significantly reduces the uncertainty in predicting risk associated with small overpressures. Depending on the relative values of overall mobilities of two-phase region and of brine region, the risk due to a critical CoP which lies in the two-phase region can either increase or decrease with time. In contrast, the risk due to a CoP in the drying region always decreases with time. This analysis helps set limits on the maximum possible radial extent of a desired CoP, thereby providing a basis for establishing an Area of Review (AoR) for the storage project monitoring. The assumption of constant pressure boundaries is optimistic in the sense that CoPs extend the least distance from the injection well. We extend the analytical model to infinite-acting aquifers to get a more widely applicable estimate of risk. An analytical expression for pressure profile is developed by adapting water influx models from traditional reservoir engineering to the “three-region” saturation distribution. For infinite-acting boundary condition, the CoP trends depend on same factors as in the constant pressure case, and also depend upon the rate of change of aquifer boundary pressure with time. Commercial reservoir simulators are used to verify the analytical model for the constant pressure boundary condition. The CoP trends from the analytical solution and simulation results show a good match...|$|E
40|$|Une {{nouvelle}} méthode analytique d'évaluation du coning d'eau par {{bottom water}} drive et/ou de gaz par gas-cap drive dans les puits horizontaux et verticaux a été développée pour les réservoirs infinis [1]. Dans cet article, une généralisation de cette méthode est présentée pour les réservoirs confinés d'extension limitée dont le toit est horizontal. La généralisation proposée est basée sur la résolution des équations différentielles de la diffusivité avec prise en compte des effets de drainage par gravité et des conditions aux limites pour un réservoir confiné. La méthode est applicable aux réservoirs isotropes ou anisotropes. L'hypothèse de pression constante à la limite de l'aire de drainage dans l'eau et/ou dans le gaz a été adoptée. Les pertes de charge dans l'aquifère et dans le gas-cap sont donc négligées. Les principales contributions de cet article sont : - L'introduction de la notion de rayon de cône, différent du rayon de puits. La hauteur du cône et le débit critique dépendent du rayon de cône alors qu'ils sont indépendants du rayon du puits. - Une nouvelle corrélation pour le calcul du débit critique sous forme adimensionnelle en fonction de trois paramètres : le temps, la longueur du drain horizontal (nulle pour un puits vertical) et le rayon de drainage. - Des corrélations pour le calcul du rapport des débits gaz/huile (GOR) ou de la fraction en eau (fw), pendant les périodes critique et postcritique, qui tiennent compte de la pression capillaire et des perméabilités relatives. - Des corrélations pour le calcul des rapports de débits gaz/huile et eau/huile pendant les périodes pré, post et supercritique en double coning. - Des critères pour le calcul du temps de percée au puits en simple coning de gaz ou d'eau, ou en double coning de gaz et d'eau. A new analytical method for assessing water and/or gas coning in {{horizontal and vertical}} wells has been developed for infinite reservoirs [1]. This article gives a generalized description of this method for confined reservoirs. The case corresponding to a horizontal top is considered (bottom water drive and gas-cap drive). The generalization proposed {{is based on the}} solving of differential equations for diffusivity, while taking gravity drainage effects and boundary conditions into consideration for a confined reservoir. The method can be applied to isotropic or anisotropic reservoirs. The principal contributions of this article are :- Introduction of the concept of coning radius, differing from the well radius. The coning height and critical flow rate depend on the coning radius, whereas they are independent of the well radius. - A new correlation for calculating the critical flow rate in an adimensional from as a function of three parameters :. time,. length of the horizontal drain hole (zero for a vertical well),. and <b>drainage</b> <b>radius.</b> - Correlations for calculating the gas/oil ratios (GOR) or the water fraction (fw) during critical and postcritical periods, which take capillary pressure and relative permeabilities into consideration. - Correlations for calculating the gas/oil and water/oil ratios during the pre, post and supercritical periods of dual coning. - Criteria for calculating the breakthrough time at the well for simple gas or water coning, or for dual gas or water coning. The critical flow rate varies with time. It depends on the geometric and physical parameters of the reservoir, such as the thickness of the layer or the drainage area of the well, and on an important parameter, the coning radius, which will be defined hereunder. On the contrary, the critical flow rate does not depend on the parameters characterizing the well or the near-well vicinity, i. e. the radius and damage (skin). N. B. No confusion must be made between the critical flow rate due to coning and other flow rates associated with the way the well operates, such as the potential flow rate of the well defined by the productivity index, or again the potential pumping flow rate. The height of coning is given by Equations (1. 1) and (1. 3). For dual coning, the coning heights depend on the same pressure drop DeltaPo in the oil zone between the drainage boundary and the coning radius and are inversely proportional to the differences in specific gravity. As shown in Figure 2, the equipotential passing via the coning apex cuts through the top of the reservoir, which is assumed to be horizontal here, at point A 2, situated at distance re from the axis of the well. We have called this distance the coning radius(see Eq. 1. 4). The coning radius is a very important concept since it defines the origin for calculating the pressure drop governing the critical coning amplitude. This coning radius is involved in the correlations given in Section 3. The new correlations proposed are given in an adimensional form (Eq. 2. 1 and Figures I and II outside the text). The geometric parameters involved in the equations are given in Figure 4 for the vertical well and in Figure 5 for the horizontal well. A horizontal well with length L is considered to be the equivalent of a well made up of a horizontal drainage hole with length Lr and two vertical semiwells with radius 2 rc (Eq. 2. 12 and 2. 13). Correlations have been determined by integrating the diffential equations (see Ref. [1] for two types of boundary conditions) : constant flow rate or constant pressure. We have given a new solution for the horizontal well by assuming that the flow rate in the sum of the flow rates for a drain hole with lenght Lr and two vertical semiwells situated at the ends of the horizontal drain hole (Fig. 6). The correlations are used in three forms :- Calculation of the flow rate (Eq. 2. 22) for a given geometry and for a given breakthrough time;- Calculation of the coning height (Eq. 2. 23) for a given breakthrough time and a constant flow rate in time;- Calculation of the breakthrough time (Eq. 2. 24) for a constant flow rate in time. The dual coning pattern is shown in Figure 8. From solely the standpoint of coning, the optimum position is the one corresponding to the simultaneity of the two water and gas breakthroughs (Eq. 3. 5 and 3. 6). Several horizontal planes are involved in the characterization of double coning. First of all, there is the dual coning convergence plane (DCCP) at depth Zdccp (Fig. 9). In the extreme case, the two gas and water cones cut across the level of this plane, and the oil flow rate becomes zero (Eq. 3. 7). The optimal up perforation (OUP) and optimal down perforation (ODP) boundaries, the dual breakthrough upper limit (DBTUL) above which the dual breakthrough is not possible, only gas can break through, and the dual breakthrough down limit (DBTDL) beyond which only water breakthrough is possible are defined. The five characteristics areas for breakthrough for dual coning are given in Figure 9 :- gas breakthrough alone,- dual gas breakthrough followed by water,- simultaneous double breakthrough of gas and water,- dual breakthrough of water followed by gas,- and breakthrough of water alone. Capillarity plays a different role depending on the phases present. In the water/oil system (w/o), this role is negative. Water breakthrough is faster when capillarity is involved. On the contrary, in the gas/oil system (g/o), it is positive. The gas breakthrough is delayed by capillarity. The new correlations have been determined by assuming the hypothesis that fluid flow rates (gas, oil and water) depend on the perforation height covered by these fluids (Fig. 10). The correlations for calculating the water fraction (fw) were determined by Pietraru and Cosentino [1] as a function of coning height (hcw or how), perforation height ho, capillary pressure (Fig. 10 and 11) and the water-oil mobility ratio (Eq. 4. 7 and 4. 8). The correlations given above, with the equations for functions F, derived in the following sections, can be used to solve the following water-coning problems :- Calculating the watercut (fw) for a given coning height (hcw). First, how must be calculed using Equation 4. 2. - Calculating the height of the coning peak (hcw) for a given watercut (fw). In a similar way, the GOR is calculated for gas coning. The correlations given above were developed while considering that the production flow rate is constant. However, application of the superposition principle can be used to apply the proposed methods to cases of variable flow rate, hence the following options that may be analyzed with this method. Constant oil flow rate : This option has a theoretical nature. It can be applied in practice only up to breakthrough. The watertut, which is insignificant up to breakthrough, effectively increases very quickly after breakthrough. Constant total liquid flow rate : This is the simplest variant in practise, especially when the wells are pumped. The oil flow rate decreases in time. Constant watercut : With a continuous decrease in the oil flow rate in time. This option can be used to optimize the cumulative oil produced. It is difficult to apply in practice, but it is the ideal variant. Production with decrease of the liquid flow rate in stages : This is an interesting combination, in practice, of the preceding two flow regimes. This regime consists of a succession of constant liquid flow ratestages with a decrease in the flow rate each time the fixed acceptable limit of the fw (or GOR) is reached. The method proposed in this article is approximate because of the simplifying hypotheses introduced and because of :- the coning heights are calculated without taking the existence of perforations into consideration;- for high watercuts, the zero pressure-drop hypothesis in the aquifer has been retained, although it is not very realistic. The method has been checked, at least in the range between 1 and 10 to the power of 4 in adimensional time td, by comparison with :- production data,- laboratory experiments, - and numerical simulations. Data published for four wells [9, 10, 11 and 12] were used for the comparison. The well parameters as well as the breakthrough time and the critical flow rates are given in Appendix F. The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 14. The comparison of parameters td, qd, and Ld, both calculated and observed, shows satisfactory agreement of correlations with production data with differences of about ý 20 %. The only published results of laboratory experiments with fairly complete data are those by Sobocinski [3] and Bournazel [12]. The empirical correlations proposed after examining the correlations proposed by these authors have been transcribed into adimensional parameters (§ 3). The experiments by Sobocinski and Bournazel covery two partially superposed fields that are limited in time, hardly two cycles in log scale (Fig. 15). The differences may be as much as 50 %. After nonexhaustive investigations, we found fairly complete results in articles by Papatzacos [8], Tiefenthal [12] and Arbadi [14]. After computing the adimensional times and flow rates, td and qd, the results found by these authors are given in Figure 14. The results of simulations by the three authors are quite different. Arbabi's simulations are in agreement with the correlations. Papatzacos's results give flow rates twice as large as those provided by the correlations, whereas Tiefenthal's results are 30 % lower. We do not know the specific conditions under which the simulations were performed, and thus a systematic study for the validation of the new method is desirable...|$|E
