40|$|Improvements {{in running}} speed have been {{attributed}} to both primary and secondary speed training techniques. Primary techniques involve attention to running mechanics and form, and secondary techniques involve resisted or assisted sprinting. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of combining both primary and secondary speed training techniques on 40 yard sprint speed in young soccer players. To compare the effects of pre- and post- <b>four</b> <b>week</b> speed training protocol on 40 -yard sprint times in female collegiate soccer players. Twelve (19. 5 + 1. 5 y) normal weight (BMI: 22. 7 + 3. 4 kg·m- 2) and body composition (BF: 27. 75 + 3. 8 %) active white female collegiate soccer players participated in a <b>four</b> <b>week</b> training protocol which implemented primary and secondary speed training methods. A standard running mechanics program was implemented two times per week and was immediately followed by resisted or assisted sprinting. Sled towing was chosen for resisted sprinting, while elastic towing devices were chosen for assisted sprinting. Forty yard sprint times were assessed pre and post protocol. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. A paired samples t-test showed the <b>four</b> <b>week</b> speed training protocol elicited statistically significant reductions in 40 yard sprint times (p< 0. 001). The average sprint time decreased by 0. 248 seconds (pre= 5. 463 + 0. 066 vs post= 5. 215 + 0. 053).
