Firstly, it creates new obligations for the breaching state, principally, duties of cessation and non-repetition (Article 30), and a duty to make full reparation (Article 31).

We argue that an adequate treatment of the pragmatic oddity within a norm-based semantics can be obtained, by not allowing primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>obligations</b> to aggregate, because they are obligations of a di erent kind. On the basis of this conceptual analysis, we introduce two logics, depending on the stance taken on the representation of normative con icts, and we present sound and complete proof systems for these logics.

Hence, it examined internal and external factors of teachers’ job satisfaction as well as, the levels of teachers’ commitments in the selected <b>general</b> <b>secondary</b> schools of Hadiya Zone. To accomplish this purpose, the study employed a concurrent nested research design. A total of 159 individuals have participated in the study. Among them 119 teachers were included through simple random sampling technique. Additionally, 8 <b>general</b> <b>secondary</b> school principals, 16 vice-principals, 8 supervisors and 8 Woreda education office expertise were included through census technique. Questionnaire and interview were the main instruments of data collection. The analysis of the quantitative data was carried out by using percent, mean, standard deviation and Pearson product correlation coefficient. Pearson product correlation coefficient results revealed of teachers’ were a significant and positive relationship between teachers’ job satisfaction and commitment (r =. 77, N = 105), (r =. 71, N = 30) teachers’, and principals, vice principals and supervisors respondents respectively. Higher levels of teachers’ job satisfaction were associated with higher levels commitment in the study area. As the mean and standard deviation teachers’, and principals, vice-principals and supervisors’ revealed that the external factors have more influence than internal factor on teachers’ job satisfaction in the study area.
