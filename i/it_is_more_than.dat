5|$|Most 50-point triple-doubles in {{a single}} season: Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) {{recorded}} three 50-point triple-doubles in the 2016–17 season. James Harden is the other player to record more than one 50-point triple double with two in the same season. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> likely that Wilt Chamberlain recorded many 50-point triple-doubles during his historic 1961-62 NBA season, but they remain unofficial, as steals and blocked shots were not yet recorded as official statistics.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It {{is possible that the}} territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E

5|$|Argon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is a noble gas. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E

Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are well represented in calligraphic as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of Ottoman callgraphies, manuscripts and paintings.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> relief; {{it is the}} three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect {{to see in the}} work of the man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the {{restoration}} claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
