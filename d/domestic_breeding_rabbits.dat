The prevalence of coccidian oocysts in weanling rabbits (74  %) was higher than that in growing rabbits (45  %) and <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits</b> (42  %), and the intensity of infection in young animals (weanling rabbits) was significantly higher (P <  0.05) than in adults (<b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits),</b> This could be due to lower resistance or less immunity to coccidian oocysts in young rabbits compared to elder animals as described previously (Pakandl et al. 2008 a, b).|$|R

Two experimental groups of three male Californian rabbits at four months of age, equal body mass and condition were formed. Their activity was examined in three cage types: without, with platforms wire-mesh and with platforms wooden platforms using camera traps. Separation of cage volume by means of {{an elevated}} platform increased the activity of <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The rabbit activity was also influenced by the platform material.

40|$|Abstract. Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an {{infrequent}} {{condition of}} animals {{characterized by the}} existence of numerous thin-walled, gas-filled cystic structures within the intestinal wall and adjacent lymph nodes. Microscopically, the cystic structures appear to be dilated lymphatics located in the lamina propria, submucosa, muscularis, subserosa, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes. This report describes a case of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis in a rabbit doe from an organic farm where 20 rabbit does were fed ad libitum with a natural diet consisting of whole barley, pea beans, alfalfa hay, and a pelleted vitamin–mineral blend. A combination of nutritional, bacterial, and other factors are hypothesized as possible predisposing factors {{in the development of}} PCI.
