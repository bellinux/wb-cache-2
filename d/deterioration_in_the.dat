40|$|As {{regard the}} thesis that the terms of trade between primary {{commodities}} and manufactured goods tended to deteriorate during the twentieth century, econometric analysis based on the Grilli-Yang series have not produced decisive results.

Work carried out more recently has highlighted the important role volatility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terms of trade of primary commodities plays in conditioning any trend deteriorations. Leaving aside empirical results regarding <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relation between the prices of primary commodities and manufactures, {{we believe that the}} policy insights provided by Prebisch and Singer remain substantially valid today: specialization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agricultural sector or mining industry have so far not led to external economies able to drive other manufacturing sectors...|$|R

5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{quality of the}} gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating {{for the quality of}} the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, {{but then in}} electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and eventually pure silver. Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king to respond to this crisis by issuing a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) {{are among the most}} radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quantity and quality of Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Communique was not {{implemented}} {{and the situation}} continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered South Vietnam's Special Forces to attack Buddhist pagodas across the country on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, {{in addition to other}} government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the knowledge that the US would not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a successful coup in November, resulting in the assassination of the president. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military situation as the communist Viet Cong made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{church in}} Kirkcaldy is the Old Kirk, the old parish church, on Kirk Wynd. The {{earliest}} {{mention of the}} Old Kirk is the record of its consecration in 1244 to St Brisse and St Patrick by David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews. The building's <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late eighteenth century was addressed by major renovations to {{the main body of}} the church between 1807 and 1808. Only the square western tower, which dates from around 1500, was retained and is now the oldest building to have survived within the old burgh. In 2000 the Old Kirk was amalgamated with St Brycedale Church and was closed for public worship in 2008. It has since been re-opened by the Old Kirk Trust and is used for musical and dramatic performances. Other significant churches in the town include St Bryce Kirk built between 1877 and 1881 by James Matthews at the corner of St Brycedale Avenue and Kirk Wynd; Abbotshall Parish Church on Abbotshall Road, the current building completed in 1788 and Linktown Church built in 1830-1 by George Hay on Bethlefield Place.|$|E

5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

40|$|After {{providing}} a brief background on recent developments of {{terms of trade}} shocks anddebt relief initiatives, the paper uses a simple macroeconomic model to estimate theimpact of debt relief and terms of trade shocks on growth and poverty <b>in</b> Africancountries. For <b>the</b> 18 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) that reached the enhancedHIPC decision point by end-December 2000, the basic quantitative findings are asfollows:· HIPC debt relief has boosted economic growth in these countries {{by an average of}} 2. 9 percent per annum (everything else remaining the same). · The computed result of this increase in growth is a reduction in poverty by anaverage of 2. 2 percent per annum. · However, recent <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terms of trade might have counter-balancedthese positive effects by lowering growth by an average of 2. 0 percent per annumand by increasing poverty by an average of 1. 3 percent per annum. · Clearly, much of the positive impact emanating from the HIPC Initiative has beeneroded due to recent <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terms of trade. The HIPC-inducedgrowth and poverty reduction have been reduced each to an average of 0. 9 percentper annum. The paper also estimates the net effect on growth and poverty of the recently agreed 100 percent multilateral debt relief. This is predicted to boost economic growth by an averageof 5 percent per annum and reduce poverty by about 5. 3 percent per annum for the groupof all African HIPCs. The paper concludes that 100 percent debt relief is crucial forAfrica, but that more aid and policies need to be focused on a long-term developmentstrategy that fosters the necessary structural transformation. ...|$|R
