In this study, we solved the cellular manufacturing system {{design and the}} technology selection problems simultaneously while taking the changing market dynamics into consideration. Cellular manufacturing system design problem aims the identification of existing part families and machine groups, while the technology selection decision determines the appropriate technology for the facility. In order to integrate the market characteristics in our model, we proposed a new cost function. Further, we modified a well known similarity measure in order to handle the operational capability of available technology. This new coefficient is employed at the identification of part families. The technology selection decision {{is based on the}} individual properties of parts, namely the production volume, variability of the demand, and the design stability of the part.

40|$|The {{flexible}} manufacturing system (FMS) has attracted substantial amount of research effort during the last twenty years. Most of the studies address the issues of flexibility, productivity, cost, and so forth. The impact of flexible lines on product quality is less studied.

By considering the <b>machining</b> <b>system</b> as a closed-loop system consisting of a machine tool structure and a machining process, the join system characteristics can be analyzed. The capability of a <b>machining</b> <b>system</b> is mainly determined by its static and dynamic stiffness. The goal of this thesis is to introduce some concepts and methods regarding the identification of <b>machining</b> <b>system</b> stability. Two methods are discussed, one for the static behaviour analysis of a machine tool, and one for dynamic stability of a <b>machining</b> <b>system.</b> Preliminary results are indicating unambiguous identification of capabilities of <b>machining</b> <b>systems</b> static and dynamic characteristics. The static behaviour of a machine tool is evaluated by use of a loaded double ball bar (LDBB) device. The device reproduces the real interaction between the join <b>system,</b> the <b>machine</b> tool elastic structure and the cutting process. This load is not equivalent to real cutting forces, {{but it does have}} a similar effect on the structure. This has been investigated both trough simulation and experimental work. It is possible to capture the process – ­machine interaction in a <b>machining</b> <b>system</b> by use of the model-based identification approach.
