40|$|In {{the known}} filling device, the {{handling}} unit is a distributor which is arranged {{at the bottom}} end of a vertical conveyor. It is borne by a carriage which travels along a bridge. Since the main components for automatic filling are easily accessible, there is the danger {{that they can be}} willfully or accidentally damaged. In order to protect the main components from accidental or willful damage, the handling unit is designed as a tank robot which is housed inside the tank island. The tank robot can reliably grab the <b>filler</b> <b>nozzle</b> by means of its grippers and easily guide it to the filler neck of any motor vehicle. The filling device is not only suitable for conveying fluid fuels but also for pressurized gases...|$|E

In conductive fillers, if approximately 15 – 20  % {{of the weight}} of Si can be replaced by that of Ag, as displayed in the EDX, the cost of precious metal conductive fillers can be reduced considerably. In addition to particle composition, we could confirm the particle size through PSD measurement, as demonstrated in Fig.  2 c. It displays that Ag–Si composite particles have a narrow distribution, an average size D 50 of approximately 800 – 900  nm and are completely dependent on Si matrix particles. This narrow distribution of conductive <b>filler</b> can prevent <b>nozzle</b> jam when a Ag–Si composite particle-based conductive ink is used for highly precise printed electronic devices (Mao et al. 2014).|$|R

[...] The converse {{is almost impossible}} because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of [...] which does not fit the [...] <b>filler,</b> and the <b>nozzles</b> are protected by a lock mechanism or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. The issue is not clear-cut as older diesels using completely mechanical injection can tolerate some gasoline — which has historically been used to [...] "thin" [...] diesel fuel in winter.|$|R
