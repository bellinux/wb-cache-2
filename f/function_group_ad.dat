40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} use of anchors with double and single-thread loading in the single-row Bankart arthroscopic procedure. METHODS: 252 {{patients}} (258 shoulders) underwent Bankart arthroscopic surgery with evaluation after a minimum follow-up of 2 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} a dexmedetomidine concentration, {{to be added}} to an alfaxalone-based bath solution, that will enhance the anaesthetic and analgesic effects of alfaxalone; and to compare the quality of anaesthesia and analgesia provided by immersion with either alfaxalone alone or alfaxalone with dexmedetomidine in oriental fire-bellied toads (Bombina orientalis). STUDY DESIGN Pilot study followed by a prospective, randomized, experimental trial. ANIMALS Fourteen oriental fire-bellied toads. METHODS The pilot study aimed to identify a useful dexmedetomidine concentration {{to be added to}} an anaesthetic bath containing 20  mg  100  mL(- 1) alfaxalone. Thereafter, the toads were assigned to one of two groups, each comprising eight animals, to be administered either alfaxalone (group A) or alfaxalone-dexmedetomidine (<b>group</b> <b>AD).</b> After immersion for 20  minutes, the toads were removed from the anaesthetic bath and the righting, myotactic and nociceptive reflexes, cardiopulmonary variables and von Frey filaments threshold were measured at 5  minute intervals and compared statistically between groups. Side effects and complications were noted and recorded. RESULTS In the pilot study, a dexmedetomidine concentration of 0. 3  mg  100  mL(- 1) added to the alfaxalone-based solution resulted in surgical anaesthesia. The toads in <b>group</b> <b>AD</b> showed higher von Frey thresholds and lower nociceptive withdrawal reflex scores than those in group A.

40|$|How {{effective}} are candidate, party, {{and interest}} <b>group</b> <b>ads</b> at conveying noticeable differ-ences between the Democratic and Republican Parties? Or at boosting preferences for the par-ties? There are two conflicting expectations; first, that ads from these three sponsors {{will have the}} same effect on citizen perceptions, under the assumption that viewers do not notice spon-sorship. The second expectation is that party ads have a stronger effect on perceived party differences (that is, at “building the party image”) than candidate and <b>group</b> <b>ads.</b> There have been very few empirical investigations into these common claims, however. I leverage a com-prehensive dataset that tracks political ads in the nation’s top media markets on surveys of U. S. voters in 2000 and 2004. The results demonstrate that sponsorship does matter, but not in ways that confirm the second expectation. When ads convey party distinctions, the effect comes from candidate ads (and to a lesser extent, from interest group ads); to that effect, party-sponsored ads almost never matter. 1...|$|R

MethodsSixty Sprague Dawley rats, weighing (300 ± 10) g, were randomly divided with 10 rats per group into a normal control <b>group,</b> <b>AD</b> model <b>group,</b> <b>AD</b> with cut olfactory nerve group, Xiu three-needle group, eugenol group, and combined acupuncture and eugenol <b>group.</b> The <b>AD</b> model was established by injection of amyloid β 1 - 40 (Aβ 1 - 40). Morris maze tests were conducted for evaluating the learning-memory ability. Content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the hippocampus were detected. ResultsThe average escape latency and the mean swimming distance in the normal control group, the Xiu three-needle group, the eugenol group, and the combined acupuncture and eugenol group were significantly shorter {{than those in the}} <b>AD</b> model <b>group</b> (all P 0. 05).

40|$|To {{separate}} functional from phylogenetic pelvic {{differences in}} Aves, seventy-seven birds were measured and statistically analyzed {{to define the}} characters that unite them into <b>function</b> <b>groups,</b> and to identify the characters that separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> from each other. Four Major <b>Function</b> <b>Groups</b> were identified: Birds of Prey (Chapter II) Waterbirds (Chapter III), Ground birds and Stalker-wader birds (Chapter V). Birds of Prey statistically separate into Air predators and Scavengers. Waterbirds statistically divide into Surface swimmers, Wing-propelled divers, and Foot-propelled divers. A suite of pelvic characters (Level One indicators) can separate nonpasseriformes birds into <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are: length to width ratio of the pelvis, iliac angle, relative iliac surface areas and pre-acetabular ilium proportions. A second suite of characters (Level Two indicators), used by themselves, shows trends, but do not completely separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are proportional length of lower leg components, and femur length: pelvis length ratio. Combining the identified characters in Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis produces a good split among the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> When all of the birds are combined into a single analysis (Chapter V), using Level one and Level Two characters, the plots generated have Stalker-wader birds at the center, with three groups radiating out. One arm is Ground Birds, another is Waterbirds, {{and the third is}} Birds of Prey. ^ Pelvic musculature dissections of a representative from each group are compared (Chapter VI). The picture drawn from the muscle data is different. The muscle data suggest that Ground Birds are the central group. Ground Birds (represented by a pigeon) have leg/pelvic muscles neither specialized for specific femoral movements, nor for specific tibiotarsal movements. No particular group of muscles is hypertrophied, and no major groups are reduced or missing. The other three <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> of birds show some degree of specialization, either by reducing or accentuating muscles, or by losing muscles completely. The result is a statistical portrait of four bird <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> that has implications for the sequence of morphological changes seen in avian radiations of the Tertiary. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study was to}} examine how music {{teachers}} can create a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic that benefits learning within an ensemble. The study was based on the following questions: (1) How can the leader of a group contribute to a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic? (2) Which ways of thinking and attitudes are beneficial to convey to the students? (3) Which are the most common social obstacles for a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic? The method of the study was qualitative. I chose to interview 4 music teachers from Norrbotten that teach at music school and Music University. The result showed that the group dynamic within an ensemble is affected by many different factors. The positive atmosphere, an accepting attitude, a humorous outlook on things, the ability to see se eachothers differences as assets and to have common goals emerged as important factors in creating a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic.
