5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, {{he did not see}} much of his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where he had gone to live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
25|$|He was {{enrolled}} at the University of Padua from 1308 to 1310 and studied letters, including rhetoric.

25|$|Edward Arthur Argent (6 February 1898 – 20 July 1968) was an English cricketer {{who played}} two {{first-class}} matches, both for Worcestershire {{in the space}} of a few days in 1928. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little success, taking no wickets from a total of 13 overs and making scores of 3, 0 and 19 with the bat.|$|E

25|$|Averroes (Ibn Rushd) is {{most famous}} for his commentaries on Aristotle's works and for writing The Incoherence of the Incoherence in which he defended the falasifa against al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers. While <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little {{influence}} in the Islamic world, which was then dominated by Avicennian philosophy and Ash'ari theology, Averroism became very influential in medieval Europe, especially among the Scholastics. Averroism {{eventually led to the}} development of modern secularism, for which Ibn Rushd is considered as the founding father of secular thought in Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Jackson {{was drafted}} {{in the second round}} by the New York Knicks. While he was a good {{all-around}} athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense. Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in 1973. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969–70 championship season due to spinal fusion surgery; however, he authored a book entitled Take It All, a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run.|$|E

25|$|Norman-Walker {{stayed in}} the Malawi {{government}} until 1965 when he was appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate in June. Before this appointment was made, the Protectorate had been steadily {{on the way to}} independence. The capital city of the Protectorate was relocated from South Africa's Mafikeng to the Protectorate's Gaborone in February 1965. A month later self-rule was granted to the Protectorate. Norman-Walker was the last Commissioner of the Protectorate and was there to prepare for the independence, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little to do in his short tenure. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the New Year Honours List of 1966 and he witnessed the independence of the Republic of Botswana on 30 September 1966.|$|E
25|$|Knott helped England win the Ashes in England in 1977 but {{had been}} persuaded by England {{colleague}} Tony Greig to join Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. This effectively put his England career on hold as the 'Packer players' were banned from Test cricket. When he returned to Tests {{after the end of}} World Series Cricket in 1980, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little success against a mighty West Indian side, averaging 5.14 in the series. He did not play in the tour of the West Indies that immediately followed, but was picked for the final two Tests of the famous 1981 Ashes series. Fittingly for one of England's greatest players, he ended his last Test against Australia at The Oval, with a score of 70 not out and an England series win.|$|E
25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic of the trend towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of the}} last century. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E

25|$|Rusk's {{mountaineering}} career {{took him}} all over the West Coast of the United States, beginning in 1889 and continuing to 1930. He met many other people on his many journeys; however, few people became close friends and learned about his personal life. The few who knew him described {{him as one of}} the most expert and daring mountaineers in the West. While Rusk had some close calls and got himself into some hair raising situations, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> few accidents while climbing and often saved others from extreme danger. He was not braggadocious about his exploits and in fact would only give the most matter-of-fact answers about them. He was known to be tenacious in his exploits, yet tempered by his good sense and consideration for others with him. Rusk was most familiar with Mount Adams, climbing it many times and exploring the area around it extensively.|$|E
25|$|A huge man, {{standing}} {{well over}} six feet tall and weighing more than 16 stone (102kg), Thompson was an excellent all-rounder. Despite his huge frame, his batting relied chiefly on a very watchful eye that made him a very hard man to dismiss when pitches were hard and firm. Though at times he would hit very hard, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little backlift and could play only a restricted range of strokes, and his size made him rather slow of foot and hence seldom likely to make many runs on the numerous rain-affected pitches of his day. As a bowler, he was above medium pace and could gain a great deal of spin, which made him respected when pitches were hard and frequently unplayable after rain or on a crumbling pitch. His large hands and long reach made him an excellent fieldsman at slip: in 1914 he achieved the unequalled feat of taking three catches off consecutive balls against Warwickshire.|$|E
25|$|At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Pereira {{finished}} 4th in the 200-meter individual medley, 8th in the 400-meter individual medley, and 19th in the 200-meter breaststroke. In the 400-meter individual medley, he {{qualified for}} the final {{with a time of}} 4:11.74, almost beating his South American record. But in the final, his time was 4 seconds slower; Pereira said that he felt tired in the change from the butterfly to the backstroke, not achieving the same efficiency as in the heats. After this, Pereira left the 4×200-meter freestyle relay team of Brazil to compete in the 200-meter breaststroke. He broke the South American record with a time of 2:11.40. His best mark in the race was 2:12.60 but his performance was not enough to advance to the semifinals. In the 200-meter individual medley, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> similar results in the heats, semifinals and finals, all near 1:58failing to beat his record from the 2007 Pan American Games. Phelps won the gold with a time of 1:54.23, setting a world record. Cseh and Lochte swam at 1:56, winning silver and bronze.|$|E
