5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
5|$|While the C9 {{project was}} well advanced, PSA {{already had a}} crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, {{including}} the legendary Citroën CX, the slow-selling Peugeot 604 and the newly launched Peugeot 505. But with so much having already been invested in the project, PSA decided to press ahead and complete the development of C9, albeit with modifications to allow the use of shared parts with other PSA models. The Simca <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> front suspension gave way to MacPherson struts adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear axle was replaced {{with that of the}} 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width. The C9 front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.|$|E
25|$|Both {{rear and}} front {{suspension}} were completely redesigned for the CSR. The front suspension has <b>double</b> <b>wishbone,</b> fully adjustable, inboard springs and dampers, improving aerodynamics. The rear suspension is also upgraded to a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone,</b> fully independent system, replacing the De Dion tube design.|$|E

25|$|The {{suspension}} setup {{was similar}} to the GTO's <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> setup, though many parts were upgraded and settings were changed; the unusually low ground clearance prompted Ferrari to include the ability to raise the vehicle's ground clearance when necessary.|$|E
25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> setup for the front suspension and independent rear suspension. Both {{the front and rear}} suspension systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), {{a method}} of {{controlling}} air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was {{also a part of}} the 7M-GE's technological arsenal.

25|$|Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> {{front and}} rear {{suspension}} systems. Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain was also an evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red.|$|E
25|$|The Model S has {{independent}} {{coil spring}} suspension {{on all four}} wheels front <b>double</b> <b>wishbone,</b> virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink. As an extra-cost option, the car is available with self-leveling, height-adjustable air suspension. This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{independent}} <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension {{was employed}} at all four corners. Another significant change {{made from the}} P61 design was to move the suspension shock absorber components outboard at the rear. This switch was initially made to accommodate the extra cam-cover space needed to employ the 32-valve motor, but though that unit was shelved the suspension geometry was retained. At the front, the coil spring and damper units were retained within the monocoque skin, resulting in a clean, aerodynamic profile around the car's nose-cone. Braking was by outboard-mounted, Dunlop disc brakes all round.|$|E

25|$|The third-generation RX's new {{transmission}} can lock-up its torque converter from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center locking differential, a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An Electric Power Steering (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> rear suspension setup replaces the previous MacPherson strut design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, <b>Double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E
25|$|Project Blueprint saw {{the chassis}} pick-up points, wheelbase, track and driving {{position}} become common across both manufacturers. The Holdens were now {{required to use}} <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> front suspension, {{similar to that of}} the Falcon, rather than the MacPherson struts used previously. The aerodynamic packages were comprehensively tested and revised and differences in the porting of each of the manufacturers' engines were also removed. The performance of the new Ford BA Falcon and Holden VY and VZ Commodores was fairly even for the next four years, with Ford winning the championship in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and Holden winning in 2006. Reverse-grid races were used at certain events in 2006 before unpopularity with the drivers, teams and fans saw them abolished halfway through the season.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} all {{contemporary}} Formula One designs, the FW30's basic architecture {{is built around}} a carbon fibre, aramid and honeycomb composite material monocoque. The design carries over the FW29's zero keel, <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension arrangement, along with the twin-pillar rear wing. The FW30's front wing is one {{area in which the}} design of the FW29 was not followed. In place of the older car's two-element wing a three-element design was introduced, similar to that used on the 2007 McLaren MP4-22. As with the McLaren design the Williams wing's upper element features a central section that is raised up and passes over the tip of the car's, slightly lower, nose cone. However, unlike the McLaren, the FW30's front wing is suspended from the nose cone using the forward element.|$|E
25|$|The Terrex AV81 is an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8×8 {{wheeled chassis}} and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It {{is designed to}} be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side {{at the back of the}} hull propel the vehicle through water at 10km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally.|$|E
25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then retain the wheel nuts and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|E

500|$|The Mk.9 was {{designed}} around the FIA's Group 6 regulations for sports prototypes, {{allowing for a}} completely custom mid-engine layout that was only limited in terms of engine sizes available to competitors. [...] Closed cockpit bodywork with gullwing doors {{was designed}} by Bob McKee to shroud the mid-engine layout. [...] Standard <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension with coil springs were used with disc brakes on each wheel.

500|$|Pace {{presented}} {{two options}} {{to replace the}} pulpitum which {{was not part of}} the cathedral restoration done earlier by Pritchard. One was for a baldacchino having four columns with a suitable painting beneath it. The other was for a <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> arch topped by a hollow drum to house the division of the organ. The figure of [...] "Christ in Glory" [...] would be installed on the west face of the drum. This proposal was accepted by the Dean and the cathedral chapter. They approached the War Damage Commission about whether funds initially meant for replacement of stained glass damaged in the bombing could be used for art in other media. This permission helped to finance the Majestas figure.|$|E
500|$|The J2X-C used <b>double</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension, with {{push-rod}} actuated {{coil springs}} over dampers {{at both ends}} of the car; the front suspension was mounted on the carbon-fibre monocoque, whilst the rear suspension was mounted to a carbon-fibre sub-structure that had been designed to allow quick transmission replacement.
