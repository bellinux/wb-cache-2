In court, Cleland disavowed the novel {{and said that he}} could only [...] "wish, from my Soul," [...] that the book be [...] "buried and forgot" [...] (Sabor). The book was then officially withdrawn. It was not legally published again for over a hundred years. However, it continued to sell well in pirated editions. In March 1750, Cleland produced a highly bowdlerised version of the book, but it too was proscribed. Eventually, the prosecution against Cleland was dropped and the <b>expurgated</b> <b>edition</b> continued to sell legally.|$|E

60|$|I have {{suffered}} {{in that way}} myself. I have had relatives killed in that way. One was in Chicago years ago--an uncle of mine, just as good an uncle as I have ever had, and I had lots of them--yes, uncles to burn, uncles to spare. This poor uncle, full of patriotism, {{opened his mouth to}} hurrah, and a rocket went down his throat. Before that man could ask for a drink of water to quench that thing, it blew up and scattered him all, over the forty-five States, and--really, now, this is true--I know about it myself--twenty-four hours after that it was raining buttons, recognizable as his, on the Atlantic seaboard. A person cannot have a disaster like that and be entirely cheerful the rest of his life. I had another uncle, on an entirely different Fourth of July, who was blown up that way, and really it trimmed him as it would a tree. He had hardly a limb left on him anywhere. All we have left now is an <b>expurgated</b> <b>edition</b> of that uncle. But never mind about these things; they are merely passing matters. Don't let me make you sad.|$|E
6000|$|The evil {{influence}} in Burns's life {{may be only}} suggested. It leads [...] first to the tavern, to roistering and dissipation, to [...] entanglements in vulgar love affairs; then swiftly {{to the loss of}} a [...] splendid poetic gift, to hopeless debts, to degrading poverty, to [...] an untimely death. Burns had his chance, if ever poet had it, after [...] the publication of his first book (the famous Kilmarnock edition of [...] 1786) when he was called in triumph to Edinburgh. There he sold [...] another edition of his poems for a sum that seemed fabulous to a [...] poor crofter; whereupon he bought a farm and married his Jean [...] Armour. He was acclaimed throughout the length and breadth of his [...] native land, his poems were read by the wise and by the ignorant, [...] he was the poet of Scotland, and the nation, proud of its gifted [...] son, stood ready to honor and follow him. But the old habits were [...] too strong, and Burns took the downhill road. To this element of [...] dissipation we owe his occasional bitterness, railing and [...] coarseness, which make an <b>expurgated</b> <b>edition</b> of his poems essential [...] to one who would enjoy the reading.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} sweated not only {{out of my}} pleuritic fever, but out of all my eating cares, and {{the better part of}} my brains (strange coincidence!), by aconite. I have that {{peculiar}} and delicious sense of being born again in an <b>expurgated</b> <b>edition</b> which belongs to convalescence. It will not be for long; I hear the breakers roar; I shall be steering head first for another rapid before many days; NITOR AQUIS, said a certain Eton boy, translating for his sins a part of the INLAND VOYAGE into Latin elegiacs; and from the hour I saw it, or rather a friend of mine, the admirable Jenkin, saw and recognised its absurd appropriateness, I took it for my device in life. I am going for thirty now; and unless I can snatch a little rest before long, I have, I may tell you in confidence, no hope of seeing thirty-one. My health began to break last winter, and has given me but fitful times since then. This pleurisy, though but a slight affair in itself was a huge disappointment to me, and marked an epoch. To start a pleurisy about nothing, while leading a dull, regular life in a mild climate, was not my habit in past days; and it is six years, all but a few months, since I was obliged to spend twenty-four hours in bed. I may be wrong, but if the niting is to continue, I believe I must go. It is a pity in one sense, for I believe the class of work I MIGHT yet give out is better and more real and solid than people fancy. But death is no bad friend; a few aches and gasps, and we are done; like the truant child, I am beginning to grow weary and timid in this big jostling city, and could run to my nurse, even although she should have to whip me before putting me to bed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series of}} {{published}} diaries that made their appearance starting in 1966 are now {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "expurgated" [...] editions.

50|$|Jouvancy edited a {{large number}} of school editions of Latin authors, {{including}} Terence, Horace, Juvenal, Persius, Martial, the Metamorphoses of Ovid and the philosophical writings of Cicero, such as De Officiis, Cato Major and Laelius. The text was revised for school use, supplied with footnotes and sometimes a paraphrase, all in Latin. These <b>expurgated</b> <b>editions</b> were frequently reissued well into the 19th century, both in France and other countries. Jouvancy's Institutiones poeticae, published in 1718 and often reprinted, was another work intended for use in teaching. A number of editions also appeared of his Novus apparatus graeco-latinus, cum interpretatione gallica. This work, based on Isocrates, Demosthenes, and the leading Greek authors, was intended to encourage the cultivation of the mother tongue, as well as the study of the two classical languages. Jouvancy also delivered many orations and eulogies, for example on Louis XIV, his family, and his government, on the churches of Paris and the French nation. These were published in two volumes and from 1701 frequently reprinted.|$|R

25|$|At first, {{inclusion}} in the Index meant total prohibition of a text; however, this proved not only impractical and unworkable, but also contrary to the goals of having a literate and well-educated clergy. Works with one line of suspect dogma would be prohibited in their entirety, despite {{the remainder of the}} text's sound dogma. In time, a compromise solution was adopted in which trusted Inquisition officials blotted out words, lines or whole passages of otherwise acceptable texts, thus allowing these <b>expurgated</b> <b>editions</b> to circulate. Although in theory the Indexes imposed enormous restrictions on the diffusion of culture in Spain, some historians, such as Henry Kamen, argue that such strict control was impossible in practice and that there was much more liberty in this respect than is often believed. And Irving Leonard has conclusively demonstrated that, despite repeated royal prohibitions, romances of chivalry, such as Amadis of Gaul, found their way to the New World with the blessing of the Inquisition. Moreover, with the coming of the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, increasing numbers of licenses to possess and read prohibited texts were granted.|$|R
60|$|It is {{deserving of}} remark and censure that American {{literature}} is become shockingly moral. There {{is not a}} doubt of it; our writers, if accused, would make explicit confession that morality is their only fault--morality in the strict and specific sense. Far be it from me to disparage and belittle this decent tendency to ignore the largest side of human nature, and liveliest element of literary interest. It has an eminence of its own; {{if it is not}} great art, it is at least great folly--a superior sort of folly to which none of the masters of letters has ever attained. Not Shakspeare, nor Cervantes, nor Goethe, nor Molière, nor--no, not even Rabelais--ever achieved that shining pinnacle of propriety to which the latter-day American has aspired, by turning his back upon nature's broad and fruitful levels and his eyes upon the passionate altitudes where, throned upon congenial ice, Miss Nancy sits to censure letters, putting the Muses into petticoats and affixing a fig-leaf upon Truth. Ours are an age and country of <b>expurgated</b> <b>editions,</b> emasculated art, and social customs that look over the top of a fan.|$|R

5000|$|When The Mint finally {{achieved}} general {{publication in}} 1955 {{there were two}} editions, the <b>expurgated</b> <b>edition</b> and a limited edition containing the full uncensored text. The delay in publication and sensitivity surrounding the full text mainly concerned its barrack-room language (i.e., lots of [...] "four-letter words") and frank references to bodily functions, which some people might still find offensive.

5000|$|Published in 1993, This is the {{continuation}} of the story begun in Henry and June, exposing the shattering psychological drama that drove Nin to seek absolution from her psychoanalysts for the ultimate transgression. This portion of Nin's diary, which was cut from the <b>expurgated</b> <b>editions</b> published in her lifetime, records her steamy love affair with Henry Miller in Paris, but here her intense adoration gives way to disillusionment. She describes Miller as crude, egotistic, imitative, childishly irresponsible, [...] "a madman." [...] Her real focus, however, is her father, Joaquin Nin, a Spanish pianist and aristocratic Don Juan who seduced her after a 20-year absence. Her graphic account of their lovemaking and of her incestuous romantic feelings is fairly shocking. Nin sought absolution from her psychiatrist and lover, Otto Rank, who advised her to bed her father, then dump him as punishment for abandoning her when she was 10. Nin's ornate, hothouse prose is much rawer than the chiseled style of the expurgated diaries. She seethes with jealousy at Miller's wife June, swoons over poet and actor Antonin Artaud, neglects her protective husband, Hugh Guiler, and describes her traumatic delivery of a stillborn child. Her extraordinary, tangled self-analysis is a disarming record of her emotional and creative growth.|$|R

60|$|With authority, {{punishment}} {{will pass}} away. This {{will be a}} great gain--a gain, in fact, of incalculable value. As one reads history, not in the <b>expurgated</b> <b>editions</b> written for school-boys and passmen, but in the original authorities of each time, one is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment, than it is by the occurrence of crime. It obviously follows that the more punishment is inflicted the more crime is produced, and most modern legislation has clearly recognised this, and has made it its task to diminish punishment as far as it thinks it can. Wherever it has really diminished it, the results have always been extremely good. The less punishment, the less crime. When there is no punishment at all, crime will either cease to exist, or, if it occurs, will be treated by physicians as a very distressing form of dementia, to be cured by care and kindness. For what are called criminals nowadays are not criminals at all. Starvation, and not sin, is the parent of modern crime. That indeed is the reason why our criminals are, as a class, so absolutely uninteresting from any psychological point of view. They are not marvellous Macbeths and terrible Vautrins. They are merely what ordinary, respectable, commonplace people would be if they had not got enough to eat. When private property is abolished there will be no necessity for crime, no demand for it; it will cease to exist. Of course, all crimes are not crimes against property, though such are the crimes that the English law, valuing what a man has more than what a man is, punishes with the harshest and most horrible severity, if we except the crime of murder, and regard death as worse than penal servitude, a point on which our criminals, I believe, disagree. But though a crime may not be against property, it may spring from the misery and rage and depression produced by our wrong system of property-holding, and so, when that system is abolished, will disappear. When each member of the community has sufficient for his wants, and is not interfered with by his neighbour, it will not be an object of any interest to him to interfere with anyone else. Jealousy, which is an extraordinary source of crime in modern life, is an emotion closely bound up with our conceptions of property, and under Socialism and Individualism will die out. It is remarkable that in communistic tribes jealousy is entirely unknown.|$|R
