500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
2500|$|A {{foreign-born}} {{woman and}} usurper of the Russian throne, Catherine the Great held no legitimate {{claim to the}} crown. Her sole connection with the house of Romanov derived from her marriage to the late Emperor, Peter III, whose murder she was widely known to have orchestrated. The royals who held genealogical claims to the throne overtly devised plots to replace the new Tsarina. Both Ivan VI and Paul I, armed with supporters, threatened Catherine's rule, {{as well as the}} guards who possessed the military might to overthrow the Empress. In a letter to Voltaire on September 21, 1762, Catherine acknowledged the conspirators and potential traitors all around her: [...] "Every guardsman when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> can say: 'I made that woman.'" [...] A shrewd politician, Catherina also knew she needed the support of the Court, the public, and other powerful regimes in order to maintain power, suppress rebellion, and emerge as a leading world power.|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{seen that}} he had got it in the neck, right enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when I came away! I said: 'I s'll {{have to go}} now, Walter, {{because of}} the train--and the children.' And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It seems hard." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a minute, then winked his eye.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with fond, {{dark eyes}} and smiled incredulously.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{makes me}} suspect that I {{need to be}} reclaimed," [...] said Miss Vane, [...] "when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with those {{beautiful}} honest eyes of his." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{makes no}} answer, but <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with eyes that are {{positively}} baleful, {{and in the}} instant I read his mute but mulish resolve that Utopia must end.|$|E
6000|$|... "'That's true,' says Gran'dad, holdin' himself in. Then <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> an' back to Ned, an' says: 'I can't see ye here. Where ye stoppin'? At the Kenton house?' ...|$|E
60|$|The boy whistled softly. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with wide-open eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mabane {{showed no}} sign of annoyance. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> composedly.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wading {{agreed to}} the alteration. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Compeyson, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very noticing, and I look at him. He has a {{watch and}} a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a {{handsome}} suit of clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master Harry {{starts up}} {{and looks at}} his pa. Such is the honor of that mite, that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> too, to see whether he has brought me into trouble.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{more than}} half believe he speaks the truth. Upon my word I do,' said Varden. 'Do you see how <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{as if he knew}} what I was saying?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in keen surprise. He {{was evidently}} taken aback.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> stolidly. Apparently <b>he</b> {{thought that}} silence was wisest.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a half-suppressed pity, {{and shook}} his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I meet old Ezra Stowbody on the street. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like {{he wants}} me to {{remember}} he's a highmuckamuck and worth two hundred thousand dollars, and he says, 'Uh, Bjornquist----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa is so stern with me. Of {{course he}} has given way, and of course I am grateful. But <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as though I had done {{something}} to be forgiven." ...|$|E
60|$|P.S.--Here is ---- perpetually flitting about Brydges Street, and {{hovering}} in the neighbourhood, with a veil of secrecy drawn down over his chin, so ludicrously transparent, that I can't help laughing while <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a {{singular}} expression in his ironical eyes.|$|R
60|$|I insulted him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in {{slow and}} smiling surprise.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grooten {{raised his}} eyes to mine. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> steadily.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he marched}} me and Tobin {{to the back}} room of a saloon, and ordered the drinks, and laid the money on the table. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and Tobin like {{brothers}} of his, and we have the segars.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't let him hit me! Oh, please don't let him hit me! I've {{been hit}} cruel to-day because I {{spoke to a}} man. Don't let him {{look at me like}} that! He's reg'lar wicked, that one. Don't let him look at me like that, neither! Oh, I feel as if I hadn't nothing on when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like that!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gosh {{blame them}} darned mules," [...] says Straw-top, {{in a voice}} so good that I nearly apologized; [...] "they're a'lus bustin' loose." [...] And then <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> close, and then {{he takes off his}} hayseed hat, and says, in a {{different}} voice: [...] "I'd like to shake hands with Parleyvoo Pickens, the greatest street man in the West, barring only Montague Silver, which you can no more than allow." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> doubtfully, then started, {{and looked}} with a changed expression.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> seriously now, a cold glitter in {{his small}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sharply, wondering, maybe, at {{the fresh}} tone I took.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it will be}} such a {{bother to}} {{have to talk about}} it. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and is such an idiot. Then Augusta frowns. When I see Augusta {{frowning}} I am so angry that I feel like boxing her ears. Do you know, Lucy, that I often think that it will not do, and that I shall have to be sent away. I wish it had been you that they had chosen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{some time}} I hesitated {{how to change}} it. Then one day I came here to see my friend Giatron--we came {{together}} from Italy. I hand him the note. I ask him please change. He give me the change and I stay {{to have a drink}} with the head waiter, who is a friend of mine. Presently Giatron comes out. He calls me into the office. Then I begin to tremble. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and I tremble more.|$|E
60|$|The man still {{stares at}} me. He asks if he shall find some one to carry my bag. I decline to let anybody be disturbed. He {{inquires}} if I have any messages {{to leave for}} my friend. I inform him that I have left written messages upstairs for Sir James and the landlord. Upon this he draws the bolts and opens the door. To the last <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if he thought I was mad.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with that}} queer {{expression}} of mirth he sometimes has.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and laughed, {{but that}} laugh was uncommonly like a snarl.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} in reproach at the levity of my question.|$|R
