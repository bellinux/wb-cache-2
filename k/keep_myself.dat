500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write {{material for a}} new release while on tour promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to <b>keep</b> <b>myself</b> busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when I finished the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E

It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was {{involved}} in, as hinted {{in the opening}} couplet: [...] "I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me". Though Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave, or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue (e.g. in guitarist Peter Asher's bedroom). McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: [...] "In our world the guy had {{to have some sort}} of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to <b>keep</b> <b>myself</b> warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, {{news outlets}} and music journalists from pre-release {{listening}} events for Channel Orange {{raised questions about}} certain songs' lyrics and Ocean's sexuality. The lyrics addressed a male object of love and deviated from the heterosexual perspective of his past songs. Scrapping his original plan of including it in the album's liner notes, Ocean published a TextEdit file as an open letter through his Tumblr blog on July 4. Originally written in December 2011, it recounted his unrequited feelings for a man when he was 19 years old, citing the experience as his first love. Ocean's disclosure was received with support from Def Jam and praise from other recording artists and cultural commentators. He also remarked on writing Channel Orange after years of emotional struggle with the experience, stating in the letter, [...] "I wrote to <b>keep</b> <b>myself</b> busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to <b>keep</b> <b>myself</b> interested." ...|$|E

Mangan and Ashfield had previously worked together early in their careers, providing voices for an animated series of Watership Down. Ashfield claimed that on set, she [...] "struggled to keep a straight face most of the time." [...] She also said that her part made her more aware of her health. She {{said in an interview}} with The Times that she hoped the show would make, [...] "people think twice about binge drinking."

2500|$|Jacques Pierre Louis Rivette {{was born}} in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, France to André Rivette and Andrée Amiard, into a family [...] "where {{everyone}} is a pharmacist". According to childhood friend André Ruellan, Rivette's father was a skilled painter who loved opera. His younger sister said that their home in Rouen was next to a movie theater, where she remembered watching Pathé Baby's Felix le Chat cartoons with Rivette and their grandparents. Rivette, educated at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille, said that he briefly studied literature at university [...] "just to <b>keep</b> <b>myself</b> occupied". Inspired by Jean Cocteau's book about the filming of La Belle et la Bête, Rivette decided to pursue filmmaking and began frequenting ciné-clubs. In 1948, he shot his first short film, Aux Quatre Coins, in Rouen's Côte Sainte-Catherine section. The following year, he moved to Paris with friend, Francis Bouchet, because [...] "if {{you wanted to make}} films it was the only way". On the day of his arrival, he met future collaborator Jean Gruault, who invited him to see Les dames du Bois de Boulogne at the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin. Éric Rohmer, whose film criticism Rivette admired, gave a talk at the screening.|$|E
