500|$|The Norwegian Public Safety Network ( [...] {{literally}} <b>Emergency</b> <b>Network)</b> is {{a public}} safety network system based on Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA). Nødnett is implemented by the Directorate for Emergency Communication (...) [...] The network is primarily used for internal and interdisiplinary communication by the police, fire departments and health services. Nødnett is also [...] used by several organisations participating in rescue and emergency work. [...] Planning of the network started in 1995 and in 2006 the contract to build it was awarded to Nokia Siemens Networks. As Nokia Siemens Networks was unable to complete the contract, it was passed on to Motorola Solutions in 2012. The critical infrastructure of Nødnett was finished and was operational in all districts of mainland Norway by December 1, 2015.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{reliability}} of complex <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>networks,</b> as reliability is crucial to reducing environmental and public health losses in post-accident emergency rescues. Such networks’ statistical characteristics are analyzed first. After the connected reliability and evaluation indices for complex <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>networks</b> are effectively defined, simulation analyses of network reliability are conducted under two different attack modes using a particular <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>network</b> as an example. The simulation analyses obtain the varying trends in emergency supply times and the ratio of effective nodes and validates the effects of network characteristics and different types of attacks on network reliability. The results demonstrate that this <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>network</b> is both a small-world and a scale-free network. When facing random attacks, the <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>network</b> steadily changes, whereas it is very fragile when facing selective attacks. Therefore, special attention should {{be paid to the}} protection of supply nodes and nodes with high connectivity. The simulation method provides a new tool for studying <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>networks</b> and a reference for similar studies...|$|R

Finally, we take three classical <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>networks</b> as examples, and through emulation analysis we obtain the connecting reliability changing situation of these three networks under random attack, the changing curve of the ratio of effective demand nodes and emergence supply mileage of <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>network</b> with same network density but different forms, and then evaluate the <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>network</b> connecting reliability. This can provide references for the designing of <b>emergency</b> logistics <b>network</b> with high reliability and analysis means for research in other fields...|$|R

The urgent requirements and {{high standards of}} responsiveness in terms of emergency management depend on horizontal and vertical communication since this is of the main factors associated with the appropriate coordination of many essentially independent organisations.

This work consists of a theory-based empirical study. It is qualitative in nature and the research method is based on both desk research and field research.
