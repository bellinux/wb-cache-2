25|$|Canada's {{economy is}} {{closely linked to}} that of the United States, and {{economic}} conditions south of the border tend to quickly make their way north. Canada's stock markets were especially hard hit by the collapse <b>in</b> <b>high-tech</b> stocks. For much of the 1990s the rapid rise of the TSX had almost wholly been attributed to two stocks: Nortel and BCE. Both companies were hard hit by the downturn, especially Nortel, which was forced to lay off much of its workforce. The events of September 11 also hurt the Canadian stock markets and were especially devastating to the already troubled airline sector.|$|E
25|$|From the 1920s to the 1960s, {{the state}} was {{dominated}} by the Byrd Organization, with dominance by rural counties aligned in a Democratic party machine, but their hold was broken over their failed Massive Resistance to school integration. After World War II, the state's economy thrived, with a new industrial and urban base. A statewide community college system was developed. The first U.S. African-American governor since Reconstruction was Virginia's Douglas Wilder in 1990.

25|$|Although Cisco was not {{the first}} company to develop and sell {{dedicated}} network nodes, {{it was one of the}} first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols. Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades. Some popular models of that time (such as Cisco 2500) managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged—a rarity <b>in</b> <b>high-tech</b> industry. Although Cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment, the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with new, high-capacity product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500.|$|E

25|$|The city {{entered a}} recent period of {{economic}} recovery and prosperity {{in the late}} 1990s, aided by a strong recovery in oil prices and further economic diversification. While oil production and refining remains the basis of many jobs in Edmonton, the city's economy has managed to diversify significantly (e.g., an explosion <b>in</b> <b>high-tech</b> jobs). Downtown Edmonton {{and parts of the}} inner city, after years of extremely high office vacancy rates and neglect, have recovered to a great degree, with office vacancy rates in downtown Edmonton at 5.0%. The downtown area is still undergoing a renaissance of its own, with further new projects underway or about to become reality and more people choosing to live in or near the downtown core (although suburban sprawl is still growing significantly).|$|E

25|$|Fremont {{became more}} industrialized between 1953 and 1962. A boom <b>in</b> <b>high-tech</b> {{employment}} in the 1980s to the late 1990s, especially in the Warm Springs District, caused rapid development {{in the city and}} linked the city with the Silicon Valley. The Apple factory where the first Mac computer was manufactured was located in Fremont (production ceased in 1993). Other semiconductor and telecommunications firms soon opened in the city, including Cirrus Logic, Asyst Technologies, Mattson Technology, Lam Research, Premisys Communications, and Nextlink California. Approximately 750 high tech companies had offices, headquarters or production facilities in Fremont by 1999. These firms included fifteen of the top one hundred fastest-growing public companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and eighteen of the top fifty companies in the East Bay.|$|E

The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live <b>in</b> <b>high-tech,</b> solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge.

The New York Times hailed the exhibition as [...] "one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade", despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution [...] "a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work".

2500|$|However, {{although}} Devine accepts that anti-Catholic attitudes {{do exist}} {{in some areas}} of Scotland, especially in West Central Scotland, he has argued that discrimination against Catholics in Scotland's economic, social and political life is no longer systematic in the way it once was. Devine cited survey and research data collected in the 1990s which indicated that there was little difference in the social class of Catholics and non-Catholics in contemporary Scotland, and highlighted increased Catholic representation in politics and the professions, describing the change as a [...] "silent revolution". Devine has suggested that a number of factors are responsible for this change: radical structural changes in the Scottish economy, with the decline of manufacturing industries where sectarian prejudices were ingrained, the increase of foreign investment <b>in</b> <b>high-tech</b> industry in Silicon Glen and the post-war expansion of the public sector, the construction of the welfare state and growth of educational opportunities, which provided avenues for social mobility, and increased interfaith marriages among Catholics.|$|E
2500|$|Rabin {{significantly}} reformed Israel's economy, {{as well as}} its {{education and}} healthcare systems. His government significantly expanded the privatization of business, moving away from the country's traditionally socialized economy. The scheme was described by Moshe Arens as a [...] "privatization frenzy." [...] In 1993, his government set up the [...] "Yozma" [...] program, under which attractive tax incentives were offered to foreign venture capital funds that invested in Israel and promised to double any investment with government funding. As a result, foreign venture capital funds invested heavily in the growing Israeli high-tech industry, contributing to Israel's economic growth and status as a world leader <b>in</b> <b>high-tech.</b> In 1995, the National Health Insurance Law was passed. The law created Israel's universal health care system, moving away from the traditionally Histadrut-dominated health insurance system. Doctors' wages were also raised by 50%. Education spending was raised by 70%, with new colleges being built in Israel's peripheral areas, and teachers' wages rising by one-fifth. His government also launched new public works projects such as the Cross-Israel Highway and an expansion of Ben Gurion Airport.|$|E
