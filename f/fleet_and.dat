5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines.

The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} be able to defeat the Ionian <b>fleet</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

50|$|Motorola Type I Is the {{original}} type of Motorola's Trunked radio system; {{it is based}} on <b>Fleets</b> <b>and</b> Subfleets.

The distribution of <b>Fleets</b> <b>and</b> Subfleets on a Type I system is determined by the system Fleetmap. Motorola Type I systems are not scalable because they limit the amount of IDs any fleet or subfleet can support. Each Type I ID appears as a three or four digit number, followed by a hyphen, followed by a one or two digit number (example 200-14).|$|R
