Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class.</b> Common forms of aversive social situations include, {{but are not limited}} to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.|$|E
25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance behaviors. For instance, a student may leave the room when talking <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior {{in order to preserve}} self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable shaking. A fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E

Stacey follows T.J. and the others follow Stacey. Mr. Morrison finds them fighting and separates them, much to the Wallace's anger. Instead of telling their mother, Morrison leaves Stacey to do it himself. Stacey tells her and she takes the children to visit the Berrys. Mr. Berry is badly burned, gruesomely disfigured and mute. Mama explains that the Wallaces are responsible for this {{and that is why}} they are never to go near Wallace's store again.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked {{a turning point}} in his career. The {{screenplay}} originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams. On its release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the [...] "smart and touching screenplay", while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it [...] "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry". Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that Affleck brought [...] "a beautifully nuanced tenderness" [...] to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as [...] "dreamlike": [...] "It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!'" [...] He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.|$|E

Cugliero soundly berated Dominic <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and Dominic bore this silently. [...] The following day, the true culprits were discovered. On being asked why he had remained silent, Dominic replied that he had thought that he would be let off with a scolding whereas the other boys might have been expelled. Dominic added that Jesus had remained silent when blamed unjustly and {{that he was trying to}} imitate him. Mary Reed Newland, in her book, suggests that, since Dominic was yet to meet John Bosco, this incident is indicative of the upbringing his parents had given him.|$|E

2500|$|His father {{remarried}} {{and moved}} to the West Bronx, where Garfield joined a series of gangs. Much later, he would recall: [...] "Every street had its own gang. That's the way it was in poor sections... the old safety in numbers." [...] He soon became a gang leader. At this time, people started to notice his ability to mimic well-known performers, both physically and facially. He also began to hang out and eventually spar at a boxing gym on Jerome Avenue. At some point, he contracted scarlet fever (it was diagnosed later in adulthood), causing permanent damage to his heart and causing him to miss a lot of school. After being expelled three times and expressing a wish to quit school altogether, his father and step-mother sent him to P.S. 45, a school for difficult children. It was under the guidance of the school's principal—the noted educator Angelo Patri—that he was introduced to acting. Noticing Garfield's tendency to stammer, Patri assigned him to a speech therapy class taught by a charismatic teacher named Margaret O'Ryan. She gave him acting exercises and made him memorize and deliver speeches <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> and, as he progressed, in front of school assemblies. O'Ryan thought he had natural talent and cast him in school plays. She encouraged him to sign up for a citywide debating competition sponsored by the New York Times. To his own surprise, he took second prize.|$|E

2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip walk up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>class</b> was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that they are not going to see the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E
