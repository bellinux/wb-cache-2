40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} modelling the spatio-temporal spread of {{foot and mouth disease}} through feral animal and unfenced livestock populations. We used a susceptible-infected-recovered model, implemented in a cellular automata framework, to assess the spread of FMD across two regions of Queensland, Australia. Following a sensitivity analysis on the infectious states, scenario analyses were conducted using <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>only</b> as the susceptible population, and then with the addition of livestock, and initiated in the wet season and in the dry season. The results indicate that, depending on the season the outbreak is initiated, and without the implementation of control measures, an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease around Winton could continue unchecked, while an outbreak around Cape York may die out naturally. The approach explicitly incorporates the spatial relationships between the populations through which the disease spreads and provides a framework by which the spread of disease outbreaks can be explored through varying the model parameters. It highlights the emergence and importance of spatio-temporal patterns, something that previous modelling of FMD in feral animal and unfenced livestock populations has lacked...|$|E

40|$|<b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> (Sus scrofa) are {{an exotic}} {{ungulate}} {{which have been}} widely introduced worldwide with multiple ecosystem and economic consequences. The author conducted a semi-comprehensive literature review directed at identifying {{the current state of}} knowledge related to the effects of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on island and mainland plant and animal communities. Also, the author describes the situation in California where <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> that were introduced in the late 1700 s are now widespread due to hunting-related introductions and natural range extensions. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on predator-free oceanic islands are a serious conservation problem because they attain high densities and have contributed to near-extinctions and extinctions of multiple endemic plants and vertebrates. In mainland ecosystems, however, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> can have both positive and negative effects depending on the local circumstances. Rooting, for example, can have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of some trees, soils and soil processes, and the distribution of native and exotic grasses. In general, however, the negative effects of rooting by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> are amplified when population densities are high. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> may compete with native species for limited resources, but there are limited data relevant to this hypothesis. Based on observations of small amounts of animal matter in their diets, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> eat terrestrial vertebrates and eggs of ground nesting birds, but the importance of predation by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on native vertebrates is poorly known. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> also may have important indirect effects in mainland ecosystems by providing a new prey base for native predators which may then increase. In areas of Europe with extant wolf (Canis lupus) populations, wild boar (Sus scrofa) are an important prey species which may be facilitating numerical and geographic recoveries of wolves. Because wild boar are important prey for endangered Amur tigers (Panthera tigris), they are considered important for recovering tiger populations. In Australia, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> are potentially important prey for dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo); whereas, in the United States, endangered Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi) consumed 23 % to 59 % <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> and mountain lions (Felis concolor) in Texas and California consumed 5 % to 38 % <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> Research needs for <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> include quantitatively assessing: 1) how acorn foraging by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> limits or influences regeneration of oaks (Quercus sp.); 2) the competitive effects of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on native species; 3) whether direct predation by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> suppresses small vertebrate populations; and 4) how the availability of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> as prey influences native predator populations...|$|R

Tree ferns are an important understory component in many forests facilitating {{the establishment of a}} variety of species. However, the extent and effects of <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage to tree ferns, and associated impacts on plant community regeneration, are largely unknown. We quantified the effect that <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage has on tree fern growth, survival, and epiphytic woody seedling abundance over 1 year on 438 randomly selected tree ferns of three endemic species (Cibotium chamissoi, Cibotium glau-cum, and Cibotium menziesii) in a Hawaiian montane wet forest with high tree fern and <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> densities. Across all tree fern species, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> damaged 13 % of individuals over 1 year. Compared with undamaged tree ferns, moderately- to heavily-damaged individuals had decreases of 4 to 27 % in trunk length increment and lost tenfold more fronds. Tree fern angle (standing, leaning, prone, or semi-prone) and woody seedling abundance co-varied with <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage. Specifically, damaged tree ferns were more often prone or semi-prone and supported more seedlings, but also had annual mortality up to 34 % higher than undamaged tree ferns. Overall, <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage had substantial negative effects on tree ferns by reducing growth and survival. Given the importance of tree ferns as regeneration sites for a variety of native plants, <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage to tree ferns will likely alter future forest composition and structure.

40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is a soil-borne plant {{pathogen}} that causes dieback, {{a disease that}} devastates many native vegetation ecosystems in Australia, particularly in south-west Western Australia. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> have long been implicated as vectors in the spread of this introduced {{plant pathogen}} due to their contact with infested soil and foraging habits.

40|$|Introduction: Humans {{who have}} {{close contact with}} livestock, wild or feral animals can risk {{acquiring}} zoonotic infections such as brucellosis, Q fever, and leptospirosis. Human infection with Brucella suis (swine brucellosis) usually follows occupational or recreational exposure to infected animals. Worldwide, many cases of human infection follow contact with infected <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> In Australia {{there is a growing}} market for the export of 'wild boar' and a considerable number of people are involved in <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunting. However, <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunters are often hard to reach with health strategies. According to Australian authorities the most important means of preventing disease in humans includes covering cuts; wearing gloves; washing hands; and avoiding blood when coming into contact with <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> There has not been an evaluation of the acceptability of these recommended risk-reduction strategies in the settings where <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunting and evisceration occurs. Methods: Semi-structured interviews and small focus groups were conducted with <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunters in north-west New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to explore their hunting experiences and views on the brucellosis prevention strategies. Interview and focus group notes were thematically analysed. Results: There was a range of experiences of <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunting, from a very professional approach to a purely recreational approach. The main domains that emerged from participants experiences during their most recent <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunting activity and their reflections on current swine brucellosis risk reduction strategies were: you've gotta be tough to be a <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunter; most of the suggested strategies won't work as they are; reducing risk in the scrub; and how to let pig hunters know. The recreational nature and prevailing macho perspective of participants demand a pragmatic approach to risk reduction if it is going to prove acceptable to <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunters. The 'you've gotta be tough to be a <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunter' context of the activity and the reality that many <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunters participate with little preparation and a 'just keep going' approach, may counteract currently recommended risk-reduction strategies. The alternate strategies that emerged from the interviews need to be tested in the real activity, especially evisceration in the scrub (at the site of slaughter). But the following ideas were grounded in the participants experiences: take more time and watch your hands when making cuts; have good lighting; take care when cutting near a sow's uterus; use latex gloves to cover cuts on hands. Conclusions: Swine brucellosis is a zoonosis of concern for <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunters in many parts of Australia, including north-west NSW. Many of the current strategies {{to reduce the risk of}} brucellosis did not appear appropriate or acceptable to the <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> hunters interviewed. More acceptable strategies when eviscerating, such as taking more time, watching hands when cutting, ensuring good lighting, being careful in the vicinity of the uterus and using a latex glove to cover cuts and abrasions on hands need to be field tested. Further development of the food safety regulations is required to also support zoonosis risk reduction strategies...|$|R

40|$|Inter-specific {{competition}} {{is considered one}} of the main selective pressures affecting species distribution and coexistence. Different species vary in the way they forage in order to minimize encounters with their competitors and with their predators. However, it is still poorly known whether and how native species change their foraging behavior in the presence of exotic species, particularly in South America. Here we compare diet overlap of fruits and foraging activity period of two sympatric native ungulates (the white-lipped peccary, Tayassu pecari, and the collared peccary, Pecari tajacu) with the invasive <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> (Sus scrofa) in the Brazilian Pantanal. We found high diet overlap between white-lipped peccaries and <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> but low overlap between collared peccaries and <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> Furthermore, we found that <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> may influence the foraging period of both native peccaries, but in different ways.

40|$|Abstract The ‘globalisation’ {{of plants}} and animals has been {{assisted}} by the move of international communities towards free trade and globalisation. Internationalisation of business and commensurate improved means and speed of transport has resulted in humans, animals and plants moving around the world, sometimes intentionally and in other cases as unintended hitchhikers. Pest animals introduced into new environments without natural balances can result in high costs to the economy into which they are introduced. Whilst prevention of entry of feral pests is desirable, their presence imposes a need for control. Resource allocation issues arise concerning whether eradication is desired, and if so, whether it is technically feasible and economically justified. If an eradication strategy is not selected, the question arises as to what level of management and which control instruments should be applied to pest populations. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> a well-established <b>feral</b> pest in Australia introduced by early colonists, cause crop and environmental damage necessitating control costs to landholders and public land management agencies. The research problem addressed in this thesis was ‘What is the optimal control strategy, including instruments and intensity, for <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> in the horticultural cropping area of tropical north Queensland?’ In examining this research problem the following research questions are examined: ‘What is the cost of the sugar cane and banana crop damage caused by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> in north Queensland’; ‘What are the current <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> management techniques utilised by north Queensland banana and cane farmers and what are the success rates and costs associated with the management techniques utilised?’; ‘What is the damage cost to the environment caused by feral pigs?’; ‘Is regional eradication in north Queensland technically feasible and is it economically preferable to the maintenance expenditure incurred in living with the continued presence of feral pigs?’ and ‘What is the optimal control strategy for <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> by stakeholders in the horticultural crop areas in the Wet Tropics of north Queensland?’ Addressing the research problem and questions necessitated a literature review to comprehend the economic nature of the problem associated with <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> This required examination of legislation that affects <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> management and hence a landholder’s property rights. Obligations imposed and restrictions placed on landholders with respect to <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> management have commensurate costs. Alternative modelling techniques and research approaches were assessed and it was decided that a form of cost-benefit analysis – estimation of the damage cost and control cost trade-off curve for alternative control strategies – would be utilised. This necessitated the development of the bio-economic simulation <b>Feral</b> <b>Pig</b> Management Model (FPMM). The types, nature and effectiveness of the control instruments and control tools and their respective costs were examined to determine the appropriate controls for <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> management in the Wet Tropics of north Queensland. A case study in the Wet Tropics of horticultural crop damage and <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> control involving 11 banana and 19 sugar cane farms was undertaken in conjunction with Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) officers. The horticultural crop damage from the case study farms was subsequently used, together with other data, to estimate damage for the Wet Tropics region {{with the aid of a}} Geographic Information System (GIS). For the broader socio-economic study, the damage that <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> cause to the environment was examined. To compare control strategies for <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> the author developed the FPMM using Excel and visual basic coding. The model was developed with continuing consultation with a number of people involved in <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> management, and was presented to a number of <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> experts for validation purposes, specifically with respect to model assumptions, most likely parameter values and alternative <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> control strategies. The FPMM permitted alternative strategies to be ranked in terms of the lowest present value of damage and control costs combined, and the optimal strategy to be identified. A damage cost and control cost trade-off curve was developed permitting the optimal strategy to be identified. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the affect changes to parameter values had on the strategy ranking. The analysis revealed that eradication of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on a national or regional level is highly unlikely to be achieved and would incur unacceptable costs. The highest ranking strategies – having the lowest present values of aggregate <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage and control costs over a 20 -year planning horizon – involved regular control intervention, at a relatively high intensity. There are still substantial gaps in the information available to undertake a comprehensive socio-economic analysis of the <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> and <b>feral</b> pest problem in general in Australia and various useful further research studies can be identified. For example, research into the carrying capacity of the Wet Tropics (feral pigs/km 2) and whether the carrying capacity changes from one season to the next is required. Carrying capacity is a critical factor because it creates a ‘ceiling’ or upper limit below which an unmanaged <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> population would fluctuate.

One formulation (TX 1) produced mean mortality rates of 50 %, which was well below our stated goal of 90 %. Bait acceptance and mortality were diminished by insufficient masking of sodium nitrite. However, results indicate that our sodium nitrite formulation improved acceptance and mortality rates in <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> and could be the basis for improvements. Future investigations will focus on masking the taste of sodium nitrite...|$|R
40|$|Context. The {{expansion}} of <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> populations across the United States {{has increased the}} occurrence of damage and damage complaints. Newtechniques are needed to more effectively manage <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> damage, including the development of fertility control agents. Aims. We aimed to assess the ovotoxic properties of ERL- 4221 as a candidate fertility control agent for <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> Methods. We conducted two palatability trials to determine ERL- 4221 acceptance and one experimental trial with ERL- 4221 at the captive wildlife facility of Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University-Kingsville during 2008. Our experimental trial had three treatments, a control containing no ERL- 4221, baits containing 16. 0 mg ERL- 4221 kg– 1 bodyweight for 10 days, and baits containing 16. 0 mg ERL- 4221 kg– 1 bodyweight for 20 days. Key results. Final body mass, total ovary mass, number of follicles and number of corpora lutea did not differ between treatments. Conclusions. We did not find it efficacious to orally deliver ERL- 4221 to <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> to reduce fertility. Oral delivery is the most practical, cost-effective means of delivering fertility control agents to <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> and development of additional fertility control strategies are needed. Implications. Unless ovotoxic effects of ERL- 4221 can be identified in <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> along with a successful means of administration, other fertility control strategies {{may need to be}} explored, such as oocyte-secreted proteins that regulate follicular development...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{efforts have}} been made to {{identify}} the most effective practices for the control and management of invasive vertebrate pest species, such as the <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> (Sus scrofa). We investigated the demographics, abundance, and molecular ecology of a persecuted <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> population that was subjected to control. We then applied methodologies to determine if we could retrospectively quantify any changes in the population structure or dynamics of these <b>pigs.</b> <b>Feral</b> <b>pig</b> demographic and abundance parameters indicated that in this population of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> there were very few detectable changes between the two aerial culling years. We observed this despite environmental conditions being optimal for control. Genetic results indicated that pigs culled in the latter 2004 cull were genetically identical to those pigs that inhabited the area a year earlier. The genetic population was geographically larger than the sample area. These findings indicate that the recovery in <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> density witnessed in the controlled area was not a result of reinvasion from a separate, genetically distinct population, but rather, it was the result of reinvasion from <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> outside the study area but within the same genetic population. Importantly, we were unable to detect any recent genetic bottlenecks. This approach has considerable potential for auditing the effectiveness of control programs of pest species and assessing the feasibility of impacting upon or locally eradicating many other free-ranging pest species...|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{many regions}} {{in the world where}} wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are threatened, in Australia they are a {{significant}} invasive species. As such, the molecular ecology of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> was investigated to understand their social and population genetic structure. Samples from 269 adult animals were collected over their distribution in southwestern Australia. Using 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we identified 7 inferred <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> populations that had moderate heterozygosity (mean = 0. 580) and displayed a high level of differentiation (mean RST = 0. 180). In revealing the genetic structure of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> we detected anomalies in the putative origin of some individuals. Samples from these animals were collected from 2 main areas: recently colonized regions that were previously uninfested, and established <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> populations, where animals from geographically isolated areas had been introduced. In the latter, these corresponded to areas that were in close proximity to public road access and towns. Given the large distances immigrants were found from their population of origin (from 50 to > 400 km), the generally low levels of dispersal of southwest <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> and the grouping and sex of these pigs, we suggest that these individuals have been deliberately and illegally translocated to supplement recreational hunting stocks. Additionally, we could not detect any genetic contribution in these <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> from domestic pig herds, suggesting that the deliberate release of domestic <b>pigs</b> to restock <b>feral</b> populations is relatively uncommon. Our molecular data allowed some inferences regarding the success or lack thereof of current management practices, and offered considerable insights into the dynamics of the <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> populations and identification of “new” approaches that may allow for better control of this highly destructive species...|$|R
25|$|In Hawaii {{the seeds}} are {{dispersed}} by frugivorous animals. By {{far the most}} important disperser in Hawaii is the <b>feral</b> <b>pig,</b> which eats the fallen fruit and passes the seeds intact. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> seek out the fruit and when P. tarminiana occurs with <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> in Hawaii, the seeds are abundant in pig droppings. Germination is not enhanced by gut passage but pigs disturb the ground making a more favourable environment for germination of P. tarminiana. Because their home range is typically one to two square miles, pigs contribute more to the peripheral expansion of P. tarminiana patches than long distance dispersal.|$|R
