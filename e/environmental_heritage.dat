2500|$|Aesthetically, the {{appearance}} of Caves House, with its roots in English provincial building practice, is a contrast to the mountainous landscape of the remote Jenolan Valley, its massive limestone arches and craggy cliffs. [...] As the building {{is the work of}} a prominent colonial architect, who was influential in the development of Australian architecture, Caves House attains significance by association. [...] Historically, Caves House illustrates the considerable human activity and ingenuity necessary to provide accommodation {{in the early days of}} Australian tourism, in buildings especially designed for this purpose. [...] Vernon had to employ innovative methods to address problems posed by a major building project in a remote setting. Also, Caves House was built to service one of the earliest protected sites of natural <b>environmental</b> <b>heritage</b> in the world, declared a protected area by the New South Wales government in 1866. Lighting and sewage developments dating from the late 1880s are of significant historical importance, as they were crucial to the development of the remote area as a tourist destination. [...] Caves House has the research potential to provide archaeological evidence about the early development of New South Wales tourism. Along with the caves, it is a rare example of the development of mountain and cave tourism in New South Wales. [...] Also, of historical significance is the fact that in 1889, to provide electricity for the caves (and later, Caves House) Australia's first hydro-electricity plant was built nearby.|$|E
