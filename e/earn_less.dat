Humanities graduates also earn more as their careers progress; ten years after graduation, the income difference between humanities graduates and graduates from other university programs is no longer statistically significant. Humanities graduates can earn even higher incomes if they obtain advanced or professional degrees.|$|E

25|$|Females tend to live {{five years}} longer; i.e. their funds need to {{last five years}} longer than men's funds.

25|$|In November 1909, the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA), {{holder of}} the Stanley Cup and ostensibly the {{pre-eminent}} ice hockey league, {{was in the}} midst of a dispute. The Montreal Wanderers team of the ECHA had been bought by P. J. Doran, owner of the Jubilee Rink in Montreal and he intended to move the team's games there. The Jubilee was smaller than the Wanderers' current rink, the Montreal Arena which meant visiting teams would <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> on their trips to play the Wanderers. On November 25, 1909, the other teams in the league disbanded the ECHA and formed the new Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), which excluded the Wanderers.|$|E

In Lima 18% were level E, 32.3% level D, 31.7% level C, 14.6% level B and 3.4% level A.

25|$|Cirio Del Monte Kenya owns a 10,000-acre (40km²) {{pineapple}} plantation and employs approximately 6,000 workers (2006 estimate). Approximately 60% of {{the workforce}} is female (2004 estimate). The company employs three types of employees: permanent staff, seasonal workers and casual laborers. Permanent staff receive sick pay, holidays, rental assistance, severance pay and have a contract. Seasonal workers <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> and do not receive severance pay, although {{they also have a}} contract. Casual labourers receive no benefits and are not covered by a contract. All compensation is aligned with Kenya's governmental laws that mandate a minimum wage of approximately 2,800 Kenyan shillings a month (2004 figures). The company's pineapple plantations are patrolled by security guards on horseback that utilise dogs, or in Jeeps.|$|E
25|$|Growing {{inequality}} {{is confirmed}} by Statistics New Zealand which keeps track of income disparity using the P80/20 ratio. This ratio shows the difference between high household incomes (those in the 80th percentile) and low household incomes (those in the 20th percentile). The inequality ratio increased between 1988 and 2004, and decreased until {{the onset of the}} Global Financial Crisis in 2008, increasing again to 2011 and then declining again from then. By 2013, the disposable income of high-income households was more than two-and-a-half times larger than that of low-income households. Highlighting the disparity, the top 1% of the population now owns 16% of the country's wealth – the richest 5% owns 38% – while half the population, including beneficiaries and pensioners, <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> than $24,000.|$|E

25|$|More {{women are}} living in poverty due {{to changes in the}} {{traditional}} family structure. The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E
25|$|Women tend to <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> {{than men}} {{in almost all}} industries, {{including}} government and academia. Women {{are less likely to}} be hired in highest-paid positions. The data showing the differences in salaries, ranks, and overall success between the genders is often claimed to be a result of women's lack of professional experience. The rate of women's professional achievement is increasing. In 1996, the salaries for women in professional fields increased from 85% to 95% relative to men with similar skills and jobs. Young women between the age of 27 and 33 earned 98%, nearly as much as their male peers. In the total workforce of the United States, women earn 74% as much as their male counterparts (in the 1970s they made 59% as much as their male counterparts).|$|E
25|$|The {{failure to}} resolve a wage dispute taken to the National Mediation Board in 1948 led to a 91-day work {{stoppage}} that spring. The dispute was resolved by increasing both fares and wages, though the company's employees continued to <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> than their counterparts at other area railroads. Simultaneously, a decline in rail travel began as initial postwar shortages of automobiles ended. These national trends—coupled with the lost revenue from the three-month strike {{and the effects of}} the strike-settling wage increase—created serious passenger revenue losses for the line. In 1949, the railroad sought to curtail some of its more unprofitable services. Dining car service (other than that on the Electroliners) was dropped, service (particularly on the Shore Line) was reduced, and the railroad applied unsuccessfully to drop Shore Line service altogether.|$|E

When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, {{income is}} {{a key factor in}} PC and Internet access. Access rates between the lowest and highest {{brackets}} range from country to country within the OECD –from 3 times more likely to 10 times more likely. The latest CNNIC survey indicates that 65 percent of China's Internet users earn an annual income of more than 6000 yuan; in contrast, the users who <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> than 6000 Yuan annually only share 15 percent of total Internet use. Although the non-income users do share 20 percent of Internet use, this fact may not undermine the importance of income because this 20 percent is more likely to represent students who usually receive a high living subsidy from their parents. Study of telephone subscription of farm households in rural China also proves that farm households with higher annual incomes are more likely to subscribe to a telephone than are low-income-level farm households.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{possible}} explanations for why newcomers <b>earn</b> <b>less</b> than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the labour productivity of immigrants is lower, and employers thus have reason to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to offer the same salary as to a native. Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than native-born Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than native-born Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than native-born Canadians.|$|E
