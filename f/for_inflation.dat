5|$|The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 {{effectively}} made possession or {{transfer of}} marihuana illegal throughout the United States under federal law, excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an excise tax on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 adjusted <b>for</b> <b>inflation)</b> for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 adjusted <b>for</b> <b>inflation)</b> for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 adjusted <b>for</b> <b>inflation)</b> for industrial users. Detailed sales logs {{were required to}} record marihuana sales. Selling marihuana to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 adjusted <b>for</b> <b>inflation)</b> per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} a two-parameter family of excited states within slow-roll <b>inflation</b> <b>for</b> which either the corrections to the two-point function or the characteristic signatures of excited {{states in the}} three-point function - i. e. the enhancement for the flattened momenta configurations- are absent. These excited states may nonetheless violate the adiabaticity condition maximally. We dub these initial states of inflation calm excited states. We show that these two sets do not intersect, i. e., those that leave the power-spectrum invariant can be distinguished from their bispectra, and vice versa. The same set of calm excited states that leave the two-point function invariant <b>for</b> slow-roll <b>inflation,</b> do the same task <b>for</b> DBI <b>inflation.</b> However, {{at the level of}} three-point function, the calm excited states whose flattened configuration signature is absent <b>for</b> slow-roll <b>inflation,</b> will lead to an enhancement <b>for</b> DBI <b>inflation</b> generally, although the signature is smaller than what suggested by earlier analysis. This example also illustrates that imposing the Wronskian condition is important for obtaining a correct estimate of the non-Gaussian signatures...|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments <b>for</b> <b>inflation,</b> but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities.
