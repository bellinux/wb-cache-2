500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a gas or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise.</b> This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E
2500|$|According to the biographer of Gobe Matenge, {{a former}} Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, {{he was one}} of several civil {{servants}} – including the future vice president Peter Mmusi – that compelled the Motswana government to adopt [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] as the anthem of the independent nation. [...] In order to ascertain the opinion of the general public on the matter, the government transmitted all of the contending hymns over Radio Botswana. [...] However, Matenge's group was able to obtain recordings of these songs for themselves and air them in front of quasi-town hall gatherings held in major settlements like Lobatse, Molepolole, and Mafikeng, in addition to the capital Gaborone. [...] They strategically played [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] as the last song – which in theory would increase the likelihood that the audience would remember the tune – while having their organisers add words of praise for it in an attempt to sway the crowd's opinion in favour of that hymn. [...] At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise,</b> they would circulate a boilerplate form letter articulating the author's viewpoint of [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] being their favourite candidate for national anthem. [...] This was done because of the low levels of literacy in Botswana at the time. [...] Of the multitude of letters sent to the Department of Information and Broadcasting, {{the vast majority of them}} expressed an inclination towards the aforementioned song.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908 he {{returned}} to sea {{in command of the}} new dreadnought battleship HMS Bellerophon, the second of the new class of ships being created by Fisher. Bellerophon joined the Home Fleet commanded by Admiral Sir William May, who had once been Evan-Thomas' commander when onboard Ramillies. During fleet exercise in 1909, Bellerophon was given the task of [...] 'fast scout', for the red fleet. On one day, she detected a group of four cruisers from the opposing red fleet, and was duly deemed to have sunk them, to the congratulations of all, including newspapers reporting the events. However, the next day trying to repeat the coup, Bellerophon instead emerged from mist to find six opposing battleships. This was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> for Evan-Thomas. In April 1910, Bellerophon played host to trials of a new 'director firing system' devised by Percy Scott. The intention of the system was to control all main guns on the ship together, from a vantage point high on the ship, where an enemy could best be seen. Firing all guns simultaneously meant that the shells would fall at the same time, and the position of the splashes compared to an enemy vessel would give a good idea of how to correct the aim for the next shot. Evan Thomas was not impressed by the system, which ultimately proved essential in extending the range at which effective attacks on an enemy could be made. At the time, conventional wisdom in the fleet suggested a range of 8,000 yards was a reasonable distance to open fire, but in the forthcoming war, successful actions took place at more than twice this range, with the advantage going to the side who could fire accurately first.|$|E

The 432nd's participation was to fly four EW sorties with AQM-34V vehicles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The squadron deployed from Davis-Monthan with three DC-130 launch planes with four drones uploaded on each, three CH-3 MARS recovery helicopters, a TPW-2 Ground Director and a minimum of ground-handling equipment and spares. Two additional DC-130 aircraft were flown in from Davis-Monthan with spares for the launch planes, and a third came in at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> to transport the Ground Director back home. The EW mission for the exercise was to lay a chaff corridor at 3,000 feet MSL while heading toward the coastline. The two drones, flying two minutes apart in trail formation, were then climbed to 19,000 and 20,000 feet MSL respectively, where they took up an active jamming orbit. The drones were followed by an E6A [...] or EB-57 aircraft which also dispensed chaff and provided EW active jamming through the chaffed corridor. The operation clearly demonstrated TAC's philosophy of sending in the decoy drones first to protect the manned jammers and fighter planes to follow.' Gene Juberg's field report concluded, stating that all objectives of the meet were met with unqualified success from the performance of the AQM-34V.

50|$|Aerobic {{exercise}} provokes {{a systemic}} cytokine response, including, for example, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-10 (Interleukin 10). IL-6 was serendipitously discovered as a myokine {{because of the}} observation that it increased in an exponential fashion proportional {{to the length of}} exercise and the amount of muscle mass engaged in the exercise. This increase is followed by the appearance of IL-1ra and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In general, the cytokine response to exercise and sepsis differs with regard to TNF-α. Thus, the cytokine response to exercise is not preceded by an increase in plasma-TNF-α. Following exercise, the basal plasma IL-6 concentration may increase up to 100-fold, but less dramatic increases are more frequent. The exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6 occurs in an exponential manner and the peak IL-6 level is reached at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> or shortly thereafter. It is the combination of mode, intensity, and duration of the exercise that determines the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6.|$|E

A follow-up of 3 and 6 months was also accessed. The individuals performed <b>the</b> <b>exercises</b> twice a week for 8 weeks (in September/October 2013). Local and phone sessions were made by the physiotherapist for assessing the compression and execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domiciliary <b>exercises.</b> Adherence was measured by records made by the participants. Assessment includes TUG (mobility), SF- 12 (health condition), IPAQ (physical activity levels) and MMSE (cognitive condition). Results: One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communities perform <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> program in a community space, with high team spirit and strong adherence. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program that participants had improvement their health condition, mobility and increase their physical activity levels. Conclusion: Perform an exercise program on community revealed high levels of participant's adherence to <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> and introduced changes to the home [...] based program, improving the participation...|$|R
500|$|Called [...] "Naval Air Station, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, {{navigation}} problem No. 1," [...] <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> involved {{three different}} legs, {{but the actual}} flight should have flown four. After take off, they flew on heading 091° (almost due east) for [...] until reaching Hen and Chickens Shoals where low level bombing practice was carried out. The flight was to continue on that heading for another [...] before turning onto a course of 346° for , in the process over-flying Grand Bahama island. The next scheduled turn was to a heading of 241° to fly [...] at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> was completed and the Avengers would turn left to then return to NAS Ft.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{present study}} was to assess <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> a 12 -week aerobic and muscular {{strength}} training program on selected dance performance and fitness-related parameters in modern dance students. <b>The</b> sample consisted <b>of</b> 32 men and women (age 19 +/- 2. 2 years) who were randomly assigned into exercise (n = 19) and control (n = 13) groups. Anthropometric and flexibility assessments, treadmill ergometry, strength measurements, and- on a separate day-a dance technique test were conducted pre- and postexercise training in both groups. After <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program, <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> group revealed significant increases in dance (p < 0. 02), VO(2) max (p < 0. 04), flexibility (p < 0. 01), and leg strength (p < 0. 001) tests compared to controls. It is concluded that in modern dance students (a) a 3 -month aerobic and strength training program has positive effects on selected dance performance and fitness-related parameters, (b) aerobic capacity and leg strength improvements do not hinder dance performance as studied herein, and (c) the dance-only approach does not provide enough scope for physical fitness enhancements...|$|R
