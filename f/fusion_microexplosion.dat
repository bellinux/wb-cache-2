5000|$|One {{propulsion}} {{method for}} a crewed spacecraft {{could be a}} <b>fusion</b> <b>microexplosion</b> nuclear pulse propulsion system, like that proposed in Project Daedalus [...] that may allow it to obtain an interstellar cruising velocity of up to 10% {{of the speed of}} light. However, if the ship is capable of transits requiring hundreds of thousands of years, chemical and gravitational slingshot propulsion may be sufficient.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} design is presented for an unmanned probe to Alpha Centauri with a planned launch {{early in the}} 21 st century. The probe would be assembled at the space station and take approx. 100 yrs to reach the nearest star. Several technologies must be developed in order for this mission to be possible. A pulsed <b>fusion</b> <b>microexplosion</b> drive with 1, 000, 000 secs of specific impulse is the primary enabling technology. A large, long life fission reactor with 300 kW power output is also required. Communications lasers would use a 0. 532 micrometer wavelength since there is minimal power output by the stars in that frequency band. A laser with an input power of 250 kW would allow for a data rate of 1000 bits per second at maximum range. There are 3 types of information to be gathered by the probe: properties of the interstellar medium, characteristics of the three star Alpha Centauri system, and astrometry...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} here investigates {{the phenomenon of}} shock wave propagation in gas continuous, two-phase media. The motivation for this work stems from the need to understand blast venting consequences in the HYLIFE inertial confinement fusion (ICF) reactor. The HYLIFE concept utilizes lasers or heavy ion beams to rapidly heat and compress D-T targets injected {{into the center of}} a reactor chamber. A segmented blanket of falling molten lithium or Li{sub 2 }BeF{sub 4 } (Flibe) jets encircles the reactor`s central cavity, shielding the reactor structure from radiation damage, absorbing the fusion energy, and breeding more tritium fuel. X-rays from the <b>fusion</b> <b>microexplosion</b> will ablate a thin layer of blanket material from the surfaces which face toward the fusion site. This generates a highly energetic vapor, which mostly coalesces in the central cavity. The blast expansion from the central cavity generates a shock which propagates through the segmented blanket - a complex geometry, gas-continuous two-phase medium. The impulse that the blast gives to the liquid as it vents past, the gas shock on the chamber wall, and ultimately the liquid impact on the wall are all important quantities to the HYLIFE structural designers...|$|E
