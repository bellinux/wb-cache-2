They are this way for a similar reason: They are both very mobile and hard to kill." [...] D.Va was also noted to take more damage than other tank characters when facing multiple opponents in the game due to her lack of a shield. Goodman attributed this along with her low damage output to the character balancing developed into Overwatch developers, stating, [...] "every character in the game has strengths and weaknesses, it's {{part of what makes}} the teamplay work well." [...] Goodman revealed that early in her development, D.Va was able to deal more damage, but that this damage output was lowered because [...] "the way that played out is that she would fly into someone's face, destroy them, and fly away. There was little that person could do because of her mobility." [...] Despite agreeing with feedback calling D.Va underpowered, Goodman expressed that improvements to the character [...] "are unlikely to take the shape of increasing her damage output significantly," [...] adding that [...] "the goal is that she should be a viable aggressive initiation tank, much like Winston can be." [...] The discussion of buffing D.Va came {{at the same time as}} a discussion on nerfing the character McCree, who had been noted to eliminate tank characters too quickly; game director Jeff Kaplan explained that D.Va buffs would take longer to develop and implement. Kaplan did however detail that the development team would be exploring improvements to her damage output and survivability, although would only [...] "probably pick one direction or the other." [...] Eventually, her ultimate ability was buffed, with the cost and <b>explosion</b> <b>delay</b> being reduced, in addition to the removal of the possibility for the activating player to be killed by their own ultimate ability. Her [...] "Defense Matrix" [...] ability was also changed to be toggled on and off at will with a resource meter, rather than being a single-use ability with a cooldown.|$|E

40|$|I use recent {{observational}} {{and theoretical}} studies of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to further constrain the viable SN Ia scenarios and {{to argue that}} there must be a substantial time delay between the end of the merger of the white dwarf (WD) with a companion or the end of mass accretion on to the WD and its terminal explosion. This merger/accretion to <b>explosion</b> <b>delay</b> (MED) is required to allow the binary system to lead to a more or less spherical explosion and to prevent a pre-explosion ionizing radiation. Considering these recent results and the required MED, I conclude that the core degenerate scenario is somewhat more favorable over the other scenarios, followed by the double degenerate scenario. Although the single degenerate scenario is viable as well, it is less likely to account for common (normal) SN Ia. As all scenarios require substantial MED, the MED has turned from a disadvantage of the core degenerate scenario to a challenge that theory should overcome. I hope that the requirement for a MED will stimulate the discussion of the different SN Ia scenarios and the comparison of the scenarios to each other.

40|$|AbstractEmulsified fuel {{remains a}} {{potential}} solution {{to meet the}} increasingly stringent emission regulations for internal combustion engines due to its capability of simultaneously reducing NOx and particular matter (PM). In this study, emulsified diesels with 10 % and 20 % water by volume were studied. The stability of the water emulsified diesel was first investigated {{in terms of the}} hydrophilic-lipophilic-balance (HLB) value. Based on the stability test, a suitable surfactant composition for the diesel/water interfacial condition was given and the separation tendency of the fuel with different water volumetric ratio was analyzed. The emulsions were later injected and combusted in a pre-burn type constant volume chamber, which is able to provide high ambient temperature and pressure to mimic real engine operation conditions. High speed imaging was used to capture the spray and combustion process under various conditions. Results show longer initial liquid penetration for emulsified diesel under low ambient temperatures. Longer ignition delay of emulsified diesel also provided more air/fuel mixing time, thus significantly lowering the soot luminosity. Although droplet micro-explosion has been intensively studied, its behavior in a burning spray is much less reported. This study in particular focused on micro-explosion in a burning spray. Broadband natural flame images were recorded with intentional overall over-exposure such that the central lift-off region could be illuminated by soot incandescence. Puffing and disruptive droplet combustion was consistently observed at high ambient temperature in the central lift-off region with emulsified diesel indicating the occurrence of micro-explosion in a burning spray flame. It is demonstrated that micro-explosion is not only able to enhance the secondary breakup, but also affect the primary breakup under certain conditions, which to the author’s awareness has not been reported in any previous literature. Lower injection pressure and higher ambient temperature favor the occurrence of micro-explosion before primary breakup as a competition between the micro <b>explosion</b> <b>delay</b> time and the primary breakup time...|$|E
40|$|A two-part {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate ignition of hypergolic propellants. The first part focused upon {{development and implementation}} of fundamental and phenomenological sub-models to describe system-level processes that lead to ignition. Propellant injection, jet formation, atomization, vaporization, and chemical reaction were considered. Sub-models were completed to handle the propellant feed system hydraulics, the vaporization of the injected droplets, and predicting ignition. The second part involved the development of an experiment to isolate and study the effect of liquid-liquid contact on hypergolic ignition under a controlled environment. The hypergolic ignition of droplets of monomethyl hydrazine, 2 -Azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine, N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethylethylene- 1, 2 -diamine, a blend of 2 -Azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine and N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethylethylene- 1, 2 -diamine, 1 -Butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium dicyanamide, and a solution of sodium borohydride and triglyme with approximately 600 µL of red fuming nitric acid that formed a convex meniscus in a quartz tube were investigated using a controlled descent under a nitrogen environment. Ignition was only observed for monomethyl hydrazine and the solution of sodium borohydride and triglyme. Thin filament pyrometry with an infrared camera was employed as a novel technique to measure the temperature of the near flame field of monomethyl hydrazine and red fuming nitric acid combustion with maximum temperatures recorded around 1600 K. Using an unrestrained, approximately 100 µL pool of red fuming nitric acid, the influence of monomethyl hydrazine fuel droplet size and fuel droplet impact velocity on <b>explosion</b> <b>delay</b> time, ignition delay time, and radiation energy released prior to ignition was explored. For the parameters explored (fuel droplet diameters on the order of 2 to 5 mm, impact velocities on the order of 10 to 300 m/s, and Weber numbers on the order of 0. 01 to 10), impact velocity and Weber number were statistically significant predictors of explosion and ignition delays. The radiation energy released from an explosion prior to ignition was determined to be independent of fuel droplet size and impact velocity. Although many more tests need to be run to better determine trends of the highly stochastic droplet impact and hypergolic ignition events, it is obvious that liquid-liquid reactions {{play an important role in}} hypergolic ignition. ...|$|E

There are four predictions in our model: (i) superluminous SNe optical lightcurves should show a double-hump with the SN hump at weaker magnitudes occurring days to weeks before the QN; (ii) Two shock breakouts should be observed vis-a-vis one for a normal SN. Depending on the time delay, this would manifest as two distinct spikes in the X-ray region or a broadening of the first spike for extremely short delays; (iii) The QN deposits heavy elements of mass number A> 130 at the base of the preceeding SN ejecta. These QN r-processed elements should be visible in the late spectrum (few days-weeks in case of strong ejecta mixing) of the superluminous SN; (iv) The QN yield will also contain lighter elements (Hydrogen and Helium).

Using two different nuclear equations of state (EoSs), a soft version of the Lattimer & Swesty EoS and the significantly stiffer Wolff & Hillebrandt EoS, we found no prompt <b>explosions,</b> but instead <b>delayed</b> <b>explosions,</b> powered by neutrino heating and the neutrino-driven baryonic wind which sets in about 200 ms after bounce. The models eject little nickel ( 0. 46, which suggests a chemical composition that is not in conflict with galactic abundances. No low-entropy matter with Ye << 0. 5 is ejected. This excludes such explosions as sites of a low-entropy r-process. The low explosion energy and nucleosynthetic implications are compatible with the observed properties of the Crab supernova, and the small nickel mass supports the possibility that our models explain some subluminous Type II-P supernovae.
