5|$|Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and {{although}} he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> smear campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Murrill {{described}} the variety flaviceps from collections made growing on magnolia wood in Gainesville, Florida. Although he originally <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new species, Volvaria flaviceps, Robert Shaffer {{considered it a}} variety of V.bombycina. Variety microspora was first described in 1953, was later (1961) named by R.W.G. Dennis; variety palmicola was originally described as a distinct species Volvaria palmicola by Belgian mycologist Maurice Beely in 1928, and later as a variety of V.bombycina by the same author in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, al-Jamri {{married his}} cousin's granddaughter, Zahra' Yousif Atiya al-Jamri, who was 16 at the time.

They had 10 children together: 7 sons and 3 daughters. One of their sons is Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor-in-chief of Al-Wasat newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Indicud is {{the third}} studio album by American hip hop {{recording}} artist Kid Cudi. The album was released on April 12, 2013, by Republic Records. It was the first album of Cudi's solo career to not be an installment of his Man on the Moon series. The album's cover artwork was designed by Kid Cudi himself, who also served as an executive producer of Indicud. It was Cudi's goal to make more uptempo and positive music with the album. He <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> completely new format compared to his previous albums.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their {{previous}} experience in recording production while making The Way I See It. Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques {{in an attempt}} to recreate the Motown music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album draws on the Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.|$|E
5|$|Terang Boelan was a {{commercial}} success {{in both the}} Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 Straits dollars in British Malaya. This success revived the faltering domestic film industry and inspired films aimed at Malay audiences in Malaya, creating a formula of songs, beautiful scenery and romance that was followed for decades afterwards. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{turning point in the}} history of Indonesian cinema for its catalytic effect on the industry's growth. Like many Indonesian films of the era, Terang Boelan has been lost since at least the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup {{continues to be a}} difficult issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union would go on to describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E

5|$|William Murrill in 1909 {{placed the}} {{species in the}} genus Suillellus, while Sanshi Imai {{transferred}} it to Tubiporus in 1968. Tubiporus has since been synonymized with Boletus. In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete he found in Florida; although he originally <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of B.frostii, he later considered {{the differences between the}} taxa significant enough to warrant publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species. Following recent molecular studies that outlined a new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{praised the}} manga for its {{creativity}} and <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quintessential shōjo manga, {{as well as}} a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the Seiun Award for Best Manga in 2001. The anime television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers. The artwork in the anime was also a focus of attention, described as above average for a late-1990s TV series, and Sakura's magic-casting scenes were complimented for being nearly unique because of the regular costume changes. The anime television series won the Animage Grand Prix award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of Cardcaptors, however, was heavily panned by critics for cutting out character backgrounds essential to understanding the plot.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive {{decided on}} {{standard}} types of signs {{to be used}} at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E

5|$|Its {{writing was}} {{consistently}} praised by reviewers. The narrative was considered deep, successfully using White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade content. Eurogamer {{said that it}} had the best script the website had ever seen in a video game, and others <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> superbly crafted tale of conspiracies, underworld subterfuge, fun and intrigue. Reviewers appreciated the use of adult themes, such as sex and death, in the storyline of a contemporary video game, which no other games had tackled with similar effectiveness. The mature themes succeeded without being gratuitous or exploitative, and were explored honestly and intelligently by a knowledgeable writer. The game's characters were praised for their memorable, developed personalities, with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers. Its ending had a mixed response, with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of the game's four endings (adding an incentive to replay the game) and others considering the ending anti-climatic.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem and Dopesmoker are {{the final}} albums by the American heavy metal band Sleep. The albums were {{released}} in 1999 and 2003 respectively. The music for these albums was written during a four-year {{period when the}} group {{was working on a}} single song that was around an hour in length. Sleep had signed with London Records, which financed the album. When recording had finished, London Records was unhappy with the finished product and refused to release it. The album was later released in various forms by different record labels. All versions of the album received very positive reception from music critics, who <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> high-water mark in both the stoner metal and doom metal genres.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra, in his {{now defunct}} blog Moondram Pirai..., {{referred}} to the film as a suspense thriller, while N. Venkateswaran of The Times of India <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> psychological thriller. Devika Bai, writing for the New Straits Times, referred to Moodu Pani as a whodunit film. K.Hariharan, director of the L. V. Prasad Film & TV Academy, noted that sexuality and the repression of desire were the dominant motifs in Moodu Pani, expressed through the mysterious misty atmospheres of Ooty where the protagonist confronts their psychological antagonist. He also noted that Moodu Pani, like many of Mahendra's films, borrowed its themes and stylistic devices from French New Wave and New Hollywood styles of filmmaking. Ilangovan noted that Chandru's character, which was depicted as having flashes of wickedness bordering on perversion, was new to Tamil cinema. Crime and detective fiction writer Pattukkottai Prabakar considers Moodu Pani, along with Sigappu Rojakkal and Nooravathu Naal (1984), to explore the personalities and behavioural traits of psychopaths in detail.|$|E

5|$|The {{cast and}} crew arrived in Sologne between February 6 and 15. Renoir's son Alain worked as an {{assistant}} camera operator and Dido Freire worked as the script girl. Renoir's assistants on the film were Koch, Zwobada and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggianni {{was hired as a}} technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The {{cast and crew}} stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> happy time in their lives just before the horrors of World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was great fun.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} several commentators have <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> classic South Park episode. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was viewed by about 2.2 million households during its original broadcast, {{which at the}} time was roughly eight times Comedy Central's average viewership. Parker and Stone said they were unhappy with the turkey subplot, which they wrote only because they felt obligated to include a B story. Sally Struthers was reportedly deeply offended by her portrayal in the episode. In addition to Starvin' Marvin, who became a popular minor character, the episode introduced regular characters Kyle's father Gerald Broflovski and Kenny's family members Stuart, Carol and Kevin McCormick.|$|E
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography {{to show that it}} was not a hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
