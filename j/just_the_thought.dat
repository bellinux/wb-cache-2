500|$|Odubade {{opted to}} stay at Eastbourne Borough ahead of the 2005–06 season, and {{subsequently}} started in the club's {{first game of the}} season, scoring the only goal of the game in a 1–0 away win against Bishop's Stortford. Odubade scored his second goal of the season a week later, scoring the opening goal of the match as Eastbourne lost 3–2 against Basingstoke Town, as well as scoring in the club's 2–1 home loss to Weston-Super-Mare. After scoring three goals in the club's first five matches of the season, Odubade failed to score again until November 2005 – scoring Eastbourne's goal in a 1–1 draw against Carshalton Athletic. He also scored and assisted a goal in the club's 3–2 away victory against Farnborough Town at Cherrywood Road. Odubade impressed in the club's FA Cup run during the same season, helping the club take Oxford United to a replay in November 2005. After impressing Oxford manager Brian Talbot in the two ties, Odubade joined Oxford two months later for a fee of £25,000 on an 18-month contract. On joining Oxford, Odubade said [...] "It brings a tear to my eye <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of leaving Eastbourne. But I wanted {{to get back into the}} Football League and I just feel I am very lucky to have this second chance". In total, Odubade played 40 times for Eastbourne Borough in all competitions, scoring 20 goals.|$|E

6000|$|Well, {{my young}} friends, {{these are very}} awful words of St. John; such blessed and {{wonderful}} words, that {{if we did not}} find them in the Bible, it would be madness and insolence to God of us to say such a thing, not merely of little children, but even of the greatest, and wisest, and holiest man who ever lived; but there they are in the Bible--the blessed Lord Himself has told us all, [...] "When ye pray, say, Our Father in heaven;"--and I dare not keep them back because they sound strange. They may SOUND strange, but they ARE NOT strange. Any one who has ever watched a young child's heart, and seen how naturally and at once the little innocent takes in the thought of his Father which is in heaven, knows {{that it is not a}} strange thought--that it comes to a little child almost by instinct--that his Father in heaven seems often to be <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> which fills his heart most completely, has most power over him,--the thought which has been lying ready in his heart all the time, only waiting for some one to awaken it, and put it into words for him; that he will do right when you put him in mind of his Father above the skies sooner than he will for a hundred punishments.

It was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything--because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage--who can tell?--but truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn't. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity--and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.|$|E

50|$|Jessie The Yodeling Cowgirl is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the films Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. At Christmas in 1999, the Wall Street Journal called Jessie toys among the hottest of the season. In the movie, {{she is a}} very rare toy modeled after a character on the fictional television show Woody's Roundup, where the characters included Sheriff Woody, Jessie, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Bullseye, Woody's horse. Her hair is formed in a ponytail braid tied with a bow. Jessie the doll has a character very similar to the one portrayed on the television show. She is excitable, brave, and very athletic. The doll, however, carries a great deal of sadness, as she was abandoned by her original owner, which left her somewhat distrustful. Years of being in storage have made her somewhat withdrawn, and noticeably afraid of the dark, to the extent of hyperventilating whenever she is inside dark enclosed spaces, or even at <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of being abandoned.|$|E

5000|$|Genophobia or coitophobia is the {{physical}} or psychological fear of sexual relations or sexual intercourse. The word {{comes from the}} Greek nouns γένος genos, meaning [...] "offspring," [...] and φόβος phobos, meaning [...] "fear." [...] This word is also formed from the Greek noun phobos and the term coitus, referring to the act of copulation in which a male reproductive organ penetrates a female reproductive tract. The term erotophobia {{can also be used}} when describing genophobia. It comes from the name of the Greek god of erotic love, Eros. Genophobia can induce panic and fear in individuals, much like panic attacks. People who suffer from the phobia can be intensely affected by attempted sexual contact or <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> of it. The extreme fear can lead to trouble in romantic relationships. Those afflicted by genophobia may stay away from getting involved in relationships to avoid the possibility of intimacy. This can lead to feelings of loneliness. Genophobic people may also feel lonely because they may feel embarrassed or ashamed of their personal fears.|$|E
