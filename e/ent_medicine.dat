40|$|Background: The {{present study}} was done to {{investigate}} the prevalence of granulomatous infection among the patients. The study was conducted from the time period of July 2008 to June 2013. The study was conducted at the histopathology laboratory, pathology department, P. D. U. government medical college, Rajkot (Gujarat, India). Methods: In the present study, total 300 cases were studied. Specimens for study were received from various departments like surgery, <b>ENT,</b> <b>medicine,</b> pediatrics etc. from July 2008 to June 2013. The sections of these specimens were taken and slides were prepared by staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) for microscopic examination. Results: In present study, most the common granulomatous reaction was tuberculosis and majority of cases were found in among young Hindu males specially in the lower socioeconomical class of rural areas. Conclusion: Our study confirms that the most common granulomatous reaction is tuberculosis, mainly found in skin and more common among the population of lower socioeconomic class and rural population, signifying increasing incidence of granulomation infection. The present study is a comprehensive comparative study of granulomatous reactions done in correlation with the age, sex, involved sites and clinical profile of the patients. This information is valuable in policy formation for the control and specific treatment and outcome of granulomatous infection. [Int J Res Med Sci 2015; 3 (1. 000) : 201 - 206...|$|E
40|$|Computer-assisted {{methods have}} emerged in medical {{diagnosis}} and therapy planning. Thereby the planning often relies on a 3 D model of the anatomical structures reconstructed from medical image data (CT, MRT, US). Within this dissertation the diagnostic possibilities are enhanced by combining the model generation of with a simulation of the patient specific biomechanics. Not only image data also biomechanical parameters are considered in the simulation. The pathologic function can be analyzed within the simulation, this analysis is combined {{with a description of}} the planned intervention and it results in a prediction of the therapy outcome and the change of functionality caused by the planned intervention. Using this approach different biomechanical phenomena have been examined in different medical application fields: Static analyses have been performed to specify an optimal prosthesis for the implantation of an artificial knee joint, a simulation of the patient specific jaw movement helps to detect occlusions and to verify the design of onlays and crowns in dental diagnostics. Stress-strain simulation is applied in spine surgery and flow simulation has been used in <b>ENT</b> <b>medicine</b> to analyze the patient-specific air flow in the nose. For the presented approaches not only the diagnostic method is presented also an evaluation strategy is outlined that can be applied to proof the significance of the simulation. The presented work results in an approach registering biomedical parameters in real-time and considering these parameters in a Virtual Reality based method for whiplash therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Appropriate {{information}} flow {{is crucial to}} the care of patients, particularly at the interface between primary and secondary care. Communication problems can result from inadequate organisation and training, There is a major expectation that information and communication technologies may offer solutions, but little reliable evidence. This paper reports the design and performance of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT), unparalleled in telemedicine research in either scale or range of outcomes. The study investigated the effectiveness and cost implications in rural and inner-city settings of using videoconferencing to perform joint tele-consultations as an alternative to general practitioner referral to the hospital specialist in the outpatient clinic. Methods: Joint tele-consultation services were established in both the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust in inner London, and the Royal Shrewsbury Hospitals Trust, in Shropshire. All the patients who gave consent to participate were randomised either to joint tele-consultation or to a routine outpatients appointment. The principal outcome measures included the frequency of decision by the specialist to offer a follow-up outpatient appointment, patient satisfaction (Ware Specific Questionnaire), wellbeing (SF 12) and enablement (PEI), numbers of tests, investigations, procedures and treatments. Results: A total of 134 general practitioners operating from 29 practices participated in the trial, referring a total of 3170 patients to 20 specialists in <b>ENT</b> <b>medicine,</b> general medicine (including endocrinology, and rheumatology), gastroenterology, orthopaedics, neurology and urology. Of these, 2094 patients consented {{to participate in the study}} and were correctly randomised. There was a 91 % response rate to the initial assessment questionnaires, and analysis showed equivalence for all key characteristics between the treatment and control groups. Conclusion: We have designed and performed a major multi-centre trial of teleconsultations in two contrasting centres. Many problems were overcome to enable the trial to be carried out, with a considerable development and learning phase. A lengthier development phase might have enabled us to improve the patient selection criteria, but there is a window of opportunity for these developments, and we believe that our approach was appropriate, allowing the evaluation of the technology before its widespread implementation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for optical tri-dimensional contouring, requiring only one acquisition to extract a contour depth. It {{is based on an}} interferometric setup, using a reduced coherence light source, and is fully adaptable to endoscopic procedure commonly in used in ear-nose-throat (<b>ENT)</b> <b>medicine.</b> It has been demonstrated that the method can be successfully applied to imaging of porcine upper airways. Although this method uses interferometry to obtain depth range measurement, the phase signal is not directly evaluated, rather the location of the coherent superposition of two waves is extracted, and thus provides a robust technique even in harsh environment. The key feature is to extract the coherent area on the image by locating intentionally induced fringes created by off-axis superposition of a smooth reference wave and an object wave coming from a rough or diffusing sample through an optical system with limited aperture. A model for the propagation of the light through the optical system has been developed. It takes into account the broadened emission spectrum of the light source, as well as the statistical speckle effect induced by the illumination of a rough surface with partially coherent light. Simulated results have been carefully compared with measurements, both in the spatial domain and in the Fourier domain (spatial frequencies response), which has permitted to better understand the processes involved {{in the creation of the}} interference fringes, and improve the design of the device. Different filters have been investigated in order to extract the depth information from acquired interferograms. By using Gabor filterbanks, which do not need any a priori knowledge of the signal, selectivity of the extracted signal has been enhanced by a factor of 1. 3 compared to a simple local Fourier spectrum evaluation, and time of the extraction procedure divided by 6, even when compared to fast iterative calculation in the Fourier spectrum. Moreover, by imposing the frequency and/or orientation of the signal to detect, which can be known by a simple calibration procedure, it has been proved that the selectivity can be further enhanced by a factor of 2. 5, keeping the calculation time as short or even shorter. A compact prototype has been designed and built, with a specific multiple fibers arrangement for illumination. The system is separated in two parts: the first one is directly attached to the rigid endoscope, and contains imaging as well as recombining object/reference wave optics, and the detector. It fits into a box with overall dimensions of 115 × 83 × 94 mm. The second part contains the laser source, the scanning arm and the injection optics for the fibered system. It is designed to be left on a small cart. This device can potentially be brought to the bedside, and used during routine endoscopic check-up. Associated with the device, a complete framework has been elaborated in order to simplify the acquisition procedure as well as the signal processing. This results in a fully automated environment taking in charge hardware control, data storage and signal processing, up to the tri-dimensional scene rendering...|$|E
