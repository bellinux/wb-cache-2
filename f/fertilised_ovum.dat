30|$|Sperm competition, {{when the}} ejaculates {{of two or}} more males compete to <b>fertilise</b> an <b>ovum,</b> could cause genital {{divergence}} via male fertilisation success. Significant variance in fertilisation success for males is attributable to differences in male copulation behaviour and male genital morphology (reviewed by Eberhard 1996;Córdoba-Aguilar 2010;Simmons 2014). This adds to the growing number of empirical studies that have provided evidence for sexual selection as a pervasive force, shaping the evolution of genitalia. Sperm displacement by males is one mechanism of avoiding sperm competition in insects (Simmons 2001). Such sperm displacement is well known in Calopterygidae damselflies (Odonata) (Córdoba-Aguilar and Cordero Rivera 2005). Males of these damselflies possess a unique aedeagus with a recurved head and two spiny lateral processes, while females have two sperm-storage organs, a spherical bursa copulatrix and a tubular Y-shaped spermatheca. Previous studies demonstrated that the recurved head removes bursal sperm, whereas the lateral processes potentially remove spermathecal sperm (Waage 1979;Córdoba-Aguilar et al. 2003;Hayashi and Tsuchiya 2005;Tsuchiya and Hayashi 2008).|$|R

40|$|The present review {{examines}} whether monotremes {{may help}} to resolve three questions relating to sperm production in mammals: why the testes descend into a scrotum in most mammals, why spermatozoa are infertile when they leave the testes and require a period of maturation in the specific milieu provided by the epididymides, and why ejaculated spermatozoa cannot immediately <b>fertilise</b> an <b>ovum</b> until they undergo capacitation within the female reproductive tract. Comparisons of monotremes with other mammals indicate {{that there is a}} need for considerable work on monotremes. It is hypothesised that testicular descent should be related to epididymal differentiation. Spermatozoa and ova from both groups share many of the proteins that are thought to be involved in gamete interaction, and although epididymal sperm maturation is significant it is probably less complex in monotremes than in other mammals. However, the monotreme epididymis is unique in forming spermatozoa into bundles of 100 with greatly enhanced motility compared with individual spermatozoa. Bundle formation involves a highly organised interaction with epididymal proteins, and the bundles persist during incubation in vitro, except in specialised medium, in which spermatozoa separate after 2 – 3 h incubation. It is suggested that this represents an early form of capacitation...|$|R

This research work was carried out at the Department of Surgery and Obstetrics, Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) during the period from January to December 2001. Three Flushing schedules have been carried out in one-year time consisting of 5 donor and 4 recipients in Flush I, 2 donors and 4 recipients in Flush II, and 4 donors and 3 recipients in Flush III. The donors as well as the recipients were synchronized with Gabbrostim ® (Alfaprostol, VETEM, Italy) at the dose rate of 2 -mg equivalent to 1 ml/goat. Among 11 donors only 6 donors responded following first injection, but all donor responded with second and third injection of Gabbrostim ®.

40|$|DOI: 10. 2478 /s 11686 - 010 - 0037 -zThe intrauterine polylecithal eggs of the spathebothriidean cestode Didymobothrium rudolphii (Monticelli, 1890) were {{examined}} {{by means of}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Each unembryonated egg is composed of a <b>fertilised</b> oocyte or <b>ovum</b> and several vitelline cells, all surrounded by a newly formed shell. The lumen of the proximal uterus is packed with unutilised vitelline material and eggs {{at different stages of}} shell formation. In the proximal region of the uterus, the fertilised oocytes, initially surrounded by dense, discontinuous islands of eggshell material and containing long axonemes of spermatozoa in their cytoplasm, were frequently observed. Sperm axonemes also remain in the oocyte cytoplasm of eggs surrounded by a thick electron-dense shell until the sperm nucleus is transformed into a male pronucleus. Despite the fact that the two-pronuclei stage and cell divisions within the eggs of D. rudolphii were never observed, individual eggs containing several blastomeres of different sizes were seen in the middle and distal regions of the uterus. This provides indirect evidence that at least a few initial cleavage divisions must take place in the intrauterine eggs and direct evidence that the early embryonic development of D. rudolphii starts in utero. The several vitellocytes present in each egg contain nutritive reserves for the developing embryos; these are composed mainly of numerous lipid droplets and a moderate amount of glycogen. In the eggs containing early embryos composed of several blastomeres, the cytoplasm of the degenerating vitellocytes exhibits the presence of so-called 'foci of cytoplasmic degradation', which appear {{to be involved in the}} autolytic process of the vitellocyte cell components and inclusions, such as a high accumulation of lipids and glycogen. This progressive degeneration of the vitellocytes, considered as an example of programmed cell death or apoptosis, likely contributes towards the resorption of nutritive reserves by the developing embryo.

40|$|INTEGRAL to {{the study}} of the {{processes}} of neoplasia is the opposite and contrary one of cell differentiation and organisation. A single <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> contains all the necessary information for growth and maturation to multicellular adult life, and Gurdon (1964) has shown that if the gamete is bisected during the first few divisions after meiosis, the separated parts will develop into complete individuals.

It would, therefore, appear that among simple organisms, which are low in the evolutionary scale, irreversible differentiation does not occur until late in embryonic development and that individual cells maintain their complete potential until a fairly advanced stage in differentiation has been reached.

40|$|Abstract Objectives We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of novel ester derivatives of nonoxynol- 9, an approved spermicidal agent, using the non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin. Indomethacin has previously been shown to inhibit the implantation of the <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> into the uterus wall of pregnant rats. It is proposed that nonoxynol- 9, in combination with a non-selective NSAID may exhibit both anti-implantation and spermicidal properties. Methods Both novel derivatives and nonoxynol- 9 were then tested on boar spermatozoa {{in order to establish}} if spermicidal activity was retained following the esterification. Results The results showed that both the ibuprofen and indomethacin derivatives enabled complete cell death of boar spermatozoa at a concentration of 100 µg ml- 1, which is comparable to nonoxynol- 9 at the same concentration. Conclusions These results indicate that NSAID derivatives of nonoxynol- 9 retain the activity of the parent molecule and may have other advantages associated with the molecular incorporation of the NSAID moieties and their anti-implantation activity.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the central issue in the {{abortion}} debate has not changed since 1967 when the English parliament enacted the Abortion Act. That central issue concerns the moral status of the human fetus. The debate here is not, it is argued, primarily a moral debate, but rather a metaphysical debate and/or a theological debate—though one with massive moral implications. It concerns the nature and attributes that an entity requires to have "full moral standing" or "moral inviolability" including a "right to life". It concerns the question when, in its development from newly <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> to unequivocally mature, autonomous morally inviolable person does a human being acquire that nature and those attributes, and thus a "right to life". The paper briefly reviews standard answers to these questions, outlining some problems associated with each.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the day-old broiler chick is {{foremost}} {{in the minds of}} many poultry managers. From <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> to the placement at the broiler farm, some factors such as the characteristics of the incubating eggs, the egg holding conditions, the incubation conditions and the conditions that exist between hatching and placement at the farm and their interactions may affect chick quality. It may be questioned if maximal hatchability is the best indicator for chick quality and/or post-hatching viability, even if optimal hatchability is considered a prerequisite for successful incubation. The environmental conditions during incubation (e. g. the temperature, humidity and ventilation rate (carbon dioxide concentration)) are not set independently from each other, although each may have its own optimum for hatchability and chick quality. These optima for each incubation factor may alter differentially according to the characteristics of the incubating egg. It is concluded that more independent control as well as more control of the variability of the classical physical conditions in the incubator are required in order to improve hatchability and chick quality. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Centchroman {{is a novel}} nonsteroidal {{contraceptive}} {{that offers}} a unique combination of weak estrogenic and potent antiestrogenic properties. Centchroman inhibits the <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> from implantation and thus prevents pregnancy. The development of the steroidal contraceptive in the late 1950 s was a big event in reproductive research. The pill has, however, some inherent logistic limitations such {{as the need for}} continuous administration and thus associated likelihood of side effects. This underscored the need for a safer alternative for preventing pregnancy such as postcoital contraceptives and those that interfere with events between ovulation and implantation. Hence, in this study, a clinical evaluation of centchroman for its contraceptive study was carried out on 153 women and the contraceptive benefit was evaluated at monthly intervals.

40|$|Abortion is {{forbidden}} {{under normal circumstances}} by nearly all the major world religions. Traditionally, abortion was not deemed permissible by Muslim scholars. Shiite scholars considered it forbidden after implantation of the <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum.</b> However, Sunni scholars have held various opinions on the matter, but all agreed that after 4  months gestation abortion was not permitted. In addition, classical Islamic scholarship had only considered threats to maternal health {{as a reason for}} therapeutic abortion.

Contemporary rulings from leading Shiite scholars and from the Sunni school of thought are presented and reviewed.

40|$|Several {{locomotor}} {{disorders in}} children {{that come to}} the attention of orthopaedic surgeons have their origin in fetal life and present as congenital anomalies. These include cerebral palsy (which may be considered as a congenital anomaly as, in the majority of cases, the impairment is prepartum in timing), club foot and arthrogryposis. Alternatively, conditions that present as locomotor disorders may arise from impairments that have occurred intra-partum or in early childhood. Cerebral palsy also features strongly in this group. This anno-tation will consider the role of twinning in the pathogenesis of locomotor disorders and will focus on cerebral palsy, but will also consider the possible role of twinning in other congeni-tal anomalies. Pathogenic mechanisms of impairment in twins Crucial to the pathogenesis of many abnormal-ities in twins is the zygosity and chorionicity of the conception. The fertilisation of two ova produces dizygous twins which are dichorionic and have separate placental circulations. Divi-sion of a single <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> leads to mono-zygotic (identical) twins and the timing of the division determines chorionicity. Early division leads to dichorionic twins, later division to monochorionic twins and very late division to incomplete separation or conjoined twins. Concerns arise with monochorionic twinning owing to placental vascular anastomoses that are present. Chronic haemodynamic instability between fetuses results in the feto-fetal trans-fusion syndromes. These anastomoses are also a channel for other mechanisms which may damage the fetus. A proposed hypothesis is that thrombo-emboli or thromboplastin, released from the dead fetus, produce ischaemic damage in the co-twin...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{knowledge}} on the reproductive physiology of ursids in order to develop alternatives for a harmless and effective control of reproduction in captive bears. For this, endocrinological, ultrasonographical and pharmacological methods were modified and used. The reproductive physiology of the examined brown and Asiatic black bears can be described as follows: The mating period is regularly observed between April and July. The duration of oestrus varies individually from a few days to several weeks. Repeated oestrus cycles within one year have not been observed. After spontaneous ovulation, the <b>fertilised</b> <b>ovum</b> develops into a blastocyst and remains in this stage under extreme retardation of mitotic activity over several month (obligate embryonic diapause). In this stage of pregnancy, corpora lutea are dominated by small luteal cells which already synthesise slightly increased serum progesterone levels. The further, rapid embryonic development starts in autumn and is concomitant with an enlargement of corpora lutea (now dominated by large luteal cells with marked vacuoles) and a sharp increase of serum progesterone levels. Implantation occurs a few days after this increase. After a post-implantation period of approximately 54 days the blind and naked cubs are born with a weight of 300 to 400 g. The majority of births occur from mid of December to end of January, the implantation therefore from mid of October to late November. A prognosis on the time of implantation is only in multiparous individuals reliable, as the dates of consecutive births in one individual are nearly constant. If the ovum is not fertilised, a corpus luteum pseudograviditatis develops. Pseudopregnancy, lasts as long as physiological pregnancy. A differentiation of pregnant and pseudopregnant bears by means of progesterone monitoring is not clearly possible throughout the year, and a ultrasonographical diagnosis of pregnancy succeeds only after implantation. These results were helpful in developing new methods to control reproduction in bears. The effectiveness of the antiprogestin J 956 and the estrogen ethinylestradiol were studied. In a pharmacokinetic study the bioavailability and half life of J 956 after oral and parenteral administration were determined. Thus, the suitability of this antiprogestin could be demonstrated, and conclusions on dosage and optimal mode of application were drawn. Application of J 956 can terminate pregnancy even after implantation (n= 6), but in two bears with embryos of a crown-rump length of more than 20 mm, pathological alterations of the uterus were observed. Therefore, an application of J 956 after implantation should be avoided, or carried out only until few days after implantation, if possible under ultrasonographical control. The single intramuscular application of both J 956 (10 or 7, 5 mg/kg KM; n= 6) and ethinylestradiol (10 µg/kg KM; n= 9) prior to implantation proved to be successful. Reversibilty of both methods has not been proven yet because of management reasons, but there were no severe side-effects observed. All bears mated again in the breeding season following treatment. Because of the potential side-effects of estrogens, the use of antiprogestins should be preferred. As long as there is no antiprogestin commercially available which is suitable for a remote application in bears (the availability of the antiprogestin J 956 is very limited), the single use of ethinylestradiol in a low dosage (10 µg/kg body weight) prior to implantation (in the first half of October) can be recommended. In contrast to other methods used to control reproduction in bears, the contragestive methods presented in this study do effect neither the oestrus cycle nor the sexual and social behaviour of the bears. A single and remote application terminates early pregnancy (during diapause) and is effective only one breeding season. Thus, you can decide to terminate pregnancy each and every year anew. <br...|$|E
