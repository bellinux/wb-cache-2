40|$|Hypermedia Learning Systems (HLS) {{are being}} used {{increasingly}} widely in Higher Education, offering non-linear navigation through complex learning materials and, it is argued, leading to improve cognitive flexibility. For some learners, though, nonlinear navigation in HLS leads {{to higher levels of}} disorientation, which can have an impact on their learning performance and attitudes towards the learning system. There has been significant research into the factors that can influence individual learners‘ experiences. For example, {{a number of studies have}} confirmed that individual differences such as cognitive style, domain knowledge and computer experience affect individuals‘ levels of disorientation and learning performance, and influence their attitudes towards HLS. It has also been suggested that <b>instructional</b> <b>aids</b> (in the form of certain visual elements and audio elements) can reduce levels of disorientation and, in turn, increase learning performance in, and positive attitudes towards, HLS for some learners. However, existing studies have tended to look at only a subset of these three individual differences in relation to an individual and/or consider only a small number of visual <b>instructional</b> <b>aids.</b> No study up to this point has considered the impact of cognitive style, domain knowledge and computer experience on disorientation, learning performance and attitudes in a HLS that incorporates a full range of visual <b>instructional</b> <b>aids.</b> In terms of the research related to audio <b>instructional</b> <b>aids,</b> no studies have looked into the effects of audio aids and these three individual differences in relation to disorientation, learning performance and attitudes in HLS. This thesis addresses these two shortcomings through two experiments. The aim of experiment 1 was to examine the effects of and between these three individual differences with respect to disorientation, learning performance and attitudes in two versions of a HLS: one that incorporated the set of visual <b>instructional</b> <b>aids</b> and one that did not. Experiment 2 aimed to do the same, but with respect to a HLS that provided audio <b>instructional</b> <b>aids.</b> The experiments used quantitative and qualitative approaches to gather data to address a set of research questions and research hypotheses. The participants were 384 university students from across London. The Cognitive Style Analysis (CSA) test was administered to determine participants‘ field dependence, and participants‘ demographic information, levels of computer experience and levels of prior knowledge were gathered using questionnaires. Learning performance was measured through achievement tests and a practical task. Levels of disorientation were measured using questionnaires, and attitudes were assessed using questionnaires and interviews. Participants were also observed when they were interacting with the HLS to perform learning tasks. A number of interesting results were revealed. Significant effects were found between the three individual differences with respect to disorientation, learning performance and attitudes in the HLS that provided no <b>instructional</b> <b>aids.</b> No significant effects were found between the three individual differences with respect to disorientation or learning performance in the other two versions of the HLS – those providing visual and audio <b>instructional</b> <b>aids.</b> Significant effects were found between the three individual differences with respect to the use of the visual and audio <b>instructional</b> <b>aids</b> to perform learning in the HLS.

Group I was the experimental group, and subjects used their own tennis rackets with the Klic-Klac teaching aid attached. Subjects of Group II, the control group, used their own tennis rackets without the Klic-Klac throughout the study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} an {{innovation in teaching}} strategy in one major subject in the Maritime Education and Training (MET) program of the Maritime Academy of Asia and the Pacific (MAAP). This strategy makes use of an <b>instructional</b> <b>aid</b> called MAAPCNIA (MAAP Celestial Navigation <b>Instructional</b> <b>Aid),</b> conceptualized and designed by Capt. Daniel S. Torres, Jr. MAAPCNIA encompasses color-coded spheres that depict navigational triangle. This triangle is composed of a blue celestial sphere representing horizon system of coordinates and a white sphere enclosing a globe characterizing time diagram and celestial equator and terrestrial systems of coordinates. With this instrument, celestial spheres can be easily visualized compared when using one-dimensional drawing. Hence, understanding of orthographic projection, which is essentially the core of appreciation and mastery of this tough subject, is enhanced. This paper focuses on the development and impact of MAAPCNIA since its conception in 2004, towards authentic teaching-learnin...|$|E

Fourteen male and sixteen female beginning tennis players enrolled in a beginning coed physical education tennis class at East Los Angeles College served as subjects for the study. Subjects were divided into one control group and one experimental group??? following examination of pre-test scores on the tennis serve. The investigation was conducted for six weeks, with a total of six practice sessions held twice a week for three weeks. The first week was devoted to the pre-test and the last week to the post-test. During the practice sessions, the experimental group performed the mechanics of the tennis toss with the Server's Tennis Toss-Thru <b>instructional</b> <b>aid</b> and the control group practiced without a training device. Throughout the experiment, both groups practiced the tennis toss for one minute and practiced ten serves across the net to the right service court. The data collected from the post-test were statistically analyzed by means of a t test for correlated pairs to determine if there were any significant difference in the mean serving scores of both groups. The null hypothesis, stating that there will be no significant difference in the mean serving scores of the experimental and control groups in the acquisition of the skill of a tennis serve, was found to be tenable...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of an advance organizer containing question prompts in information seeking in terms of problem-solving strategies, metacognitive facilitation, and search results for college students. Researching design elements that could be effective in these problemsolving environments could also benefit other learning environments that share the similar characteristics of being ill-structured or open-ended. Six graduate students volunteered and participated in this comparative case study. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: one group searched an instructional technology open-ended problem using a print-based advance organizer and the other searched the same problem without the <b>instructional</b> <b>aid.</b> Data collected from talk-aloud audio recordings, video screen captures, and follow-up interviews were analyzed for themes and patterns. The results of this study support the ability of question prompts to facilitate questioning and reflection during the information-seeking problem-solving process. The advance organizer caused participants to slow down and think about their search, particularly in the beginning and end of the search process. Based on the results of the study, design recommendations for the advance organizer and search interfaces have been proposed.
