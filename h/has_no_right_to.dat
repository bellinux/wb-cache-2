Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E

The jury is composed of various animals, including Bill the Lizard; the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter; and the judge is the King of Hearts. During the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.|$|E
25|$|Each housing {{cooperative}} {{has their own}} bylaws. The members hold annual meetings in the {{housing cooperative}}, in which they elect {{a board of directors}} that take on the responsibility of managing the cooperation during the upcoming year. In most normal-sized cooperatives the board members are recruited among the inhabitants. The board sets the monthly fee, secures proper administrative procedures, keeps the property in good condition, and may initiate large renovation projects when necessary. The board is also involved when a member sells his apartment (i.e. sells his right to inhabit the apartment) to someone else, as the board has to make decisions on allowing the exit of old members and the entry of new members. If the buyer of a bostadsrätt is found financially viable, the board <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> turn down a membership application. The board is also involved when individual members want to initiate large renovation projects, or when individual members want to rent out the apartment to a non-member.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} (licensed repair facility) has repaired, {{furnished}} supplies or materials, towed or stored a vehicle {{and has not}} been paid for the services rendered, that person has a lien against the vehicle. The lien arises at the time the registered owner is presented with a written statement of charges for completed work or services. Although if services were performed that were not agreed upon and no written and signed estimate was issued beforehand, a mechanic <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> keep the title owner from reclaiming the vehicle. If a mechanic asserts a fee that is not reasonably related to the work performed, and refuses to return the vehicle until that price is paid, the owner of the vehicle will be able to recoup a storage fee from the mechanic, as the mechanic is in the wrong for refusing to return the vehicle. In doing so the mechanic would commit the crime of conversion, or embezzlement.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, King Hassan II {{created the}} Union Nationale des Femmes Marocaines (UNFM), an {{organization}} with the stated goal {{of improving the}} social and economic status of women in Morocco. The activities of the UNFM focused less on legal reform and more on professional and training programs for women. It was given the legal status of a utilité publique, an important designation for Moroccan civil society organizations, which allows them to raise funds and be exempt from taxes (similar to non-profit status in the United States). Historically, this distinction, which must be conferred by the government, has provided a way for the Moroccan regime to exert a measure of control over civil society organizations, as those whose agendas conflict with that of the government typically find it difficult to obtain utilité publique status. Without this license, an association will have difficulty securing funding and <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> recourse within the Moroccan justice system.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Palestinian {{legislative}} elections Hamas won {{a majority}} in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority insisting that the Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs that Israel <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> exist and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must be wiped out. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E

25|$|Caroline is {{introduced}} in Last Tango in Halifaxs series premiere (2012), {{as a successful}} headmistress dealing with the fallout of her husband's affair and her own clandestine liaison with Kate. At {{the climax of the}} episode she is shocked to learn that her mother Celia has decided to marry Alan; an old love interest she had recently {{met for the first time}} in sixty years. She is also shocked upon discovering that Alan is father to Gillian, a working-class woman who Caroline has previously insulted. After learning that John is still seeing his lover Judith (Ronni Ancona), Caroline tells him he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> carry on living in their marital home. She grows closer to Kate, and explains to her that she finds it hard to be open with her feelings, having long suppressed her emotions. In the following episode, Caroline grows closer to Gillian after their respective parents go missing. She admits to John that she has moved on and began seeing someone else. When Caroline makes her relationship with Kate official, her eldest son William (Edward Ashley) takes it in his stride, but her younger son Lawrence (Louis Greatorex) is upset. When Judith arrives at Caroline's house she learns of the relationship and informs John who tells Celia. Celia refuses to accept that her daughter is gay and her bigoted words and attitude at a dinner party drive Kate away. Caroline has an angry argument with her mother, blaming her for her emotional repression and for ruining her chance of happiness with Kate. She reminds her that she had previously tried to come out to her at the age of 18, and that it had been her prejudices that had forced her to live a closeted existence. Celia, realising that she may have ruined her relationship with both her daughter and the liberal-minded Alan, is compelled to ask Kate to give Caroline another chance.|$|E
