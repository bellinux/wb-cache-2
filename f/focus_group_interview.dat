30|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} qualitative deductive semi-structured interviews conducted between June 2014 and May 2015 with actors operating within O&M activities in offshore wind parks. In {{the beginning of the}} qualitative research, a <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> was conducted with 11 participants who were invited due to their different roles in O&M activities within offshore wind parks. The O&M area has never before been a target for research on innovation and the reduction of LCOE. Therefore, a focus group approach was selected for preparation of an interview guide to address the essential issues later in the more thorough individual interviews for deductive analyses. The participants in the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> revealed challenges and phenomena in terms of a broad spectrum of offshore O&M activities. The 11 participants in the semi-structured <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> held in June 2014 were managers from various enterprises with different roles, e.g. a wind park owner, a wind turbine producer, equipment suppliers, service providers of equipment and/or staffing. The <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> was transcribed to analyse the findings (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2009). Different roles and interests were found in the offshore wind industry for service providers offering manpower/equipment/components and service providers offering transportation/maintenance solutions using different logistic approaches.|$|E

However, the literature on this method is ambiguous {{in relation to the}} size, con-stitution, purpose and execution of <b>focus</b> <b>groups.</b> Aim. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore some of the methodological issues arising from using <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> in order to stimulate debate about their efficacy. Discussion. Methodological issues are discussed in the context of a study examining attitudes towards and beliefs about older adults in hospital settings among first-level registered nurses, nursing lecturers and student nurses. <b>Focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> were used to identify everyday language and constructs used by nurses, with the intention of incor-porating the findings into an instrument to measure attitudes and beliefs quantitatively. Conclusions. Experiences of conducting <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> demonstrated that smaller groups were more manageable and that groups made up of strangers required more moderator intervention.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{increase}} awareness about and stimulate interest in using <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews,</b> a qualitative research technique, to advance the state-of-the-art of education and learning about health. After a brief discussion of small group process in health education, features of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> are presented, and a theoretical framework for planning a <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> study is summarized. Then, litera-ture describing traditional and health-related applications of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> is reviewed and a synthesis of methodological limitations and advantages of this tech-nique is presented. Implications are discussed regarding: need for more inductive qualitative research in health education; utility of <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> for research and for formative and summative evaluation of health education programs; appli-cability of marketing research to understanding and influencing consumer behav-ior, despite notable distinctions between educational initiatives and marketing; and need for professional preparation faculty to consider increasing emphasis on qualita-tive research methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of expanding the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> into the field of English as a Second Language (ESL), where this research methodology {{is yet to be}} thoroughly explored. Specifically, it aims to challenge popular criticisms about {{the reliability and validity of}} the focus group as a qualitative research methodology. It does this by first setting up a list of five main criticisms of the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview</b> drawn from current literature on research methodology within the social sciences and education. Based on transcripts of interactional data gathered from focus group interviews carried out among ESL students in a formal ESL context, it then provides a direct and detailed response to each criticism. The arguments put forward demonstrate that the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interview,</b> as a method of data collection, may be particularly relevant in gathering the viewpoints and opinions of participants who have traditionally not been well represented through the more conventional and common methods currently employed in ESL research studies. Furthermore, the paper raises conscious awareness about the potential of the focus group as a viable and verifiable tool in qualitative research methodology...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{contribution}} of rheumatology nurses to improved patient outcomes is increasingly recognised but {{more research is}} needed about the effects of interventions. The patient's role in deciding about healthcare quality is considered pivotal and therefore patients' opinions and expectations should be directional in defining priorities for a research agenda. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore needs and expectations with regard to rheumatology nursing care in patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA). METHODS: Patients aged 18 - 90 years from three medical clinics in different regions in The Netherlands were invited to participate in <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews.</b> The interviews were transcribed verbatim and independently analysed by the authors. In a consensus meeting the emerging subjects were categorised into themes which were verified in a fourth interview. RESULTS: In total, 20 patients, mean age 57 years old, participated in the <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews.</b> The majority had rheumatoid arthritis and mean disease duration was 15 years. The <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> revealed 12 subthemes that were organised into four main themes: education, self-management support, emotional support and well organised care. Additionally, patients considered opinions about 'the personality of the nurse' (eg, easy to talk to) to be important. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CIA mentioned that many problems have to be addressed when one is faced with having a rheumatic disease. The <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> <b>interviews</b> yielded valuable information about the care these patients need and expect. This information will direct future research with regard to rheumatology nursing care...|$|R
