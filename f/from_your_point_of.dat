500|$|Bruce replied formally, {{saying that}} the funds he had raised in Scotland {{would not have been}} {{forthcoming}} for any other project. There was no further correspondence between the two, beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham, in February 1901, which read [...] "I can now see things <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, and wish you success"â€”a sentiment apparently not reflected in Markham's subsequent attitude towards the Scottish expedition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say? What {{can anyone}} say? <b>From</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, or his, it's rotten, of course. But in her position, anything's rotten." ...|$|E
6000|$|Somewhat to his surprise, Jake nodded agreement. [...] "No, not <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. But {{what makes}} you think Kenwardine is dangerous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We fancy that we {{have some}} ideas that way, also," [...] he told her. [...] "Wherein do we fail most, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> English <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down {{even to the}} {{facility}} of your minding everything so little-- <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of TWO beautiful women." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{no right}} to talk of losing what's not yours. And even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] Isabel added, [...] "you ought {{to know when to}} let one alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. But even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, {{that would}} {{depend upon the}} artist. Extraordinary talent might make him {{a member of the}} great world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is really}} {{business}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view; and I have come round to {{that point of view}} myself. Olive, I want you to marry!" ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE It's awfully {{rough on}} you, Geoffrey. I {{can see it}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. But one can't help remembering {{the things that you}} {{yourself}} have said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, do it. I {{dare say}} Mr. Morton's quite right. He {{will look at}} these things more <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. All the Kingsley novels are in the Tauchnitz. By all means do what he says." ...|$|R
60|$|THE DEVIL. Not that we don't admire your intellect, you know. We do. But I look at {{the matter}} <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. You don't get on with us. The place doesn't suit you. The truth is, you have--I won't say no heart; for we know that beneath all your {{affected}} cynicism you have a warm one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Prescott confessed, [...] "when I explained, I {{was more}} afraid of you than of Jernyngham. I wanted to keep your good opinion, and I {{wondered}} whether you had only given it to me because you thought I was Cyril Jernyngham. <b>From</b> <b>your</b> friends' <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view Jack Prescott {{is a very different}} kind of person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{may be a}} School-prefect, Mr Perceval, but {{the fact}} remains that he is a trespasser, and ought <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view to be punished for {{breaking}} bounds.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps I have behaved badly--at least <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, but {{remember}} that I warned you. Let us sit down here. Who is your friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In brief--as you say--leave {{well enough}} alone. Apart from his {{prejudice}} against new-fangled surgery, I'm afraid {{he looks at}} the case <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--don't do it, for Leslie's sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|So, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, {{suppose a}} mind-stuff--[--Greek--]--a noumenal cosmic light such as is shadowed {{in the fourth}} gospel. The brain of a dog will convert it into one set of phenomenal pictures, and the brain of a man into another. But {{in both cases the}} result is the {{consequence}} {{of the way in which}} the respective brains perform their [...] "function." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell me, therefore, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> vantage <b>point</b> <b>of</b> cold view, what in [...] {{your mind}} is the cause. Can American Jews do {{anything}} to correct it [...] either in America or abroad? Will it ever come to an end? Will a [...] Jew be permitted to live honestly, decently, and peaceably like the [...] rest of mankind? What has become of the Golden Rule?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am simply {{obeying the}} law," [...] he answered. [...] "After all, even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, I {{do not think}} that it is so bad. Look closer, and you will find that the hedges are {{blackened}} here and there with smuts. The birds will find a better dwelling place further away. See how the smoke from those factory chimneys is sending its smuts across these fields. They are no longer country; they are better gathered in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{that it is}} so," [...] Bervie rejoined. [...] "The {{thing is}} {{remarkable}}, even <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. And if more coincidences follow, {{the result will be}} more remarkable still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say!" [...] he observed, with dismay. [...] "I {{never looked}} at it like that before! I can see that, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, this must look like {{a bit of a}} wash-out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you {{can only}} look at it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--can't you {{understand}} yet that there is another? If you had meant to go away you should have gone--some time ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't work any more," [...] said Roderick. [...] "You have upset me! I 'll go and {{stroll on}} the Pincian." [...] And he tossed aside his working-jacket and {{prepared}} {{himself for the}} street. As he was arranging his cravat before the glass, something occurred to him which made him thoughtful. He stopped a few moments afterward, as they were going out, {{with his hand on}} the door-knob. [...] "You did, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, an indiscreet thing," [...] he said, [...] "to tell Miss Light of my engagement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did not, till I {{began to}} look at it <b>from</b> <b>your</b> father's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. Besides, I ought to tell you, that there is no chance even of a legacy. I find that Mrs. Fotheringham rules the house, and has tried to {{prejudice}} my uncle against me. On the marriage, there were fresh arrangements; my uncle was to alter his will, and it was on that occasion that Sir Antony sent for me to keep up the balance, and save him from her influence. Mrs. Martindale was right about her. What a mischief-maker she is! My delay gave great offence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|LUBIN [smiling comfortably] <b>From</b> <b>your</b> high {{scientific}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, I daresay, none whatever, Professor. In {{any case}} I {{think a little}} perfectly idle discussion would do Burge good. After all, {{we might as well}} hear about the elixir of life as read novels, or whatever Burge does when he is not playing golf on Walton Heath. What is your elixir, Dr Barnabas? Lemons? Sour milk? Or what is the latest? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{struggling}} prairie farmer," [...] said Winston quietly. [...] "The {{son of an}} English country {{doctor who}} died in penury, and one who <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view could never have been entitled to more than courteous toleration from any of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Upon Lord Dredlinton? A {{very good}} report <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, Mr. Wingate. Lord Dredlinton's death {{was due to}} exhaustion, but the doctor {{certifies}} that he was suffering, {{and has been for}} some time, from advanced valvular disease of the heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} an {{excellent}} plan, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] the governor said. [...] "Teniers {{is one of the}} best sailors on the island, and has several times carried despatches for me to Weymouth. You could not be in better hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] Vine answered, [...] "it {{was not for}} my {{own sake}} that you warned me. You have {{admitted}} that yourself. It was entirely <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view that you judged it well for me to remain a little longer on the earth. Why, therefore, should I be grateful? As a matter of fact, I {{am not sure that}} I am. I, too, go about armed, and {{it is by no means}} certain that I might not have had the best of any little encounter with our friend who you say was hiding there."--He motioned his head towards his bedroom.--"In that case, you see, I should have known exactly who he was, possibly even have been able to hand him over to the police." ...|$|R
6000|$|Amelius listened without conviction. [...] "It's {{certainly}} {{useless to}} make a secret of the matter now," [...] he said; [...] "but I don't see my way to making it more public still." [...] He paused, and looked at Mr. Hethcote. [...] "It so happens, sir," [...] he resumed, [...] "that this unfortunate affair {{is an example of}} some of the Rules of our Community, which I had not had time to speak of, when Mr. Dingwell here joined us. It will be a relief to me to contradict these abominable falsehoods to somebody; and I should like (if you don't mind) to hear what you think of my conduct, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. It might prepare me," [...] he added, smiling rather uneasily, [...] "for what I may find in the English newspapers." ...|$|R
5000|$|Laak {{became known}} widely in the poker scene as the [...] "Unabomber" [...] {{because of the}} hooded sweatshirt [...] and {{sunglasses}} he wears at the table, making him resemble the forensic sketch of Theodore Kaczynski who {{was known as the}} Unabomber. These items were given to him by fellow poker player Gus Hansen. Laak is also known for his unusual and inventive manner of speech. He coined the poker terms [...] "felted" [...] to mean having lost all of one's chips (i.e. nothing left in front of the player except the table felt) as well as upstuck, meaning being down <b>from</b> <b>your</b> high <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the session (i.e. if you won $15 000 and then lost $10 000). He also coined the terms POW (Pay off wizard) which he uses in a self-mocking fashion (i.e. one who pays off big bets on the river) and [...] "Cherry bomb" [...] which refers to large, ultimately unsuccessful bets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. These {{matters are}} {{sufficient}} under that head. Now please describe the elephant, and leave out no particular, however insignificant--that is, insignificant <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. To {{me in my}} profession there are no insignificant particulars; they do not exist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{who could}} be {{expected}} to understand?" [...] Rodney groaned; [...] "but it's <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view that we must look at it. It's not only asking too much, it's putting you into a position--a position in which I could not endure to see my own sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{returned}} Thorne, [...] "is, perhaps, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, no {{more than}} natural. In fact, I'm not sure I could say he was right in everything he has done." [...] He paused a moment. [...] "But, I shouldn't {{like to think that}} your prejudice extends to Lucy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Consider the subject, Mr. Hartright, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view," [...] he said. [...] "If you {{are right}} about Sir Percival Glyde and Count Fosco (which I don't admit, mind), every imaginable {{difficulty}} would be thrown {{in the way of}} your getting fresh evidence. Every obstacle of litigation would be raised--every point in the case would be systematically contested--and by the time we had spent our thousands instead of our hundreds, the final result would, in all probability, be against us. Questions of identity, where instances of personal resemblance are concerned, are, in themselves, the hardest of all questions to settle--the hardest, even when they are free from the complications which beset the case we are now discussing. I really see no prospect of throwing any light whatever on this extraordinary affair. Even if the person buried in Limmeridge churchyard be not Lady Glyde, she was, in life, on your own showing, so like her, that we should gain nothing, if we applied for the necessary authority to have the body exhumed. In short, there is no case, Mr. Hartright--there is really no case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very little," [...] Macheson answered, [...] "for {{you give}} of your superfluity. Charity {{has little to}} do with the cheque-book. Besides, you must {{remember}} this. I am not here to-day to plead the cause of the East. I am here to talk to you of your own lives. I represent, if you are pleased to have it so, the Sandow of your spiritual body. I ask you to submit your souls to my treatment, as the professor of physical culture would ask for your bodies. This is not a matter of religion at all. It is a matter, if you choose to call it so, of philosophy. Your souls need exercise. You need a course of thinking and working for the good of some one else--not for your own benefit. Give up one sin in your life, and replace it with a whole-hearted effort to rescue one unfortunate person from sin and despair, and you will gain what I understand to be the desire of all of you--a new pleasure. Briefly, for <b>your</b> own sakes, <b>from</b> <b>your</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, it is a personal charity which I am advocating, as distinguished from the charity of the cheque-book." ...|$|R
5000|$|Battles {{begin with}} your robo being {{launched}} {{out of a}} Robocannon, which is controlled with the Control Stick. Robos are shot from the Cannon {{in the form of}} cubes; there are six sides numbered 1 to 6, which designate how long your robo has before transforming. You can speed up the process up by pressing any button repeatedly. The first robo to transform gets to attack first; an attack brings you to transform immediately. There are two views in battle: Normal view is the view that allows the player to see both the Custom Robos in an isometric view. First-person view allows you to see <b>from</b> <b>your</b> robo's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. You can change views during a battle by pressing up on the C-stick after [...] "A New Journey" [...] is completed. The endurance bar is located above <b>your</b> hit <b>points.</b> Once it runs out, your robo gets [...] "downed", which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After it gets up, it goes into [...] "rebirth", where it briefly turns invincible for about 3 seconds. If the player repeatedly loses the same battle, the game offers the option of reducing the opponent's initial health. This goes up to the opponent losing 250 HP.|$|R
