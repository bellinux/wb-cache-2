2500|$|Jains {{contrast}} {{all attempts}} to proclaim absolute truth with andhagajanyāyah, which can be illustrated through {{the parable of the}} [...] "blind men and an elephant". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an <b>elephant</b> (<b>trunk,</b> leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives. This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the Kevalis—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge. According to the doctrine, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent absolute truth.|$|E

2500|$|Buckland was {{a pioneer}} of zoöphagy: his {{favourite}} research was eating the animal kingdom. This habit he learnt from his father, whose residence, the Deanery, offered such rare delights as mice in batter, squirrel pie, horse's tongue and ostrich. After the [...] "Eland Dinner" [...] in 1859 at the London Tavern, organised by Richard Owen, Buckland set up the Acclimatization Society to further the search for new food. Buckland spoke about {{the introduction of the}} turkey, musk-duck and pheasant in the sixteenth, seventeent and eighteenth century respectively and that it was a pity that the same monotonous food was being eaten in the heyday of Queen Victoria's reign. In 1862 a hundred guests at Willis' Rooms sampled Japanese Sea slug (= sea cucumber, probably), kangaroo, guan, curassow and Honduras turkey. This was really quite a modest menu, though Buckland had his eye on capybara for the future. Buckland's home, 37 Albany Street, London, was famous for its menagerie and its varied menus, including, at times, boiled <b>elephant</b> <b>trunk,</b> rhinoceros pie, porpoise heads, and stewed mole.|$|E

Cavor resisted. [...] "We may just as well begin explaining ourselves now. They may think we are new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps!
