5000|$|The Methodist Church {{defines the}} nature and purpose of the District as being: to advance {{the mission of the}} Church in a region, by {{providing}} opportunities for Circuits to work together and support each other, by offering them resources of finance, personnel and expertise, which may not be available locally and by enabling them to engage with the wider society of the region as a whole and address its concerns. The District serves the Local Churches and Circuits and the Conference in the support, deployment and oversight of the various ministries of the Church, and in programmes of training. It has responsibility for the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> by Local Churches and Circuits for approval of or consent to their proposals, when required, or for assistance from district or connexional bodies or funds.

Such knowledge is especially valuable {{when there are no}} or little training data. In the paper we elaborate on the extraction ontology paradigm; the distinctive features of our system called Ex are 1) probabilistic reasoning over extractable attribute and instance candidates and 2) combination of the extraction ontology approach with the inductive and (to some degree) wrapper approach. We also discuss the issues related to the deployment and <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> based on extraction ontologies. ...|$|E

Firstly, we develop an extension for existing wireless channel modeling techniques to the case of mobility-dependent behavior. Based on the amount of available information regarding a propagation environment we provide three parametrization methods. Then, to avoid computationally expensive physical layer simulations when performing performance evaluation studies we extend the proposed wireless channel model to the data-link layer using the cross-layer mapping. Finally, we show how to utilize classic methods of queuing theory to obtain performance characteristics of application running over the wireless channels...|$|E

Traditional methods of analysis rely heavilyon the inherent predictability of the system, something which is totally lacking in ubiquitous systems. This paper discusses one possible approach to flexible analysis and evaluation, the ScenarioBased Approach, describing its use in the IST FP 6 project, Daidalos. The Scenario Based approach addresses the adaptive nature of ubiquitous systems by its own intrinsic flexibility. This paper explains the approach and argues that it is appropriate that a method of analysis should exhibit similar characteristics to the object of that analysis...|$|E
