500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|Fourth Amendment protections {{expanded}} {{significantly with}} Katz v. United States (1967). In Katz, the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and {{ruled that a}} search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached {{to the outside of}} the glass. While there was no physical intrusion <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth,</b> the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him, had exhibited his expectation that [...] "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that [...] "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places". A [...] "search" [...] occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person's [...] "reasonable expectation of privacy." [...] Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and thus necessitated a warrant. The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed.|$|E

500|$|... "Clumsy" [...] {{was written}} by Talay Riley, Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder and Alex Niceforo, with {{production}} being handled by the latter two; Mischke served as a vocal producer. Spears, Riley, Felder, Zaire Koalo, Trevor Brown and Mischke provided crowd vocals on the track, which were recorded at 158 Studios, Westlake Village, California, and at House of Blues Studio, Encino, California. Musically, [...] "Clumsy" [...] portrays a [...] "synth-laden" [...] electro track, with a [...] "folksy verse stomp" [...] and a [...] "futuristic club beat." [...] It additionally incorporates [...] "stomping drums and finger snaps" [...] in its instrumentation, as well as doo-wop [...] "hand-claps and soulful vocal riffs as it builds to an explosive electronic drop." [...] In an interview with radio show The Cooper Lawrence Show, the singer confirmed {{that she and her}} team [...] "literally went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> together and did all the claps [...] all the sound effects are real, they're from us, our feet and everything, it's all real, so we all did it together, it's like very old-school." [...] Joey Nolfi, writing for Entertainment Weekly, saw [...] "Clumsy" [...] as being [...] " [...] sonically in-line with songs heard on 2011's Femme Fatale and 2013's Britney Jean." [...] The Guardian Alex Macpherson opined that [...] "its rapacious giddiness shares something of the same spirit as Ariana Grande's 'Greedy'." ...|$|E
500|$|Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song, stating that [...] "the girls are going to love the lyrics. It brings total sex appeal and groove that starts the hips swinging and is so meant to break the set into a dark drive and into sensual exploration of a grind close contact dance rhythm". Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is [...] "sure to fit right into club DJ mixes and get people dancing"; however, he criticized that Gaga was [...] "all over the song ... as if Lopez went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> trying to emulate her delivery." [...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd be silly not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer". She additionally wrote that it was [...] "impossible to get [...] out of your head after more than one listen" [...] although becoming [...] "increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes" [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view, stating that [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is not anything [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [...]" [...] Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth,</b> but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important." ...|$|E

After a guest commentary at the 1979 British Grand Prix, Hunt accepted the position and continued for thirteen years until his death. During his first live broadcast at the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix, Hunt placed his plaster-cast leg into Walker's lap and proceeded to drink two bottles of wine during the broadcast.

2500|$|As a teenager, Nas enlisted {{his best}} friend and upstairs {{neighbor}} Willy [...] "Ill Will" [...] Graham as his DJ. Nas initially went by the nickname [...] "Kid Wave" [...] before adopting his more commonly known alias of [...] "Nasty Nas".

In 1991, Nas performed on Main Source's [...] "Live at the Barbeque". In mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records during the same year. Nas made his solo debut under the name of [...] "Nasty Nas" [...] on the single [...] "Halftime" [...] from MC Serch's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead.

2500|$|Commensurate {{with the}} LGBT rights {{movement}} in other arenas, LGBTQ activists began visibly advocating for greater representation in libraries in 1969. In 1970, the Task Force on Gay Liberation formed within the American Library Association.

2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E

40|$|Semanticists face {{substitution}} challenges even {{outside of}} contexts com-monly recognised as opaque. Jennifer M.
