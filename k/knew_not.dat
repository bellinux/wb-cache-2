25|$|There {{is little}} direct {{evidence}} {{as to the}} kind and amount of knowledge which Pythagoras acquired, or as to his definite philosophical views. Everything of the kind mentioned by Plato and Aristotle is attributed not to Pythagoras, but to the Pythagoreans. Heraclitus stated {{that he was a}} man of extensive learning; and Xenophanes claimed that he believed in the transmigration of souls. Xenophanes mentions the story of his interceding on behalf of a dog that was being beaten, professing to recognise in its cries the voice of a departed friend. Pythagoras is supposed to have claimed that he had been Euphorbus, the son of Panthus, in the Trojan war, as well as various other characters, a tradesman, a courtesan, etc. In his book The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus wrote that Pythagoras <b>knew</b> <b>not</b> only who he was himself, but also who he had been.|$|E
25|$|On Friday 15 October 1926 his HRH The Prince of Wales visited Halifax. It {{was another}} of several visits the Royal Family made to Halifax during Richardson's time in office. Richardson {{continued}} {{to establish his}} reputation of being a good Organiser and Planner. He prepared the Borough Police by devising a booklet of 28 pages. It shows, in detail, {{the route of the}} cars taking part, crowd control, Sergeants in charge of Sections, mounted police positions, roads to be blocked off and timings – to the minute. Everyone taking part had a copy of the booklet so every Policeman on duty <b>knew</b> <b>not</b> only {{what they had to do}} but what other Policemen had to do as well. It had the signature of A.H. Richardson on the cover to prove it was genuine and all copies had to be returned immediately the visit was over. Copies were later sent to other Chief Constables as a template for any Royal Visit they might get.|$|E

The Bermudian effectiveness was such that, when the US sued British privateers for wrongful seizures in British courts, following the war, a sizable part of the damages they were awarded were to have come from Bermudians, like Hezekiah Frith (although, with the local authorities tasked with collecting these damages being in sympathy with the defendants, most of these damages were never paid).|$|E

[...] Charles was more sober and refined than his father, but he was intransigent and deliberately pursued unpopular policies that ultimately brought ruin on himself. Both Charles and James were advocates of the divine right of kings, but while James's ambitions concerning absolute prerogative were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects, Charles believed {{that he had no}} need to compromise or even to explain his actions.

[...] Coddington then deflected Cotton's suggestions that he reform some of his own ideas and [...] "errors in judgment".

500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... {{there was so much}} going on that the perplexed ear <b>knew</b> <b>not</b> where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E
