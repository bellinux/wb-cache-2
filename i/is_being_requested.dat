The north central panel represents the continuation of the ritual in the afterlife, and shows how the events of the game connect the society of El Tajin to the gods. At the center of the scene is a temple with the rain and wind gods seated on top and a vat of liquid within. The sacrificed player appears here, whole and with a pot under his arm. He points to the vat and addresses the rain god. The liquid is protected by a reclining chacmool, who is speaking. [...] What <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>requested</b> is pulque, indicated by a glyph indicating the mythical origin of the drink and a split image of the god of pulque above the scene. On the south central panel is depicting a scene after the sacrificed ball player has received the pulque with the same temple, glyphs and depiction of the pulque god. The differences are a depiction of the moon as a rabbit, the rain god in front of the temple and the level of the liquid in the vat lowered. The rain god is shown in a rite of auto sacrifice running a spike through part of his penis. The blood falls into the vat and to refill it with pulque.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Tutu's {{theology}} fundamentally changed {{as a result}} both of his experiences in Africa and his discovery of liberation theology, a movement introduced {{to him by the}} TEF's associate director for Latin America, Aharon Sapsezian. On discovering black theology, he had been immediately attracted to it, in 1973 attending a conference on the subject at New York City's Union Theological Seminary. There, he presented a paper in which he stated that [...] "black theology is an engaged not an academic, detached theology. It is a gut level theology, relating to the real concerns, the life and death issues of the black man." [...] He stated that his paper was not an attempt to demonstrate the academic respectability of black theology but rather to make [...] "a straightforward, perhaps shrill, statement about an existent. Black theology is. No permission <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>requested</b> for it to come into being... Frankly the time has passed when we will wait for the white man to give us permission to do out thing. Whether or not he accepts the intellectual respectability of our activity is largely irrelevant. We will proceed regardless." [...] Tutu sought to fuse the African-American derived black theology with African theology, an approach which contrasted with that of other African theologians like John Mbiti who regarded black theology as a foreign import not relevant to the African situation.|$|E

I took them at a pace of four miles and a half an hour, and you never beheld such objects as they were when we got back; both smoking like factories, and both obliged to change everything before they could come to dinner. They have the absurdest ideas of what are tests of walking power, and continually get up in the maddest manner and see how high they can kick the wall! The wainscot here, in one place, is scored all over with their pencil-marks. To see them doing this--Dolby, a big man, and Osgood, a very little one, is ridiculous beyond description.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an insurance}} risk model {{that consists of}} two reserves which receive income at fixed rates. Claims <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>requested</b> at random epochs from each reserve and the interclaim times are generally distributed. The two reserves are coupled {{in the sense that}} at a claim arrival epoch, claims <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>requested</b> from both reserves and the amounts requested are correlated. In addition, the claim amounts are correlated with the time elapsed since the previous claim arrival. We focus on the probability that this bivariate reserve process survives indefinitely. The infinite- horizon survival problem is shown {{to be related to the}} problem of determining the equilibrium distribution of a random walk with vector-valued increments with reflecting boundary. This reflected random walk is actually the waiting time process in a queueing system dual to the bivariate ruin process. Under assumptions on the arrival process and the claim amounts, and using Wiener-Hopf factor- ization with one parameter, we explicitly determine the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the survival function, c. q., the two-dimensional equilibrium waiting time distribution. Finally, the bivariate transforms are evaluated for some examples, including for proportional reinsurance, and the bivariate ruin functions are numerically calculated using an efficient inversion scheme.
