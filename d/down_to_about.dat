5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} Main Stand used a propped {{cantilever roof}} design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' {{view of the}} pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had {{been put on the}} Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 55,000.|$|E

5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Barbirolli {{made another}} Atlantic crossing, {{avoiding}} {{death by a}} fluke: he changed flights with the actor Leslie Howard when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli's plane landed safely; Howard's was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players in the orchestra was <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 30. Most younger players were serving in the armed forces, and to compound the shortage {{the management of the}} orchestra had ended the arrangement by which many of its players were also members of the BBC Northern Orchestra. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must follow the example of the Liverpool Philharmonic, which the Hallé's former conductor Malcolm Sargent had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the upper Naktong valley {{at the end}} of July, the North Korean divisions engaged {{in this part of the}} drive southward had suffered heavy casualties. The NK 1st Division in battling across the Mun'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack. Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch'ang {{at the end of}} July it was down to 3,000 men from the 5,500 it had before the push. The NK 15th Division, according to prisoners, also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK troops and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, and was <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 5,000 men at the end of July, from 7,500 before the fight. In contrast, the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties.|$|E

5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E
5|$|With the North Koreans {{turned back}} north of Taegu, Walker issued {{orders for the}} 27th Infantry to leave the Bowling Alley {{and return to the}} 25th Division in the Masan area. The ROK 1st Division was to assume {{responsibility}} for the Bowling Alley, but the 23rd Infantry was to remain north of Taegu in its support. ROK relief of the 27th Infantry began at 18:00, 25 August, and continued throughout the night until completed at 03:45 August 26. Survivors of the 1st Regiment, KPA 1st Division, joined the rest of that division in the mountains east of the Taegu–Sangju road near the walled summit of Ka-san. Prisoners reported that the 1st Regiment was <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 400 men and had lost all its 120mm mortars, 76mm howitzers, and antitank guns {{as a result of its}} action on the east flank of the KPA 13th Division at the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|At {{daylight}} on {{the morning}} of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive. As the day passed, with ammunition <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night. When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying {{that he did not want}} to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.|$|E

5|$|During {{location}} scouting in December 2010, Nolan {{began searching}} for locations such as India, Romania, and Michigan. According to the Romania Insider, Nolan {{was interested in}} Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine. The film had an estimated budget of $250–300 million, coming <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> $230 million after tax credits. Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated {{that he intended to}} focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes). Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. Wally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX, but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35mm and 70mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes, as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX planned to run the film in its theatres for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks. Nolan also bypassed the use of a digital intermediate for the film, resulting in less manipulation of the filmed image and higher film resolution.|$|E

25|$|Addition of {{fluorine}} {{lowers the}} dielectric constant of glass. Fluorine is highly electronegative and attracts the electrons in the lattice, lowering the polarizability of the material. Such silicon dioxide-fluoride {{is used in}} manufacture of integrated circuits as an insulator. High levels of fluorine doping lead to formation of volatile SiF2O and such glass is then thermally unstable. Stable layers were achieved with dielectric constant <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 3.5–3.7.|$|E
