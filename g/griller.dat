There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack <b>Griller,</b> made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II.

2500|$|The {{product was}} {{introduced}} {{at a point}} of massive change for the company; besides the new broiler system that was being introduced, the company was also adding an entirely new product holding system designed {{to improve the quality}} of its products. Burger King was also tinkering with its menu in regards to other products, adding the <b>Griller</b> and a new veggie burger sandwich along with changes to its grilled chicken offerings, onion rings and milkshakes. The company had high hopes for the product at the time of introduction; same store sales for the company had been falling for at least five years resulting in lagging market share and decreased customer counts. The failure of the product left a hole in the company's menu, leaving it without the premium product side of its barbell strategy at a point where parent Diageo was trying to build up the chain's value to maximize the profit in the upcoming sales to the Texas Pacific Group. This failure was part of a series of events that deteriorated the chain's financial performance and eventually forced Diageo to drop its selling price for the chain from [...] to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The chain's {{first major}} attempt {{was part of}} their Specialty Sandwich line that was {{introduced}} in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After {{the failure of the}} Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch <b>Griller</b> sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales {{due in part to the}} patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state [...] "Angus" [...] in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.|$|E
2500|$|The Back Porch Grillers were {{introduced}} in 2002 {{as part of a}} plan to increase the company's sales ahead of the upcoming sale of Burger King from then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by Texas Pacific Group (TPG). In its press release announcing the product, Burger King stated the intent of the burgers was to evoke the taste of a grilled burger that one would cook at home. At the time of launch there were two flavors of the sandwich, the Homestyle and the Smokehouse Cheddar, both served on a [...] "bakery-style" [...] bun. A third type, the Black Strap BBQ <b>Griller,</b> was introduced as a product tie-in with Men in Black II two weeks later. Initial testing of the sandwich led to favorable scoring in customer surveys and a roughly 15% increase in sales without compromising the sales of other products such as the Whopper. Due to the favorable results in testing, the company pushed up the introduction of the sandwich nationally. However, the product was statemented into two variants due to the company's introduction of its new broiler line; these new broilers were designed to allow a greater flexibility of products with different cooking times and heat settings which allowed the company to sell thicker burgers that required more cooking times. At the time of the sandwiches' introduction, the new broiler units had only been introduced to about one tenth of its North American stores. In these stores the sandwich was made with a single, thicker [...] patty; in those locations with the older units, the company used a pair of thinner [...] patties in a double burger sandwich. The use of the thinner patties resulted in numerous customer complaints that the sandwich was dry and not as tasteful as the thicker patty version.|$|E

5000|$|The {{area around}} Pass-a-Grille has been {{inhabited}} by Native Americans {{for thousands of}} years and was first spotted by Spanish explorers in 1528 when PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez anchored off Pass-a-Grille pass. Local legend states that it was named from the French phrase Passe Aux Grilleurs (the passageway of the <b>grillers)</b> in honor of the fisherman who used to camp there. John Gomez was one on the first entrepreneurs to utilize Pass-A-Grille Beach as a vacation area, inviting travelers from St. Petersburg and Tampa to stay at his resort-like structure as early as 1857. Some of the first major businessmen in the area were Roy S. Hanna and Selwyn Morey, who began developing plots of land for homes and lodgings at Pass-A-Grille Beach. By 1901, Frenchman and Travel Agent, George Henri Lizotte, opened the first Pass-A-Grille hotel, named Bonhomie. The first schoolhouse in Pass-a-Grille was constructed in 1914 at the cost of $1,000 and opened its doors to students in the winter of 1915. Pass-a-Grille was eventually incorporated into the city of St. Pete Beach in 1957, and in 1989 Pass-a-Grille was recognized as a National Register Historic District.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies (FBs) discovered in adults {{are the result}} of intentional ingestion, most of which are found in patients with a preexisting psychiatric illness, with substance abuse disorders, or in people seeking secondary gain. No similar case of internal injuries following unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle has been reported. A 58 -year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill cleaning brush. The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a barbecue grill cleaning brush bristle atypically presenting with halitosis. Physiciansâ awareness of this potential injury from grill cleaning brush bristles would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid <b>grillers</b> must be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill cleaning brush. Appropriate history taking, considering GI causes as potentially inducing halitosis, and an awareness of this entity among providers are important to facilitate prompt diagnoses and prevent major adverse outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes Anglophone South African dramatic {{critiques of}} national crises in the post-apartheid moment. Focusing {{specifically on the}} years after Nelson Mandelaâs retirement, it examines some of the countryâs prominent plays produced between 2001 and 2014. This was an important period {{of social and political}} change in South Africa, described by drama theorist Marcia Blumberg as a second interregnum where acts of reconciliation or disaffection were staged frequently (âReconcilingâ 140). I build on Blumbergâs temporal model by extending her framework to account for recent events of national significance leading up to, and including, Mandelaâs death in 2013. In addition to expanding her temporal framework, this project contributes new research on second interregnum drama by examining the rise of humour as a key component of the social and political criticism occurring in works from this period. My project is divided into four research chapters that highlight major challenges curtailing reconciliation and nation-building during this time: continuing class inequality, silence around mothersâ experiences of trauma during apartheid, ethnic minoritiesâ feelings of exclusion from national narratives, and continuing cycles of physical and psychological violence. Drama is an important barometer {{of the state of the}} nation. During apartheid, it was often used to oppose the state by staging âsites of conflict between different discoursesâ (Orkin 5). In the second interregnum drama continued to play a significant role in critiquing conditions by highlighting unaddressed areas of class, gender, and racial inequality. Playwrights in this period used drama to engage contemporary audiences in South Africa, and abroad, in order to encourage social change through debate and dialogue. This project analyzes the appearance of humour in second interregnum drama and the way it foregrounded unresolved tensions in the nation, especially discrepancies between personal and national narratives, and provided alternative ways of dealing with them. Moments of laughter emerge throughout the plays in this dissertation to challenge state discourses, critique social conditions, but also encourage expressions of unity through instances of collective laughter. Mapping key intersections between postcolonial studies and humour, this project provides new analysis of Pieter-Dirk Uysâs MacBeki: A Farce to be Reckoned With, Greig Coetzeeâs Happy Natives, Fatima Dikeâs The Return, Lara Foot Newtonâs Reach, Ashwin Singhâs To House, Ntokozo Madlala and Mandisa Haarhoffâs Crush-hopper, Zakes Mdaâs The Bells of Amersfoort, and David Peimer and Martina <b>Grillerâs</b> Armed Response...|$|R
