5000|$|Denys Fisher/Mego {{released}} {{a selection of}} 9" [...] figures in the mid-1970s, including the Fourth Doctor, Leela, K-9 (released in 1978 after the first six), the Giant Robot, a Cyberman, a Dalek, and a TARDIS. The Dalek and K-9 have friction drives to allow for movement. The TARDIS has a self-propelled spinning top. The Doctor could be inserted into the TARDIS and the [...] "light" [...] on top was spun. If the red button was hit while the top was spinning, the Doctor [...] "disappeared". If the green button was hit, the Doctor re-appeared. These toys are all extremely rare and difficult to find, especially in near mint or mint condition. The Tom Baker figure {{is the most common}} and can be found in an English or Italian box. A mint (or near mint) Baker figure with the box is worth between $150-500, depending on quality of the figure and the box. The Tom Baker figure with the Italian box is more common (and may sell for as little as $75-200). The other figures, excluding the TARDIS, are worth $500-1200 if they are in near mint quality and have their original box, even if the box is damaged. In May 2006, a Denys Fisher Dalek with box sold for over $1150 on eBay. The TARDIS is usually a bit cheaper at $200-350 (provided it has no damage or any repairs are not noticeable and the box is included). Of course, this is relative and eBay auctions can vary considerably. While a mint Leela may sell for $500-600, one without a box may only sell for $150-200. That said, some items are so rare that even a damaged item, or one with missing pieces, is worth a fair amount. For example, in May 2006, a Leela doll without her loin cloth (and correspondingly, without the attached pouches and knife) but with her original, but highly damaged box, sold for over $350. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> competition, timing and if serious bidding is occurring. Nonetheless, considering these toys sold in the UK for under GBP £10 in the 1970s, their value has gone up nearly 10- to 100-fold and will most likely continue to rise due to the popularity of the new Doctor Who series. Some stress cracks due to time and cannot be avoided, but more serious cracks or discolouration will decrease the value considerably. The more damaged the item is, obviously, the less it is worth. These are very simple toys, as none require batteries, have any flashing lights or speak, but they have become quite collectible. The rarity of the boxes (or high quality boxes) has led to people selling box reproductions. These reproduced boxes can be an alternative as they are less expensive than finding a figure with the original box, although true collectors may not appreciate them. Be sure to ask if the box is original or a reproduction. Along those lines, some of these toys can be repaired. The TARDIS [...] "light" [...] and doors easily broke, but repairs by those with ingenuity or toy-repair skills can be done. Simply re-glueing the light or the doors rarely works for this toy, so more advanced repairs are needed. Flaking damage on the Cyberman suit can be repaired using a high quality silver paint for fabric. Dust on many figures can be removed by air-blown sprays or delicate washing. Leela's hair can be repaired by combing, conditioning and steam-cleaning. Delicate repainting can also be done on some figures. The key is to do just enough repairs, without ruining the essence of the original. Any repair work should be noted in ads (often a seller will simply sell the damaged item and leave repairs to the buyer). If unsure, ask the seller. The Denys Fisher K-9 or Dalek may be initially confused with the talking Palitoy K-9 or Dalek toys. The Palitoy talking toys were {{released a}}round the same time and are also quite collectable. Finding a good quality talking K-9 or Dalek, that speak at a [...] "normal" [...] speed and have their original boxes, can cost anywhere from $200-500. Even without the box, the toy could be worth $100-150 if in good speaking condition. If the toys do not speak, their value drops considerably (not more than $50-100 for a non-speaking Dalek). A working Palitoy K-9 is more rare and may be more costly. Both toys speak via a small vinyl record that is inside or near the battery compartment. The K-9 record is inside the battery compartment and the record can be flipped over, giving K-9 more phrases. The Dalek record is buried within the toy and cannot be removed. The Palitoy K-9 is considerably larger than the Denys Fisher line, so the two cannot be confused when visually compared. The Palitoy Dalek is considerably different from the Denys Fisher Dalek, although it is similar in size. The Palitoy Dalek came in red with black Dalek [...] "spots" [...] or [...] "bumps" [...] and in silver-grey with blue [...] "bumps". The silver/blue Dalek is a bit more rare. Both Palitoy Daleks had black extremities, with a red end on the eye and red suction cup. The Denys Fisher Dalek is also silver/blue, but has a red head and a blue eye piece (with silver gun and suction cup). Palitoy toys also tended to rust and crack.|$|E

This thesis is about implementation of interactive web comic toward modern design using Adobe Muse and Edge Animate. This methods is suitable for person who doesn't know well about website programming. This is the time for comic artist to have their own website rather using blogging site as an alternative approach. The challenging of comic world today is how comic maker find a new approach to bring a new spirit and increase the reader satisfaction when read a comic. Additional criteria to enhance a comic is relevan on this era. Comic maker sometimes need a new effective approach toward comic development and reader sometimes need a special experience when read a comic. Not just a still comic, but maybe has a animate picture, music, interact button and etc. That criteria forces comic maker to develop something useful on their comic, absolutely for increase the reader satisfaction.

6000|$|What <b>it</b> <b>really</b> came to, on the morrow, {{this first}} time--the time Kate went with her--was {{that the great}} man had, a little, to excuse himself; had, by a rare accident--for he kept his consulting-hours in general rigorously free--but ten minutes to give her; ten mere minutes which he yet placed at her service {{in a manner that}} she admired even more than she could meet it: so crystal-clean the great empty cup of {{attention}} that he set between them on the table. He was presently to jump into his carriage, but he promptly made the point that he must see her again, see her within a day or two; and he named for her at once another hour--easing her off beautifully too even then in respect to her possibly failing of justice to her errand. The minutes affected her in fact as ebbing more swiftly than her little army of items could muster, and they would probably have gone without her doing much more than secure another hearing, {{had it not been for}} her sense, at the last, that she had gained above all an impression. The impression--all the sharp growth of the final few moments--was neither more nor less than that she might make, of a sudden, in quite another world, another straight friend, and a friend who would moreover be, wonderfully, the most appointed, the most thoroughly adjusted of the whole collection, inasmuch as he would somehow wear the character scientifically, ponderably, proveably--not just loosely and sociably. Literally, furthermore, <b>it</b> wouldn't <b>really</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> herself, Sir Luke Strett's friendship, in the least; perhaps what made her most stammer and pant was its thus queerly coming over her that she might find she had interested him even beyond her intention, find she was in fact launched in some current that would lose itself in the sea of science. At the same time that she struggled, however, she also surrendered; there was a moment at which she almost dropped the form of stating, of explaining, and threw herself, without violence, only with a supreme pointless quaver that had turned, the next instant, to an intensity of interrogative stillness, upon his general goodwill. His large, settled face, though firm, was not, as she had thought at first, hard; he looked, in the oddest manner, to her fancy, half like a general and half like a bishop, and she was soon sure that, within some such handsome range, what it would show her would be what was good, what was best for her. She had established, in other words, in this time-saving way, a relation with it; and the relation was the special trophy that, for the hour, she bore off. It was like an absolute possession, a new resource altogether, something done up in the softest silk and tucked away under the arm of memory. She hadn't had it when she went in, and she had it when she came out; she had it there under her cloak, but dissimulated, invisibly carried, when smiling, smiling, she again faced Kate Croy. That young lady had of course awaited her in another room, where, as the great man was to absent himself, no one else was in attendance; and she rose for her with such a face of sympathy as might have graced the vestibule of a dentist.

Cloud computing is all about services of various levels based upon Internet or Intranet including Software-as-a- Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). The most wonderful part of what's happening around the web and cloud computing is being able to expose data in a very pervasive, scalable and uniform way. Enterprises around the world can expose their data through web services loose-coupling and efficiently, in which way we can build more powerful and interesting applications once data is liberated from different organizations. WS-* and REpresentational State Transfer (REST) as two dominant integration methodologies are supporting implementation of those web services, which is being used to supply widespread cloud services. Objective & Method: This paper introduces a design-oriented case study with objective of evaluating new integration technology REpresentational State Transfer (REST) and how to design and development RESTful web services on Software-as-a-Server (SaaS) in the cloud environment based on evaluation from software architecture‘s perspective. In addition to, the paper presents security solution for RESTful Web services as well as some critical decisions and main concerns for implementation of successful and real RESTful web services. Meanwhile, the paper reports on literature study about cloud computing and theoretical comparison between two integration methodologies – REpresentational State Transfer and WS-*. Results: A RESTful web service will be designed and implemented to show that REST as cloud-based integration method can be used to support cloud services. And a qualitative comprehensive comparison will be contacted during research as well to answer why {{there are more and more}} RESTful web services on web currently. Conclusion: Based on study on cloud computing, web service, integration method, and implementation of RESTful web services as well as comprehensive comparison between two most popular integration methods REST and WS-*, we found that REST has a bunch of advantages of many areas, but not perfect, which shows that there is no permanent best solution of building applications, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> our requirements...|$|E
