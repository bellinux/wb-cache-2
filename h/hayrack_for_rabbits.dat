50|$|The acute {{toxicity}} of citrinin {{depends on the}} route of administration and on the species used for the research. Oral administration required the highest dose for lethality and the LD50 of this administration route is 134 mg/kg bodyweight (b.w.) <b>for</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Intravenous administration required the lowest dose for lethality. The LD50 is 19 mg/kg b.w. <b>for</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Intraperitoneal the LD50 is 50 mg/kg b.w. <b>for</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Subcutaneous the LD50 is 37 mg/kg b.w. for guinea-pig.
