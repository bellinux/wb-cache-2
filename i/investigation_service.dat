500|$|The {{number of}} police districts was nearly {{constant}} from 1894 to 2002, {{although a few}} have been creased and closed. However, the organization in the various police districts varied considerably, especially in the cities.

This was confusing for the public, resulting in the police services reorganizing to a homogenous organization during the 1980s, whereby the civil tasks being organized as part of the police stations. Økokrim was established in 1988 and in 1994 the administrative responsibilities for the sheriff's offices was transferred to police districts.

According to the [...] "detention review synopsis" [...] filed by Crown prosecutor Major Marylene Trudel, Afghan soldiers found a man whose wounds [...] "appeared too severe for any type of treatment in situ" [...] and disarmed him.

The document states that [...] "After evaluating all available evidence, the prosecution believes that it was Captain Semrau who fired both shots, that these shots resulted in the death of the severely wounded insurgent and that Captain Semrau had no lawful justification for shooting the severely wounded insurgent". The prosecution also claimed that it would produce a witness who would testify that he saw Semrau shoot the wounded man. The body of the man was left behind {{at the scene of the}} ambush and was never found. Major Trudel added that the charges against Captain Semrau could change and that the prosecution was [...] "still a step behind that process." ...|$|E
