50|$|A <b>full</b> <b>anneal</b> {{typically}} {{results in}} the second most ductile state a metal can assume for metal alloy. Its purpose is to originate a uniform and stable microstructure that most closely resembles the metal's phase diagram equilibrium microstructure, thus letting the metal attain relatively low levels of hardness, yield strength and ultimate strength with high plasticity and toughness. To perform a <b>full</b> <b>anneal</b> on a steel for example, steel is heated to slightly above the austenitic temperature and held for sufficient time to allow the material to fully form austenite or austenite-cementite grain structure. The material is then allowed to cool very slowly so that the equilibrium microstructure is obtained. In most cases this means the material is allowed to furnace cool (the furnace is turned off and the steel is let cool down inside) {{but in some cases}} it's air cooled. The cooling rate of the steel has to be sufficiently slow so as to not let the austenite transform into bainite or martensite, but rather have it completely transform to pearlite and ferrite or cementite. This means that steels that are very hardenable (i.e. tend to form martensite under moderately low cooling rates) have to be furnace cooled. The details of the process depend on the type of metal and the precise alloy involved. In any case the result is a more ductile material but a lower yield strength and a lower tensile strength. This process is also called LP annealing for lamellar pearlite in the steel industry as opposed to a process anneal, which does not specify a microstructure and only has the goal of softening the material. Often the material to be machined is annealed, and then subject to further heat treatment to achieve the final desired properties.|$|E

The findings indicate that plastic deformation increases with rolling pressure and number of passes due to more intense cold working and that under identical deep rolling conditions the fully annealed material presents more severe deformation than the subcritically annealed samples. Moreover, the ability of deep rolling to increase surface hardness decreases with the elevation of the hardness of the original material. The values of the yield and ultimate tensile strength were affected in different manners by deep rolling depending on work material condition and the tensile residual stresses observed after turning were converted into compressive values by deep rolling.

It is able to include three effects, namely the third deviatoric stress invariant, anisotropy and the Bauschinger effect. Experimental evaluation is made on A 1050 aluminum tubes under multiaxial stress states. The tubing used has undergone progressive deformation such as extruding, plug drawing and stretching in the industrial forming process. For this reason, it has orthotropic anisotropy even after <b>full</b> <b>annealing,</b> and the initial yield locus in the tension-torsion stress field lies outside von Mises’ yield locus. Reloading tests by means of both combined axial load (tension and compression) -torsion and combined axial load-internal pressure-torsion are carried out on the fully annealed tubes subjected to prestrains in tension, torsion and combined tension-torsion. By determining the subsequent yield loci in various principal stress planes, the change in yield stress with a rotation of the principal stress axes is examined. Consequently, it is shown that anisotropic hardening (expansion, distortion and rotation of the locus) superposed kinematic hardening (translation) can be expressed precisely by the proposed yield function. words: A 1050 aluminum, Tensile prestrain, Torsional prestrain, Combined prestrain, Yield locus, Subsequent yield function...|$|R

Critically refracted longitudinal (LCR) waves have been investigated as a possible technique for the evaluation of the residual stress gradients present in ductile iron castings. Residual stresses are likely to develop in ductile cast iron during the cooling phase of a casting process. A LCR probe fabricated for previous research was used to make the velocity measurements.

Higher notch angles give lower fracture toughness and lower notch diameter gives lower fracture load. For 60 ° angle, lower notch diameter give higher fracture toughness. For 80 ° angle, lower notch diameter give lower fracture toughness. Microstructure of steel has the strong influence on the value of K 1 C. The finer grain structure has been found to have higher value of K 1 C than a coarse and wider grained structure. Non heat treated samples are stronger and harder but for the heat treatmeent sample it is softer and brittle...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Present work {{corresponds}} to the research on the kinetics of phase transformation of undercooled austenite of three Cr-Mn-Mo models alloys with a different carbon content. The kinetics of phase transformation of undercooled austenite of investigated alloys was presented on CTT diagrams. Also the methodology of a dilatometric samples preparation and the method of the critical points determination were described. Design/methodology/approach: The austenitizing temperature was assumed, in a standard way, which means higher by 50 °C than Ac 3 temperature for W I and W II alloys and 50 °C higher than Ac 1 f temperature for W III alloy. The first melt underwent the normalizing annealing and for the second melt the <b>full</b> <b>annealing</b> was proposed. For W III alloy the technology of soft annealing was proposed. The CCT diagrams were made {{on the grounds of}} dilatograms recorded for samples cooled with various rates. The microstructure of each dilatometric sample was photographed after its cooling to the room temperature and the sample hardness was measured. Findings: The most noticeable influence of the increased carbon concentration in the investigated Cr-Mn-Mo alloys is increasing the austenite stability range within the bainitic transformation (but only up to 0. 30 %C) and increasing the pearlite fraction. Along with the carbon concentration increase only the Ms temperature systematically decreases. Research limitations/implications: The investigated alloys are the models alloys. Taking into account their chemical compositions the possibility of improving their properties by means of the heat treatment can be expected. In the first place the kinetics of phase transformations during tempering should be investigated. Practical implications: Broadening the knowledge on the carbon influence in Cr-Mn-Mo alloys, which will help in designing new alloys with better properties. Originality/value: The carbon influence on structures and properties of model alloys with Cr-Mn-Mo were undertaken...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{hydraulic}} bulging experiments were respectively carried out using AA 6016 -T 4 aluminum alloy and AA 6016 -O aluminum alloy, and the deformation properties and fracture mechanism of aluminum alloy under {{the conditions of}} thermal and hydraulic were analyzed. Firstly, the aluminum alloy AA 6016 was dealt with two kinds of heat treatment systems such as solid solution heat treatment adding natural ageing and <b>full</b> <b>annealing,</b> then the aluminum alloy such as AA 6016 -T 4 and AA 6016 -O were obtained. In the same working environment, the two kinds of materials {{were used in the}} process of hydraulic bulging experiments, according to the observation and measurement of the deformation sizes of grid circles and material thicknesses near the fracture region, the flow properties and development trend of fracture defect of the materials were analyzed comprehensively from the perspective of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis; Secondly, the two kinds of materials were sampled in different regions of the fracture area and the microstructure morphology of the fracture was observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The influence laws of the heat treatment systems on the fracture defect of the aluminum alloy under the condition of the liquid pressure were studied preliminarily by observing the distribution characteristics of the fracture microstructure morphology of dimple. At the same time, the experimental research on the ordinary stamping forming process of AA 6016 -O was carried out and the influence law of different forming process on the fracture defect of the aluminum alloy material was studied by observing the distribution of the fracture microstructure morphology; Finally, the development process of the fracture defect of aluminum alloy sheet was described theoretically from the view of the stress state...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{diffused}} x-cut {{lithium niobate}} samples {{have been studied}} from a structural point of view by ion beam analysis techniques in channeling conditions. The aim of this work {{is to determine the}} most probable position of iron atoms after high temperature diffusion treatment in pure oxygen atmosphere and to verify their location after an additional <b>full</b> reducing <b>annealing</b> at low temperature. The results are compared with the bulk doping case that can be considered the final equilibrium state of the diffusion process. By comparing the iron signal with niobium and lithium counterparts in angular scans along proper crystallographic directions, we demonstrate that iron occupies in any case the lithium site or a very close position regardless of the reduction degree, just {{as in the case of}} bulk doped samples...|$|R
40|$|Tectono-thermal {{evolution}} of {{the northern part of}} Central Western Carpathians (Slovakia) was revealed by zircon and apatite fission track thermochronology of Neogene deposits, volcanic rocks, and crystalline basement. New fission track ages combined with previous geochronological data are correlated with main tectonic events and important palaeogeographic changes. (1) The palaeo-Alpine burial to more than 10. km depths, heating (> 320 °C) and low-grade metamorphism of the crystalline basement was caused by crustal thickening due to nappe stacking driven by the collisional processes (~. 90 - 75. Ma). (2) Extensional collapse and exhumation of basement complexes during the Late Cretaceous to Middle Eocene (~. 75 - 40. Ma). (3) The extension process resulted in a new sedimentary cycle of the Central Carpathian Palaeogene Basin (~. 40 - 25. Ma) {{in the northern part of}} the Central Western Carpathians. During the ensuing burial under the thick sedimentary cover, the crystalline basement of the northern zone resided at 'hotter' conditions (ca > 120 °C and < 200 °C) which led to <b>full</b> <b>annealing</b> of apatite single-grain ages. In the meanwhile the southern zone of the crystalline basement was gradually exhumed to the depth of 5 - 3. km and occasionally appeared at the erosion surface. (4) Disintegration of the Central Carpathian Palaeogene Basin (~. 25 - 20. Ma) was closely connected with a partial exhumation of the Central Western Carpathians and intensive denudation. (5) The Middle to Late Miocene (~. 20 - 9. Ma) subduction of the Outer Carpathians substratum had crucial consequences for the tectonic {{evolution of}} the hinterland that was located in the upper crustal plate. The most external zone of the hinterland basement domain (Lúčanská and Krivánska Fatra Mts.) was exhumed to the 5 - 3. km depth and the intramontane basins were opened.

40|$|Our work {{focuses on}} an {{analysis}} of the processes for <b>full</b> and partial <b>annealing</b> of aluminium coils. Due to inefficient production management these processes show high inventory levels, long lead times and decreased delivery performance. We have also found inadequacies in the ways costs for these processes are distributed. We have established a new process mapping by initially investigating the strategic dimensions of the company and the processes for annealing, in order to later on establish performance measures congruent with the business objectives. Furthermore we have conducted extensive calculations and analyses to facilitate the successful implementation of a Just-in-time production philosophy, including necessary process improvements and redesigns to be made. Our proposed changes will lead to shorter lead times and low levels of WIP, which are important success factors of a JIT-based production philosophy. To do this we have developed a capacity analysis tool with which it is also possible to analyse other processing scenarios or the effect of load changes and/or product mix variations. This tool can also serve as a benchmark for capacity analysis of other processes. Finally, {{we have been able to}} establish more accurate costs per machine hour for <b>full</b> and partial <b>annealing</b> to be implemented in the managerial system. We believe that the processes for annealing are not the only ones suffering from poor cost control, why we would suggest that Sapa Heat Transfer investigates the cost distribution in more processes, and also develops and follows better guidelines for cost control...|$|R
