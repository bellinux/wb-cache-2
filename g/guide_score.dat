40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of social {{maladjustment}} at age 11 on adult employment probability. Social maladjustment is measured according to the British Social Adjustment <b>Guide</b> <b>score</b> provided by the National Child Development Study that also provides information on cohort-members both in childhood and adulthood, including current employment status and past working history. The econometric method consists in a dynamic probit model with unobserved heterogeneity accounting for true state dependence and initial conditions problem. Consistently with the previous literature, we find that social maladjustment during childhood determines a lower employment probability in adulthood. This result holds also after controlling for true state dependence and past working history. Interestingly, the adult employment probability of socially maladjusted children is prone to greater variability according to life experiences than that of socially adjusted children. We find that being employed in the previous period, education, young-adulthood working experiences and, for females, early working experiences increases the adult employment probability for all cohort-members. However the positive effect is stronger for socially maladjusted children and, overall, investment in higher education seems to be relevant. This suggests that interventions during life development for socially maladjusted children could be important to reduce inequality in adult employment probability. ...|$|E

Also {{the differences in the}} number of assessments administered and marked with the use of <b>guided</b> <b>scoring</b> and without its use were examined. The design of the study is quasi-experimental utilizing pre-test post –test non equivalent group. A sample of three hundred and thirty six senior secondary class one students were selected from three school types in Umuahia education zone of Abia State with experimental and control groups constituted in each school. Data obtained from pre-test and post –test were statistically analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). With gain scores of- 1. 99 and 20. 26 (40. 8 %) for Control and Experimental groups respectively, the work indicates that <b>Guided</b> <b>Scoring</b> improved the problem solving skills of students and enhanced their performance in Mathematics. The F-ratio of 398. 808 is shown to be significant at 1 % level, further confirming that students exposed to <b>guided</b> <b>scoring</b> instructional strategy significantly out performed those who were not exposed to the strategy. Also the teacher administered and marked more continuous assessments with the use of <b>guided</b> <b>scoring</b> with a total score of 12 for control group and 20 for experimental group. The findings of this study will help lessen the burden of continuous assessment on teachers, increase the frequency of continuous assessment and thereby improve efficiency in teaching and learning o...|$|R

Preplanning movement in conducting may be one way to widen the student's vocabulary of gesture and promote motor awareness. To test the difference between <b>guided</b> <b>score</b> study and <b>guided</b> <b>score</b> study with preplanned intentional movement on the conducting gestures of novice conductors, undergraduate music students (N = 20) were {{assigned to one of}} two conditions and then evaluated on their conducting performance. In the first condition, score study with preplanned intentional gestures, students assigned and practiced specific gestures to the articulations, dynamics, cues, texture, and phrase shapes. In the second condition, score study only, students were guided through the piece in terms of form, articulation, dynamics, orchestration, and texture, discussing the sound of the ensemble only. All participants were video recorded conducting the piece with an university instrumental ensemble. Performances were evaluated by four conducting experts on gestures of dynamics, articulation, cues, releases and phrasing. Analysis of the mean scores for each rating revealed {{no significant differences between the}} two conditions. Analysis of post-conducting interview transcriptions revealed several factors that may have contributed to the results of the conducting performances. For example, many of the score study only participants were silently matching their movements to the musical decisions being made...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to bring about a reevaluation of writing assessment practices in engineering classes. The authors begin by drawing rhetoric (the knowledge base of effective technical communication) and engineering together, explaining how engineering work is rhetorical. From this theoretical vantage point, the authors argue for a change in engineering writing assessment practices. Specifically, they argue for an approach that favors formative assessment (focused on writing comments that lead to both better writing and better engineering) over summative assessment (which sees writing ability as separate from engineering design). The authors continue by revealing a <b>scoring</b> <b>guide</b> for the formative assessment of engineering reports, and detailing the process by which such a <b>scoring</b> <b>guide</b> may be created. Each criterion in the <b>scoring</b> <b>guide</b> is explained in terms of the rhetorical and engineering principles that it simultaneously addresses...|$|R
