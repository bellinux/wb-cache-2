5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>contemporary</b> contexts, {{have been born}} and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined {{using a variety of}} distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.|$|E
5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>contemporary</b> figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E

25|$|Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – April 18, 1967) was an American philosopher of science. Hanson was {{a pioneer}} in {{advancing}} the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>contemporary</b> comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} held by most Brethren, both <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>contemporary,</b> {{there have}} always been some Brethren who rejected Dispensationalism.

Until much more recently, however, Dispensationalism was much more universally held among Brethren outside of the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} of series {{inspirational}} romances debuted shortly after the 1980 U.S. presidential election, when Silhouette launched their Silhouette Inspirations line. The books were aimed at born-again Christians and were marketed in religious bookstores. The Silhouette Inspirations line was closed after Harlequin acquired Silhouette in 1984 {{because it was not}} profitable. However, other Christian publishers continued to produce romance novels, including <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>contemporary,</b> and Harlequin later rejoined the market with the 1998 launch of its Steeple Hill and Love Inspired lines.|$|E
25|$|The Nigerian society (both <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>contemporary)</b> {{has been}} dotted with {{peculiar}} cultural {{practices that are}} potently hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices. As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.|$|E
