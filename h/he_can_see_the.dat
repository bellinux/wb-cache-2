5|$|As {{the week}} goes on, {{the people in}} the cabin are running out of food, while Satoru is {{subjected}} to multiple attempts on his life by an unknown assailant. As days pass, Satoru notices that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> same lunar phase at SPHIA and at the cabin and that both areas are surrounded by a body of water. It is revealed that the Yuni in the cabin is from the year 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E
25|$|Further {{along in}} the journey, Raval reappears: dying of the plague, he pleads for water. The servant girl {{attempts}} to bring him some, but Jöns stops her, and Raval dies alone and uncomforted. Jof tells his wife that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> knight playing chess with Death, and decides to flee with his family while Death is preoccupied.|$|E
25|$|Flushed with victory, {{the knight}} kneels and renders thanks to heaven. Seeing the moon, {{he takes it}} for his Dulcinea and tries to get to her. As he {{approaches}} the windmills <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> moon no longer and thinks that evil magicians have hidden his beloved mistress. So, spear in hand, he tilts at {{the wings of the}} windmill, which he mistakes for a giant. Alas, the knight is caught by one of the wings and flung into the air. He falls unconscious at Sancho's feet.|$|E

25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means {{one of the two}} other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E
500|$|Tolkien takes {{a moment}} to dismiss another criticism, that monsters {{should not have been}} made to appear in both halves. He replies <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> point of no monsters, but not in {{complaining}} about their mere numbers; the poet could not, he argues, have balanced Beowulf's rise to fame through a war in Frisia, against death by dragon. Similarly, he dismisses notions that the poem is primitive: it is instead a late poem, using materials left over from a vanished age: ...|$|E
500|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu {{takes the}} form of the enchantress, Mohini, in order to trick the demons into giving up Amrita, the elixir of life. Shiva later becomes {{attracted}} to Mohini and spills his semen on the rocks which turn into gold. In the Brahmanda Purana, Shiva's wife Parvati [...] "hangs her head in shame" [...] when she sees her husband's pursuit of Mohini. In some stories Shiva asks Vishnu to take on the Mohini form again so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> actual transformation for himself. Stories in which Shiva knows of Mohini's true nature have been interpreted to [...] "suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction".|$|E

50|$|The driver {{will then}} proceed at caution, {{at a speed}} which enables him to stop within <b>the</b> {{distance}} that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> to be clear.

500|$|In the Brahmanda Purana {{when the}} {{wandering}} sage Narada tells Shiva about Vishnu's Mohini form that deluded the demons, Shiva dismisses him. Shiva {{and his wife}} Parvati go to Vishnu's home. Shiva asks him {{to take on the}} Mohini form again so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> actual transformation for himself. Vishnu smiles, again meditates on the Goddess, and in place of Vishnu stands the gorgeous Mohini. Overcome by lust, Shiva chases Mohini as Parvati hangs her head in shame and envy. Shiva grabs Mohini's hand and embraces her, but Mohini frees herself and runs further. Finally, Shiva grabs her and their [...] "violent coupling" [...] leads to discharge of Shiva's seed which falls on the ground and the god Maha-Shasta ("The Great Chastiser") is born. Mohini disappears, while Shiva returns home with Parvati.|$|E
2500|$|Bloom's {{translation}} and {{essay on the}} Republic is radically different in many important aspects from the previous translations and interpretations of the Republic. Most notable is Bloom's discussion of Socratic irony. In fact, irony {{is the key to}} Bloom’s take on the Republic (see his discussion of Books II–VI of the Republic.) Allan Bloom says a philosopher is immune to irony because <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tragic as comic and comic as tragic. Bloom refers to Socrates, the philosopher par excellence, in his Interpretative Essay stating, [...] "Socrates can go naked where others go clothed; he is not afraid of ridicule. He can also contemplate sexual intercourse where others are stricken with terror; he is not afraid of moral indignation. In other words he treats the comic seriously and the tragic lightly". Thus irony in the Republic refers to the [...] "Just City in Speech", which Bloom looks at not as a model for future society, nor as a template for the human soul; rather, it is a city presented ironically, an example of the distance between philosophy and every potential philosopher. Bloom follows Strauss in suggesting that the [...] "Just City in Speech" [...] is not natural; it is man-made.|$|E

50|$|The {{influence}} of the Ring and the wound by the Morgul-blade, along with subsequent healing by Elrond, had seemingly combined to give him <b>the</b> ability to <b>see</b> into <b>the</b> spirit world; he sees faraway events in dreams on several occasions. <b>He</b> also <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ring of power worn by Galadriel.|$|R

60|$|The judge interposes here. He fails, he says, to {{see that}} this {{evidence}} is relevant.
