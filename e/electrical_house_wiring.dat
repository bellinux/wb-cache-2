50|$|At present, {{the ground}} floor of the Lara House was {{utilized}} into a mixed use - residential occupancy and a barber shop. A grilled gate replaced the front door. The other parts of the house were disintegrated. Additional works were also conducted such as overlaying of concrete hollow blocks and cement finishes. Several tarpaulins were also posted within the front facade of the <b>house.</b> <b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring,</b> accumulation of black deposits, and nearby vegetation present problems as well.|$|R
50|$|After the World War II, Vice Admiral Alan Kirk, later Ambassador to Belgium {{and to the}} Soviet Union, {{purchased}} the property. Three years later, Dr. E. H. Gushing bought the home along with his wife. They sold the attached servants' wing as a separate residence to Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Woodward who built a new front entrance and lived in the home. The Cushings updated the main <b>house's</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> and plumbing and removed some of the interior walls therefore enlarging the living room.|$|R
50|$|The Stooges {{manage to}} destroy the entire {{plumbing}} system in the home in grand fashion. Curly attempts to repair a leak in the upstairs bathroom and ends up constructing a maze of pipes that traps him. Larry digs up the front lawn {{in search of the}} water shutoff valve. In addition, Moe and Curly end up connecting a water pipe with another nearby pipe <b>housing</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> leading to water exiting every electrical appliance in the mansion. When a hostess invites her guests to watch Niagara Falls on her new television set, the whole company gets doused with water (therefore leading to the invention of 4-D television).|$|R
50|$|At 10 pm, a six-alarm {{fire was}} {{reported}} at 173 Ocean Avenue. Local volunteer firefighters {{were trapped in}} place for several hours due to the flooding. Once the waters receded, the Rockaway Point Fire Department rescued more than 41 civilians. FDNY was delayed getting into Breezy due to the high flood levels. Roxbury FD extinguished fires by the promenade. Rockaway Point and Roxbury are located on the ocean side. Rockaway Point lost all of its rigs due to high water, and helped Roxbury with its lines. They found 130 homes burned to the ground. Nearby, another 50 homes were damaged by the fire. According to an official report in December, rising seawater caused the fire by contacting a <b>house's</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Five brought severe impact to Canada. In Nova Scotia, 13schooners were grounded, while 2were destroyed. Strong winds downed telegraph wires {{in the eastern}} end of the province, while barns were de-roofed and trees were felled in Bayfield. High tides in New Brunswick inundated portions of Saint John, with some houses having up to [...] of water. Other low-lying areas were flooded. Washouts disrupted the Canadian Pacific Railway service and swept away portions of the tracks. The cost to repairs the tracks was estimated at $100,000. There was also damage to highways and bridges. A child drowned after attempting to cross a swollen creek. On Prince Edward Island, winds damaged small buildings and knocked chimneys of some <b>houses.</b> <b>Electrical</b> <b>wires</b> were reported down in Charlottetown.|$|R
5000|$|During the storm, a fire, which {{spread between}} the closely spaced houses of Breezy Point while firefighters' {{access to the}} area was greatly {{hampered}} by flooding, destroyed 126 homes and damaged 22 more. Thousands of other houses were damaged by flooding. Fires also wreaked havoc along several blocks of Beach 130th Street in Belle Harbor, and among storefronts along Rockaway Beach Blvd. near Beach 114th Street in Rockaway Park. Large portions of the Rockaway boardwalk were swept away by the floodwaters, leaving only its supporting piers visible. The FDNY found 130 homes burned to the ground. Nearby, another 50 homes were damaged by the fire. According to an official report in December, rising seawater caused the fire by contacting a <b>house's</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wires.</b> Besides the extensive human, physical and economic damage to the peninsula, the storm also struck a blow against local morale, as [...] "Whalemina," [...] a large, brightly colored statue of a smiling whale {{that had been a}} beloved iconic symbol of Rockaway since the 1990s, disappeared from her usual spot at Beach 94th Street near the Boardwalk and was presumed to have been swept out to sea.|$|R

50|$|The Rural Electrification Programme (REP) was {{incorporated}} in 1975 {{with the specific}} mandate to expand the reach of electricity supply to rural areas, where the provision of such services would not be economically viable for commercial providers of electricity. The REP extends the national grid {{through the construction of}} electrical distribution pole lines to un-electrified areas and provides <b>house</b> <b>wiring</b> assistance through a loan programme to householders.|$|R
40|$|In a {{house the}} {{electricity}} is transmitted along heavy wires to the device being powered. If the <b>house</b> <b>wiring</b> {{is not of}} sufficient size, a voltage drop will occur along the wires, so the devices being powered will not obtain enough voltage to run them properly. This effect {{is shown in the}} video, using the apparatus of Figure 1. In this case the wires heat up and eventually break...|$|R
50|$|All dimmers rely on heat {{conduction}} and convection {{to keep the}} electronic components cool. Similarly, power <b>wiring</b> (e.g., <b>house</b> <b>wiring)</b> not surrounded by an air space (e.g., inside a conduit) needs to have its current-limiting device (e.g. circuit breaker or fuse) adjusted {{so as not to}} carry as much current through that circuit. Derating is the reduction of the maximum capacity (load) a unit can reliably handle when fins/side sections are removed.|$|R
5000|$|Digital control. With {{this style}} of control, all of the fan's functions—on/off status, speed, {{direction}} of rotation, and any attached light fixtures—are controlled by a computerized wall control, which typically does not require any special wiring. Instead, it uses the normal <b>house</b> <b>wiring</b> to send coded electrical pulses to the fan, which decodes and acts on them using a built-in set of electronics. This style of control typically has anywhere from three to six speeds.|$|R

50|$|Mr. Howell {{was educated}} at the College of the City of New York (1874-76), Rutgers College (1876-78) and Stevens Institute of Technology (1878-81). In {{his last year}} at Stevens he wrote a thesis on “Economy of Electric Lighting by Incandescence,” giving {{original}} and accurate data on the efficiency of dynamos and lamps, carrying capacity of conductors, drops in <b>house</b> <b>wiring,</b> and allied subjects. Published in booklet form under the title of “Incandescent Electric Lights,” in 1882, it was at once translated into several languages.|$|R
5000|$|Janice {{decides to}} open a [...] "model house" [...] and move several of her models in, {{allowing}} her {{to work with them}} intensively. Her business manager advises her that she can't afford both the house and her office, so she decides to close the office and re-open the agency in the house. She also decides to move in. Finding the master suite hideous, she calls on her friend, designer Christopher Ciccone, to redecorate it. His makeover includes installing spy cameras throughout the <b>house</b> <b>wired</b> into Janice's bedroom.|$|R
5000|$|Simple three light testers cannot detect two {{potentially}} serious <b>house</b> <b>wiring</b> errors: (1) {{neutral and}} ground reversed at the receptacle. (2) a bootleg ground, where the neutral and ground pins have been connected {{together at the}} receptacle. This may be done by someone fitting 3-prong receptacles on a circuit that has no ground wire. These errors can be detected with a multimeter and a test load, to verify that the ground connection is separate from the neutral and is not carrying normal circuit current.|$|R
50|$|Beranek {{was very}} busy {{in his final}} year at Cornell, running a radio repair and sales {{business}} and then transitioning to <b>house</b> <b>wiring</b> for electricity, while carrying a full course load. He managed three major wiring jobs for Cornell, including designing and installing a master antenna system in a new men's dormitory then under construction. He also continued to date his girlfriend Floss. Beranek graduated from Cornell College in summer 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts. He continued studies at Harvard University, where he received a doctorate in 1940.|$|R

50|$|The ensuing {{restoration}} {{efforts were}} extensive, aimed primarily at repairing the building's structural system. New framing members were cut from local oak {{to replace the}} existing ones in the west section, reinforced by concealed steel girders above the windows. Rotten floor joists were likewise capped with steel. The chimneys were repaired and the cellar door on the south facade converted into a window (supposedly for security reasons). On the inside, the kitchen was modernized and the <b>house</b> <b>wired</b> for electricity. Modern plumbing and heating systems were also added, {{in a way that}} detracted from the house's historic appearance as little as possible.|$|R
