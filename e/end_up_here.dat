Digital Spy awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars, they said: [...] "Want U Back", [...] "With Ur Love", [...] "Playa Boi" [...] and [...] "Grow Up" [...] are all tracks worthy of downloading, and went on to praise [...] "Dub on the Track" [...] as [...] "loaded with attitude that few could pull off". Virgin Media gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, they said: [...] "Sticks + Stones is a very pleasant shock. It's sparky and restless and sustains Lloyd's mini rapping firebrand/cute crooner aesthetic through a quickfire run of 10 top-notch songs."NME gave the album 5 out of 10, they said: ‘Grow Up’, a grossly irritating slice of tweenish ragga-pop driven home with are-we-there-yet insistency,still-hideous ‘Swagger Jagger’ and bulldozing dubstep territory on ‘Dub On The Track’ but when Sticks + Stones stops charging about the place, there's evidence to suggest Cher is actually quite good at this pop malarkey. ‘Want U Back’ is a sassy bit of bubble-drunk pop, while ‘End Up Here’ finds Cher adopting a Beyoncé-aping vocal style with not-at-all-bad results.|$|E
