5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The religious leader of Sogamoso was still the most important <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted {{the role of a}} schoolgirl <b>in</b> <b>These</b> <b>Days.</b> Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E

25|$|While Farell was flight-testing a new Mexican {{aircraft}} called Baja California-1 on March 3 of 1929 {{a serious}} military coup took place, led by General José Gonzalo Escobar and heeded by various Generals. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> the air force's remaining airplanes consisted of worn and shot Bristol F.2 Fighter, Bristol Boarhound, de Havilland DH-4B and Douglas O-2C, {{a force that}} was not suitable to defeat Escobar's power.

25|$|Soon after, France's German {{allies were}} driven from the war, in an equally humiliating way. Dutch troops reconquered all lands lost to Munster. A {{strategic}} thrust to the fortress of Bonn in late 1673 forced the French {{to evacuate the}} areas she occupied in the Republic, except for Maastricht and Grave. By then the reconstituted Dutch army had again become a formidable force, as in the 1640s, its strength rising to 100,000 men, almost {{as large as the}} French army (France had a population ten times as large <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> as that of the Republic). This was accomplished by great financial outlay in the hiring of mercenary troops. But the Republic had the financial wherewithal to bear this burden, despite French hopes that it would break the Republic. The war went on till the Peace of Nijmegen in 1678. Here the Dutch finally obtained the retraction of Colbert's tariff of 1667, that had set off the economic war. However, the handling of the peace negotiations, in which Louis managed to divide his enemies, and entice the Dutch (against the wishes of William, who perceived the diplomatic cost) to conclude a separate peace, cost the Republic dearly in reputation and good will with its allies.|$|E

500|$|The {{increasing}} {{size and}} power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship's main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The torpedo now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy. As naval expert Fred T. Jane wrote in June 1902,Is there anything outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well? And inside 2,000, what, <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of gyros, is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty? ...|$|E
500|$|... "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira and co-produced by the singer along with Lester Mendez. It is a {{combination}} of pop rock and tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance music that originated in Argentina and Uruguay. According to the sheet music of [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] published at MusicNotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, it is written in the key of B minor and has a half note metronome of 66 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range spans from E3 to B4. The song contains instrumentation from the bandoneón, which is played at a [...] "breakneck speed," [...] and also features a [...] "twanging" [...] guitar solo. Lyrically, [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] is dramatic and humorous in approach and focuses on an angered Shakira ordering her love interest to choose between her and his other leading lady; it was said to be a feminist anthem and a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train". It contains a line in which Shakira asserts to her lover that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/ That’s why in front of your eyes I'm invisible/ But you gotta know small things also count," [...] which a critic commented was a [...] "brave statement <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers." [...] During the bridge of the song, Shakira delivers rap-like vocals and instructs her lover to end the love triangle, declaring that [...] "Tango is not for three, was never meant to be." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ode to Psyche" [...] is a 67-line poem {{written in}} stanzas of varying length, which took its form from {{modification}} Keats {{made to the}} sonnet structure. The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character, displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with [...] "O GODDESS!" [...] (line 1). Psyche, a creature so beautiful that she drew the attention of Cupid himself, draws {{the attention of the}} narrator, whose artistic imagination causes him to dream of her: [...] "Surely I dream'd to-day, or did I see / The wingèd Psyche with awaken'd eyes" [...] (lines 5–6). As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid, he confuses the god's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman's beauty. The poet does, however, understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares, [...] "even <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> [...] I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired" [...] (lines 40–43). In line 50, the poet states [...] "Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane", which, Harold Bloom suggests, implies that the poet himself becomes a [...] "prophet of the soul" [...] as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid's personage. according to T.S. Eliot, it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} {{story is}} that the actors did not know until {{the last day of}} shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Laszlo to the airport. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film [...] "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl {{to live up to the}} idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> is far more important than the love of two little people." [...] It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the production code forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this result could be engineered. The problem was solved when the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip, were driving down Sunset Boulevard and stopped for the light at Beverly Glen. At that instant the identical twins turned to each other and simultaneously cried out, [...] "Round up the usual suspects!" [...] By the time they had driven past Fairfax and the Cahuenga Pass and through the Warner Brothers studio's portals at Burbank, in the words of Julius Epstein, [...] "the idea for the farewell scene between a tearful Bergman and a suddenly noble Bogart" [...] had been formed and all the problems of the ending had been solved. The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. Rewrites did occur during the filming, but Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, in critic Roger Ebert's words, [...] "emotional", not [...] "factual".|$|E
