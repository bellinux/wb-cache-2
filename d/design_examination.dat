It had, among many other items, pump-free and puncture- proof tires, safety belts and a smooth and soft, shock-absorbing interior. Ehrich’s and Lindhé’s car existed only as a mock up, but the information about it was spread worldwide by a Swedish news agency. The authors were contacted from different countries, by people who wanted to buy the car. “Optima” was rewarded the first prize in the Ford design competition, presented in Munich in 1967.|$|E

40|$|ATP sulfurylases (ATPSs) are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} catalyse the primary step of intracellular sulfate activation: {{the reaction of}} inorganic sulfate with ATP to form adenosine- 5 ′-phosphosulfate (APS) and pyrophosphate (PPi).

We have analysed the crystal structure of the native enzyme at 1. 95  Å resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and, subsequently, the ternary enzyme product complex with APS and PPi bound to the active site. The enzyme consists of six identical subunits arranged in two stacked rings in a D 3 symmetric assembly. Nucleotide binding causes significant conformational changes, which lead to a rigid body structural displacement of domains III and IV of the ATPS monomer.

40|$|Abstract—An {{inherent}} {{problem in}} multiobjective optimiza-tion {{is that the}} visual observation of solution vectors with four or more objectives is infeasible, which brings major difficulties for algorithmic <b>design,</b> <b>examination,</b> and development. This paper presents a test problem, called the Rectangle problem, to aid the visual investigation of high-dimensional multiobjective search. Key features of the Rectangle problem are that the Pareto optimal solutions 1) lie in a rectangle in the two-variable decision space and 2) are similar (in the sense of Euclidean geometry) to their images in the four-dimensional objective space. In this case, {{it is easy to}} examine the behavior of objective vectors in terms of both convergence and diversity, by observing their proximity to the optimal rectangle and their distribution in the rectangle, respectively, in the decision space. Fifteen algorithms are investigated. Underperformance of Pareto-based algorithms as well as most state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms indicates that the proposed problem not only is a good tool to help visually understand the behavior of multiobjective search in a high-dimensional objective space but also {{can be used as a}} challenging benchmark function to test algorithms ’ ability in balancing the convergence and diversity of solutions.

Additional analyses compared pairs of siblings from the sample who were and were not breast fed.

Subjects Data on 5475 children, the offspring of 3161 mothers in the longitudinal survey. Main outcome measure IQ in children measured by Peabody individual achievement test. Results The mother's IQ was more highly predictive of breastfeeding status than were her race, education, age, poverty status, smoking, the home environment, or the child's birth weight or birth order. One standard deviation advantage in maternal IQ more than doubled the odds of breast feeding. Before adjustment, breast feeding was associated with an increase of around 4 points in mental ability.

Setting and Participants A Brief Alzheimer Screen (BAS) was developed from cognitive assessments on 406 normal subjects and 342 mild AD patients in the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD) dataset. The derived measure was then applied to a second validation sample. Main Outcome Measure Logistic regression was used to derive a predictive equation, which was then applied to two validation samples to estimate sensitivity and specificity. Results The resulting logistic model for discriminating between mild AD and controls included: recall of 3 words, number of animals named in 30 seconds, date, and spelling of WORLD backwards, (p < 0. 001 for each) accounting for 77 % of the variance. When applied to the validation samples, sensitivity and specificity were over 99 % and 87 %, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to attempt to {{determine}} participant perceptions of Child to Parent Violence (CPV), more specifically to address gaps in current literature with regards to assumptions that may be made when considering gender and severity of perpetration, of both the aggressor and their victims. Based on available literature, definitions of CPV and four considered levels of aggression were developed allowing for a mixed <b>design</b> <b>examination</b> of the afore mentioned perceptions (Ibabe, Arnoso, & Elgorriaga, 2014; Miles & Condry, 2015). The study hypothesised that maternal figures would, in this study, be the primary victim of CPV across all four measures, males would be the predominant perpetrator across physical and financial levels of aggression, with predominant female perpetration across psychological and emotional CPV. A gender control would be used as a measure to determine how the group viewed gender prevalence in the perpetration of CPV. Results would determine partial congruence with the hypotheses, however it was shown that male to parent aggression, regardless of parental gender, was the dominant perception of this hidden phenomena, highlighting the shortcomings in societies understanding of the complexities of CPV. The author posits that ongoing CPV studies are more than necessary to inform policy making, with regards to CPV support for victims, offenders and other family members, whilst bringing issues of Intra-Family Violence (IFV) into line with empirical evidence that is relevant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Temperamental {{suitability}} (personality traits) {{could be}} a factor to consider in career placement and professional development. It could also be an indicator of professional success or failure in any profession such as Systems Analysis and Design (SAD). However, there is not sufficient empirical {{evidence in support of}} the personality traits to which systems analysts and designers may be categorized. The objective {{of this study is to}} empirically investigate the main personality traits to which systems analysts and designers may belong, then propose a new approach to composing a personality matrix based on sound computational model. The study employed a quantitative research approach to measure the personality traits of 60 student systems analysts and designers using a human metric tool such as the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and some pre designed additional questionnaires. A mathematical model of the form was employed in order to measure achievement in systems analysis and <b>design</b> <b>examination.</b> The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the data. Using linear regression, the model was not significant, implying that achievement in SAD examination does not depend only on personality traits, motivation variables and study habit variables which were the independent variables. However, the R squared value indicated that these variables account for 52 % variation in the dependent variable SAD score (achievement). The best achievers in the personality traits are ENFJ, ENTJ, ISFJ and INFJ all scoring 70 % each.
