Women wearing an underwire bra {{have in a}} few rare instances been subjected to extra scrutiny when their bra set off metal detectors at security checkpoints in airports or prisons.

5|$|Also, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> unorthodox (unusual) {{causes of}} solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts {{may increase the}} chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation {{from the sun and}} transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E

5|$|The African crake (Crex egregia) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family that breeds in most of sub-Saharan Africa away from the arid south and southwest. It is {{seasonally}} common in most of its range other than the rainforests and areas that have low annual rainfall. This crake is a partial migrant, {{moving away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow it to breed elsewhere. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> records of vagrant birds reaching Atlantic islands. This species nests {{in a wide variety of}} grassland types, and agricultural land with tall crops may also be used.|$|E
5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{instances}} of general population poisoning {{as the result}} of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E
5|$|Though the Meridian Star is now {{the only}} {{newspaper}} printed in the city, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other historical newspapers. One such paper is the Memo Digest, a ten to twenty page publication published during the 1970s. The Digest focused on issues relevant to the African-American population of the region, gathering a circulation of about 5,000 people. Other newspapers in the city have included The Colored Messenger, The State, The Weekly Mercury, The Blade, Weekly Echo, Fair Play, Headlight, Meridian Morning Sun, Teacher and Preacher, and Clarion.|$|E

All she <b>had</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> eggs, <b>a</b> potato and an onion, so she combined all three, making an omelette. Surprisingly, Zumalacárregui was pleased and took the idea with him.|$|R

A 1979 study examined the stomach contents of all fishers trapped {{in the state of}} New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found no cat remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (scat and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, {{have been}} kept in captivity in various marine parks, arguably {{starting}} the late 1940s. Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity. Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan {{have been kept}} in aquariums and oceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii were taken into captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s, two of which were placed at SeaWorld in San Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female short-finned pilot whale, who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at Sea World California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.|$|E
