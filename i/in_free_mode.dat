50|$|Though he was {{initially}} strongly {{identified with the}} avant-garde, Watts is a versatile musician {{who has worked in}} everything from straight jazz contexts to rock and blues. His own projects have come increasingly to focus on blending jazz and African music, notably the Moiré Music ensemble which he has led since 1982 in configurations ranging from large ensembles featuring multiple drummers to more intimate trios. He has only occasionally recorded <b>in</b> <b>freer</b> <b>modes</b> <b>in</b> recent years, notably the CD 6 Dialogues, a duet album with Veryan Weston (the pianist in earlier editions of Moiré Music).

5000|$|Holodance is a {{collaborative}} multiplayer virtual reality rhythm video game developed {{and published by}} narayana games for Microsoft Windows in which players can either dance with dragons to have an environmentally themed story unfold {{with each of the}} twelve levels, or play any osu!-beatmap in one of the fifteen environments available <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>mode.</b> As a Virtual Reality rhythm game, Holodance can be classified as fitness game due to the requirement to move your arms and often the full body to interact with the gameplay mechanics, giving players a [...] "workout". The game has been available as Early access title on Steam since April 5, 2016.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} game {{features a}} total of 41 playable characters, a step-down from previous installment in the series, which featured 48 playable characters. The seven removed characters are Da Qiao, Jiang Wei, Meng Huo, Pang De, Xing Cai, Zhu Rong, and Zuo Ci. Other than brief mentions in cutscenes and character biographies in-game, they otherwise do not make appearance in the game at all. Unlike previous games which featured Musou Modes for all characters, only seventeen of the playable characters received stories, while the others are playable only <b>in</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Mode</b> and Challenge Mode. Dynasty Warriors 6: Special adds Musou Mode for six more characters, while the PSP port of the game adds Meng Huo back to the roster, bringing the character count to 42.|$|E
5000|$|Unique movesets {{for each}} {{character}} {{have been largely}} reduced. Only characters who have Musou Mode receive original movesets (with the exception of Diao Chan); {{the rest of the}} characters playable only <b>in</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Mode</b> have cloned movesets based on the Musou Mode characters with altered properties (with the exception of Xiao Qiao, who retains her fan moveset). Due to the addition of Renbu system, the traditional [...] "fourth weapon" [...] from previous games have been removed with the three normal weapons no longer being quality-based. Each weapons obtained have random stats and effects implemented and the [...] "weight system" [...] from previous game have been replaced by weapon categories; Standard (default type), Strength (greater attack power at the cost of Renbu Gauge being kept for a smaller amount of time), and Skill (greater attack speed with low attack power). In addition to the new weapon system, it is now possible to block from any direction, for example, if a character is attacked from behind while blocking, they will rotate their body with their weapon in front of them to guard against the enemy's attack. This eliminates the need to quickly stop blocking, change direction, and press the guard button again. Unlike previous games, horses can be found by obtaining saddles randomly dropped from boxes or beaten officers. These horses can gain levels, skills, and some can even change into the legendary Red Hare, although this is very rare.|$|E
50|$|In the Nightmare chapter, each of {{the turtles}} have a dream and {{encounter}} various bosses. Clearing most of the missions in this chapter leads to the game's final boss, Ultimate Drako. To use the gembu scrolls to activate the Ultimate Turtle forms, the player must collect scrolls and other content <b>in</b> <b>Free</b> Battle <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>Free</b> Battle <b>mode,</b> players may conduct {{practice}} battles. Players {{can select}} rules {{from any of}} the tournament cups or use modified rules. Up to four players may participate, using any combination of rental Pokémon and those imported via Transfer Pak. Pikachu can say its name when you choose from the trainer icon from the Pokémon section screen.|$|R
50|$|Pro Career is a mode where {{a player}} has to {{progress}} through different championships {{in the game}} to unlock other championships in this Mode. If a player wins a cup, they then unlock bonus championships to play <b>in</b> <b>Free</b> Race <b>mode</b> only. If the player gets all 177 cups, they unlock all the bonus championships and bonuses.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{retains the}} EX weapon system from Dynasty Warriors 7, where each character's six normal and charge attacks are {{determined}} entirely {{by the two}} weapons that they have equipped; in addition, each character {{is associated with a}} single weapon, for which a special EX attack (a character-specific followup to a charge attack) is available to them; in Xtreme Legends each character gains a second EX attack. Each character may equip two weapons, and may freely switch them in battle by pressing the weapon switch button; a character may perform their Musou attack regardless of which weapon is equipped. Unlike Dynasty Warriors 7, characters no longer share EX weapon types; each character is now associated with a unique EX weapon type. Examples include Sun Jian featuring a new nine-ringed blade. This is a dao that has a total of nine rings that connect to the sword's back. The rings are able to produce sound that inflicts damage upon enemies. [...] All weapons from Dynasty Warriors 7 and its expansions return, with many new ones added. Unlike Dynasty Warriors 7, players may keep multiple copies of a single weapon type, each of which containing six [...] "element" [...] slots. Weapons broadly fall into two categories in terms of customization: standard weapons and [...] "treasure weapons". Whereas treasure weapons have preset elements and cannot be customized, players may customize standard weapons through one of three methods (all inspired by the Warriors Orochi series): weapon tempering, reforging, and, in Xtreme Legends, fusion. Weapon tempering and reforging require the use of [...] "weapon materials", which may be obtained through Ambition Mode play; tempering sacrifices a weapon to strengthen another one while reforging trades three weapons for two stronger ones. Weapon Fusion requires the use of Gems, acquired through Free and Ambition modes, where players may selectively replace an existing element on a weapon with elements found on another weapon (which will be sacrificed in the process), change the affinity of an existing weapon, or improve the base attack rating of a weapon. The process of weapon customization must be unlocked through Ambition Mode, though in Xtreme Legends once unlocked it may also be used <b>in</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Mode.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{determine}} the resonant frequencies of different shear-mode piezoelectric ceramic materials. The {{knowledge of the}} resonant and anti-resonant frequencies {{is probably one of}} the most important aspects in the characterization of piezoelectric ceramics since, together with the capacitance and dimensions, one can determine practically all the piezoelectric shear-mode parameters. Conclusions are taken relative to ceramic characterization using this methodology, both <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>mode</b> and when embedded on a mechanic apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cobots {{can assist}} a human by {{mechanically}} constraining motion to software-defined guide paths. The Learning Cobot we introduced in [1] provides simple design tools for ergonomic guide paths. Walk-Through-Programming (WTP) lets the operator trace out a path <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>mode</b> {{and use a}} B-spline approximation of this path as a guide path for subsequent movements. Guide paths can also be designed by placing B-spline control points by mouse in a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI). This paper presents psychophysical experiments to evaluate these tools. User satisfaction was our evaluation criterion, as it encompasses analytical criteria like effort and motion jerkiness but is finer. The results demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} Learning Cobot, and the necessity of using the WTP and GUI together. With the WTP the operator can design ergonomic guide paths well, i. e., with haptic feedback alone, but operators prefer also to have the GUI to visualize the path. Using the Learning Cobot, operators can gradually learn ergonomic guide paths and adapt to changes in the environment or in the task. ...|$|E

30|$|<b>In</b> <b>free</b> {{allocation}} <b>mode,</b> {{power plants}} get emission permits for free, meeting their needs of electrical production. Some emission permits beyond their demand may be obtained, inducing extra profit opportunities. The {{advantage is that}} it provides power plants with asset which can be traded in the market without increasing their production cost. But it may weaken their motivation of emission reduction.|$|R
