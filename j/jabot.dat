5|$|In December 2009, Tucker is {{introduced}} as J.T. Hellstrom’s (Thad Luckinbill) employer, while pursuing a business deal with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and beginning {{an affair with}} Jill Abbott (Jess Walton).

5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a <b>jabot,</b> which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E

[...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of <b>Jabot</b> whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight.
