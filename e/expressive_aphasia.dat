5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia affects {{both the}} {{expression}} and reception of language. Both two most common types, <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> and receptive aphasia, affect speech perception to some extent. <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> causes moderate difficulties for language understanding. The effect of receptive aphasia on understanding {{is much more}} severe. It is agreed upon, that aphasics suffer from perceptual deficits. They usually cannot fully distinguish place of articulation and voicing. As for other features, the difficulties vary. It {{has not yet been}} proven whether low-level speech-perception skills are affected in aphasia sufferers or whether their difficulties are caused by higher-level impairment alone.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} kinds of aphasic patients: <b>Expressive</b> <b>Aphasia</b> (also known as Broca's Aphasia) and receptive aphasia (also known as Wernicke's Aphasia). There are three distinctive dimensions to phonetics: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing.|$|E
5000|$|Anomic <b>aphasia,</b> <b>aphasia</b> (<b>expressive</b> + {{receptive}} <b>aphasia)</b> and Alzheimer's {{disease can}} all affect recalling or retrieving words. Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people, a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words. Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe {{form of the}} [...] "tip-of-the-tongue" [...] phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word. Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.|$|R
40|$|Clinical History: The {{patient is}} 36 year old woman whose {{neurological}} history began in 1988 at age 17 when a head CT was performed for post traumatic headaches following {{a motor vehicle}} accident and revealed bilateral diffuse white matter disease of unknown etiology. Over the following 1 - 2 years she had several episodes that lasted up to 1 hour in duration and where characterized {{by a variety of}} neurological symptoms including headaches, blurred vision, hemianopia, <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasias,</b> seizure-like activity, and extremity numbness and weakness. These “episodes ” were diagnosed as complex migraines. The “episodes ” continued to increase in frequency over the ensuing years and included additional symptoms such as bizarre behavior, wrist drop, facial drooping, and clonus. These episodes could last from 12 - 48 hours. At age 27, following a fall she had an acute neurologic event requiring hospitalization which left her lethargic and unable to carry out her activities of daily living. MRI revealed diffuse white matter abnormalities in the centrum semiovale and periventricular region with marked ventricular dilation. Extensive metabolic workup wa...|$|R

The work is separated into two parts, the theoretical part and practical part. In theoretical part it pursues interconnection among functional communication, occupational therapy and speech therapy, defines functional communication, occupies by questions of fatigue impairments, describes various ways of nonverbal communication and also ways of their learning. In practical part it includes notation of work with three patients with <b>expressive</b> chronic <b>aphasia</b> for purpose of improvement of functional communication. There is a description of methodology which approximates the process used in practical part. The intervention with patients proceeded {{in the end of}} May and in June in 2009 in Clinic of rehabilitation medicine in Prague and is notified in case studies. The output of practical part was origination of two communication aids (the picture book and card which describes fatigue impairment). The occupational therapy intervention confirms a positive influence of visual-motoric and visual nonverbal means for facilitation of functional communication. The work also attends to functional communication as a standard part [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Individuals with transcortical {{motor aphasia}} have similar deficits as <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> except {{repetition}} ability remains intact. Auditory comprehension is generally fine for simple conversations, but declines rapidly for more complex conversations. It {{is associated with}} right hemiparesis, meaning {{that there can be}} paralysis of the patient's right face and arm.|$|E
25|$|A {{differential}} diagnosis {{must be used}} in order to rule out other similar or alternative disorders. Although disorders such as <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> conduction aphasia, and dysarthria involve similar symptoms as apraxia of speech, the disorders must be distinguished in order to correctly treat the patients. While AOS involves the motor planning or processing stage of speech, aphasic disorders can involve other language processes.|$|E
25|$|Progressive <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> is the {{deterioration}} of normal language function that causes individuals to lose {{the ability to communicate}} fluently while still being able to comprehend single words and intact other non-linguistic cognition. It is found in a variety of degenerative neurological conditions including Pick's disease, motor neuron disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. It is associated with hypometabolism and atrophy of the left anterior insular cortex.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Carl Wernicke {{described}} {{patients with}} receptive aphasia, who had {{damage to the}} left posterior superior temporal lobe, which he named [...] "the area of word images". These patients could speak fluently, but their speech lacked meaning. They had a severe deficit in auditory comprehension. The two disorders (<b>expressive</b> and receptive <b>aphasias)</b> thus seemed complementary, and corresponded to two distinct anatomical locations.|$|R
50|$|A {{fascinating}} corollary of {{this has}} come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to <b>Expressive</b> and Receptive <b>aphasias</b> in hearing populations. These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca's area and the semantic functions of Wernicke's area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.|$|R
50|$|CIAT (Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy) is an {{adaptation}} of CIMT for people with Aphasia. It {{can be used for}} clients with either <b>expressive</b> or receptive <b>aphasia.</b> Like CIMT, treatment is intensive and usually occurs over a ten-day period for several hours per day. In CIAT, patient must use verbal communication without gestures or pointing in order communicate. The constraints are placed on the use of gestures with the aim of improving verbal communication. Also like CIMT, CIAT has been shown to not be feasible in most clinical environments due to its parameters and distributed protocols are now being investigated.|$|R
25|$|TSA {{should not}} be {{confused}} with transcortical motor aphasia (TMA), which is characterized by nonfluent speech output, with good comprehension and repetition. Patients with TMA have impaired writing skills, difficulty speaking and difficulty maintaining a clear thought process. Furthermore, TMA is caused by lesions in cortical motor areas of the brain as well as lesions in the anterior portion of the basal ganglia, and can be seen in patients with <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{damage to}} Broca's area and/or to {{neighboring}} {{regions of the}} left inferior frontal lobe are often categorized clinically as having <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> (also known as Broca's aphasia). This type of aphasia, which often involves impairments in speech output, can be contrasted with Receptive aphasia, (also known as Wernicke's aphasia), named for Karl Wernicke, which is characterized by damage to more posterior regions of the left temporal lobe, and is often characterized by impairments in language comprehension.|$|E
25|$|AOS and <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> (also {{known as}} Broca's aphasia) are {{commonly}} mistaken {{as the same}} disorder mainly because they often occur together in patients. Although both disorders present with symptoms such as a difficulty producing sounds due to damage in the language parts of the brain, {{they are not the}} same. The main difference between these disorders lies in the ability to comprehend spoken language; patients with apraxia are able to fully comprehend speech, while patients with aphasia are not always fully able to comprehend others' speech.|$|E
50|$|The {{discoveries of}} Paul Broca were {{made during the}} same period of time as the German Neurologist Carl Wernicke, who was also {{studying}} brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as Wernicke's area. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between <b>expressive</b> and receptive <b>aphasia).</b>|$|R
50|$|Wernicke {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} conduction aphasia in his landmark 1874 monograph, Der Aphasische Symptomenkompleks: Eine Psychologische Studie auf Anatomischer Basis. He {{was the first to}} distinguish the various aphasias in an anatomical framework, and proposed that a disconnection between the two speech systems (motor and sensory) would lead to a unique condition, distinct from both <b>expressive</b> and receptive <b>aphasias,</b> which he termed Leitungsaphasie. He did not explicitly predict the repetition deficit, but did note that, unlike those with Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasics would be able to comprehend speech properly, and intriguingly, would be able to hear and understand their own speech errors, leading to frustration and self-correction.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} studies that {{examined}} the neural mechanism of this therapy, {{but it has}} not been firmly agreed upon yet. However, the possible neural mechanism boils down to two routes to recovery. First, for patients with small lesions in the left hemisphere, there tends to be more activation in the left hemisphere around the lesions and small amount of right hemisphere activation. Second, for patients with large lesions in the left hemisphere, there tends to be more activation of right Broca's area, the Broca's area in the right hemisphere. Songs are promising to treat <b>expressive</b> and receptive <b>aphasia</b> patients by activating speech part of the brain through melodic and rhythmic notes.|$|R
25|$|This disease {{attacks the}} brain and makes the {{patients}} unable to stop shaking. The effects could be difficulty in walking, communicating, or functioning. Over time the symptoms go from mild to severe, which can cause extreme difficulties in a person's life. Many psychologists relate Parkinson's disease to Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia, which would cause a person to have comprehension deficits {{and being able to}} recognize irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> or Parkinson's disease would say the dog goed home.|$|E
25|$|Receptive aphasia: The {{patients}} {{suffer from}} lesions or damage {{located in the}} left temproparietal lobe. Receptive Aphasic patients mostly suffer from lexical-semantic difficulties, but also have difficulties in comprehension tasks. Though they have difficulty saying things or describing things, these people showed {{that they could do}} well in online comprehension tasks. This is closely related to Parkinson's disease because both of the diseases have trouble in distinguishing irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> or Parkinson's disease would say the dog goed home.|$|E
25|$|Therapy for <b>Expressive</b> <b>Aphasia</b> (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with anomic aphasia. Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{who read}} in a letter-by-letter manner can {{demonstrate}} effects of lexical variables when reading words comprised of low confusability letters, suggesting the capacity to process low-confusability words in parallel across the letters (Fiset, Arguin, and McCabe, 2006). Here a series of experiments is presented investigating letter confusability effects in MAH, a patient with <b>expressive</b> and receptive <b>aphasia</b> who shows reduced reading accuracy with longer words, and DM, a relatively "pure" alexic patient. Two rehabilitation studies were employed: (i) a word-level therapy and (ii) a letter-level therapy designed to improve discrimination of individual letters. The word-level treatment produced generalised improvement to low-confusability words only, but the serial processing treatment produced improvement on both high and low confusability words. The results add support to the hypothesis that letter confusability {{plays a key role}} in letter-by-letter reading, and suggest that a rehabilitation method aimed at reducing ambiguities in letter identification may be particularly effective for treating letter-by-letter reading...|$|R
40|$|BI, an 82 {{year old}} woman, {{presents}} {{to the hospital}} with a mixed <b>expressive</b> and conductive <b>aphasia</b> after waking up. She has a history of well controlled Type II diabetes mellitus, hyperten-sion, hypercholesterolemia, chronic stable angina, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and a recently repaired hip fracture. Medications included metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, ibuprofen, calcium and Vitamin D supplements, and alendronate. An MRI of her brain showed multiple, small infarcts suggestive of embo-lic disease in the left middle cerebral artery territory consistent with her aphasia, and MRA of her neck showed minimal ca-rotid and posterior circulation atherosclerotic disease.

40|$|Background and purpose: This {{case study}} and {{evidence-based}} analysis aims {{to determine which}} intervention or combination of interventions commonly cited in available research is most effective in facilitating a more efficient, coordinated gait pattern in patients with acute stroke. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked or bursts, causing damage to the brain. Stroke is the second leading global cause of death and accounts for 11 % of deaths worldwide. Stroke {{continues to be a}} major cause of disability and a very common diagnosis seen in physical therapy. It is currently controversial which physical therapy interventions are most effective in the treatment of acute stroke and some therapists continue to use interventions that studies have found to be ineffective. Many studies investigating acute stroke have themselves been found to be underpowered, biased and misleading. Case Description: The patient, Mrs. M, was an 85 year old female who suffered a left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in late November. She was hospitalized 4 days, admitted to a rehabilitation hospital in early December and to a skilled nursing facility in late December. The patient presented with right hemiparesis, decreased muscle strength, right foot drop, an inefficient, uncoordinated gait pattern, impaired balance and transfer abilities, limited overall mobility and safety, <b>expressive</b> and receptive <b>aphasia,</b> fatigue and confusion. In addition to right hemiparesis, she reported significant left flank pain limiting function of her left side. Outcomes: A review of current literature revealed that a intensive and organized treatment plan including {{some or all of the}} following specific interventions, tailored to each patient’s needs with close monitoring of patient response, can decrease deficits, increase independence and improve overall outcomes for patients with acute stroke. The specific recommended interventions include: therapeutic exercise, task-oriented training, biofeedback, overground/treadmill gait training, balance/transfer training, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), treatment of shoulder subluxation, electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), therapeutic ultrasound and acupuncture. Discussion: The overall quality of current research in acute stroke rehabilitation is moderate with many studies demonstrating questionable reliability, validity and generalizability. This analysis focused on higher-level systematic reviews and meta-analyses of current stroke research to determine which intervention or combination of interventions were most effective in acute stroke gait training. This analysis found a general consensus that an intense, individualized combination of the above interventions is most effective, affordable and safe in acute stroke gait training. More high-quality research is needed involving similar stroke patient demographics, research designs, and outcome measures to further investigate intervention effects and to determine consistent, accepted parameters and protocols for optimal acute stroke rehabilitation...|$|R
25|$|On May 13, 2007, Diddley was {{admitted}} to intensive care in Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, following a stroke after a concert the previous day in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Starting the show, he had complained {{that he did not}} feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging south Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. Nonetheless, he delivered an energetic performance to an enthusiastic crowd. The next day, as he was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport; 911 and airport security were called, and he was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center and admitted to the intensive care unit, where he stayed for several days. After tests, it was confirmed that he had suffered a stroke. Diddley had a history of hypertension and diabetes, and the stroke affected {{the left side of his}} brain, causing receptive and <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> (speech impairment). The stroke was followed by a heart attack, which he suffered in Gainesville, Florida, on August 28, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|An American physicist, he is a {{brilliant}} and creative scientist, and is greatly respected for his intellectual gifts. However, he is socially awkward and often finds it difficult to understand and relate to other people. Russell is {{a leader of the}} Green movement, the goal of which is to terraform Mars. During Green Mars, Sax suffers a stroke while being tortured by government security forces and fellow member of the First Hundred, Phyllis Boyle (although according to later it is revealed she actually opposed Sax's torture). He subsequently suffers from <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> and has to relearn how to speak and becomes less predictable in his actions. Originally apolitical, this event and a growing attachment to Mars itself leads Russell to become the physical architect of the second revolution. After memory issues become apparent in many of the remaining first hundred including Sax he begins work on an ambitious project to gather the remaining first hundred and have them try an experimental treatment he helped to develop. It is after this that Sax realizes his persistent attempts to please Ann are actually because he is also secretly in love with Ann Clayborne, who cannot stand him at first, but after decades on Mars, eventually reconciles. Saxifrage means [...] "stonebreaker" [...] and is the name for an Alpine plant that grows between stones.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] {{has no effect}} on {{implicit}} processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production. They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading). Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process. [...] Implicit knowledge involves phonological awareness, understanding of the morphology, and a semantic understanding of written words. This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production. Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics. For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a lexical decision task with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and phonics to process the words. Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology. These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud). They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level. This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> {{also known}} as Broca's aphasia, <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> is a non-fluent aphasia that is {{characterized}} by damage to the frontal lobe region of the brain. A person with <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> usually speaks in short sentences that make sense but take great effort to produce. Also, a person with <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> understands another person's speech but has trouble responding quickly.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> is stroke. A stroke is caused by {{hypoperfusion}} (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by thrombosis or embolism. Some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients. <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke. In most cases, <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> is caused by a stroke in Broca's area or the surrounding vicinity. However, cases of <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> have been seen in patients with strokes {{in other areas of the}} brain. Patients with classic symptoms of <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> in general have more acute brain lesions, whereas patients with larger, widespread lesions exhibit a variety of symptoms that may be classified as global aphasia or left unclassified.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> (non-fluent aphasia) is {{characterized}} by partial loss {{of the ability to}} produce language (spoken or written), although comprehension generally remains intact. A person with <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words, but leaves out function words that have only grammatical significance and not real-world meaning, such as prepositions and articles. This is known as [...] "telegraphic speech". The person may still be understood, but sentences will not be grammatical. In very severe forms of <b>Expressive</b> <b>Aphasia,</b> a person may only speak using single word utterances. Comprehension is typically only mildly to moderately impaired in <b>expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> due to difficulty understanding complex grammar. <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> is also known as Broca's aphasia in clinical neuropsychology and agrammatic aphasia in cognitive neuropsychology and is caused by acquired damage to the anterior regions of the brain, such as the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus or inferior frontal operculum, also described as Broca's area (Brodmann area 44 and Brodmann area 45). It is one subset of a larger family of disorders known collectively as aphasia. <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> contrasts with receptive aphasia, in which patients are able to speak in grammatical sentences that lack semantic significance, and generally also have trouble with comprehension. [...] <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> differs from dysarthria, which is typified by a patient's inability to properly move the muscles of the tongue and mouth to produce speech. <b>Expressive</b> <b>aphasia</b> also differs from apraxia of speech which is a motor disorder characterized by an inability to create and sequence motor plans for speech.|$|E
