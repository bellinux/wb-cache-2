5|$|This {{game was}} {{designed}} at Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R) division, while the programming was {{handled by the}} external company Intelligent Systems (known as Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena at the time). The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because the peripheral's <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer's (and NES's) console's cartridges. Combined with the possibility to store the players' progress, the floppy disk format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa's debut as a video game designer, {{and he was the}} only staff member working on the game {{at the beginning of the}} project. Osawa (credited in the U.S. version as Inusawa) intended to make Light Myth: Palutena's Mirror an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. He drew the pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems. After Nintendo's action-adventure Metroid had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} game's {{projected}} release date of December 19, 1986, {{the staff members}} worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night. They used torn cardboard boxes as beds, and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building. Eventually, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was finished and entered production a mere {{three days before the}} release date. Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts. In February and July 1987, respectively, a cartridge-based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America under the name Kid Icarus. For this release, the graphics of the ending were updated, and staff credits were added to the game. Unlike Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena, which saves the player's progress on the <b>Disk</b> <b>Card,</b> Kid Icarus uses a password system to return to a game after the console was turned off. In August 2004, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was re-released as part of the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the Game Boy Advance. The game was published internationally for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. The North American, European and Australian versions of this digital release have the cheat codes of the NES version removed.|$|E
500|$|In February 1986, Nintendo {{released}} {{the game as}} the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, all the text was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that {{was not included in}} the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, [...] "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons. The cartridge version made use of the Memory Management Controller chip, specifically the MMC1 model. The MMC could use bank-switching, allowing larger games than had been previously possible. They also allowed for battery-powered RAM, which let players save progress for the first time on any cartridge-based system or game.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{machine-readable}} media include {{magnetic media}} such as magnetic <b>disks,</b> <b>cards,</b> tapes, and drums, punched cards and paper tapes, optical discs, barcodes and magnetic ink characters.|$|R
50|$|Nintendo held game score {{contests}} {{for certain}} games that were released on blue-colored <b>disk</b> <b>cards.</b> Some of the prizes to these contests included two gold prize disks, {{one for the}} game Golf US course, and one for Golf Japan course (not {{to be confused with}} the title simply called Golf). These two gold disks have metal shutters on them, like the aforementioned blue <b>Disk</b> <b>Cards.</b> Nintendo awarded other prizes including a stationery set, and a gold cartridge version of the Punch-Out!! for the Family Computer. In the gold version of Punch-Out!!, the final opponent is Super Macho Man, before Nintendo used Mike Tyson and Mr. Dream instead in later NES versions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Disk System {{version was}} released in two separate <b>Disk</b> <b>Cards,</b> released separately from each other. Its music was composed by Kenji Yamamoto, who composed sound and music for Super Metroid and for Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. [...] It utilizes the FDS's extra sound channel for the music.|$|R
500|$|The Legend of Zelda {{has been}} re-released on {{multiple}} platforms since its original {{domestic and international}} releases. The game was first re-released in cartridge format for the Famicom in 1994. The cartridge version slightly modified the title screen of the <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> version of the game, such that it displayed the number 1 {{at the end of}} the title. In 2001, the original game was re-released in the GameCube game Animal Crossing. The only way to unlock the game is by using an Action Replay. An official re-release was included in 2003's [...] for the GameCube, and the game was again re-released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 along with its sequel, , as part of the Famicom Mini/Classic NES Series. In 2006, another rerelease was made available to players on the Wii's Virtual Console, and most recently a timed demo of the game was released for the 2008 Wii game Super Smash Bros. Brawl, available in the Vault section. All re-releases of the game are virtually identical to the original, though the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console versions have been altered slightly to correct several instances of incorrect spelling from the original, most notably in the intro story. A tech demo called Classic Games was shown for the Nintendo 3DS at E3 2010, showcasing more than a dozen classic games utilizing 3D effects, including The Legend of Zelda. It was announced by Reggie Fils-Aim√©, president of Nintendo of America, that the titles were slated for release on the 3DS, including The Legend of Zelda, Mega Man 2, and [...] and would possibly make use of some of the 3DS's features, such as 3D effects, analog control, or camera support. The Legend of Zelda [...] was released to the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on September 1, 2011 as a part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program, and was later released to the Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22, 2011 in Japan, April 12, 2012 in Europe and July 5, 2012 in North America.|$|E

50|$|The {{heroine of}} the game, {{who works as}} an {{assistant}} at the Utsugi detective agency along with the protagonist. She helps out with the investigation on various occasions. Her graphic scheme is changed in the second <b>Disk</b> <b>Card,</b> but her character {{is meant to be}} the same as the first <b>Disk</b> <b>Card.</b> She is also 17 years old. She would later appear in trophy form in Super Smash Bros. Melee and, at one point, was a considered fighter for the same game.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{storage media}} (tapes, <b>disks,</b> <b>cards,</b> etc.) may be damaged by {{external}} magnetic fields. The potential for such {{damage has been}} researched, but no objective standard exists {{for the protection of}} such media. This paper summarizes a magnetic storage facility standard, Publication 933, that ensures magnetic protection of data storage media...|$|R
50|$|In this version, the {{shopping}} music features less instruments. Also, {{many of the}} tunes featured in the NES version are {{nowhere to be found}} in this version, and instead recycle the same music for certain scenes in the game. This is due to the limited memory space in FDS <b>disk</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
25|$|UNIVAC, {{the first}} {{commercial}} computer manufacturer, produced a series of EXEC operating systems. Like all early main-frame systems, this batch-oriented system managed magnetic drums, <b>disks,</b> <b>card</b> readers and line printers. In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system.|$|R
50|$|The SmartMedia format was {{launched}} {{in the summer of}} 1995 to compete with the MiniCard, CompactFlash, and PC Card formats. Although memory cards are nowadays associated with digital cameras, digital audio players, PDAs, and similar devices, SmartMedia was pitched as a successor to the computer floppy disk. Indeed, the format was originally named Solid State Floppy <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> (SSFDC). The SSFDC forum, a consortium aiming to promote SSFDC as an industry standard, was founded in April 1996, consisting of 37 initial members.|$|E
50|$|This game {{came on a}} blue <b>disk</b> <b>card,</b> {{when most}} disk {{at the time were}} yellow. The blue disk {{indicated}} that it could be used in machines called a Disk Fax as part of a contest in Japan. Players' high scores were saved on the disk, and by using the name entry feature in the game to enter their personal data, players could send the data to Nintendo using the Disk Fax. The winners of the contest received a golden disk containing a harder version of the game.|$|E
5000|$|The Famicom {{version in}} Japan was {{released}} in <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> format for the Family Computer Disk System add-on. In contrast to its NES counterpart, which the make player complete the game in one sitting, the Disk System allowed player to save their progress {{in one of three}} save files. After a game over, the player can quit the game and resume where they left off by loading the save file. The English localization of the game's manual identifies the main character as [...] "Captain Commando", a fictional spokesman for Capcom USA who later starred in his own video game.|$|E

50|$|The {{game is a}} {{standard}} command-style adventure. The player chooses from a set of text commands to interrogate, examine, or move from place to place. The setting of the secluded mansion gave the game a tense and horror movie-like atmosphere which was well received by fans. The original FDS version requires the player to switch the <b>Disk</b> <b>Cards</b> midway through the game, but the GBA and Virtual Console versions can be played without such interruptions.|$|R
5000|$|A Japanese {{version was}} {{released}} for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) {{a few months}} earlier on May 2, [...] under the title of Final Command: Akai Y≈çsai ("The Red Fortress"). This earlier version lacks some of the content that were later added to its NES counterpart {{due to the fact that}} it was released in <b>disk</b> <b>card</b> format rather than on a ROM cartridge. Namely, the stages in the FDS versions scrolls vertically only, have different layouts and are much shorter as a result. The beach stage is not featured in the FDS version and thus, the ruins (Stage 2 in the NES version) serves as the introductory stage instead.|$|E
50|$|The Human Research Facility (HRF) Holter {{accessories}} kit is stowed during {{launch and}} landing. Prior {{to using the}} Holter, the crew-member takes the HRF Holter accessories kit from stowage, uses the razor to shave the electrode sites, wipes the area clean with biocide wipes, and applies the electrode pads to the chest in the configuration depicted on the placard. The crew-member then dons the hardware, attaches the Holter harness to the main unit, and activates the hardware. At {{the end of the}} recording period, the crew-member deactivates, doffs, and stows the hardware. For data download, the crew-member removes the hard <b>disk</b> <b>card</b> assembly from the main unit, plugs the card into the HRF personal computer (PC), and downloads the data to the HRF PC. Downlink of the Holter data is accomplished as part of HRF rack activities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game was}} ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1987, which was later {{released}} in Japan in <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> format for the Family Computer Disk System {{under the title}} of Exciting Basketball. The NES version features 5-on-5 action on a horizontally scrolling court, four different teams (Boston Frogs, New York Eagles, Chicago Ox, Los Angeles Breakers), three levels of single-play difficulty, and four different choices of quarter lengths. Double Dribble {{was among the first}} games to feature cut scenes, which depicted a mid-air player completing a slam dunk, {{and one of the first}} to use speech, though in a limited quantity (such as announcing the game title, the game's beginning jump ball, and some foul calls)."The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] in this version was slightly altered, while it was being played in a cut scene depicting the crowd entering the stadium before the menu pops up. The NES version was ported to the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on November 16, 2007, and in North America on November 26, 2007.|$|E

5000|$|It {{soon became}} clear that the PCMCIA card {{standard}} needed expansion to support [...] "smart" [...] I/O cards to address the emerging need for fax, modem, LAN, harddisk and floppy <b>disk</b> <b>cards.</b> It also needed interrupt facilities and hot plugging, which required the definition of new BIOS and operating system interfaces. This led to the introduction of release 2.0 of the PCMCIA standard and JEIDA 4.1 in September 1991, which saw corrections and expansion with Card Services (CS) in the PCMCIA 2.1 standard in November 1992.|$|R

5000|$|The SFC remake had {{improved}} graphics - directed by Tomoyoshi Yamane, object and Samus designer for Super Metroid and designer for Wario Land 4 and Metroid II: Return of Samus; the remake's music was yet again composed by Kenji Yamamoto. Since the SFC version is on a cartridge {{instead of a}} <b>Disk</b> <b>Card,</b> it avoids the load times when saving games and switching between scenes. The SFC version utilized the SFC's 8-channel Sony SPC700, which had more channels than the Famicom's 5-channel Ricoh 2A03 and the FDS's channel together. The SFC version generally had extended remixes all of the original version's songs, and a few extra songs. The game uses either waveforms or white noise to [...] "voice" [...] the characters. The FDS version's voice waveforms {{are all the same}} frequency square waves, but in the SFC version, each character is designated to {{one of a number of}} different voice waveforms. In the original FDS version, for the protagonist's search for Ayumi, the game required the player to manually go through the town as a pseudo-3D maze; the SFC version had this trimmed down to just text and visual descriptions.|$|E

5000|$|After {{defeating}} Mother Brain, {{the player}} is given an end screen {{based on the}} time it took them to get there. Metroid {{is one of the first}} games to contain multiple endings, with five in total. In the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus Aran appears without her suit, and for the first time, reveals herself to be a woman. In Japan, the <b>Disk</b> <b>Card</b> media used by the Disk System allowed players to save up to three different games in Metroid, similar to the three save slots in The Legend of Zelda in the West. Use of an internal battery to manage files was not fully realized in time for Metroids international release. The Western versions of Metroid use a password system that was new to the industry at the time, in which players write down a 24-letter code and re-enter it into the game when they wish to continue a previous session. Codes also allow for changes in gameplay; the [...] "NARPAS SWORD" [...] grants Samus infinite ammunition, health, all power-ups, and a modified Ice Beam. The [...] "JUSTIN BAILEY" [...] code lets the player play as Samus without her Power Suit, which was thought by some to be the only way to use the feature; however, it is available simply by beating the game quickly enough to reveal Samus wearing a leotard at the ending sequence. However, the game on the Nintendo 3DS becomes inoperable if the player enters a code that the game does not recognize.|$|E
