40|$|Credit scoring is {{a common}} tool used by lenders in credit risk management. However, recent credit scoring methods are error-prone. Failures from credit scoring will {{significantly}} affect the next process, which is payment collection from customers. Bad customers, who are incorrectly approved by credit scoring, end up making <b>payments</b> that, are <b>overdue.</b> In this dissertation, we propose a solution for pre-empting <b>overdue</b> <b>payment</b> as well as improving credit scoring performance. Firstly, we utilize data mining algorithms including Logistic Regression, C 4. 5, and Bayesian Network to construct payment predictions that can quickly find <b>overdue</b> <b>payments</b> in advance. By utilizing payment prediction, customers who may make <b>overdue</b> <b>payments</b> will be known by the lender earlier. As a result, the lender can proactively approach such customers to pay their payments on schedule. The second solution is to define a refined scoring model that will use feedback from the payment prediction models to improve the initial credit scoring mechanism. The payment prediction result will give information to review the combinations of current credit scoring parameters that work inappropriately. By updating the current credit scoring parameters, the performance of credit scoring {{is expected to increase}} significantly. As a result, this mechanism will create a dynamic credit scoring model. We also investigate the impact of the imbalanced data problem on the payment prediction process. We employ data segmentation as a tool to overcome the problem of imbalanced data. By using a novel technique of data segmentation, which we call Majority Bad Payment Segments (MBPS), learning bad payments become much easier. The results of our experiments show that payment prediction based on MBPS produces much higher performance when compared to conventional methods of dealing with imbalanced data. We perform extensive experimentation and evaluation with a variety of metrics such as Hit Rates, Cost Coverage, F-measure, and the Area under Curve measure...|$|R

Guin (2017) shows, for example, that considerable differences exist in behaviour associated with savings and indebtedness. Households in French-speaking regions save less than those in the German-speaking regions, {{and are more likely to}} take out formal credits and informal ones (among the family network, for example) in the case of financial difficulties and <b>overdue</b> <b>payments.</b> This is confirmed by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO); households in the French-speaking regions are ahead of the Italian- and German-speaking Swiss in terms of indebtedness. 1 Moreover, debts owed to the family or to friends are more common among the French-speaking Swiss than German speakers. 2 The same tendency can be found among people aged 18 – 30 [*]years. The existing literature suggests that French-speaking students save less (Guin, 2017). German-speaking people who leave the parental home have larger incomes, have fewer financial difficulties, save more and have fewer <b>overdue</b> <b>payments</b> than those in the other regions of the country (Wernli and Henchoz, 2015).|$|R
