2500|$|With few exceptions, parrots are monogamous breeders who nest in {{cavities}} {{and hold}} no territories {{other than their}} nesting sites. The pair bonds of the parrots and cockatoos are strong and a pair remains close during the nonbreeding season, even if they join larger flocks. As with many birds, pair bond formation is preceded by courtship displays; these are relatively simple {{in the case of}} cockatoos. In Psittacidae parrots' common breeding displays, usually undertaken by the male, include slow, deliberate steps known as a [...] "parade" [...] or [...] "stately walk" [...] and the [...] "eye-blaze", where the pupil of the eye constricts to reveal the edge of the iris. Allopreening is used by the pair to help maintain the bond. Cooperative breeding, where birds other than the breeding pair help raise the young and is common in some bird families, is extremely rare in parrots, and has only unambiguously been demonstrated in the El Oro parakeet and the <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> (which may also exhibit polygamous, or group breeding, behaviour with multiple females contributing to the clutch).|$|E

50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet's</b> {{breeding}} {{system is}} almost unique amongst parrots, as pairs are {{aided by a}} number of helpers which aid in the raising of the young. This behavior is less common with parakeets in captivity, which often abandon their young after three weeks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>parakeets</b> are {{a social}} species, living, feeding, sleeping, and even {{breeding}} together. They eat fruits, flowers, buds, seeds, and cultured maize in the wild. These include {{the seed of}} Croton matouensis, which {{is related to the}} castor oil plant; muruci fruit (Byrsonima crispa); mangoes; and açaí fruits.|$|R
50|$|At birth, <b>golden</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{are covered}} in white down that {{eventually}} turns darker within a week. By {{the end of the}} third week, wing feathers start to develop. Juveniles are playful, but may turn abusive against their peers. Nestlings are preyed upon by toucans, which may explain their social behavior. Nests are vigorously defended from toucans by several members of the group.|$|R

50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> or golden conure, (Guaruba guarouba), is a {{medium-sized}} golden-yellow Neotropical parrot {{native to the}} Amazon Basin of interior northern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to several {{endangered}} species including the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), bush dog (Speothos venaticus) and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).A total of 193 bird species have been recorded, including the endangered Kawall's amazon (Amazona kawalli), <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Guaruba guarouba), orange-cheeked parrot (Pyrilia barrabandi), vulturine parrot (Pyrilia vulturina) and golden-crowned manakin (Lepidothrix vilasboasi).|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} the {{displacement}} of <b>golden</b> <b>parakeets</b> by habitat loss comes from {{the building of the}} Tucuruí Dam, Pará, from 1975-1984. More than 35,000 forest dwellers were forced from what had been a habitat that was considered to be [...] "among the richest and most diversified in the world." [...] In addition, 2,875 km2 of rainforest were flooded, and 1,600 islands were produced by the flooding, all of which were heavily deforested.|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg) {{infection}} of wild native Brazilian psittacines (Psittaciformes) which died of any cause during sorting, rehabilitation, or conservation, was investigated by PCR. Two previously described PCR methodologies using Mg specific primers were employed for the analyses of 140 swab samples (cloaca, trachea, or palatine cleft). Average positive Mg detection in cloacal swabs was 51. 9 %, with 80. 0 % (n= 5) of Blue-and-yellow Macaws (Ara ararauna), 60. 0 % (n= 3) Dusky Parrots (Pionus fuscus), 52. 5 % (n= 59) Amazon Parrots (Amazona aestiva), 50. 0 % (n= 2) Orange-winged Parrots (Amazona amazonica), 50. 0 % (n= 2) Jandaya Parakeetsor Jandaya Conures (Aratinga jandaya), 0 % (n= 2) Golden Conures or <b>Golden</b> <b>Parakeets</b> (Guarouba guarouba), and 0 % (n= 2) Hyacinth Macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). Palatine cleft swab sampling was {{more sensitive to}} detect Mg, with 85. 4 % (n= 17) detection rate, as compared to 67. 4 % (n= 46) obtained with tracheal samples, and 53. 5 % (n= 77) with cloacal swabs. The surprisingly high Mg incidence in psittacines kept in conservation or triage environments is possibly due to the proximity or cohabitation with several bird species during confinement and housing psittacines of different origins together. The implementation of biosecurity measures and species-specific facilities is recommended...|$|R
50|$|The zoo {{has several}} {{endangered}} species {{of animals in}} the Himalayas, and animals like Royal Bengal tiger, Tibetan wolves, sambar, leopard cat and Himalayan bear. It also has a vast collection of high altitude birds, like kalij pheasant, Lady Amherst pheasant, rose ringed <b>parakeet,</b> <b>golden</b> pheasant and red junglefowl.|$|R
50|$|Other {{species of}} note include: pink backed pelicans.

Species include: Desert Finch and Carmine Bee-Eater.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{is listed}} on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. This {{is largely due to}} {{deforestation}} and the capture of wild birds for aviculture, where it is in high demand due to the attractiveness of its plumage. Locally, they are considered as pests for feeding on crops, and are hunted for food or sport. The current population is estimated to be in the range of 10,000 to 20,000.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} a warm, humid sub-tropical climate, with {{temperatures}} ranging from 20 to 34 C.The area {{is one of}} large sandstone plateaus cut by the valleys of perennial or intermittent rivers.The top of the plateaus is covered by typical cerrado vegetation, while there is gallery forest in the valleys.Fauna is very varied, and includes species such as maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Guaruba guarouba), armadillo and peccary.|$|E
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of wildlife, some of which are endangered species. The wildlife includes the Indian wolf, Indian leopard, sloth bear, striped hyena, Golden jackal, jungle cat, sambhar, nilgai, chausingha (the four horned antelope), chinkara and Indian hare. The birds at Kumbhalgarh includes the normally shy and untrusting grey jungle fowl. Peacocks and doves can be sighted feeding on grains scattered by the jungle guards. Birds like the red spurfowl, <b>parakeet,</b> <b>golden</b> oriole, grey pigeon, bulbul, dove and white breasted kingfisher can also be seen near the water holes.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> is 34 cm long [...] and mainly yellow {{with green}} in the outer wings and with an all-yellow tail. It has a large horn-colored (gray) beak, pale-pink bare eye rings, brown irises, and pink legs. Males and females have {{identical}} external appearance. Juveniles are duller and have less yellow and more green plumage than the adults. The juvenile's head and neck are mostly green, the back is green and yellow, the upper side of tail is mostly green, the breast is greenish, the eye rings are pale-gray, and the legs are brown.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet</b> reaches sexual {{maturity}} {{at the age}} of three years, the breeding season starts in November and runs through February. They nest in a high tree, in deeper than average nesting cavities, and lay an average of four 37.1 by 29.9 mm eggs, which they aggressively guard. The incubation period is about 30 days, in which the male and female take turns incubating. In {{the first few years of}} {{sexual maturity}}, golden parakeets tend to lay infertile clutches until the age of six to eight. In captivity, golden parakeets resume breeding when their chicks are taken from them.|$|E

5000|$|On average, sun parakeets weigh {{approximately}} 110 g (4 oz) and {{are around}} 30 cm (12 in) long. They are sexually monomorphic.Adults have a rich yellow crown, nape, mantle, lesser wing-coverts, {{tips of the}} greater wing-coverts, chest, and underwing-coverts. The face and belly are orange with red around the ears. The base of the greater wing-coverts, tertials, and base of the primaries are green, while the secondaries, tips of the primaries, {{and most of the}} primary coverts are dark blue. The tail is olive-green with a blue tip. From below, all the flight feathers are dark greyish. The bill is black. The legs and the bare eye-ring are grey, but the latter often fades to white in captivity (so using amount of grey or white in the eye-ring for determining [...] "purity" [...] of an individual can be misleading). It is easily confused with the closely related jandaya parakeet and sulphur-breasted parakeet, but the former has entirely green wing-coverts, mantle and vent, while the latter has green mottling to the mantle and less orange to the underparts. The sun parakeet is also superficially similar to the pale-billed <b>golden</b> <b>parakeet.</b>|$|E
