5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since {{more than a year}} had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|The {{affected}} {{versions of}} OpenSSL allocate a memory buffer for {{the message to}} be returned based on the length field in the requesting message, {{without regard to the}} actual size of that message's payload. Because of this <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> proper bounds checking, the message returned consists of the payload, possibly followed by whatever else {{happened to be in the}} allocated memory buffer.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{myths of}} Rome are often political or moral, that is, {{they deal with}} the development of Roman government in accordance with divine law, as expressed by Roman religion, and with demonstrations of the individual's adherence to moral expectations (mos maiorum) or <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|R
5|$|In the novel, Miranda {{has many}} {{similarities}} to Wintour—among them, she is British, has two children, and {{is described as}} a major contributor to the Met. Priestly is a tyrant who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|R

5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E
5|$|The city {{consists}} of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel casino, a 24-hour wedding chapel, a discothèque, and a convenience store. The player can walk between {{areas that are}} next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, which costs the player money; <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so results in Larry's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic. During {{the early stages of}} the game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as King's Quest—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside a blender and reformed.|$|E
5|$|Ulrezaj reappears {{several years}} later, {{residing}} on Aiur {{where he is}} manipulating a faction of Protoss survivors who were not evacuated. Ulrezaj uses these Protoss to attempt to capture a Terran archaeologist, Jacob Ramsey, who has the powerful mind of a Protoss archivist, Zamara, residing in his own mind; their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so leads to Ulrezaj personally trying to take Ramsey, but the archaeologist escapes through a warp gate while both Zerg and Valerian Mengsk's forces also attempt to capture him. Ulrezaj traces Ramsey to Ehlna, breaking through the defenses of both the Protoss and the Dominion. However, Zamara uses her last energy to lock Ulrezaj's mind into a storage crystal, sacrificing herself to keep Ulrezaj trapped.|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in {{the last part of}} the game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Events {{come to a}} {{head when}} Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of being {{involved}} in the murders. Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist's interrogation, leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck, and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes a god-like monster—Kunino-sagiri—which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame; as the protagonist, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive, and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi, is the true killer. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so ends the game with the party unable to solve the case; Nanako either remaining dead, or reviving but remaining hospitalised; and the recurring fog permanently setting in, the last of which will eventually lead to humanity's demise.|$|E

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to better understand and predict urban mobility patterns in the city, and analyze the robustness of the multi-modal transportation system, i.e., its ability to withstand random and targeted <b>failures.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> so, we model the multi-modal transportation system as a “multiplex network” consisting of several layers that correspond to the different transportation modes available in the city; and we estimate the coverage of the city, which is defined as the average fraction of distinct vertices visited at least once during a time budget.|$|R

25|$|There {{are certain}} playing {{restrictions}} {{that apply to}} all League fixtures. Bowlers are limited to bowling a maximum of fifteen overs per innings, the fielding side's innings must be bowled within 3 hours 10 minutes (<b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so results in a points penalty), and the fielding side must have four fieldsmen plus the wicketkeeper and bowler within a 30-yard fielding circle {{at the moment of}} delivery (<b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so results in a no ball being called).|$|E

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} {{the assumption that}} small religious groups enjoy little political power. According to the standard view, courts, because of their countermajoritarian qualities, are indispensable for protecting religious minority groups from oppression by the majority. But this assumption fails {{to account for the}} many and varied ways in which the majoritarian branches have chosen to protect and accommodate even unpopular religious minority groups, as well as the courts’ <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The Article offers a public choice analysis to account for the surprising majoritarian reality of religious accommodationism. Further, it explores the important implications of this reality for deeply contested legal doctrines, as well as the insights it offers for recent and looming high profile cases pitting state law against religious liberty...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{uncover the}} load and {{fault-tolerant}} backbones of the trans-European gas pipeline network. Combining topological data {{with information on}} inter-country flows, we estimate the global load of the network and its tolerance <b>to</b> <b>failures.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> this, we apply two complementary methods generalized from the betweenness centrality and the maximum flow. We find that the gas pipeline network has grown to satisfy a dual-purpose: on one hand, the major pipelines are crossed by {{a large number of}} shortest paths thereby increasing the efficiency of the network; on the other hand, a non-operational pipeline causes only a minimal impact on network capacity, implying that the network is error-tolerant. These findings suggest that the trans-European gas pipeline network is robust, i. e., error tolerant <b>to</b> <b>failures</b> of high load links. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures (minor changes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDistributed storage {{systems have}} to ensure data {{availability}} and durability despite {{the occurrence of}} <b>failures.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> so, many of them rely on replication mechanisms. We show that {{the layout of the}} data block copies on the nodes, chiefly the way the copies are scattered, has a major impact on the reparation speed and thus on the data loss ratio. In this paper, we propose an approach that provides the ability: (i) to finely tune the proportion of common content stored by the nodes; and (ii) to control the storage load distribution while creating new data block copies. We propose a simulation model that allows us to present a long-term study {{of the impact of the}} data block copies layout and the system’s storage load on the data loss ratio...|$|R

40|$|According to John Broome, akrasia {{consists}} in a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that one believes one ought <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and such akrasia is necessarily irrational. In fact, however, failing to intend something that one believes one ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is only {{guaranteed to be}} irrational if one is certain of a maximally detailed proposition about what one ought to do; if one is uncertain about {{any part of the}} full story about what one ought <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> it could be perfectly rational not <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that one believes one ought <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This paper seeks to remedy this problem, by proposing an anti-akrasia principle that covers cases of uncertainty (as well as cases of such complete certainty).
