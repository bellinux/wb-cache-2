During the trip, Spotnitz met a [...] "friend of a friend," [...] who constantly mentioned an [...] "image that freaked him out." [...] The man explained that the image was a tube of toothpaste that, when opened, would have [...] "blood come out." [...] The mental image intrigued Spotnitz, who later postulated, [...] "How could you create a story where blood {{comes out of a}} tube of toothpaste?" [...] Due to the strangeness of the idea, Spotnitz was unable to think of any real-world scenarios having likeness to the image, so he began to look into [...] "dreams and nightmares." [...] He eventually {{came up with the idea}} of a cult trying to reach a higher plane of existence, but instead stumbling into a [...] "lower place, a darker plane." [...] Spotnitz later explained: [...] "What if the higher plane is a darker plane, what <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we're reaching up but we're reaching down." [...] Complementarily, the episode's title, [...] "Via Negativa," [...] means [...] "Negative Way" [...] in Latin. [...] This type of theology, more commonly referred to as apophatic theology, attempts to describe God by expanding upon what God is not.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} religious problems is that people fear having a relationship with God and consequently distance themselves from Him.

This represents a wholeness that we as human beings are capable of only <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of ourselves as walking amongst angels. (Sfas Emes, Parshat Beha'alotecha 5636) ...|$|E

According to Richmond, Nate still has plenty more to give and the studio would continue to create new Uncharted experiences as long as fans want it.
