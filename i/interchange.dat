5|$|In 1990, {{plans were}} made to build an <b>interchange</b> at PA 903 in Carbon County. A bill authorizing {{construction}} of this <b>interchange</b> {{was signed into law}} by Governor Casey in July of that year. Plans for this <b>interchange</b> were cancelled by the turnpike commission in 1995. In 2006, plans for an <b>interchange</b> at PA 903 were resurrected, with the proposed <b>interchange</b> to be all-electronic, in that it will only accept E-ZPass. Construction on the $23 million <b>interchange</b> began in the middle of 2008. The <b>interchange</b> opened to traffic on June 30, 2015.|$|E
5|$|MD295 {{is planned}} to be widened to six lanes between MD100 and I-195 with a new <b>interchange</b> is {{planned to be}} {{constructed}} at Hanover Road.

50|$|Roundabout <b>interchanges</b> are {{extremely}} {{common in the}} United Kingdom and Ireland with hundreds on the motorway network alone. However, recent cost-cutting has meant that dumbbell <b>interchanges</b> are increasingly used instead. These are essentially diamond <b>interchanges</b> with roundabouts instead of signals or stop signs where the slip roads meet the minor road. They are cheaper than roundabout <b>interchanges</b> as only one bridge is required instead of two.|$|R
50|$|Between <b>interchanges</b> Oudenrijn and Everdingen, the A2 was {{expanded}} to 2x4 lanes. Between <b>interchanges</b> Everdingen and Deil, {{the road is}} widened from four (2x2) to eight lanes (2x4); the section between <b>interchanges</b> Deil and Empel {{was expanded}} from four to six lanes.|$|R
5|$|A planned {{modification}} of the existing route encompasses construction of a directional T <b>interchange</b> to replace the existing trumpet <b>interchange</b> built at Žuta Lokva. The new <b>interchange</b> is only planned to be built once the A7 motorway is completed between the Rijeka bypass and Žuta Lokva. It shall not feature any weaving, similar to the Bosiljevo2 <b>interchange</b> of the A1 and A6 motorways.|$|E
5|$|After the Valley Forge <b>interchange</b> {{the turnpike}} is {{designated}} as I-276 {{and becomes a}} six-lane road serving as a suburban commuter highway, crossing the Schuylkill River on the Schuylkill River Bridge near Norristown. In Plymouth Meeting, an <b>interchange</b> with Germantown Pike provides access to Norristown before the roadway reaches the Mid-County <b>Interchange.</b> This <b>interchange</b> connects to I-476, which heads south as the Blue Route and north as the Northeast Extension of the turnpike; connecting the mainline turnpike to the Lehigh Valley and the Pocono Mountains.|$|E
5|$|After this <b>interchange,</b> {{the freeway}} bends in a southeastern {{direction}} and reaches its final exit, Exit 420. This exit is a cloverleaf <b>interchange</b> with US-69, {{which is also}} known as the 18th Street Expressway. At this <b>interchange,</b> US-69 turns east to overlap I-70, US-40, and US-24, and the highways continue east of Exit 420 toward Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E
5000|$|Limited <b>interchanges</b> were reintroduced, {{a maximum}} of 12 <b>interchanges</b> were now allowed using a pool of 4 replacements.|$|R
50|$|Although many post-1970 <b>interchanges</b> along I-4 were {{constructed}} before the recent widening projects, {{they were designed}} with I-4 expansion in mind. In other words, there is enough room available to widen I-4 to up to ten lanes without extensively modifying the <b>interchanges.</b> Some of these <b>interchanges</b> include the I-75 stack (constructed in the 1980s) and several <b>interchanges</b> serving the Walt Disney World Resort (constructed in the late 1980s and early 1990s).|$|R
500|$|The Kansas Turnpike is [...] long. [...] the Kansas Turnpike has 22 <b>interchanges</b> and two barrier toll plazas.

5|$|An <b>interchange</b> between 36th Street and I-96 {{was built}} {{starting}} in 2005 and {{was completed in}} 2006. The project aimed to improve access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport southeast of Grand Rapids. The reconstruction of the Wixom Road <b>interchange</b> near Novi as a SPUI was completed in late fall of 2008. Another <b>interchange</b> at Latson Road in Howell was approved for construction on July 19, 2012. This <b>interchange</b> was designed to bring improved access to the eastern Howell area, which prior to construction of the Latson Road exit was only accessible from westbound I-96. The project was completed on December 2, 2013. Also in 2013, the two interchanges near Nunica serving M-104 and B-31 were reconstructed, with two ramps removed from the former and two added to the latter; a new partial <b>interchange</b> was also built in preparation of M-231.|$|E
5|$|An <b>interchange</b> {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to {{widening}} US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed <b>interchange</b> is to be a dumbbell <b>interchange,</b> a variation of the diamond <b>interchange</b> with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed to build this <b>interchange</b> is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond <b>interchange</b> was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack <b>interchange</b> at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban <b>interchange</b> at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond <b>interchange</b> with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway <b>interchange,</b> but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing <b>interchange</b> in the future.|$|E
