50|$|On February 7, 2008, Lowassa {{was forced}} to resign after being implicated in the Richmond Energy deal {{corruption}} scandal. This followed a parliamentary select committee report on an <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> contract between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd (TANESCO), a public corporation, and a US company styled Richmond Development Company LLC of Houston, Texas. The five-member select committee, headed by Kyela MP, Dr. Harrison Mwakyembe, found the contract to have been fraudulently concluded, hence unconscionable. Richmond was contracted to provide 100 megawatts of electricity each day after a drought early in 2006 but the Richmond generators arrived late and did not work as expected. In spite of this, the government paid Richmond more than $100,000 a day. Lowassa's office then influenced the government's decision to extend Richmonds contract despite advice to the contrary form TANESCO. Two other cabinet ministers who had held the energy portfolio, Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha and Nazir Karamagi were forced to resign as well.|$|E
40|$|Buoyant {{airborne}} {{wind turbines}} are devices capable of harnessing stronger winds at higher altitudes {{and with their}} automated and rapidly deployable system they are suited to niche applications such as <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation.</b> Although much of the wind turbine technology for these systems is common with their ‘grounded’ cousins, an additional design limitation is the requirement for the wind turbine equipment to be lightweight. This paper concentrates on the drivetrain of the wind turbine and the different potential ways of reducing its mass. A buoyant airborne wind turbine with different types of drivetrains, going from gearless to geared systems with distinct gear ratios, has been analysed. Special {{attention was paid to}} the mass of the supporting structure of the permanent magnet electrical generator and this was minimized by utilising low density materials, such as composites, in its design. The model showed that a significant reduction in the mass of the drivetrain can be achieved in the gearless case by using materials with a higher ratio of Young’s Modulus to density for the electrical machine supporting structure. For the geared systems, mass decrease was less significant as the gearbox mass had also to be considered. Keywords: Airborne, lightweight, generator structure, composite material...|$|E
40|$|Crude and {{gas from}} the Russian Federation dominates the South Eastern Europe (SEE) import portfolio. Russian {{companies}} control oil refineries in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia. Gazprom is the main gas supplier to the entire region and the only producer of domestic gas (and oil) in Serbia. Its gas export {{is associated with a}} network of subsidiaries, resellers, agents and sponsorships that are granted special rights in their respective countries of operation. This system is supported by the availability of âon demandâ credit resources that contribute to the soft budget constraint and facilitate the operation of low efficiency district heating systems, <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> and inefficient (fertilizer, etc.) industries. In this governance context, and if the current supply and demand structure remains, SEE will have an increased energy security risk due its exposure to a disruption in gas supply via Ukraine. In contrast, the European Union (EU) is looking toward this region as an option to improve its security of gas supply and diversify its supply portfolio. This encourages local expectations of transit rents and {{is based on the assumption}} that the region may host the following: Southern Gas Corridor, North-South Gas Interconnection and Central/South Eastern Electricity Interconnection. There are more overlapping energy transit projects being considered than in any other region in Europe. This paper sets out a realistic roadmap that is able to overcome existing barriers and provide the desired level of security of supply: 1. Gas consumption that does not yield positive economic returns is to be phased out by energy efficiency, use of renewable energy and opening to international markets; 2. Flexible Black Sea & Balkans (BS&B) Gas Hub through the improved use of existing infrastructure; 3. BS&B Gas Hub facilitates gas trade with the rest of Europe that promotes more efficient use of gas, market opening, industrial restructuring and increased renewable energy integration â all beyond the expectations indicated in various current strategic documents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{backup power}} plays an {{important}} emergency supply role in industrial field and agricultural field. The <b>emergency</b> supply <b>power</b> (such as generator and Uninterrupted Power System etc.) is a standby state {{in most of the}} time. These devices only start to ensure electricity supply on the condition of power lose or power failure. It is difficult for users to know its real load performance. This paper designed a kind of intelligent AC (Alternating current) load test system based on PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to solve the problem. There are signal acquisition part ， the dummy load component and parameter display control part in testing load testing system, which can meet the general users of <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> supply in daily inspection. We design the intelligent control for high performance and fine test users.

40|$|Radial gas {{turbines}} engines have established {{prominence in the}} field of small turbomachinery because of their simplicity, relatively high performance and installation features. Thus they have been used in a variety of applications such as generator sets, small auxiliary power units (APu), air conditioning of aircraft cabins and hybrid electric vehicles turbines. The current research describes the design, manufacturing, construction and testing a radial type small gas turbine. The aim was to design and build the engine to drive directly a high-speed permanent magnet alternator running at 60000 rpmand developing a maximum of 60 W. This direct coupling arrangement produces a portable, light, compact, reliable and environment friendly power generator. These features make the generator set very attractive to use in many applications including <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> for hospitals, in areas of natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, in remote areas that cannot be served from the national grid, oil rigs, and in confined places of limited spaces. It {{is important to recognize that}} the design of the main components, that is, the inward flow radial UFR turbines, the centrifugal compressor and the combustion chamber involve consideration of aero-dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, stress analysis, vibration analysis, selection of bearings, selection of suitable materials and the requirements for manufacturing. These considerations are all inter-linked and a procedure has been followed to reach an optimum design. This research was divided into three phases: phase I dealt with the complete design of the inward radial turbine, the centrifugal compressor, the power transmission shaft, the selection of combustion chamber and the bearing housing including the selection of bearings. Phase 2 dealt with mechanical consideration of the rotating components that is stress, thermal and vibration analyses of the turbine rotor, the impeller and the rotating shaft, respectively. Also it dealt with the selection of a suitable fuel and oil lubrication systems and a suitable starting system. Phase 3 dealt with the manufacturing of the gas turbine components, balancing the rotating components, assembling the engine and finally commissioning and then testing the engine. The current work in this thesis has put the light on a new design methodology on determining the optimum principal dimensions of the rotor and the impeller. This method, also, has defined the optimum number of blades and the axial length of the rotor and the impeller. Mathematical models linking the performance parameters and the design variables for the turbine and the compressor have been developed to assist in carrying out parametric studies to study the influence of the design parameters on the performance and on each other. Also, a new graphical matching procedure has been developed for the gas turbine components. This technique can serve as a valuable tool to determine the operating range and the engine running line. Furthermore, it would decide whether the gas turbine engine operates in a region of satisfactory compressor and turbine efficiencie...|$|E
