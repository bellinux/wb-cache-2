5|$|In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> loss deeply, and was {{plunged into}} {{depression}} and insomnia, even contemplating suicide. He left Paris {{and stayed in}} Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet, alongside her sister Delaware. Her first overseas cruise came in November 1910, when she steamed across the Atlantic to visit France and Britain. North Dakota also took part in the invasion of Vera Cruz in 1914. Unlike her sister, North Dakota remained off the American coast {{for the duration of the}} United States' involvement in World War I. Hugh Rodman, the commander of the American expeditionary force, specifically requested that North Dakota be kept stateside; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> turbine engines were too unreliable for the ship to be deployed to a war zone.|$|E
25|$|On 30 March 2013, a {{distribution}} error occurred, and many subscribers to Doctor Who Magazine received the issue {{five days before}} the official release date. The issue of the magazine included the official announcement that David Tennant and Billie Piper, who previously played the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler in Doctor Who respectively, were lined up {{to appear in the}} special, along with actor John Hurt. Moffat did not want to bring Rose the character back because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> story was wrapped up and did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' arc. However, he liked the concept of bringing back her Bad Wolf persona and felt that Piper needed to be in the special as she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who.|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} gasp and sob, and Bill {{began to think}} wot a good wife he 'ad got, when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'er</b> put a couple of pillers over where she judged his 'ead to be, and hold 'em down with her arm.|$|R
60|$|Herbert {{approached}} Sydney. It was {{a moment}} when he was bound to assure her of his sympathy. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her.</b> In his inmost heart <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her.</b> As <b>he</b> drew nearer, he saw tears in her eyes; but {{they seemed to have}} risen without her knowledge. Hardly conscious of his presence, she stood before him--lost in thought.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated. <b>He</b> {{suddenly}} <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> hand grow colder in his. He saw her frame shiver {{beneath its}} weight of furs.|$|R
500|$|Christina Lee from Idolator {{called it}} [...] "as assertive" [...] as Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] (2005), which she {{considered}} a good thing, while Kayleigh Hughes from Bustle {{described it as}} [...] "super cool". Additionally, Allison Bowsher from Much claimed that the artists, including Stefani and Timberlake, within the soundtrack created [...] "awesome music". Jonathan Hamard from Aficia compared the track to Stefani's 2004 song [...] "Rich Girl" [...] and the material on her third studio album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016). <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> role in Trolls was a good move and claimed that Stefani's verses came off as cool and unpretentious. Similarly, Nadia N. from Virgin Radio saw the release as unexpected but praised the dancing qualities of the track.|$|E
500|$|Edith Cardus died on 26 March 1968. Despite their {{separate}} day-to-day lives, {{she had been}} an influential presence for nearly all Cardus's adult life; they had communicated by telephone almost daily, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> loss keenly. After her death he left the National Liberal Club and moved into her flat, which remained his base {{for the rest of}} his life. In the ensuing months he worried about his deteriorating relationship with The Guardian; the paper had been renamed in 1959 following reorganisation, and its editorial offices had moved to London in 1964. Cardus felt that much of the old ethos had departed, and that his once-sacrosanct copy was now at the mercy of subeditors. He was particularly incensed by the treatment meted out to his 1969 Edinburgh Festival reports, and referred to the subeditors' room as [...] "the Abattoir" [...] in one of many letters complaining of editorial butchery.|$|E
500|$|Marlohe {{expanded}} on Sévérine's personality {{beyond what}} {{was written in}} the screenplay. She said she added a feeling of [...] "raziness" [...] to the character, partially basing it on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. She also thought more critically about Sévérine's relationship with Silva, saying: [...] "I just built everything with my imagination, and that is very exciting, too, because there's room for accidents on set." [...] GMA Network's Mikhail Lecaros wrote that Marlohe approached the character with a [...] "bemused cynicism". Daniel Craig praised Marlohe's approach to the character, saying she [...] "brought a huge amount of depth to what is essentially a very small part" [...] and [...] "gave her an awful lot of history in the way she played it". He added that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> preparation made the scenes easier to act, and would make the interactions between Bond and Sévérine more appealing to the audience. While discussing her working relationship with Craig, Marlohe described him as [...] "funny, very humble...".|$|E
6000|$|Fort dashed {{his hand}} across his eyes. The sight of her face just then moved him horribly. What a brute <b>he</b> <b>felt!</b> <b>He</b> took <b>her</b> limp hand, put it to his lips, and murmured: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> again <b>her</b> {{interest}} in his work. Or was it for himself? Why was she always most interested in him as he appeared in his work? ...|$|R
60|$|Helena {{had come}} to read his {{loneliness}} and the humiliation of his lot. <b>He</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> blue eyes, heavily, steadily gazing into his soul, and he had lost himself to her.|$|R
500|$|... "Canvassing" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Marlene Griggs-Knope, Leslie's mother and an important public figure in the Pawnee school system. Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, and I thought that was really impressive." [...] During the audition, Reed was asked whether she was proud of her daughter, and Reed replied, [...] "I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother." [...] The improvised line, which was based on something her father-in-law said to her, so impressed the producers that they incorporated it into the episode. Schur said the producers sought to establish Leslie's mother early in the series, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> relationship to Leslie {{was the center of the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur said of Leslie's attempts to impress her mom at her public forum, [...] "We imagined it in the writer's room that she is eight years old and doing a piano recital, and she's nervous because her mom's there." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the character has been mixed. BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> [...] "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her {{to a combination of}} Catwoman and [...] "the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from Angel". However, he later admitted Bela was [...] "a great comic foil". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] with the [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be [...] "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel [...] "even a tiny bit sorry for [...] " [...] during her death scene. Writing that [...] "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently"not either annoying or downright contemptible"and deemed her [...] "a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys". Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale [...] "No Rest For The Wicked" [...] that Bela [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a [...] "decent traveling [...] ". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them [...] "look ridiculous", she [...] "really liked" [...] the character. Overall, she felt Cohan [...] "did one hell of a job".|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the praise}} was {{reserved}} for the casting, with Vivien Leigh in particular being singled out for her performance as Scarlett. Nugent described her as the [...] "pivot of the picture" [...] and believed her to be [...] "so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable". Similarly, Hoellering found her [...] "perfect" [...] in [...] "appearance and movements"; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> acting best when she was allowed to [...] "accentuate the split personality she portrays" [...] and thought she was particularly effective in such moments of characterization like {{the morning after the}} marital rape scene. Flinn also found Leigh suited to the role physically and felt she was best in the scenes where she displays courage and determination, such as the escape from Atlanta and when Scarlett kills a Yankee deserter. Leigh won in the Best Actress category for her performance at the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Of Clark Gable's performance as Rhett Butler, Flinn felt the characterization was [...] "as close to Miss Mitchell's conception—and the audience's—as might be imagined", a view which Nugent concurred with, although Hoellering felt that Gable didn't quite convince in the closing scenes, as Rhett walks out on Scarlett in disgust. Of the other principal cast members, both Hoellering and Flinn found Leslie Howard to be [...] "convincing" [...] as the weak-willed Ashley, with Flinn identifying Olivia de Havilland as a [...] "standout" [...] as Melanie; Nugent was also especially taken with de Havilland's performance, describing it as a [...] "gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization". Hattie McDaniel's performance as Mammy was singled out for praise by many critics: Nugent believed she gave the best performance in the film after Vivien Leigh, with Flinn placing it third after Leigh's and Gable's performances.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you a poet?" [...] she demanded. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>her</b> {{question}} had an unexplained weight of meaning behind it, {{as if she}} sought an {{answer to a question}} that she did not ask.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>her</b> {{mind had}} lost its balance, and, what is more, his own nerves were shaken. Therefore he was {{naturally}} the angrier with her, and the more determined to be perfectly matter-of-fact.|$|R
60|$|Linley {{thought of}} {{his visit to the}} school, and remembered the detestable mistress. He excused Sydney; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her.</b> She held the door open for him. Sure of himself, he entered the summer-house.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson {{asked her what she}} would do if she were in his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] in his tone. A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Bonwick's more {{important}} volumes were [...] (1867); , , and [...] s, {{all of which}} were published in 1870; Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought (1878), First Twenty Years of Australia (1882), Port Phillip Settlement (1883), Romance of the Wool Trade (1887) and Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions (1894). He had now finally settled down in England and in this year was appointed archivist for the New South Wales government. He traced and copied the information that became the basis of the History of New South Wales, vol. I by G. B. Barton, and vol. II by A. Britton. His materials were afterwards printed as The Historical Records of New South Wales. Though he published other volumes, these records were his principal work until in 1902, at the age of 85, he resigned his position. In 1900 he had celebrated with his wife the sixtieth anniversary of their wedding. She died in 1901 and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> loss keenly. He completed and published in 1902 his final volume, an autobiography, An Octogenarian's Reminiscences, and died on 6 October 1906. He was survived by five children.|$|E
60|$|He tottered to his chair. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> draw {{his arms}} about her neck; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> put her own round his; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> kisses on his face; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> wet cheek laid against his own; he felt--oh, how deeply!--all {{that he had}} done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't a {{question}} of that! I shall be glad to do anything I can," [...] Lanfear said, with a little pang which {{he tried to keep}} silent in orienting himself anew towards the girl, whose loveliness <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> before <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> piteousness.|$|R
60|$|The silence {{between them}} {{remained}} unbroken for some minutes. <b>He</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> appeal to his consideration {{as she had}} never expected or intended him to feel it--he shrank from looking at her or from speaking to her again.|$|R
60|$|He despised {{himself for}} his own weakness, but at this awful and supreme moment, when he {{realized}} that the idol which he had set up and worshipped was nothing but defiled mud, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her</b> only tenderness and pity.|$|R
6000|$|But not {{the less}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> {{presence}} never [...] Out {{of the room}} depart; [...] Over the threshold, not the less, forever [...] <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> going on his broken heart.|$|E
60|$|Sitting on {{the sofa}} beside her, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> fingers {{stroking}} his, begging him not to take offence and leave her. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> eyes trying to see his eyes, and saw her lips trembling; but a stubborn, almost evil smile was fixed upon his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{resting on}} him with a strange, {{touching}} look.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not his}} fancy this time. Of that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> sure. <b>Her</b> {{face for}} the moment had been the color of chalk--a little exclamation had been strangled upon her lips. She shot {{a quick glance at}} him. He met it steadily.|$|R
60|$|Jerry {{was in a}} quandary. To {{a certain}} degree <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{responsible}} for <b>her</b> present forlorn condition. Suddenly an idea struck him.|$|R
50|$|Mary Ann Duff first {{appeared}} in Boston as Juliet on December 31, 1810 with her husband as Romeo. The part of Mercutio was played by John Bernard. Although one critic remarked on <b>her</b> attractiveness, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>her</b> youth made her lack experience and conception.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> wistfulness and her menace tearing {{him in his}} bowels and loins.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> {{tears on}} his cheek as she spoke, and tried to reassure her.|$|E
60|$|Even then, numb as was {{her flesh}} with cold, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> wince at the question.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked slowly}} towards the house. The {{distressing}} sensation of whose wife she was could not entirely quench the resuscitated pleasure <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> at <b>her</b> grateful recognition of him, and her confiding seizure {{of his arm}} for support. He conveyed her carefully into the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's enough!" [...] he {{returned}} with a slight thoughtful droop of {{his head to the}} right and his eyes attached to the far horizon as through a shade of shyness for what he was saying. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> all <b>her</b> own lingering nearness somehow on his cheek.|$|R
60|$|With one blow of {{the tiller}} he unshipped for the purpose, he knocked the plug out, {{but did not}} take the trouble to lower the sail. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> the water welling up heavily about his legs before he leaped on to the taffrail. There, upright and motionless, in his shirt and {{trousers}} only, he stood waiting. When <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> settle <b>he</b> sprang far away with a mighty splash.|$|R
