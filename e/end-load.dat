McNaughton (Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, Department of Transport), in the Sir Seymour Biscoe Tritton Lecture to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1977. Speaking {{of the fall}} in fatalities since 1955, he put forward his opinion that {{a major factor in}} this improvement was [...] "the introduction in 1951 of the BR standard Mark 1 passenger carriage, which, over a period of about ten years, replaced pre-war designed rolling stock on most principal routes. The damage-resistant qualities of this all-steel coach, mounted on a 200 ton <b>end-load</b> resistant underframe and fitted with buckeye couplings, have been evidenced time and time again. Only in a small number of very destructive accidents has serious body damage of the kind that inevitably leads to fatal accidents been observed and there have been several remarkable instances of high-speed derailments in which no personal injuries have occurred." ...|$|E

50|$|The main {{components}} of the piston-cylinder apparatus (Fig. 1) are the pressure generating system, the pressure vessel, and the assembly parts within the vessel. There {{are two types of}} piston-cylinder apparatus: non <b>end-loaded</b> and <b>end-loaded,</b> which involve, respectively, one or two hydraulic rams. In the <b>end-loaded</b> type the second hydraulic ram is used to vertically load and strengthen the pressure vessel. The non <b>end-loaded</b> type is smaller, more compact and cheaper, and is operable only to approximately 4 GPa.Pressure is applied to the sample by pressing a piston into the sample volume of the pressure vessel. The sample assembly consists of a solid pressure medium, a resistance heater and a small central volume for the sample. Three common configurations are used: ”, ” and 1”, which are the diameters of the piston and thus the sample assembly. According to the pressure amplification concept, the choice of the piston depends on the pressure you need to achieve.During the experiment, water circulates around the pressure vessel, the bridge and the upper plates to cool the system.|$|R

40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{characteristics of}} flexure strips in the constrained directions {{are an important}} attribute of their behavior when serving as a constituent of flexure mechanisms. The decrease in support stiffness that accompanies movement in the intended degrees of freedom limits the performance of mechanisms comprised of such strips. This paper presents a closed-form nonlinear model that describes the support stiffness in 3 -D under arbitrary <b>end-load</b> for the elementary flexure strip. The formulation takes into account geometrical nonlinearities by means of finite strain relations and deformed-configuration equilibrium equations. By distinguishing the low-stiffness large-deflection motion (the degrees of freedom) from the high-stiffness small-deflection motion (the constrained motion) with the appropriate simplification of limited twist, a closed-form stiffness model is obtained for dimension and load ranges of practical interest...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{maximize}} low power-line channel capacity within the limited transmission bandwidth, a new transmitting power allocation algorithm {{based on the}} quality of service (QoS) strategy is proposed in this paper. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is considered to support remarkable capacity of power-line channel. In order to derive the closed form expression of the maximum channel capacity in an OFDM power communication system, the relationship between channel capacity, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and modulation scheme is analyzed. Furthermore, some influence factors of power-line channel capacity, such as branches number, branches length and <b>end-load</b> impendence are analyzed in this paper. Simulation result shows that the mainly factors that affect the channel capacity of low power-line are branch number and load impendence; the performance of proposed algorithm is superior to the existed water-filling algorithms at the same SNR...|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} is developed analytically {{to design and}} produce an optimized stiffened panel with a centrally located hole. The PASCO panel-buckling analysis and sizing code is employed with the Engineering Analysis Language (EAL) code for finite-element analysis to optimize the design variables. Important design considerations are stiffener height and ply thicknesses in the skin and the stiffener laminates. The EAL code calculates the maximum strains around the hole boundary, and the resulting constraints are combined with the buckling constraint developed by the PASCO code. Cooptimization of the two codes is effected until convergence on the optimal solution is achieved. Results of the analytical procedure are experimentally verified by applying a compressive <b>end-load</b> to graphite-fiber laminated plates with center holes.

40|$|Summary. We {{investigate}} hysteretic {{behavior in}} two dynamic models for solid-solid phase transitions. An elastic {{bar with a}} nonconvex double-well elastic energy density is subjected to time-dependent displacement boundary conditions. Both models include inertia and a viscous stress term that provides energy dissipation. The first model involves a strain-gradient term that models interfacial energy. In the second model this term is omitted. Numerical simulations combined with analytical results predict hysteretic behavior in the overall <b>end-load</b> versus end-displacement diagram for both models. The hysteresis {{is largely due to}} metastability and nucleation; it persists even for very slow loading when viscous dissipation is quite small. In the model with interfacial energy, phase interfaces move smoothly. When this term is omitted, hysteresis is much more pronounced. In addition, phase boundaries move in an irregular, stick-slip fashion. The corresponding load-elongation curve exhibits serrations, in qualitative agreement with certain experimental observations in shape-memory alloys...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEstimating end-use energy {{consumption}} that accurately reflects {{the variance of}} the <b>end-load</b> is critical for the grid wise simulation and analysis work. In a house, the largest load with a thermal cycle is often the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. So the thermal dynamics of typical residential electric air conditioner is discussed, and then an equivalent thermal parameters (ETP) model is built by the thermal equilibrium in this paper. Based on this, the switch status, indoor air temperature and power consumption are simulated through control strategies of constant thermostat set point. The results show according the switch status, indoor air temperature can be calculated by the ETP model, thus give the desire status to the grid according the setting temperature. In summer, with the increasing of setting temperature, the frequency of on-off becomes lower, thus the power consumption also reduces from 1200 kW (26 °C) to 970 kW (27 °C). So if some control strategies are used, the model will play an important part on decreasing the peak-average rate of the power grid and also improving the load rate of grid...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} novel three-dimensional pseudo-rigid-body model (3 -D PRBM) for straight cantilever beams with rectangular cross sections. The model {{is capable of}} capturing {{the behavior of the}} neutral axis of a beam loaded with an arbitrary force <b>end-load.</b> Numerical integration of a system of differential equations yields approximate displacement and orientation of the beam 2 ̆ 7 s neutral axis at the free end, and curvatures of the neutral axis at the fixed end. This data was used to develop the 3 -D PRBM which consists of two torsional springs connecting two rigid links for a total of 2 degrees of freedom (DOF). The 3 -D PRBM parameters that are comparable with existing 2 -D model parameters are characteristic radius factor (mean: γ = 0. 8322), bending stiffness coefficient (mean: KΘ = 2. 5167) and parametric angle coefficient (mean: cΘ = 1. 2501). New parameters are introduced in the model in order to capture the spatial behavior of the deflected beam, including two parametric angle coefficients (means: cΨ = 1. 0714; cΦ = 1. 0087).

40|$|The {{state of}} stress {{in the core of}} a notched bar is {{analysed}} at the moment when pronounced plastic yielding begins. The theory is two-dimensional and an ideal plastic-rigid material is assumed. Following a general analysis of the problem, the magnitude of the constraint factor is calculated for a deep notch with a semi-circular root. The correct approach to problems of plane plastic strain is discussed, and is further illustrated by a re-examination of the classical work of Frandtl on indentation (which is closely related in principle with the notched bar problem). 1. General considerations THE paper is concerned with the {{state of stress}} in the core of a notched bar under an applied load sufficient to cause plastic flow. It is known that the fairly well-defined bend in the load-extension relation for a notched bar corresponds to a mean stress in the core that is greater than the yield stress in a tensile test of an unnotched specimen. The " investiga-tion will be directed particularly to a calculation of the magnitude of this effect in relation to the shape of the notch. The problem will be treated as one of plane strain, so that the specimen is a wide rectangular block, symmetrically notched through the thickness on two sides. The notch is shown in Fig. 1, the plane of the paper representing a plane of flow. Let it be supposed that the applied load at the ends of the specimen is statically equivalent to a tension along the central longitudinal axis. It is also supposed that a distribution of stress, suitable to ensure plane strain, is applied to the two lateral surfaces of the block which are parallel to the planes of flow. The specimen is assumed so long that the state of stress in the neighbourhood of the notch is, to any desired approximation, independent of the precise distribution of the end load. It is further assumed that the notch is of sufficient depth to ensure that the plastic region is localized in and around the core (this will be discussed more carefully later). If the curvature of the notch is greatest at the root, the yield limit is first attained at that point. As the applied <b>end-load</b> is further increased, the plastic region can be expected to spread in thn manner shown i...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{selecting}} a baseball or a softball bat, both weight and weight distribution should be considered. However, these considerations must be individualized, {{because there is}} large variability in how different batters swing a bat and in how each batter swings different bats. Previous research has defined the ideal bat weight as that weight that maximizes the batted-ball speed based on measurements of individual swings, {{the concept of the}} coefficient of restitution, and the laws of conservation of momentum. In this paper, a method is given that extends this approach to recent bat designs where the moment of inertia can be specified. The data presented in this paper show that all of the players in our study would probably profit from using <b>end-loaded</b> bats.

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of this case study is to discuss the case management of a patient with idiopathic scoliosis through application of a therapeutic exercise maneuver. For simplicity the word “exercise ” is used interchangeably with therapeutic maneuver. The clinical features {{were based on a}} 28 -year-old female whose case history revealed a scoliosis originally detected in 1982 at which time an orthopedic surgeon prescribed bracing to reduce the curvature. The patient observed an increase in her postural distortion while {{standing in front of a}} three-way mirror and presented to our office for care several years later. The intervention and outcome was based on a therapeutic maneuver/exercise prescribed specifically for the reduction of the scoliosis and disc wedging. The specific exercise was based upon an observation of the initial radiographs as well as stress <b>end-loaded</b> radiographs taken at the finished position of the exercise. Follow up radiographs revealed a reduction of the curvature.

40|$|Various {{difficulties}} {{arise in}} the data reduction of the <b>end-loaded</b> split (ELS) test. On one hand, a small Fracture Process Zone (FPZ) at the crack front is assumed in the existing mode II <b>end-loaded</b> split test methodologies based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). However, mode II fracture {{has been reported to}} involve large FPZ and a fuzzy crack tip. Furthermore, the ELS test, is usually affected by geometrical non-linearities. This work proposes a closed-form solution based on the J-integral to determine the interlaminar fracture toughness in an ELS test. This solution avoids the need to measure the crack length, and is applicable when a large FPZ is present, as occurs in adhesive bonded joints between CFRP. In addition, because the ELS test involves large vertical deflections, a correction of the formulation for large displacements has been implemented. This new methodology has been compared to other methods available in the literature based on LEFM by means of an experimental campaign of delamination tests using unidirectional CFRP specimens {{in order to make a}} first validation of the methodThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Spanish government though the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad under contract TRA 2015 - 71491 -...|$|R

40|$|The upper {{extremities}} {{are often}} used to protect the head and thorax by bracing for impact, particularly in falls to the ground. The impulsive loads they impose on the hand and wrist can be substantial, exceeding one body-weight. If the upper extremity then “gives way” or flexion buckles at the elbow then a head injury is likely, particularly in the elderly; but if the elbows are fully extended to prevent buckling, then the risk for wrist fracture increases. A current knowledge gap includes the biomechanical factors that determine the threshold load required to flexion-buckle the elbow of an <b>end-loaded</b> and pretensed human upper extremity. In this thesis we use computer simulations and in vivo experiments to explore how age, gender, initial elbow angle, arm muscle strength and pre-contraction level and lumped contractile properties about a joint affect upper extremity deflection under impulsive <b>end-loading.</b> The experimental results show that gender and age affect the rotational stiffness and damping coefficients of muscles acting about the elbow and shoulder when estimated by dynamic optimization. The pre-contraction levels of arm and shoulder muscles significantly affected these coefficients. Computer simulations predict that advancing age, female gender and insufficient arm and shoulder muscle pre-contraction level adversely affect upper extremity buckling loads. Kinetic, kinematic and myoelectric studies suggest the speed of propagation of the impulsive load along the upper extremity is such that arm and shoulder muscles must be pretensed prior to impact: no neuromuscular reflex is rapid enough to increase arm muscle tensile stiffness to prevent flexion buckling. Pre-contraction level and gender significantly affected the rate of propagation of an impulse along the upper extremity. The findings {{provide a framework for}} better understanding how biomechanical factors determine whether or not an arm will buckle when <b>end-loaded</b> during a fall arrest. We conclude that in order to help safely arrest falls older women and men need to avoid using hyperextended arms when possible, use an adequate pre-contraction level in the arm muscles to prevent buckling, and maintain as much arm protraction strength as possible, perhaps most conveniently by regular push-up exercises...|$|R
