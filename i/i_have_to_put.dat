5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
500|$|Parliament {{repealed}} the Townshend Acts in 1770. Washington {{regarded the}} passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as [...] "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges". He told friend Bryan Fairfax, [...] "I think the Parliament of Great Britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my hands into yours for money." [...] He also said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny [...] "till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Bruff {{proved to}} be too busy to give me {{more than a minute}} of his {{valuable}} time. In that minute, however, he contrived to dispose--in the most discouraging manner--of all the questions <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He seemed {{unwilling to}} explain matters {{of his own}} accord. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the {{conversation}} into {{the form of a}} cross-examination.|$|R
500|$|Zubir {{took a year}} {{to finish}} {{composing}} the music and lyrics for the song. In a 1984 oral history interview, he recalled the process: [...] "he difficulty is {{in such a short}} melody, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in all the words.... t must be very simple, understandable for all the races in Singapore.... I consult also [...] an author in Malay language so that I can do it in proper Malay language but not too deep and not too difficult." [...] Summing up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb [...] "Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung" [...] ("You should hold up the sky of the land where you live").|$|E
500|$|Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della Sera {{mentioned that}} Madonna would play in Italy {{as part of}} a world tour to promote Bedtime Stories in spring or fall 1995. However, Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann cancelled all plans after she was offered the role of Eva Perón on the film Evita, directed by Alan Parker. Her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg considered a [...] "shorter tour" [...] because of filming, however, Madonna commented, [...] "I've waited years for this role, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> every ounce of concentration into it. I love touring, and I very much want to go out with this album. But I can't—I'd be going straight from months on the road right into filming; I'd be exhausted and strained. It wouldn't be {{in the best interests of}} the movie for me to be at any less than my peak of energy".|$|E
2500|$|Julia's {{social life}} was {{severely}} controlled, {{and she was}} allowed to talk only to people whom her father had vetted. However, Octavian had a great affection for his daughter and made sure she had the best teachers available. Macrobius preserves a remark of Augustus: [...] "There are two wayward daughters that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with: the Roman commonwealth and Julia." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} Thirties, Williams was {{accompanied}} on his travels through the Mississippi Delta {{by a young}} Muddy Waters. Williams recounted to Blewett Thomas, [...] "I picked Muddy up in Rolling Fork {{when he was about}} 15. He went all 'round the Delta playin' harmonica behind me. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him down after awhile. All these women were comin' up to me and sayin', 'Oh. your young son is so nice!' See, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Muddy down because he was takin' away my women." ...|$|R

2500|$|I've {{become more}} patient and more tolerant. A life spent in cricket {{can make you}} very self-centred, so I think I've moved away from that and become more open. People still say I come across as a grumpy old man, though, with a droopy {{moustache}} and a worn-out face. But that's just my exterior. Underneath I'm a much softer person. I haven't {{got rid of the}} moustache and long hair from my cricketing days, which gets a mixed reaction. Babies in prams look at me strangely quite a lot, so when I talk to them <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my finger over my top lip to soften the blow. They think the hair bear bunch [...] have arrived.|$|E
2500|$|On March 7, 2011, Ensign said {{he would}} not seek reelection in 2012 because he wanted to spare his family from an [...] "exceptionally ugly" [...] campaign. [...] "At this point in my life, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my family first," [...] Ensign told reporters {{at a news conference in}} Las Vegas. The {{announcement}} was welcomed by national Republicans. Republicans have suggested he would not have survived a primary election. The Senate Ethics Committee conducted a 22-month investigation of Ensign's activities. Before they released their report, on April 21, 2011 Ensign announced his resignation from office effective May 3. He said that he [...] "will not continue to subject my family, my constituents, or the Senate to any further rounds of investigation, depositions, drawn out proceedings, or especially public hearings." [...] The Committee gave its report to the Department of Justice for investigation of alleged serious violations of law.|$|E
2500|$|The footage {{shows that}} Encinia {{initially}} wrote a routine traffic violation warning for Bland. After {{he returns to}} her car and speaks briefly to her again, he asks her to put out her cigarette. She responds, [...] "Why do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a cigarette when I'm in my own car?" [...] Encinia orders her to [...] "get out of the car", and, when she repeatedly refuses to exit, he tells her she is under arrest. Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am giving you a lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her car door and tells her {{more than a dozen}} times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out. After struggling, he draws his Taser and points it at Bland, shouting [...] "I will light you up! Get out! Now!", at which point she exits her vehicle.|$|E
60|$|I {{paused and}} sighed. This was very humiliating. It was {{unpleasant}} to {{rank in the}} public mind somewhere between Constance Kent and Laura Bridgman. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{think of}} the work <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in," [...] said Lord Wisbeach, [...] "it makes me tired to think of some one else just walking in here as you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said he; [...] "now {{you have}} a heart that any man might be proud of. I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't be helped." ...|$|R
2500|$|Articles {{published}} at {{that time}} hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement, in hopes money from Songs of the Innocence and Experience would enable her to live in comfort. She said: [...] "I’m not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I’m {{going to have to}} get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don’t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn’t." [...] However, she still lived in her flat in Paris (located in one of the most expensive streets of the capital) and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland.

6000|$|... "I've got {{too much}} on my mind {{to put up with}} that kind of thing," [...] said Mr. Flint, [...] "and I won't be worried here on the place. I can get capable men to tend cattle, at least. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with {{political}} rascals who rob and deceive me as soon as my back is turned, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with inefficiency and senility, but I won't have it at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Funny ass,' said Bristow, {{resuming}} his work. Psmith {{glanced at}} Mr Waller, as who should say, 'See what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with. And yet I {{do not give}} way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I felt {{a subtle}} embarrassment in putting the {{question}} that perplexed me. And yet it seemed so material <b>to</b> me <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it. [...] "And did you--?" [...] I asked. [...] "Were you--lovers?" ...|$|R

60|$|BLUNTSCHLI. When I {{got through}} <b>to</b> Peerot <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in safe keeping somehow. I {{thought of the}} railway cloak room; but that's the surest place to get looted in modern warfare. So I pawned it.|$|R
60|$|It was bitter, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{the best}} face I could upon it. After all, {{it was my}} own fault, for <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> known by this time that a {{journalist}} <b>has</b> no right <b>to</b> make plans of his own.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wrote this}} song {{looking out of}} a rooming house window in New York City {{in the winter of}} Nineteen and Forty. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down on paper how I felt about the rich folks and the poor ones." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Nor will,' said Aubrey. 'Tom {{had put her}} in such a {{rage that}} she did not choose to dance with that cousin of hers, Sam Axworthy, so she was obliged to refuse every one else; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with that child!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it {{that way}} because Scandinavian grammar is not a strong point with me, and my {{knowledge}} of the verbs is as yet limited to the present tense of the infinitive mood. Besides, this {{was no time to}} worry about grace of style.) ...|$|R
