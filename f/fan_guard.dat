40|$|Since {{the inlet}} and outlet of hidden ceiling fan are almost {{located at the}} same Plane; thus, an {{improper}} housing may cause inhale-return phenomenon which significantly affects its power consumption and performance. In this study, a comprehensive investigation by numerical and experimental techniques was used to predict and identify the flow pattern, airflow rate, efficiency, and noise for ceiling fans with different design parameters. The {{results showed that the}} unique inhale-return phenomenon happens for an inappropriate housing. Several key parameters, such as <b>fan</b> <b>guard,</b> housing ring, inlet-to-outlet area ratio, and blockage height, are evaluated for finding out the criterion to avoid the inhale-return flow. Consequently the study finds that <b>fan</b> <b>guard</b> changes the airflow to a wider distribution with a lower velocity. A minimum blockage distance and a maximum height of ring-plate are set at 80 mm and 30 mm, respectively. Also, it is suggested that the inlet area must be bigger than the outlet area. Moreover, all the parameters show the same trend under various rotational speeds. In conclusion, this systematic investigation not only provides the fan engineer's design ability to avoid the inhale-return phenomenon, but also the predicting capability on its aerodynamic and acoustic performances...|$|E

40|$|Social insect {{workers can}} vary {{in terms of}} body size, space use, {{division}} of labor, and reproductive potential. Here, I begin to 'dissect' a social insect colony, using the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, to determine how this variation affects colony organization. I found that workers are spatially organized inside the nest and they remain at a specific distance from the colony center. Bees that feed larvae tend {{to remain in the}} center, whereas foragers are more often found on the periphery when not foraging. Smaller workers are more likely to feed larvae and incubate brood, and larger workers are more likely to <b>fan</b> or <b>guard</b> the nest. Still, workers perform multiple tasks throughout their life. The size of this task repertoire does not depend on body size or age. Furthermore, workers that remain further from the queen while inside the nest and avoid energy-expensive tasks during the ergonomic phase are more likely to reproduce {{by the end of the}} colony cycle. Inactive bees are not, however, defensive reserves. Although inactive bees increase their speed inside the nest when the nest was disturbed, they were not more likely to leave the nest (presumably to attack the simulated attacker) or switch to guarding behavior. This suggests that inactive bumble bees that remain farther from the queen may be storing fat reserves to later develop reproductive organs. Finally, I examined how within-group variation affects colony performance. I reduced variation in body size or temperature response thresholds by removing individuals from the colony with extreme phenotypes, and compared colony performance to colonies where random bees were removed. Colonies took longer to cool down the nest after bees were removed, but this effect was most striking when variation in temperature thresholds was reduced. Further, although larger bees are better at carrying items and are more likely to fan, the ability of colonies to perform undertaking behavior or thermoregulation was not affected when size variation was reduced. These studies provide evidence that (1) within-group variation affects colony organization and (2) variation among workers in their inherent tendencies to respond to stimuli positively affects colony performance...|$|R
40|$|In the fifteen-spined stickleback, Spinachia spinachia, males provide {{females with}} direct {{benefits}} by <b>fanning,</b> cleaning and <b>guarding</b> the offspring. Males announce their parental skills through intense body shakes during courtship. Females preferred {{to mate with}} more intensely shaking males. As a result, females got better fathers for their offspring, as such males achieved a higher hatching success. Not only did male behavioural cues attract females, but males also used their nests as extrabodily ornaments. The nest is held together with shiny secretional threads consisting of a glycoprotein. Females chose to spawn in nests with more secretional threads. A likely {{reason for this is}} that the threads are metabolically costly for the male to produce and the amount of secretion indicates a male's nutritional status, which is of great importance as parental duties are energetically costly. Moreover, females preferred nests built high up in the vegetation, as such nests were safer from egg predators. Competition with other males for females favoured males building higher nests than did their neighbours, probably because females preferred high nests. Male-male interactions, such as sneaking and egg stealing, caused decreased paternity among males in nature as assessed by a microsatellite analysis. Males adjusted their paternal effort according to their previous investment in the brood, but not according to paternity. Thus, female choice is based on multiple cues and results in better paternal care. Males invest in courtship, male-male competition, nest construction and paternal care, the outcome determining their success in mate attraction...|$|R
50|$|Most anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites, {{meaning they}} {{alternate}} between {{the male and}} female sexes {{at some point in their}} lives. Anemonefish colonies usually consist of the reproductive male and female and a few juveniles, who help tend the colony. Although multiple males co-habit an environment with a single female, polygamy does not occur and only the adult pair exhibit reproductive behavior. However, if the largest female dies, the social hierarchy shifts with the breeding male exhibiting protandrous sex reversal to become the breeding female. The largest juvenile will then become the new breeding male after a period of rapid growth. The existence of protandry in anemonefish may rest on the case that non-breeders modulate their phenotype in a way that causes breeders to tolerate them. This strategy prevents conflict by reducing competition between the males for one female. For example, by purposefully modifying their growth rate to remain small and submissive, the juveniles in a colony present no threat to the fitness of the adult male, thereby protecting themselves from being evicted by the dominant fish. The reproductive cycle of anemonefish is often correlated with the lunar cycle. Rates of spawning for anemonefish peak at approximately the first and third quarters of the moon. The timing of this spawn means that the eggs will hatch around the full moon or new moon periods. One explanation for this lunar clock is that spring tides produce the highest tides during full or new moons. Nocturnal hatching during high tide may reduce predation by allowing for a greater capacity for escape. Namely, the stronger currents and greater water volume during high tide protects the hatchlings by effectively sweeping them to safety. Before spawning, anemonefish exhibit increased rates of anemone and substrate biting, which help prepare and clean the nest for the spawn. In terms of parental care, male anemonefish are often the caretakers of eggs. Before making the clutch, the parents often clear an oval sized clutch varying in diameter for the spawn. Fecundity, or reproductive rate, of the females usually ranges from 600 to 1500 eggs depending on the size of the female. In contrast to most animal species, the female only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs, with males expending most of the time and effort. Male anemonefish care for their eggs by <b>fanning</b> and <b>guarding</b> them for 6 to 10 days until they hatch. Studies have shown that, in general, eggs develop more rapidly in a clutch when males fan properly and that fanning represents a crucial mechanism of successfully developing eggs. This suggests that males have the ability to control the success of hatching an egg clutch by investing different amounts of time and energy towards the eggs. For example, a male could choose to fan less in times of scarcity or fan more in times of abundance. Furthermore, males display increased alertness when guarding more valuable broods, or eggs in which paternity was guaranteed. Females, on the other hand, display generally less preference for parental behavior than males. All these suggest that males have increased parental investment towards the eggs compared to females.|$|R
