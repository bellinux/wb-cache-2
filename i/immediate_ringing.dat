5000|$|The Death Knell was {{regulated}} by statutes {{in the time}} of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. [...] but the <b>immediate</b> <b>ringing</b> after death fell into disuse. It was customary {{by the end of the}} 19th century to ring the Death Knell as soon as notice reached the clerk of the church (parish clerk) or sexton, unless the sun had set, in which case it was rung at an early hour the following morning.|$|E
40|$|Reaction of the heterodinuclear complex HC-{SiMe 2 N(2 -FC 6 H 3) } 3 Zr-FeC p(CO) 2 (1) with 1, 3 -di-methyl- 6 H-benzobnaphtho 1, 2 -dpyranone (2) and 1, 3 -dimethoxy- 6 H-benzob-naphtho- 1, 2 -dpyranone (3) led to <b>immediate</b> <b>ring</b> {{opening of}} the lactones to yield {{products}} which combine the biaryl fragment with aryloxyzirconium and acyl-FeCp(CO) 2 units. The latter slowly decarbonylate to yield the corresponding heterobimetallic complexes in which the {MCp(CO) 2 } fragment is directly bonded to the naphthalene ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{suburban}} subdivision, {{replete with}} iden tical houses, lawns, and families, {{is a familiar}} icon of contemporary American culture. Equally familiar are suburban governments, which many critics describe as providers of exclusive havens from urban problems. Building Chicago examines the evolution of both the suburbs themselves and their gov ernments, using Cook County, Illinois— which includes Chicago and its <b>immediate</b> <b>ring</b> of suburbs—as a case study. It argues that suburban government evolved {{to meet the demands}} of residents and real estate developers for services and amenities. Until the 1860 s, only two kinds of loca...|$|R
40|$|An aerobic endospore-forming bacterium, {{tentatively}} {{identified as}} a strain (JJ-lb) of Bacillus macerans, was isolated by enrichment on 4 -hydroxybenzoate (4 HBA), using as an inoculum soil taken from a 50 degrees C Iadho hot spring. Enzymatic analyses of cells grown on succinate and 4 HBA indicated that strain JJ- 1 b degrades 4 HBA {{by way of the}} novel protocatechuate (PCA) 2, 3 -dioxygenase pathway. Purification of the PCA 2, 3 -dioxygenase by affinity chromatography allowed the first observation of the <b>immediate</b> <b>ring</b> fission product of PCA, namely, 5 -carboxy- 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (CHMS; labmda max at pH 7. 0 = 348 nm). An affinity column fraction was obtained that decarboxylated CHMS to 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (HMS; lambdamax at pH 7. 0 = 375 nm). Thus, conversion of PCA to HMS is accomplished in two steps, 2, 3 -fission of the PCA ring followed by enzymatic decarboxylation of the ring fission product, forming HMS...|$|R

40|$|Unstable {{fractures}} of the pelvic ring, {{associated to}} perineal lacerations are severe injuries occurring during high-energy trauma. High rates of septic complications and mortality {{have been reported}} with these injuries. Current treatment guidelines, while dealing with open pelvic fractures or dislocations are discussed, based on a current {{review of the literature}} and on our local experience. At our institution, 55 unstable type B or C fractures of the pelvic ring were treated by osteosynthesis between 1991 and 1997. Of these, 11 patients presented with an associated perineal laceration (20 %). Simultaneously to the <b>immediate</b> pelvic <b>ring</b> fixation, a diversion colostomy was performed in all these patients. Repeated wound debridements and wide spectrum antibioprophylaxis were associated. Of these 11 patients presenting an open pelvic fracture, only one died of pelvic sepsis at three weeks. 10 patients survived (91 %) and went on to bony union, without any local infectious complications. Aggressive multidisciplinary initial surgical management is a rule when dealing with this type of injuries, immediate colostomy and careful wound debridement must be associated to the initial osteosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSaturn's narrow F ring {{exhibits}} several unusual {{features that}} vary on timescales of hours to years. These include transient clumps, a central core {{surrounded by a}} multistranded structure and a regular series of longitudinal channels associated with Prometheus, one of the ring's two 'shepherding' satellites. Several smaller moonlets and clumps have been detected in the <b>ring's</b> <b>immediate</b> vicinity, and a population of embedded objects has been inferred. Here we report direct evidence of moonlets embedded in the ring's bright core, and show {{that most of the}} F ring's morphology results from the continual gravitational and collisional effects of small satellites, often combined with the perturbing effect of Prometheus. The F-ring region is perhaps the only location in the Solar System where large-scale collisional processes are occurring on an almost daily basis...|$|R
40|$|A {{particle}} size distribution is incorporated into a three-dimensional homogenisation scheme, devised {{on the scale of}} a particle and its <b>immediate</b> (or first <b>ring)</b> of neighbours. Based on this scheme, micropolar continuum models for polydisperse, dry, and densely packed granular assemblies of spherical particles undergoing quasi-static deformation are developed for various {{particle size}} distributions. Three different cases are considered: (1) a monodisperse assembly, (2) a defect particle in an otherwise monodisperse assembly, and (3) an assembly of a given {{particle size distribution}}. In Case 1, an additional dependence on particle radius is found in 3 D systems, compared with previous 2 D constitutive laws. In Case 2, it is found that a small (large) particle in an otherwise monodisperse system increases (decreases) the stress compared to a purely monodisperse assembly, but the couple stress may increase or decrease depending on the relative size of the rolling resistance compared with the tangential stiffness coefficients. On the other hand, if the defect particle is substantially smaller or larger than the monodisperse particle size, the stress and couple stress are always increased. In Case 3, three different distributions are examined, i. e. square, normal and a lognormal distribution. For Cases 2 and 3, both the stress and the couple stress increased with the degree of dispersity, from the lower bound value corresponding to the monodisperse system considered in Case 1. Finally, the paper highlights areas that will need to be addressed to enable the future advancement of micromechanical continuum models...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{the time}} of the [...] "suspects." [...] Mr. O'Mahony had already taken an {{opportunity}} of expressing an opinion in the House of Commons that every honest man, every patriotic man, every generous man, every man in fact who was worth his salt, was in Ireland locked up as a [...] "suspect," [...] and in saying so managed to utter very bitter words indeed respecting him who had the locking up of these gentlemen. Poor Mr. O'Mahony had no idea that he might have used with propriety as to this gentleman all the epithets of which he believed the [...] "suspects" [...] to be worthy; but instead of doing so he called him a [...] "disreputable jailer." [...] It is not pleasant to be called a disreputable jailer in the presence of all the best of one's fellow citizens, but the man so called in this instance only smiled. Mr. O'Mahony had certainly made himself ridiculous, and the whole House were loud in their clamours at the words used. But that did not suffice. The Speaker reprimanded Mr. O'Mahony and desired him to recall the language and apologise for it. Then there arose a loud debate, during which the member of the Government who had been assailed declared that Mr. O'Mahony had not as yet been quite long enough in the House to learn the little details of Parliamentary language; Mr. O'Mahony would no doubt soften down his eloquence in course of time. But the Speaker would not be content with this, and was about to order the sinner to be carried away by the Sergeant-at-Arms, when a friend on his right and a friend on his left, and a friend behind him, all whispered into his ear {{how easy it is to}} apologise in the House of Commons. [...] "You needn't say he isn't a disreputable jailer, but only call him a distasteful warder;--anything will do." [...] This came from the gentleman at Mr. O'Mahony's back, and the order for his <b>immediate</b> expulsion was <b>ringing</b> in his ears. He had been told that he was ridiculous, and could feel that it would be absurd to be carried somewhere into the dungeons. And the man whom he certainly detested at the present moment worse than any other scoundrel on the earth, had made a good-natured apology on his behalf. If he were carried away now, he could never come back again without a more serious apology. Then, farewell to all power of attacking the jailer. He did as the man whispered into his ear, and begged to substitute [...] "distasteful warder" [...] for the words which had wounded so cruelly the feelings of the right honourable gentleman. Then he looked round the House, showing that he thought that he had misbehaved himself. After that, during Mr. O'Mahony's career as a Member of Parliament, which lasted only for the session, he lost his self-respect altogether. He had been driven to withdraw the true wrath of his eloquence from him [...] "at whose brow," [...] as he told Rachel the next morning, [...] "he had hurled his words with a force that had been found to be intolerable." ...|$|R
