[...] It's bad enough that you people get all the parking spots!" [...] To an individual with Tourette syndrome, she says, [...] "I think Tourettes is so cool. It would be great to be able to annoy people like that. You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with <b>her</b> <b>cane.</b> [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not like any of them saw me." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{the tumult}} {{was at its}} height, came her ladyship at last into the room, where Colonel Penruddock stood {{watching}} the operations of his men. She {{stood in the doorway}} leaning upon <b>her</b> ebony <b>cane,</b> <b>her</b> faded eyes considering the gaunt soldier with reproachful question.|$|R
60|$|She {{felt for}} the table, with <b>her</b> ivory <b>cane,</b> and put the vase down on it--very unwillingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are like}} Miss Ailie with <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> {{when she is}} pandying," [...] he told Grizel. [...] "You begin well, but you slacken just when {{you are going to}} hit." ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{geography}} lesson, {{as she was}} pointing to the map with <b>her</b> <b>cane,</b> the boy continually ducked his whitish head under the desk, and {{attracted the attention of}} other boys.|$|E
60|$|Her ladyship stood a moment, leaning upon <b>her</b> <b>cane,</b> {{her head}} thrown back, her thin lip curling, {{and her eyes}} playing over Mr. Caryll {{with a look of}} dislike that she made no attempt to dissemble.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth was adorably patient. She surreptitiously drew towards <b>her</b> a <b>cane</b> chair, a doubtful-looking {{article of}} {{furniture}} upon which she seated herself slowly and with great care.|$|R
60|$|The {{mother of}} the Stalos looked round for <b>her</b> iron <b>cane,</b> which she always used to kill her victims, {{but it was not}} there, for Lyma had put it in the fire.|$|R

60|$|So that Ursula {{would appeal}} {{no more to}} the headmaster, but, when she was driven wild, she seized <b>her</b> <b>cane,</b> and slashed the boy who was insolent to her, over head and ears and hands. And at length {{they were afraid of}} her, she had them in order.|$|E
60|$|So Gruffanuff {{opened the}} hall {{door with a}} low bow, {{just as he had}} been {{accustomed}} to do, and they all went in and signed the book, and then they went to church and were married, and the Fairy Blackstick sailed away on <b>her</b> <b>cane,</b> and was never more heard of in Paflagonia.|$|E
60|$|Nancy rose. The Scherers were going. While Mr. Scherer {{pressed my}} hand {{in a manner that}} {{convinced}} me of his gratitude, Hilda was bidding an affectionate good night to Maude. A few moments later she bore her husband and daughters away, and we heard the tap-tap of <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> on the walk outside....|$|E
60|$|And {{she swept}} out, fan going briskly in one hand, <b>her</b> long ebony <b>cane</b> {{swinging}} as briskly in the other.|$|R

50|$|Ms. Accord, {{a teacher}} at the Primp Magic School, has lost <b>her</b> Flying <b>Cane,</b> the {{equivalent}} of a magic wand, and claims to have a reward for the student who can find it. The player plays the role of either Amitie or Raffine, students at the school, as they venture across the Puyo Pop Fever world to find the cane, while meeting many wacky characters along the way and battling them. Raffine's course contains more difficult gameplay and alters the characters the player meets, as well as which character actually finds the wand. When playing as Raffine near {{to the end of the}} game, it is revealed that Accord never actually lost <b>her</b> flying <b>cane.</b> Raffine then plans on revealing her and Popoi's secret, but fails in her ending, as she is knocked unconscious by Ms. Accord, losing all memories of the flying cane incident. She regains consciousness near her school where Amitie and her friends congratulate her.|$|R

"Ho, sir," [...] {{cried the}} lady, {{rustling}} {{up from her}} chair and rising on <b>her</b> <b>cane,</b> [...] "wear black for your brother till you are as old as Methuselah, if you like. I am sure I don't want to prevent you. I only want you to dress, and to do like other people, and make a figure worthy of your name." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{held up a}} smart ivory walking-cane, with {{a bright}} silk tassel attached. With <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> in one hand, and her {{chemical}} bottle in the other--and her roguish little hat {{on the top of}} her head--she made the quaintest and prettiest picture I had seen for many a long day. [...] "You shall guide me, my dear," [...] I said--and took her arm. We went on down the village.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Warrington {{thought that}} there was no cause why he should tell his aunt how {{intimate}} he was with her early history, and accordingly held his peace upon that point. When their meal was over, she pointed with <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> to her escritoire, and bade her attendant bring the letter which lay under the inkstand there; and George, recognising the superscription, of course knew the letter to be that of which he had been the bearer from home.|$|E
50|$|Cally is in {{her bedroom}} and hears a noise in the hallway. She goes to open a door and Augustus <b>canes</b> <b>her</b> hand. Eve does not believe her when no marks are visible.|$|R
5000|$|One of the show's producers, Will Brenton, {{explains}} that Melody's sight difficulties are never mentioned directly. [...] "We often see her using <b>her</b> white <b>cane,</b> or placing <b>her</b> hand {{on top of}} her mum's whilst they cut something," [...] he says. [...] "It is never about what Melody can't do or needs help with, but always about what she can do and the methods she uses to do as much as most children." ...|$|R
50|$|She wrote against Titus Oates, who {{figured in}} the Popish Plot, {{accusing him of}} being no {{minister}} and fraudulently wearing clerical dress. He responded by beating <b>her</b> with his <b>cane,</b> {{for which he was}} found guilty of assault and fined.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} more reason for your {{explaining}} yourself," [...] she rejoined. [...] "If you will only satisfy her, I might ask you {{to come and see}} us--I might even take the vase." [...] With that strong hint, she actually gave him her hand at parting. Her perfect self-possession, her easy familiarity with this stranger--so bold, and yet so innocent--petrified me. [...] "I shall send my friend to you this morning," [...] she said imperiously, striking <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> on the turf. [...] "I insist on your telling her the whole truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the married}} people take hands and dance round the new-made husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside!" [...] cried Laurie, promenading {{down the path}} with Amy, with such {{infectious}} spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.|$|E
6000|$|Trembling on <b>her</b> <b>cane,</b> the old Countess glared out upon Madame d'Ivry. [...] "I pray you, madame," [...] {{she said}} in French, [...] "never again to address me the word. If I had, like you, assassins in my pay, I would have you killed; do you hear me?" [...] and she hobbled on her way. The {{household}} to which she went was in terrible agitation; the kind Lady Anne frightened beyond measure, poor Ethel full of dread, and feeling guilty {{almost as if she}} had been the cause, as indeed she was the occasion, of Kew's misfortune. And the family had further cause of alarm from the shock which the news had given to Sir Brian. It has been said that he had had illnesses of late which caused his friends much anxiety. He had passed two months at Aix-la-Chapelle, his physicians dreading a paralytic attack; and Madame d'Ivry's party still sauntering on the walk, the men smoking their cigars, the women breathing their scandal, now beheld Dr. Finck issuing from Lady Anne's apartments, and wearing such a face of anxiety, that the Duchesse asked with some emotion, [...] "Had there been a fresh bulletin from Kehl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} the Prince. I {{have a right to}} see him. What's this?--Where am I?--What's the matter?" [...] cries Madame Bernstein, waking up from her sleep. She had been dreaming of old days, no doubt. The old lady shook in all her limbs--her face was very much flushed. She stared about wildly a moment, and then tottered forward on <b>her</b> {{tortoiseshell}} <b>cane.</b> [...] "What--what's the matter?" [...] she asked again. [...] "Have you killed her, sir?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Gabe and Loren {{agree not to}} tell Eve {{about the}} {{bullying}} episode. Eve and Cally greet them {{at the front door}} and Cally tells them about the ghosts. Gabe is told that Eve heard Cams voice, but Gabe doesn’t believe her, while Calley and Loren play in the bathroom. When the family are all in bed, Augustus goes into Lorens room and beats <b>her</b> with the <b>cane.</b> <b>Her</b> parents run in and turn on the light to a distressed Loren. All but Eve vote to leave the house. Eve tells the children that the ghosts know where Cam is and so they must stay. As Eve sleeps, Augustus says, [...] "Shes mine." ...|$|R
50|$|Born in London in 1980, Evie Wyld {{grew up on}} <b>her</b> grandparents' sugar <b>cane</b> farm in New South Wales {{although}} she {{spent most of her}} adult life in Peckham. In The Guardian she recounts how as a child she suffered from viral encephalitis.|$|R
60|$|She knew if {{she let go}} the boy {{he would}} dash to the door. Already he had run home once out of her class. So she {{snatched}} <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> from the desk, and brought it down on him. He was writhing and kicking. She saw his face beneath her, white, with eyes like {{the eyes of a}} fish, stony, yet full of hate and horrible fear. And she loathed him, the hideous writhing thing that was nearly too much for her. In horror lest he should overcome her, and yet at the heart quite calm, she brought down the cane again and again, whilst he struggled making inarticulate noises, and lunging vicious kicks at her. With one hand she managed to hold him, and now and then the cane came down on him. He writhed, like a mad thing. But the pain of the strokes cut through his writhing, vicious, coward's courage, bit deeper, till at last, with a long whimper that became a yell, he went limp. She let him go, and he rushed at her, his teeth and eyes glinting. There was a second of agonized terror in her heart: he was a beast thing. Then she caught him, and the cane came down on him. A few times, madly, in a frenzy, he lunged and writhed, to kick her. But again the cane broke him, he sank with a howling yell on the floor, and like a beaten beast lay there yelling.|$|E
6000|$|When he was gone, and {{she could}} do as she liked, she sat stiller than ever, knowing by long {{experience}} that to indulge oneself in private only {{made it more difficult}} not to indulge oneself in public. It really was provoking that this nice new clasp should go wrong just this once, and that the first time it was used! And she took from her pocket a tiny prayer-book, and, holding it to the light, read the eighteenth psalm--it was a particularly good one, that never failed her when she felt low--she used no glasses, and up to the present had avoided any line between the brows, knowing it was her duty to remain as nice as she could to look at, so as not to spoil the pleasure of people round about her. Then saying to herself firmly, [...] "I do not, I WILL not want any tea--but I shall be glad of dinner!" [...] she rose and opened <b>her</b> <b>cane</b> trunk. Though she knew exactly where they were, she was some time finding the pincers, because there were so many interesting things above them, each raising a different train of thought. A pair of field-glasses, the very latest--the man had said--for darling Derek; they would be so useful to keep his mind from thinking about things that it was no good thinking about. And for dear Flora (how wonderful that she could write poetry--poetry!) a really splendid, and perfectly new, little pill. She herself had already taken two, and they had suited her to perfection. For darling Felix a new kind of eau de cologne, made in Worcester, because that was the only scent he would use. For her pet Nedda, a piece of 'point de Venise' that she really could not be selfish enough to keep any longer, especially as she was particularly fond of it. For Alan, a new kind of tin-opener that the dear boy would like enormously; he was so nice and practical. For Sheila, such a nice new novel by Mr. and Mrs. Whirlingham--a bright, wholesome tale, with such a good description of quite a new country in it--the dear child was so clever, it would be a change for her. Then, actually resting on the pincers, she came on her pass-book, recently made up, containing little or no balance, just enough to get darling John that bag like hers with the new clasp, which would be so handy for his papers when he went travelling. And having reached the pincers, she took them in her hand, and sat down again to be quite quiet a moment, with her still-dark eyelashes resting on her ivory cheeks and her lips pressed to a colorless line; for her head swam from stooping over. In repose, with three flies circling above her fine gray hair, she might have served a sculptor for a study of the stoic spirit. Then, going to the bag, her compressed lips twitching, her gray eyes piercing into its clasp with a kind of distrustful optimism, she lifted the pincers and tweaked it hard.|$|E

60|$|He hesitated. It was in {{his mind}} to tell her of that evening at Clonarty, to speak of it, to recall that one wave of emotion on which, indeed, they might have floated into a {{completer}} understanding. He looked at her steadfastly. She was very graceful, very good to look upon. She sat upright in <b>her</b> poor <b>cane</b> chair, bending over her foolish little task. But he missed any inspiration which might have guided his tongue. She looked so thoroughly self-possessed, so splendidly superior to circumstances.|$|R
