40|$|The fig mosaic disease (FMD) is a wide-spread {{disease in}} fig growing countries. This disease can be {{transmitted}} by vegetative propagation material and <b>eriophyd</b> <b>mite,</b> Aceria ficus Cotte. Because of the unknown etiology of this disease the possible role of phytoplasmas were studied in this work. Both EM and PCR methods were used. According to PCR analysis, one fig sample found infected by phytoplasma when universal P 1 /P 7 and R 16 F 2 /R 2 primers were used. This test was repeated and the same result was observed. EM works also showed that two samples {{one of which was}} cv. Yediveren and other one was experimentally infected seedling, included phytoplasma like bodies. This is the first record for phytoplasma infection of fig trees for our knowledge but it is still uncertain if it was an accidental companion or real agent of the disorder...|$|E
