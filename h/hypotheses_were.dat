5|$|When Deinocheirus {{was only}} {{known from the}} {{original}} forelimbs, its taxonomic relationship was difficult to determine, and several <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> proposed. Osm√≥lska and Roniewicz initially concluded that Deinocheirus did not belong in any already named theropod family, so they created a new, monotypic family Deinocheiridae, placed in the infraorder Carnosauria. This {{was due to the}} large size and thick-walled limb bones, but they also found some similarities with Ornithomimus, and, to a lesser extent, Allosaurus. In 1971, John Ostrom first proposed that Deinocheirus belonged with the Ornithomimosauria, while noting that it contained both ornithomimosaurian and non-ornithomimosaurian characters. In 1976, Rhinchen Barsbold named the order Deinocheirosauria, which was to include the supposedly related genera Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus. A relationship between Deinocheirus and the long-armed therizinosaurs was supported by some later writers, but they are not considered to be closely related today.|$|E

25|$|An abiogenic {{hypothesis}} was first proposed by Georgius Agricola in the 16th century and various additional abiogenic <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> {{proposed in the}} 19th century, most notably by Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt, the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev and the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot. Abiogenic <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> revived {{in the last half}} of the 20th century by Soviet scientists who had little influence outside the Soviet Union because most of their research was published in Russian. The {{hypothesis was}} re-defined and made popular in the West by Thomas Gold who developed his theories from 1979 to 1998, and published his research in English.|$|E
50|$|Fisher's {{method is}} {{typically}} {{applied to a}} collection of independent test statistics, usually from separate studies having the same null hypothesis. The meta-analysis null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> {{that all of the}} separate null <b>hypotheses</b> <b>are</b> true. The meta-analysis alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> {{that at least one of}} the separate alternative <b>hypotheses</b> <b>is</b> true.|$|R
5000|$|In {{entrepreneurial}} science, a <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> used {{to formulate}} provisional ideas within a business setting.

50|$|Misunderstandings of p-values are an {{important}} problem in scientific research and scientific education. P-values are often used or interpreted incorrectly. The data obtained by comparing the p-value to a significance level will yield one of two results: either the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected (which however {{does not imply that}} the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false), or the null <b>hypothesis</b> cannot <b>be</b> rejected at that significance level (which however does not imply that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true). In Ronald Fishers formulation, a low p-value means either that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true and a highly improbable event has occurred or that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false.|$|R
25|$|Initial {{observation}} of mating {{in the green}} poison-dart frog Dendrobates auratus shows convincing evidence of sex-role reversal. Small female clutch size, female-female competition, and large parental care investment by males are characteristic of sexual role reversal. as cited by To test whether this sexual role reversal was true, two <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> tested; the sexual role reversal hypothesis and the parental quality hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Although Jesus {{bloodline}} <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> not {{submitted to}} {{the judgment of the}} Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars involved in the quest for the historical Jesus from a liberal Christian perspective, they were unable to determine whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a matrimonial relationship due to the dearth of historical evidence. They concluded that the historical Mary Magdalene was not a repentant prostitute but a prominent disciple of Jesus and a leader in the early Christian movement. Bart D. Ehrman, who chairs the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, commented that, although there are some historical scholars who claim that it is likely that Jesus was married, the vast majority of New Testament and early Christianity scholars find such a claim to be historically unreliable.|$|E
25|$|There {{are places}} other than sport {{that can be}} {{affected}} by the hot-hand fallacy. A study conducted by Joseph Johnson et al. examined the characteristics of an individual's buying and selling behavior as it pertained to the hot hand and gambler's heuristic. Both of these occur when a consumer misunderstands random events in the market and is influenced by a belief that a small sample is able to represent the underlying process. To examine the effect of the hot hand and gambler's heuristic on the buying and selling behaviors of consumers, three <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> made. Hypothesis one stated that consumers that were given stocks with positive and negative trends in earning {{would be more likely to}} buy a stock that was positive when it was first getting started but would become less likely to do so as the trend lengthened. Hypothesis two was that consumers would be more likely to sell a stock with negative earnings as the trend length initially increased but would decrease as the trend length increased more. Finally, the third hypothesis was that consumers in the buy condition would be more likely to choose a winning stock over those in the selling condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> used {{differently}} in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher, a null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected if the observed data are significantly unlikely to have occurred if the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>were</b> true. In this case the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected and an alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> accepted in its place. If the data {{are consistent with the}} null hypothesis, then the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> not rejected. In neither case <b>is</b> the null <b>hypothesis</b> or its alternative proven; the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data are. This is analogous to the legal principle of presumption of innocence, in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).|$|R
25|$|Statistical <b>hypothesis</b> testing <b>is</b> a key {{technique}} of both frequentist inference and Bayesian inference, {{although the two}} types of inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly deciding that a default position (null <b>hypothesis)</b> <b>is</b> incorrect. The procedure is based on how likely it would be for a set of observations to occur if the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>were</b> true. Note that this probability of making an incorrect decision is not the probability that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true, nor whether any specific alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of decision theory in which the null and alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>are</b> treated on a more equal basis.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> a conjecture, {{based on}} {{knowledge}} obtained while formulating the question, {{that may explain}} the observed behavior of {{a part of our}} universe. The <b>hypothesis</b> might <b>be</b> very specific, e.g., Einstein's equivalence principle or Francis Crick's [...] "DNA makes RNA makes protein", or it might be broad, e.g., unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans. A statistical <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> a conjecture about some population. For example, the population might be people with a particular disease. The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people. Terms commonly associated with statistical <b>hypotheses</b> <b>are</b> null <b>hypothesis</b> and alternative hypothesis. A null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the conjecture that the statistical <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false, e.g., that the new drug does nothing and that any cures are due to chance effects. Researchers normally want to show that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false. The alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the desired outcome, e.g., that the drug does better than chance. A final point: a scientific <b>hypothesis</b> must <b>be</b> falsifiable, meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested.|$|R
25|$|However, these <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> all refuted by {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s Apollo lunar missions, which {{introduced}} a stream of new scientific evidence; specifically concerning the Moon's composition, its age, and its history. These lines of evidence contradict many predictions made by these earlier models. The rocks brought back from the Moon showed a marked decrease in water relative to rocks elsewhere in the Solar System, and also evidence of an ocean of magma early in its history, indicating that its formation must have produced {{a great deal of}} energy. Also, oxygen isotopes in lunar rocks showed a marked similarity to those on Earth, suggesting that they formed at a similar location in the solar nebula. The capture model fails to explain the similarity in these isotopes (if the Moon had originated {{in another part of the}} Solar System, those isotopes would have been different), while the co-accretion model cannot adequately explain the loss of water (if the Moon formed in a similar fashion to the Earth, the amount of water trapped in its mineral structure would also be roughly similar). Conversely, the fission model, while it can account for the similarity in chemical composition and the lack of iron in the Moon, cannot adequately explain its high orbital inclination and, in particular, the large amount of angular momentum in the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, more than any other planet‚Äìsatellite pair in the Solar System.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{availability}} of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication. Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. However, {{the lack of a}} detectable substructure [...] in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.|$|E

A crane fell while carrying a part of the roof, destroying eight columns of the LED screen and part of an internal slab. The structure was not affected because anti-vandalism glass was installed on the east fa√ßade. An area of [...] was closed for investigation. Initial <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> human error, crane mechanical failure and unstable ground under the crane.

In Richmond, Virginia, the Turk was observed by Edgar Allan Poe, who was writing for the Southern Literary Messenger.

500|$|Tucker {{considered}} a trip abroad would enhance his insight and resume generally, and specifically prepare {{him for a}} possible, though not likely, diplomatic appointment. He expected there was much to be learned for his country's benefit in the British factories, great estates and crowded cities.
