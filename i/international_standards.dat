5|$|A {{review of}} the National Waymarked Trails in Ireland by the National Trails Office in 2010 {{acknowledged}} these shortcomings and recommended that the Wicklow Way be selected as one of fourteen trails to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail. This is a proposed new standard of trail in Ireland, intended to meet <b>international</b> <b>standards</b> for outstanding trails. It would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10% of the total trail and for appropriate support services – accommodation, meals, transport, luggage transfer etc. – to be available. The review also recommended the development of shorter looped walks off the Wicklow Way and improving parking facilities.|$|E

Ireland supplied a small number of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan (2001–2014) and supports the ongoing NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).|$|E
5|$|Raymond Harvey (born 3 January 1926) is {{a former}} Australian {{first-class}} cricketer who played for Victoria in the 1940s and 1950s.

5|$|When {{designing}} Queen Mary 2, {{the designers}} aimed {{to reduce the}} ship's {{impact on the environment}} by improving fuel efficiency and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as it was predicted that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from that of many older ships, as well as <b>international</b> <b>standards</b> on waste.|$|E
40|$|As {{supplies}} of the <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> for Chlortetracycline were practically exhausted, it was replaced.

The mean potencies obtained in the participating laboratories, although they varied by only 7 %, were heterogeneous. However, the mean potency for all the laboratories combined did not differ significantly from that of the first <b>international</b> <b>standard.</b> The <b>International</b> Unit for chlortetracycline was therefore defined as the activity contained in 0. 001 mg of the second <b>international</b> <b>standard,</b> corresponding to a potency of 1 000 IU/mg...|$|R

5|$|During a {{televised}} {{address to the}} nation on 7 September 2004, Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of <b>international</b> <b>standards.</b> An example of the failure, cited by the OSCE, was the pre-marking of ballots. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring <b>international</b> <b>standards.</b> This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|The Palais des Sports in the Mahamasina {{neighborhood}} is the country's only indoor performance space built to <b>international</b> <b>standards.</b> It {{was built in}} 1995 by the Government of China; it regularly hosts concerts, dance and other arts performances, expositions and novelty events like monster truck rallies. The city lacks a dedicated classical music performance space, and concerts by international artists are infrequent. Performances of classical, jazz and other foreign musical genres, modern and contemporary dance, theater and other arts occur at cultural arts centers funded by foreign governments or private entities. Among the best-known of these are the Centre Culturel Albert Camus and Alliance française d'Antananarivo, both funded by the French government. the Cercle Germano-Malgache, {{a branch of the}} Goethe-Institut funded by the German government; The American Center is funded by the United States government. Antananarivo has two dedicated cinemas, the Rex and the Ritz, both of which were built in the colonial era. These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.|$|E
