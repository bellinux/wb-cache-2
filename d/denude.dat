5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U–boat threat {{expected}} so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive {{was part of a}} wider German strategy to <b>denude</b> Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. George Borrow was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, {{in the same manner as}} Q-ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{assembled}} warbands of the Alamanni frequently {{crossed the}} limes, attacking Germania Superior {{such that they}} were almost continually engaged in conflicts with the Roman Empire, whilst Goths attacked across the Danube in battles such as the Battle of Beroa and Battle of Philippopolis in 250 AD and the Battle of Abrittus in 251 AD, and both Goths and Heruli ravaged the Aegean and, later, Greece, Thrace and Macedonia. However, their first major assault deep into Roman territory came in 268 AD. In that year the Romans were forced to <b>denude</b> much of their German frontier of troops {{in response to a}} massive invasion by another new Germanic tribal confederacy, the Goths, from the east. The pressure of tribal groups pushing into the Empire was the end result of a chain of migrations with its roots far to the east: Huns from the Russian steppe attacked the Goths, who in turn attacked the Dacians, Alans and Sarmatians at or within Rome's borders. The Goths first appeared in history as a distinct people in this invasion of 268 AD when they swarmed over the Balkan peninsula and overran the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Illyricum and even threatened Italia itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>denuded</b> zones following low stress creep in particle-containing crystalline materials {{is both a}} microstructural prediction and observation often cited as irrefutable evidence for the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) mechanism of diffusional creep. The <b>denuded</b> zones are predicted to be at grain boundaries that are orthogonal to {{the direction of the}} applied stress. Furthermore, their dimensions should account for the accumulated plastic flow. In the present article, the evidence for such <b>denuded</b> zones is critically examined. These zones have been observed during creep of magnesium, aluminum, and nickel-base alloys. The investigation casts serious doubts on the apparently compelling evidence for the link between <b>denuded</b> zones and diffusional creep. Specifically, <b>denuded</b> zones are clearly observed under conditions that are explicitly not diffusional creep. Additionally, the <b>denuded</b> zones are often found in directions that are not orthogonal to the applied stress. Other mechanisms that can account for the observations of <b>denuded</b> zones are discussed. It is proposed that grain boundary sliding accommodated by slip is the rate-controlling process in the stress range where <b>denuded</b> zones have been observed. It is likely that the <b>denuded</b> zones are created by dissolution of precipitates at grain boundaries that are simultaneously sliding and migrating during creep. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|As the 19th century dawned, Florida {{had been}} undisputed Spanish {{territory}} for almost 250 years, aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Although a sparsely inhabited swampland, expansionist-minded Americans {{were eager to}} grab it and already, in 1808, American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities, after which Congress hastily passed a bill annexing it under {{the claim that the}} Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States. During the War of 1812, American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay. Spain, then engulfed in war with France, did not react to either of these actions. Also taking advantage of the mother country's distraction, Spain's Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to <b>denude</b> Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions. The result of this was that law and order practically broke down in Florida and a horde of Indians, pirates, and other troublemakers began raiding across the border into the US. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there. He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids, leading to an outcry in London and calls for war. However, cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further. A year later, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain. The Spanish agreed to turn over the no-longer-defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy claims to the distant Oregon Territory, in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced (some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase). The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon. Although American designs on Texas did not disappear, they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida.|$|E

In Experiment 1, the effect of the cumulus cells by comparing slaughterhouse-oocytes <b>denuded</b> on purpose (DOP) prior to IVF to intact COC, and the effect of heparin during IVF were assessed. In Experiment 2, oocytes that were already <b>denuded</b> at collection (DOC), DOP and intact COC were studied. Three treatments used oocytes <b>denuded</b> at collection: DOC oocytes were cultured alone for both IVM and IVF; DOC and COC were cultured together for both IVM and IVF or DOC were IVM alone and then mixed with COC for IVF. In other treatments, COC were allocated to four IVF treatments: Intact COC; COC were <b>denuded</b> prior to IVF; COC were <b>denuded</b> and IVF with added cumulus cells; COC were <b>denuded</b> and IVF mixed with intact COC giving two sub-treatments: <b>Denuded</b> oocytes that were IVF with COC; and COC that were IVF with <b>denuded</b> oocytes. After fertilization, all presumptive zygotes were cultured for 8 days. In Experiment 1, the yield of blastocysts as a proportion of total oocytes was greater (P< 0. 05) for COC that were IVF in the presence of heparin (54 %) than without heparin (42 %) or oocytes already <b>denuded</b> at collection that were IVF with or without heparin (41 %; 38 %; respectively). In Experiment 2, the developmental potential of oocytes <b>denuded</b> at collection was reduced (cleavage and blastocyst rates calculated from total oocytes: 34 %; 11 %, respectively) as compared to COC (77 %; 59 %, P< 0. 05). However, when equal numbers of both were mixed at the start of IVM, the rates were not significantly different to COC alone (68 %; 45 %), but when both were mixed equally only for IVF, the rates were reduced (57 %; 40 %, P< 0. 05). <b>Denuded</b> oocytes co-cultured with cumulus cells were not significantly different to intact COC (76 %; 55 %). The effect of adding COC during IVF to oocytes <b>denuded</b> after IVM was similar to adding cumulus cells to the same type of oocytes. In conclusion, both the use of heparin and the association of oocytes with cumulus cells, either detached or in intimate contact, during IVM and/or IVF significantly improve IVP of goat embryos. Furthermore, some oocytes that are already <b>denuded</b> at collection will develop satisfactorily to blastocysts when matured and fertilized with intact COC...|$|R

2500|$|When Yosemite Valley {{became part}} of a state park in 1864, Hetch Hetchy {{received}} no such designation.

Schleicher wanted the [...] "New State" [...] to enjoy popular legitimacy, and was increasing convinced that Papen's massive unpopularity would <b>denude</b> the [...] "New State" [...] of any legitimacy. On 27 October 1932, the Supreme Court of Germany in a convoluted ruling declared that Papen's coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal as Papen's lawyers had failed to prove his claim that the coup was necessary because the Social Democrats and Communists were allegedly about to merger, but also allowed for Papen to retain his control of Prussia, giving no means for Braun to resume office as the court ruled that the Reich government could depose a Land government if law and order were threatened. In November 1932, Papen showed his contempt for the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by passing an umbau (rebuilding) programme for the German Navy of one aircraft carrier, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas, sixteen U-boats and six battleships, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic. Versailles had forbidden Germany to have battleships, aircraft carriers and submarines.|$|E
40|$|Measurement of {{the loss}} of semi-volatile organic {{compounds}} from particles collected with a filter is carried out by comparing the amounts collected by comparable filter pack and diffusion <b>denuder</b> samplers. The sorbents used to collect organic compounds in the <b>denuder</b> and sorbent filters must have the same efficiency for collection of all gas-phase organic compounds present. Interpretation of the data requires that the efficiency of collection of gas-phase compounds by the <b>denuder</b> be known. In theory this can be accomplished by determination of the deposition pattern of all organic compounds collected in the <b>denuder,</b> but in practice this is very difficult if the organic material consists {{of a wide variety of}} compounds. An alternative approach is to determine the breakthrough of organic compounds in a sampler with a particle-collection filter preceding the <b>denuder</b> and sorbent filter.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionBased {{on recent}} analyses, the {{measures}} of short-term responsiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived cartilage morphometry {{may not be as}} large as earlier studies had suggested. We examined if by selecting regions of interest with <b>denuded</b> cartilage, the remaining cartilage within this region of interest was susceptible to greater rates of cartilage loss. MethodsSubjects included for this analysis are a subset of the approximately 4700 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) Study. Bilateral radiographs and 3 T MRI (Siemens Trio) of the knees and clinical data are obtained at baseline and annually in all participants. Hundred and fifty subjects from the OAI progression subcohort all of whom had both frequent symptoms and, in the same knee, radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA defined as definite tibio-femoral osteophytes on X-ray) based on a screening reading done at the OAI clinics. One knee from each subject was selected for analysis. Using sagittal 3 D DESSwe MR images from the baseline and 12 -month follow-up visit, a segmentation algorithm was applied to the cartilage plates of the index knee to compute the cartilage volume, normalized cartilage volume (volume normalized to bone surface interface area), and percent <b>denuded</b> area (Total Cartilage Bone Interface area <b>denuded</b> of cartilage). Summary statistics of the changes (absolute and percentage) from baseline at 1 year and the standardized response mean (SRM), i. e., mean change divided by the standard deviation (SD) of that change were calculated. Analyses are stratified into three groups according to baseline assessment of <b>denuded</b> area: those with no <b>denuded</b> area in the region of interest at baseline, and then two groups (intermediate <b>denuded</b> area (≤median) and severe (≥median) <b>denuded</b> area) of equal sample size. ResultsOn average the subjects were 60. 9 years of age and obese with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 30. 3 kg/m 2. For the combined central medial femur and tibia the mean volume change for the whole sample was − 48. 2 (SD 159. 8) mm 3, which gives an SRM of − 0. 30. In the subsample of knees with no <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 25, in the knees with intermediate <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 30, and in knees with severe <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 1. 00. For normalized volume of the central medial femur in the subsample of knees with no <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 22, in the knees with intermediate <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 26, and in knees with severe <b>denuded</b> area (n= 23) the SRM was − 0. 71. The magnitude of the SRMs was generally smaller in participants with no <b>denuded</b> area. In contrast, the SRMs in participants with <b>denuded</b> area were larger. ConclusionBy selecting participants with the presence of cartilage regions with <b>denuded</b> area the ability to demonstrate change in cartilage loss in that specific location is markedly improved compared to persons without a full thickness lesion in that cartilage plate. This option for screening during recruitment in clinical trials could facilitate the detection of participants at greater risk of subsequent cartilage loss...|$|R

Abstract—Laboratory models of the {{respiratory}} lining with mucin secreting epithelial goblet cells have been obtained by culturing epithelial cells under air–liquid interface (ALI) conditions, which require specific wells with semi-permeable substrates. In this study nasal epithelial cells (NEC) were successfully cultured on <b>denuded</b> amniotic membrane (AM) under ALI conditions. The cells adhered well {{on both sides of}} the <b>denuded</b> AM (i. e., the basement membrane or spongy layer) and proliferated to confluency at the same time as cells grown on a synthetic membrane.

Cultures on the <b>denuded</b> AM differentiated to contain goblet cells which produce and secrete mucins and ciliated cells.

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} developed a limbal epithelial culture system using a cell-suspension method on <b>denuded</b> amniotic membrane (AM). However, other workers reported that intact AM is advantageous for limbal epithelial culture {{in that it}} preserves stem cell characteristics. In this study, we cultivated human limbal epithelial cell-suspensions on both intact and <b>denuded</b> AM and compared the morphology and adhesion of the limbal epithelial cells on these two substrates. Methods: Human limbal epithelial cells were dissociated from donor eyes using dispase and gentle pipetting and then seeded onto intact and <b>denuded</b> AM as cell suspension. Limbal epithelial cells on AM were co-cultured with a MMC-treated 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layer and epithelial differentiation was promoted by air lifting. Cultures were examined by light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and differences in cellular attachments and intercellular spacing were quantified. Basement membrane complexes were examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Results: Limbal cells grown on <b>denuded</b> AM were well stratified and differentiated. Cells were well attached {{to each other and}} to the basement membrane. In contrast, limbal cells cultured on intact AM failed to stratify and in places formed a monolayer. The culture on <b>denuded</b> AM had significantly (P < 0. 001) more desmosomal junctions as well as significantly (P < 0. 001) more junctional attachments to the carrier than the intact culture. In addition, the intercellular spaces between cells cultivated on <b>denuded</b> AM were significantly (P < 0. 001) smaller than those between cells grown on the intact substrate. In cultures on both <b>denuded</b> and intact AM, the basement membrane zone displayed a positive staining for collagen VII, integrins alpha- 6 and beta- 4 and laminin 5. Conclusions: We successfully cultivated well-stratified and -differentiated limbal cells on <b>denuded</b> AM, while on the intact AM limbal cells failed to stratify and in places formed only a monolayer of cells. The limbal cells cultivated on <b>denuded</b> AM were well attached to the AM stroma and were morphologically superior to the limbal epithelium cultivated on intact AM. We conclude that for purposes of transplantation of differentiated epithelial sheets, <b>denuded</b> AM is probably the more practical carrier for human limbal epithelial cell cultures when using our cell-suspension culture system...|$|R

If you see me falter, do not hesitate; if necessary, wreck the train! I speak, of course, by a parable. Any extremity were better than for me to reach Paris alive.' ...|$|E
60|$|French's {{force had}} now come {{level to the}} main {{position}} of the Boers, but had struck it upon the extreme left wing. The extreme right wing, thanks to the Koodoosdrift demonstration, was fifty miles off, and this line was naturally very thinly held, save only at the central position of Magersfontein. Cronje could not <b>denude</b> this central position, for he saw Methuen still waiting in front of him, {{and in any case}} Klip Drift is twenty-five miles from Magersfontein. But the Boer left wing, though scattered, gathered into some sort of cohesion on Wednesday (February 14th), and made an effort to check the victorious progress of the cavalry. It was necessary on this day to rest at Klip Drift, until Kelly-Kenny should come up with the infantry to hold what had been gained. All day the small bodies of Boers came riding in and taking up positions between the column and its objective.|$|E
40|$|The first direct {{microstructural}} observation used {{as evidence}} for diffusional creep {{is from the}} work of Squires, Weiner, and Phillips (S-W-P). They observed <b>denuded</b> zones at grain boundaries after creep in a Mg- 0. 5 wt. % Zr alloy that contained inert precipitates. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to show that the reported creep data for the Mg- 0. 5 wt. %Zr alloy was, in fact, obtained in a region where dislocation creep, rather than diffusional creep, was the dominant deformation mechanism. Details of the <b>denuded</b> zone formation will also be presented which question the relation of <b>denuded</b> zones to diffusional creep. Therefore, it is contended that the microstructurally-observed <b>denuded</b> zones cannot be a result of diffusional creep. This contention supports previously-published views by the present authors that conclusive proof for diffusional creep in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Results {{obtained}} from five techniques for measuring gas-phase ammonia {{at low concentration}} in the atmosphere are compared. These methods are: (1) a photofragmentation/laser-induced fluorescence (PF/LIF) instrument; (2) a molybdenum oxide annular <b>denuder</b> sampling/chemiluminescence detection technique; (3) a tungsten oxide <b>denuder</b> sampling/chemiluminescence detection system; (4) a citric-acid-coated <b>denuder</b> sampling/ion chromatographic analysis (CAD/IC) method; and (5) an oxalic-acid-coated filter pack sampling/colorimetric analysis method. It was found {{that two of the}} techniques, the PF/LIF and the CAD/IC methods, measured approximately 90 percent of the calculated ammonia added in the spiking tests and agreed very well with each other in the ambient measurements...|$|R
