40|$|Abstract. The {{synchronization}} {{of two or}} more semi-traces {{describes the}} possible evaluation of a concurrent system, which consists {{of two or more}} concurrent subsystems in a modular way, where communication between the subsystems restricts the order of the actions. In this paper we give criteria, which tell us <b>for</b> <b>given</b> semi-traces in given semicommutation systems, whether they are synchronizable and whether the synchronization is again a semi-trace; and criteria, which tell us <b>for</b> <b>given</b> semi-commutation systems, whether all semi-traces have this property. We prove that deciding these criteria is NLOGSPACE-complete <b>for</b> <b>given</b> semi-traces. The same holds for the synchronizability of all semitraces <b>for</b> <b>given</b> semi-commutation systems. On the other hand the question, whether <b>for</b> <b>given</b> semi-commutation systems the synchronization of synchronizable semi-traces is a semi-trace is co-NP-complete. Furthermore we give a co-NP-complete condition for being able to decide synchronizability locally in TC 0. ...|$|R
5|$|G-spot proponents are criticized <b>for</b> <b>giving</b> {{too much}} {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples.
