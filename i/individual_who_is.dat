50|$|Meanwhile, {{self-similarity}} {{transmission is}} {{the tendency to}} copy those <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible {{with his or her}} knowledge or social environment.|$|R

Kassing and Avtgis (1999) found an <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> more argumentative and less verbally aggressive is prone to use articulated dissent. On the other hand, an individual who lacks argumentative skills will resort to using a less direct and more aggressive strategy, latent dissent.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{the giving}} of praise by teachers, praise is a {{reinforcer}} for students. Adolescents undergo social-emotional development {{such that they}} seek rapport with peers.

The case was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus it is only binding in the state of California.|$|E

25|$|Rogers {{suggested}} that the incongruent <b>individual,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic {{this is a difficult}} task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Shower series from 1965, {{a man is}} depicted standing under a shower but with no water. Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E
25|$|The Nyaya school, {{one of six}} {{orthodox}} {{schools of}} Hindu philosophy, states {{that one of the}} proofs of the existence of God is karma; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God. This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is {{the same as that of}} Vedanta.|$|E

He compared the use of the character to American singer Beyoncé's adoption of the Sasha Fierce alter ego, or singer Lady Gaga's use of various costumes, being a way to protect Neuwirth's own private life.|$|E
