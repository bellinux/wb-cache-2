5|$|Sycorax {{has been}} conceptualised {{in a variety}} ways by {{adapters}} and directors of The Tempest. In John Dryden and William Davenant's version of The Tempest (1670), Sycorax is survived by two children, Caliban and a daughter also named Sycorax. This second Sycorax makes sexual advances toward Trinculo, the drunken sailor, and (according to Trinculo) also has incestuous relations with her brother Caliban. Die Geisterinsel, a 1778 version of the play in German, includes a living Sycorax, a witch who has full power during the night, while Prospero rules the <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> play, {{she is the one}} who causes the tempest and shipwreck, not Prospero; Prospero is extremely wary of her actions as each night approaches, as she has power over those who sleep. Several times he struggles to keep Miranda awake to protect her from Sycorax's power. In Eugène Scribe's French 1846 version, Sycorax is alive but imprisoned behind some rocks out of sight. She spends most of the play trying to convince her son, Caliban, to free her. Peter Brook's 1968 British version of the play portrayed Sycorax as an ugly witch, including her in a birth scene in which the equally ugly Caliban is born.|$|E

25|$|After two tame days of bowling {{from the}} England squad which saw the president's XI reach an {{impressive}} 500 for 5, England {{took to the}} wicket for one <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> warm up match.

As top-scorer Alastair Cook reached his fifty, with seven fours, {{the rest of his}} teammates were investigating rumoured sittings of a snake underneath the advertising board. Only Kevin Pietersen fell cheaply, for 4, while the other top-order batsmen all retired after making semi-impressive starts to ensure as many batsmen could have a knock but the match was over as any kind of contest due to the poor performance of the 9 bowlers used.|$|E

25|$|When runway {{alternation}} was introduced, aircraft generated {{significantly more}} noise on departure than when landing, so {{a preference for}} westerly operations during daylight was introduced, which continues to this <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> mode, aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over London, thereby minimising the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas. Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the departure runway due to {{the legacy of the}} now rescinded Cranford Agreement, pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.|$|E

Nāwahī died in 1896 from tuberculosis complications contracted during his imprisonment. After Nāwahī's death, White and other Hui Aloha ʻĀina delegates from the different island branches congregated in Honolulu for the election of a new leadership council on November28, 1896, coinciding with Lā Kūʻokoʻa (Hawaiian Independence <b>Day).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> meeting in which White presided as chairman, James Keauiluna Kaulia was elected as the new president.

The task of the navy, along with the army, was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies. The Italians opposed the formation of a navy by the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] , NDH), as they considered the Adriatic to be Mare Nostrum (Our Sea). The Germans supported the Italians in this, so the development of the RMNDH along the Adriatic coast was initially very restricted. On 18 May 1941, the Agreement on Military Matters Pertaining to Coastal Areas was signed in Romethe second of three Treaties of Rome signed that <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> bilateral treaty with Italy, Croatia agreed to demilitarize the coastal area entirely, restricting itself to civil administration there. It also agreed not create any naval units in the Adriatic except for policing and customs purposes.

500|$|In 1903, Pelham Warner, {{who played}} for Middlesex, was chosen to captain the first tour of Australia to be {{sponsored}} by MCC, {{in the winter of}} 1903–04.

[...] Before the tour, critics claimed Hirst would be unsuccessful, citing his failure during his previous tour. However, Warner later wrote: [...] "Hirst, to say nothing of his batting, bowled excellently throughout the tour, and was of much more value as a bowler than his average would suggest". He further described him as the best all-rounder in England and noted that [...] "the tighter the match, the better he plays". Wisden was less convinced, and the report on the tour said that, as a bowler, [...] "Hirst, though by no means the failure he had been with Mr Stoddart's team six years before, fell far below his English form." [...] While commenting on his batting record, the Wisden report noted: [...] "The Australian wickets [...] in fine weather are rather too fast to suit the pulling and hook strokes of which he is such a master in England." [...] As he could not make the ball swing in Australia in the same way it did in England, Hirst used leg theory, bowling at leg stump with fielders close by on the leg side.|$|E
