50|$|Even {{though the}} S4PH engine had {{contemporary}} maximum {{power and torque}} outputs, its performance was reportedly sluggish in real world driving.

50|$|Great {{care must}} be used when {{selecting}} the length and diameter of the primary tubes. Tubes that are too large will cause the exhaust gas to expand and slow down, decreasing the scavenging effect. Tubes that are too small will create exhaust flow resistance which the engine must work to expel the exhaust gas from the chamber, reducing power and leaving exhaust in the chamber to dilute the incoming intake charge. Since engines produce more exhaust gas at higher speeds, the header(s) are tuned to a particular <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> according to the intended application. Typically, wide primary tubes offer the best gains in power and torque at higher engine speeds, while narrow tubes offer the best gains at lower speeds.|$|E

In order to evaluate noise emissions, four <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> (1600 - 1900 rpm with steps of 100 rpm) and four engine load conditions (25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %) were selected.

The increase in pmax is about 0.9 MPa at 1, 500 rpm and 0.6 MPa at 2, 460 rpm passing through 0 MPa both at about 1, 900 and 2, 800 rpm. The noticeable increase in Tmax is about 60 K at 1, 500 rpm and 40 K at 2, 460 rpm passing through 0 K both at 1, 900 and 2, 800 rpm. These increases in pmax and Tmax are tolerable, as they are still below the allowable pressure and temperature of the conventional engine. Similar observations for the changes of brake efficiency and bsfc versus <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> for operation under constant and variable compression ratios are shown in Figure 12.

Expansion chambers only work well at a narrow <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> which is why two stroke engines are referred to as having a [...] "powerband".
