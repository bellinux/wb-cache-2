40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{due to the}} usage of hard superabrasives like CBN and Diamond, the {{significant}} increasing of material removal rate as well as performance in the grinding technology could be achieved. The advantage of superabrasives {{can not be fully}} utilized without process oriented dressing of grinding wheel. In this paper, the practical results of the applied tests using <b>dressing</b> <b>roll</b> (dressing disc) are presented to demonstrate the influence of the dressing parameters on the grinding process...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{determination of}} the <b>dress</b> <b>roll</b> optimal radius while producing parts having trohoidal profile {{with the help of}} grinding method that presupposes application of grinding disk. In this case disk profile has been cut-in by diamond dressing. Two methods for determination of calculation of the <b>dress</b> <b>roll</b> optimal radius have been proposed in the paper. On the basis of the satellite gear of the planetary pin reducer whose profile presents a trochoid {{it has been shown that}} the obtained results pertaining to two proposed methods conform with each other. </p...|$|R

60|$|She {{sat down}} beside him with a laugh and a pretty blush. She was in her apron, and the sleeves of her <b>dress</b> were <b>rolled</b> to her elbows, {{displaying}} the strong, round arms. Wholesome and sweet she looked and smelled, {{the scent of the}} cooking round her. Lyman munched a couple of the cookies and gulped a pint of milk before he spoke.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice studied Hester Harding with interest. Though {{she found}} her simply <b>dressed,</b> with sleeves <b>rolled</b> back and hands smeared with flour, the prairie girl made a {{favorable}} impression on her. She liked the sensitive, grave face, and the candid, thoughtful look.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{contains}} {{a number of}} unusual items that have not (yet) been claimed by their owners, including a lobster found at Paris-Orly Airport, a funerary urn lost in the subway station near Père Lachaise Cemetery, a fireman's helmet, skulls, a wooden leg, wedding <b>dresses,</b> and a <b>roll</b> of copper weighing over 100 kg.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to public}} support for {{retaining}} the hall, and for keeping the honour board there, it was extensively rebuilt in its original form, retaining original fabric in the stage area. The honour board was remounted on its original supporting frame and the hall was officially reopened on 20 October 2012. The only original features to survive the cyclone damage were the stage, <b>dressing</b> rooms, honour <b>roll,</b> and the Cardwell Shire Council table.|$|R

50|$|The {{flagship}} sandwich in Carrols' original menu was the Club Burger. Like the Big Mac at McDonald's, it {{also had}} two all-beef patties, a special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions, served on a sesame-seeded, triple-decker hamburger bun. The Club Burger also had a tomato slice, and its special sauce is known as Crisbo Royale Sauce. In the early-to-mid-1970s, there was no tomato slice, and the sauce was a French dressing variant called Royal <b>Dressing.</b> The <b>roll</b> was sliced into three parts: crown, center and heel. The sandwich was assembled in a paper collar with the crown having the pickle, lettuce and royal dressing followed by a patty (as I recall topped with onions), center bun section, another patty and a slice of American cheese and finally the heel which had ketchup. The fish sandwich at Carrols was the Sea Filet. This was a fish fillet that was deep fried placed on a steamed <b>roll</b> <b>dressed</b> with tartar sauce, lettuce and salt. They also rolled out the Brute, {{their own version of}} Burger King's Whopper. Carrols' Roast Beef Hero piled microwave heated slices of deli roast beef inside a bolillio roll with a dripping of au jus sauce. When introduced, the meat was sliced in the restaurant from roasts. Later the roast beef came in pre-packaged single serving units, served in carton. Carrols' Toasted Cheese (aka TC) had two yellow American cheese slices criss-crossing on both the top and bottom sides of a hamburger bun (cut surfaces to the outside), which was pressed with a spatula as it cooked on the grill. The TC sold for ten cents in 1970.|$|R
60|$|Then {{for just}} a moment her eyes grew hazy. In {{proportion}} to the man's means, it was a costly gift, and, except for him, nobody had shown her much consideration since she had left England. She was a trifle perplexed, for she did not think there was lace of that kind on sale often in Victoria, and, in regard to the gloves, it was not evident how he had known her size. Then she remembered that one of the cotton ones she sometimes wore had disappeared some little time before, and once more the flush crept into her cheeks. That almost decided her not to wear his lace, but she felt that to refrain from doing so would raise the question as to how they stood with regard to one another, which was one she did not desire to think out closely then; and, after all, the lace was exactly what she wanted to complete the <b>dress.</b> She <b>rolled</b> it together, and put it and the gloves away, but she treasured the little note.|$|R
6000|$|It's all gone. What's {{this new}} place? Flick, flick, {{looks like a}} street. Say! see the street car coming along--well! say! isn't that great? A street car! And here's Madeline! How on earth did she get back from the old farm all in a second? Got her street things on--that must be music under her arm--I wonder where--hullo--who's this man in a silk hat and swell coat? Gee! he's well <b>dressed.</b> See him <b>roll</b> his eyes at Madeline! He's lifting his hat--I guess he must be Edward Something, the Roo--only a roo would dress {{as well as he}} does--he's going to speak to her-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Discipline Walter {{found very}} strict, {{and once he}} had donned his uniform he was kept {{employed}} from sunrise to sunset, his duties being largely similar to those performed by his brother Larry on the Olympia. Early {{in the morning he}} was aroused by the blare of a bugle, or the roll of a drum, and given but a few minutes in which to <b>dress</b> and <b>roll</b> up his hammock and put it away. Then came the work of washing down the deck, followed by breakfast, and later all hands were called to quarters, to attend some drill, sometimes at the guns, sometimes at the hose pipes scattered about in case of fire, and occasionally with small-arms and with cutlasses. Each afternoon there was a [...] "run around," [...] lasting from ten minutes to half an hour. In this the men fell in singly or in pairs, and ran around and around the deck, at first slowly until [...] "second wind" [...] was gained, and then faster and faster. This is the one chance a jackie gets of stretching his legs while on board of his ship, and how he does enjoy it! ...|$|R
5000|$|A year later, Billy-Ben marries Ellwyn. Jess-Belle reappears {{in various}} {{threatening}} forms. Billy-Ben learns from Granny that to kill Jess-Belle he {{must make a}} figure of her using clothing she has worn, and stab it through the heart with silver. He returns home to find Ellwyn has been possessed by Jess-Belle. Jess-Belle then asks Billy-Ben to [...] "dance in the moonlight," [...] which means she wants to kill him. He runs {{into the house and}} locks the door. He puts one of Jess-Belle's dresses on a mannequin and stabs it with one of Jess-Belle's own silver hairpins. Jess-Belle appears in the <b>dress,</b> her eyes <b>roll</b> back, and she disappears. After this, Ellwyn does not remember anything that happened since the wedding, but claims, upon seeing a falling star that [...] "it means a witch has died." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the Saturday Night Show {{selected}} Scout {{leaders and}} staff members proceed to a campfire where they are told about their membership in the Knights of Yawgoog. During the Sunday <b>dress</b> parade the <b>roll</b> of new members is announced, along with the ceremonial induction potato, which is necklace of a potato threaded by a rope that is required to be worn of all new recruits and cannot be removed for 24 hours or when the inductee leaves Reservation property to head home, whichever comes first. It was started in 1920 when the [...] "Knights" [...] would be commissioned by a [...] "King of Yawgoog". It was a lighthearted club with no obligations, but later evolved into a more serious group to remind men of their role in molding Scouts. Scoutmasters {{and staff members}} inducted into the Knights of Yawgoog earned a patch tab of a gold sword against a navy blue background for uniform wear.|$|R
60|$|Presently Thurston {{knocked at}} the door, and strode in at a summons to enter. Slightly abashed, he halted inside the threshold. Jean, looking ruddy and winsome in light print <b>dress,</b> with sleeves <b>rolled</b> clear of each plump fore-arm, was {{spreading}} great platefuls of hot cakes and desiccated fruits among the more solid viands on the snowy tablecloth. Geoffrey {{found it difficult to}} refrain from glancing wolfishly at the good things until his eyes rested upon Miss Savine, and then it cost him an effort to turn them away. Helen reclined on an ox-hide lounge. An early rose rested among the glossy clusters of her thick, dark hair. A faint tinge of crimson showed through the pale olive in her cheek, and he caught the glimmer of pearly teeth between the ripe red lips. In her presence he grew painfully conscious that he was ragged, toil-stained and dusty, though he had made the best toilet he could beside a stream.|$|R
60|$|Edgar by {{this time}} had put on the dark-blue blouse, {{reaching}} down below the knee and girt by a belt at the waist, which forms the main article of dress of every Egyptian peasant. On his head was a brown cap of rough wool, of something of the same shape as a fez. These, {{and a pair of}} low Turkish shoes, completed his costume, underneath which he wore the European one, the trousers being rolled up above the knees, so as not to show. While the operation of dressing the wounds was going on, he went down into the village, and finding a shop where they sold such things, bought similar suits to his own for the two Arabs. When he returned, the sheik's wounds had been <b>dressed,</b> a blanket <b>rolled</b> up under his head, and he was looking altogether more comfortable. Edgar now told him his plan of carrying him off.|$|R

500|$|Lisa {{tries to}} {{convince}} Homer and Marge that college suits her, but {{they refuse to}} listen, saying that college {{is no place for}} her. Lisa is also ridiculed by Groundskeeper Willie and all of her friends at school, saying that she is too [...] "college for them". In the meantime, Bart gets used to his bubble, as it brings him a lot of popularity. Bart tells Lisa what she should do to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the Seymour Skinner parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant chocolate cake in his <b>dress</b> polyester, Bart <b>rolls</b> Lisa (inside his bubble) {{to the edge of the}} school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside of his bubble for the first time in days. He stays in an air vent, but gets sucked in.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{their host}} entered, {{and the subject}} of course was dropped. But the major's words rankled in the young man's mind, and would have been doubly bitter had he known that their {{confidential}} conversation had been overheard. On either side of the great fireplace was a door leading to a suite of rooms which had been old Sir Jasper's. These apartments had been given to Maurice Treherne, and he had just returned from London, whither he had been to consult a certain famous physician. Entering quietly, he had taken possession of his rooms, and having rested and <b>dressed</b> for dinner, <b>rolled</b> himself into the library, to which led the curtained door on the right. Sitting idly in his light, wheeled chair, ready to enter when his cousin appeared, he had heard the chat of Annon and the major. As he listened, over his usually impassive face passed varying expressions of anger, pain, bitterness, and defiance, and when the young man uttered his almost fierce [...] "We shall see," [...] Treherne smiled a scornful smile and clenched his pale hand with a gesture which proved that a year of suffering had not conquered the man's spirit, though it had crippled his strong body.|$|R
