500|$|When {{recording}} Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too, Alexander {{stated that}} he [...] "completely ripped up the rules that applied to [...] first two records." [...] While the album was credited to the New Radicals, it is often {{considered to be a}} Gregg Alexander album, as he wrote and produced most of its songs, played several instruments on it, and is the only constant member of the band. In reference to the wide variety of musicians he recruited to record the album, Alexander stated, [...] "Most of that record was me pulling favors with studios or musicians that had played on earlier records and were like, 'Oh, Gregg's down on his luck — let's go play on his demo for the <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> we'll have a good laugh, have a couple of beers and maybe smoke a jay or whatever.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly for the <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> or repeat textures so much in its huge maps {{that you can get}} a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E
500|$|Doubt (also 2008) {{features}} Streep with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. A drama {{revolving around}} the stern principal nun (Streep) of a Bronx Catholic school in 1964 who brings accusations of pedophilia against a popular priest (Hoffman), the film became a moderate box office success, and was hailed by many critics {{as one of}} the best films of 2008. The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for Shanley's script. Ebert, who awarded the film the full four stars, highlighted Streep's caricature of a nun, who [...] "hates all inroads of the modern world", while Kelly Vance of The East Bay Express remarked: [...] "It's thrilling to see a pro like Streep step into an already wildly exaggerated role and then ramp it up a few notches just for the sheer <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Grim, red-eyed, deathly pale Sister Aloysius may be the scariest nun of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very true," [...] I answered. [...] "And {{that is the}} perfectest <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> John Barleycorn makes toward death. That is why I {{voted for}} the {{amendment}} to-day. I read back {{in my life and}} saw how the accessibility of alcohol had given me the taste for it. You see, comparatively few alcoholics are born in a generation. And by alcoholic I mean a man whose chemistry craves alcohol and drives him resistlessly to it. The great majority of habitual drinkers are born not only without desire for alcohol, but with actual repugnance toward it. Not the first, nor the twentieth, nor the hundredth drink, succeeded in giving them the liking. But they learned, just as men learn to smoke; though it is far easier to learn to smoke than to learn to drink. They learned because alcohol was so accessible. The women know the game. They pay for it--the wives and sisters and mothers. And when they come to vote, they will vote for prohibition. And the best of it {{is that there will be}} no hardship worked on the coming generation. Not having access to alcohol, not being predisposed toward alcohol, it will never miss alcohol. It will mean life more abundant for the manhood of the young boys born and growing up--ay, and life more abundant for the young girls born and growing up to share the lives of the young men." ...|$|E
