40|$|Seed shriveling in the {{man-made}} intergeneric hybrid, triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) {{appears to}} be related to increased activity of endosperm acid phosphatases including para-nitrophenyl phosphatase, ATPase, ADPase, phosphatidic phosphatase, and glucose- 1 -phosphatase that occur specifically at later stages of seed development. These hydrolases may reduce endogenous substrates for starch synthesis, deplete energy supply for maintenance and biosynthesis of tissue growth, and <b>deassemble</b> membrane structures resulting in a partially filled endosperm and localized necrosis. Electrophoretic isozyme patterns of endosperm acid phosphatase exhibited distinctive differences between lines producing plump and shriveled seeds indicating a divergent role of the isozymes in these two different seed conformations...|$|E
50|$|As {{the main}} {{instrument}} of the observatory, an astrograph was ordered to Carl Zeiss Jena in Germany on December 11, 1935. The instrument arrived in Istanbul <b>deassembled</b> in twelve pieces on September 25, 1936, and was installed in the observatory's dome. The facility started its observations {{in the fall of}} 1936. It is the first modern observatory of Turkey.|$|R
40|$|Software {{protection}} is important problem of nowaday. In 2009 the piracy rate reaches 43 % of all globe softwares usage, especialy high piracy rate is in Eastern Europe, where 64 % of softwares are illegal. This brings hardware-based protection {{to be one}} of the prime defense against illegal software usage. The analysis of hardware-based software protection showed that the weakest part of hardware-based {{protection is}} communication with software, so dongle method, which computes part of the software inside dongle, could withstand most of reverse engineer attack methods. To prove this Matlab model of distributed dongle-based protection scheme was created and its experimental evaluation showed, that suggested software protection model is resistant against <b>deassembling,</b> debbuging and software cloning attacks. Equally, experimental distributed computing protection dongle prototype was created and tested with two experimental programs against <b>deassembling,</b> debbuging, decompilation and software cloning attacks. This shows that attackers can find calls to the dongle, but can not jump or nop it, such it was done in experimental software protected with traditional commercial dongle...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm which has {{enabled us to}} give a complete list, without repetitions, of all closed oriented irreducible 3 -manifolds of complexity up to 9. More interestingly, we have actually {{been able to give}} a "name" to each such manifold, by recognizing its canonical decomposition into Seifert fibred spaces and hyperbolic manifolds. The algorithm relies on the extension of Matveev's theory of complexity to the case of manifolds bounded by suitably marked tori, and on the notion of assembling of two such manifolds. We show that every manifold is an assembling of manifolds which cannot be further <b>deassembled,</b> and we prove that there are surprisingly few such manifolds up to complexity 9. Our most interesting experimental discovery is the following: there are 4 hyperbolic manifolds having complexity 9, and they turn out to be precisely the 4 closed hyperbolic manifolds of least known volume. All other manifolds having complexity at most 9 are graph manifolds. Comment: 49 pages, 32 figures. This is a revised version of math. GT/ 0005104, accepted for publication in Experimental Mathematics. The main improvement is an intrinsic definition of "brick", in terms of manifolds rather than in terms of spines, and an extension of Matveev's complexity to manifolds bounded by suitably marked tor...|$|R
40|$|Biomolecular and {{artificial}} receptors are typically designed {{to exploit the}} hydrophobic effect {{in order to enhance}} the stability of receptor−ligand complexes in water. For example, artificial receptors are often built around hydrophobic cavities. These receptors exploit the hydrophobic effect toward ligand recognition, but the structure of the binding site requires a rigid framework to overcome the hydrophobic effect-driven tendency to collapse. Here we present an artificial receptor that exploits the hydrophobic effect to define its structure in water. The receptor is based on amphiphilic building blocks that assemble into micelle-like aggregates of a very high stability, attributed to the unusual shape of the amphiphile: a relatively rigid molecule composed of a large hydrophobic segment, based on the cholesterol molecule, and a very large headgroup build around a Zn-metalloporphyrin moiety. The assemblies, persistent down to the nanomolar range, are better described as self-assembled nanoparticles. Within the nanoparticle−water interface, Zn-metalloporphyrin moieties form multiple binding sites that specifically bind ligands bearing basic nitrogen atoms. The nanoparticles show enhanced binding affinity relative to a model receptor that does not self-assemble. Structurally related ligands show a correlation between the enhancement of binding and the octanol/water partition coefficient, log P, suggesting that the desolvation of binding sites is the main driving force for the enhancement of binding affinity at the nanoparticle−water interface. In addition, the highest affinity observed for the ditopic ligands relative to the monotopic ligands is evidence of a multivalent effect operating within this type of receptors. The nanoparticle readily <b>deassembles</b> upon addition of water-miscible organic solvents, such as methanol, or in the presence of detergents. This approach toward self-assembled receptors can be easily adapted to the development of differential receptors by the simple expedient of mixing slightly different amphiphiles (i. e., different metals in the porphyrin ring for the amphiphiles described here) in variable proportions...|$|R
