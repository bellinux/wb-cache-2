Cars listed on 'black lists' (no insurance, stolen, etc.) generate an alarm in the <b>dispatching</b> <b>room,</b> {{so they can be}} intercepted by a patrol.As of early 2012, 1 million cars per week are automatically checked in this way.|$|E
50|$|The city of Mechelen uses ANPR cameras since September 2011 {{to check}} all inbound and {{outbound}} cars against {{a database of}} stolen, non-insured and cars listed for other reasons. In case of a positive match, an alarm is generated in the <b>dispatching</b> <b>room,</b> enabling the police to quickly intercept the car. Mechelen {{was one of the}} first cities in Belgium to use ANPR on this scale. As of early 2012, 1 million cars per week are checked in this way. Mechelen started this project with SAIT Zenitel.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith the {{construction}} of integrated automated mining monitoring system and its platform, the monitoring data of great capacity from different subsystems were converged in the <b>dispatching</b> <b>room.</b> A high-speed response linkage model for integrated automated monitoring system at coal mine was proposed. In this model, the monitoring data from different subsystems were analyzed intelligently by building the data storage and linkage rules. Also, the uniform dada exchanging formats and data processing mechanism were defined to share monitoring data between different subsystems for united alarms, which provide coal mine with an efficient intelligent dispatching and decision-making method. The simulation results show that this model can meet the demand of high-speed response linkage for integrated monitoring system at coal mine...|$|E

40|$|Chapter I briefly {{describes}} the general research projected {{in the original}} technical proposal to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The initial theoretical model advanced is set fourth, {{as well as a}} description of the laboratory facilities being used. This chapter draws heavily from an internal DRC staff memorandum by Drabek, a theoretical article by Drabek, Haas, Quarantelli and Dynes, and a descriptive brochure by Roth. The original pilot study conducted by DRC in the laboratory is discussed in Chapter II. Observations made of behavioral changes in small groups in high demand situations are reported. This chapter is based on much longer draft report prepared by Mrs. Elaine Hobart, a DRC research assistant, which is intended to be the basis for an article in a professional journal. Chapter III {{describes the}} major laboratory research conducted during the whole course of the project, a realistic simulation of an actual police <b>dispatching</b> <b>room.</b> Emphasis is given to the methodology of this unique study, although some substantive findings are also noted. This discussion primarily although selectively summarized the writings of Drabek on the study, including his dissertation, a monograph, several papers and two articles. The next chapter discusses the highlights of a second major laboratory simulation conducted by DRC. Undertaken by Muzzy as part of his dissertation work, the experiment attempted a quantitative test of some hypotheses drawn from a refined version of the original theoretical model used. Preliminary findings are presented. Air Force Office of Scientific Researc...|$|E

50|$|Management of the {{monorail}} {{line can}} be carried out automatically from the computer control room located in the Bauman train depot. Also at each station there are Station <b>Dispatch</b> <b>rooms,</b> so that rolling stock can be controlled remotely from the station. Currently, the monorail trains operate in a semiautomatic mode, where the electronic system controls the trains. There is also a manual mode in which the operator at the depot controls the trains. The monorail is powered by seven substations, one for each station and one for the depot.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to web search {{that is based on}} a bee hive metaphor is presented. We proposed a modified model of a bee hive. Our model comprises of a dance floor, an auditorium, and a <b>dispatch</b> <b>room.</b> We have shown that the model is a true model of a bee hive in the sense it simulates several kinds of its typical behaviour. However, more importantly it is a simple model that describes some processes taking place in web search. Our model incorporates also several kinds of uncertainty. Experiments show that uncertainty increases robustness of the search and makes it actually more efficient...|$|R

50|$|The Royal Cayman Islands Police Service (RCIPS) {{provides}} {{law enforcement}} {{for the three}} islands. Regular off-shore marine and air patrols are conducted by the RCIP using a small fleet of vessels and a helicopter. Grand Cayman is a port of call for Britain's Royal Navy and the United States Coast Guard who often assist with sea rescues when their resources are in the Cayman Islands area. The Cayman Islands Fire Service provides fire prevention, fire fighting and rescue. Its headquarters are in George Town and has substations in Frank Sound, West Bay, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Emergency Medical Services are provided by paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians using ambulances based in George Town, West Bay and North Side in Grand Cayman and in Cayman Brac. EMS is managed by the Government's Health Services Authority.Access to Emergency Services is available using 9-1-1, the Emergency telephone number, the same number as is used in Canada and the United States. The Cayman Islands Department of Public Safety's Communications Centre processes 9-1-1 and non-emergency law enforcement, EMS, fire, and Search and Rescue calls for all three islands. The Communications Centre dispatches RCIP and EMS units directly however, the Cayman Islands Fire Service maintains their own <b>dispatch</b> <b>room</b> at the airport fire station.|$|R

50|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} the marble-walled lobby, flanked by terra cotta fountains, which has stained glass clerestory windows and ceramic tile flooring. In {{the vicinity of}} the lobby desk are a check <b>room,</b> attendant <b>dispatch</b> <b>room,</b> and elevators. The north and central portions of the building house the men's facilities: cooling room, pack room, steam room, hydrotherapy room, and bath hall. The women's facilities, considerably smaller in size, are {{at the south end of}} the building. Originally there was a 30 tub capacity. Although the men's and women's bath halls both have stained glass windows in aquatic motifs, the most impressive stained glass is the massive skylight in the men's area, with the DeSoto fountain centered on the floor directly below it. The second floor originally had dressing rooms, lockers, cooling rooms, and massage and mechano-therapy departments; now it is largely occupied by wood changing stalls, with entry to a centrally located quarry-tile courtyard for sunbathing. The third floor houses a massive ceramic-tiled Hubbard Currence therapeutic tub (a full body immersion whirlpool installed in 1938 when other hydrotherapeutic pools were also added), areas for men' s and women' s parlors, and a wood panelled gymnasium to the rear. The most impressive space on the third floor is the assembly room (now museum) where the segmentally arched vaults of the ceiling are filled in with arched, stained glass skylights. Arched wood-frame doors surrounded by fanlights and sidelights open out to the small balconies of the front elevation. The basement houses various mechanical equipment, a bowling alley (since removed), and the Fordyce spring - a glazed tile room with an arched ceiling and a plate glass window covering over the natural hot spring (spring number 46).|$|R
40|$|With the {{uncertainty}} of light rail for public transportation in the USA, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a growing trend. The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) has been in operation since 1983, and functions as a Regional Transportation Authority. RFTA is the second largest public transit system in Colorado, after Denver Rapid Transit Delivery (RTD). RFTA is also the largest rural public transit system the United States of America (USA) and BRT VelociRFTA is the first Rural Bus Rapid Transit system in the USA. Results are positive for rider satisfaction and bus and bus station safety and comfort from a recent customer survey of RFTA’s VelociRFTA Bus Rapid Transit Program service and amenities. Ridership is up 22 % for RFTA overall from 2013 {{with the introduction of}} the VelociRFTA BRT in the fall of 2013. Survey results will assist in training, productivity, well-being and sustainability for the existing and future RFTA programs.

40|$|Demand for concrete, {{regardless}} of the geographical location, is increasing globally. While the Ready Mixed Concrete (RMC) industry is facing an ever-increasing demand for concrete, and although concrete is mostly mixed automatically by machines, the allocation of resources remains labour intensive and is mostly handled by experts in RMC <b>dispatching</b> <b>rooms.</b> This thesis introduces a new method for the automatic planning of concrete delivery dispatching. This method uses machine learning to characterises an expert decision making process. Seven supervised machine learning versions with their boosted algorithms are selected for this purpose and tested with field data. Random-Forest outperforms the other selected algorithms. An method is developed to check the feasibility of misclassified deliveries and {{the results show that}} around 30 % of misclassified solutions are achievable. In this thesis the Ready Mixed Concrete Dispatching Problem (RMCDP) with/without time window is mathematically modelled and used for assessing the quality of experts’ decisions as well as the quality of solutions obtained by machine learning algorithms (Random-Forest). As empirically proved in this thesis, obtaining exact solutions for large scale RMCDPs with available computing facilities is intractable and characterized as NP-hard. Two heuristic methods (Robust-GA and Sequential-GA) are developed to find a near optimum solution {{in the absence of an}} exact solution. Four RMCDPs are selected for evaluating the available methods. The results show that Sequential-GA converges 10 times faster than Robust-GA with achieved solutions at 30 % less cost. Also, although there is around 10 % gap between solutions obtained by Sequential-GA and the optimum solution, the computing time of Sequential-GA is 100 times less than when using the optimization approach. Thus, the best solutions for all 4 test RMCDPs are obtained by comparing the exact solutions (IP and MIP) and Robust-GA and Sequential-GA. Comparing the best solution with the experts’ decisions reveals that the decisions made by experts are near optimum with an 90 % of optimality. The accuracy of the machine learning approach is slightly better than the experts’ decisions and Sequential-GA, however, the computing time for the machine learning based method is significantly lower than for the available approaches. This supports the potential of using machine learning techniques in practical Ready Mixed Concrete Dispatching Problems...|$|R
50|$|In 1996, the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps {{relocated}} to a new, more modern and much larger ambulance station located at 40 Embry Place.

40|$|With {{the number}} of {{non-human}} devices expected to significantly overtake human users of LTE networks, {{it is no surprise}} that First Responders in Mission Critical operations will need to interact with an increasing number of unmanned devices, “bots” or drones. In the paper we propose the Mission Critical “bot” concept as an entity capable of gathering environmental/situational information and triggering certain automated actions without the need of human intervention. We prove that in certain circumstances these bots can help quickly resolve emergency situations and complement traditional centralized coordination from <b>Dispatch</b> Control <b>Rooms.</b> We explain how such “bots” relate and expand the 3 GPP Mission Critical Communications architecture framework, considering different architectural approaches and complexity levels. Importantly, because First Responders must remain focused, hands-free and context-aware most of the time, we cover specifically the case where man-machine interaction is based on voice communication without having to use hands or look at a screen. It is hence of particular interest to convert “bot” interactions into audio information exchanged over push-to-talk communication services, be it through the cellular network or leveraging the 3 GPP device-to-device capability. The paper is complemented with theoretical use cases as well as description and multimedia material of a prototype implementation of a concept emulator.
