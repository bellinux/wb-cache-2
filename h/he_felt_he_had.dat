5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses. When she was a yearling, she was sold by her owner, although he had not really planned on selling her. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to because one of his employees had told a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to join a faction as a hired gun, although it {{put him on the}} wrong side of the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E

60|$|Here Mr. Dodge laughed; for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> got {{the best}} of it.|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed a}} little uneasily. In some vague way <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> displeased her.|$|R
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{the core of his}} expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become a journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his}} career with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> retired too early, and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.|$|E
60|$|But {{the more}} he thought of it, the more sorry <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met George Purvis.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{done all}} {{that a patient}} and {{reasonable}} husband could do. Now--things must take their course.|$|R
60|$|Urmston laughed, though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been favoured with a hint. Mrs. Annersly, however, {{had more}} to say.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} its last album, in November 2008, Guns N' Roses {{released}} Chinese Democracy exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose did {{not contribute to the}} album's promotion; by December, he had reportedly been missing for at least two months and had not returned phone calls or other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album's release, in December 2009, Guns N' Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4. Rose was subsequently sued by former band manager Irving Azoff, who sought $1.87million in unpaid fees related to the tour. In a countersuit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and their album's promotion to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement dictated that Rose and the current Guns N' Roses had to do a number of performances with Azoff's company Live Nation as the promoter.|$|E
5|$|While {{he was in}} Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw {{an unnamed}} dried specimen, {{collected}} by André Michaux, and named it Shortia galacifolia. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but {{did not know what}} it was. Eighteen months later the collector sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found Shortia. Gray was ecstatic to confirm this when he saw the specimen in October 1878. In spring 1879 Gray led an expedition, in which the collector helped, to the spot where S.galacifolia had been found. Gray never saw the species in the wild in bloom, but made a final trip to this region in 1884.|$|E

25|$|In 1846, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns {{revisited}} Vienna, {{traveling to}} Prague and Berlin {{in the spring}} of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrest of}} the Fryes {{and the ensuing}} riots are {{referenced}} by the character George Hutchence in the second volume of the comics miniseries Jupiter's Circle, {{as an example of}} the class struggle that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been perpetuating as a superhero, and which prompted him to give up that life.|$|E
25|$|In 1588 one Elizabethian loyalist {{cited the}} failed {{invasion}} of England by the Spanish Armada {{as an attempt}} by Philip II of Spain to put into effect the Pope's decree. In truth, King Philip II was attempting to claim the throne of England <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{as a result of}} being the widower of Mary I of England.|$|E

25|$|Surrealism helped Carpentier to see {{contexts}} and aspects, {{especially those of}} American life, {{which he did not}} see before and after working among the leading artistic figures for some time, Carpentier did not feel overly enthusiastic about his work within surrealism and had felt that his “surrealist attempts ha been in vain” describing his frustration, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> “nothing to add to this movement in France".|$|E
25|$|In August 1937 {{he went to}} Singapore under a fake Chinese {{identity}} and became a teacher. After the Dutch surrendered to Japan he returned to Indonesia via Penang. He then sailed to Sumatra arriving in Jakarta in mid-1942, where he wrote Madilog. After <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to have a job, he applied to Social Welfare Agency and was soon sent to a coal mine in Bayah, on southern coast of West Java.|$|E
25|$|In the post-fight interview, Rampage {{expressed}} that the fairest {{thing would be}} to offer Machida an immediate rematch, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost the fight. Five of 7 media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida. However, since UFC President Dana White personally felt that Rampage won the fight, he denied {{the possibility of an}} immediate rematch. This generated some controversy, as White had previously awarded an immediate rematch to Rua in spite of a unanimous judgment decision awarded to Machida in that fight.|$|E

25|$|Gurney was {{particularly}} noted for an exceptionally fluid driving style. On rare occasions, as when his car fell behind with minor mechanical troubles and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> nothing to lose, he would abandon his classic technique and {{adopt a more}} aggressive (and riskier) style. This circumstance produced what many observers consider the finest driving performance of his career, when a punctured tire put him nearly two laps down halfway through the 1967 Rex Mays 300 Indycar race at Riverside, California. He produced an inspired effort, made up the deficit and won the race with a dramatic last-lap pass of runner-up Bobby Unser.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Al-Zahawi {{moved to}} London {{to begin his}} {{post-graduate}} studies at the University College London in international relations. It was in London that Al-Zahawi decided to devote time to nurture his creative passions by simultaneously enrolling at London’s Central School of Art and Design. At the Central School of Art, he began to devote his time to understanding terracotta ceramic sculptures, where he selected the coiling method. Through coiling, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> complete control over the power evoked from his sculptures, {{which could not be}} achieved by the pinching method or throwing on a mechanical wheel.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, he crashed his Lotus heavily {{during the}} Glover Trophy at Goodwood held on Monday 23 April. The {{accident}} {{put him in}} a coma for a month, and for six months {{the left side of his}} body was partially paralysed. He recovered, but retired from professional racing after a private test session in a Lotus 19 the following year, when he lapped a few tenths of a second slower than before. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not regained his previously instinctive command of the car. He had been runner-up in the Drivers' Championship four years in succession, from 1955 to 1958, and third in each of the next three years.|$|E
