Comparisons show that the Weber-Schalm method more accurately measures conjugated bilirubin concen#{ 149 } trations in serum in which the bilirubin is mostly conjugated, but that it gives falsely high values for unconjugated bilirubin in serum in which more of the bilirubin is in the unconjugated form.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial and toxicological effects of aqueous garlic (Allium sativum) bulbs extract in wister rat using biochemical and hematological parameters.

Results: Garlic bulbs extract produced significant inhibitory activities against all bacteria tested at concentrations of 120 and 160  mg/mL.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{operational}} impact of using vanadate oxidase versus diazo <b>direct</b> <b>bilirubin</b> assays for an academic medical center patient population. Design and methods: Retrospective study was done over an approximately 3. 5 year period. The main automated chemistry instrumentation was a Roche Diagnostics cobas 8000 line. The Roche <b>Direct</b> <b>Bilirubin</b> assay was compared to Diazyme Laboratories <b>Direct</b> <b>Bilirubin</b> Assay and Randox Laboratories <b>Direct</b> <b>Bilirubin</b> assay using manufacturer's guidelines for hemolysis index, lipemia index, and analytical measurement range (AMR). Results: Retrospective data was analyzed for 47, 333 serum/plasma specimens that had clinical orders for <b>direct</b> <b>bilirubin.</b> A total of 5943 specimens (12. 6 %) exceeded the hemolysis index limit for the Roche method compared to only 0. 2 % and 0. 05 % of specimens for the Diazyme and Randox methods, respectively. The impact was particularly large on patients less than 2 years old, for which 51. 3 % of specimens exceeded the hemolysis index for the Roche method. A total of 1671 specimens (3. 5 %) exceeded the lipemia index limit for the Roche method compared to less than 0. 1 % for the Randox method.
