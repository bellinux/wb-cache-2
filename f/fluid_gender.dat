And, this gendered, hetero-normative context is often {{believed}} to be a biological, natural state of identity (understanding gender, sex, and sexuality as fixed characteristics that manifest in an “activation” of these characteristics, femininity within queer persons who do not identify with a gender (i.e. gender <b>fluid,</b> <b>gender</b> non-conforming, gender-queer, etc.) is still understood on a gendered basis. This creates a marginalization of such queer individuals, and consequently limits the freedom of expression within the queer community. The fluidity and multiplicity of feminine (and masculine) embodiment is not understood as an adequately complex, non-traditional or permanent means of expression of identity through one’s lived experiences.|$|E

5000|$|Due to Xavin often {{changing}} {{through their}} three main forms, (human female, human male, and true Skrull form) both characters within the series and fans question {{the nature of}} their gender. As a Skrull, a race of shapeshifters, Xavin stated [...] "for us, just changing our gender is no different than changing our hair color", implying that Skrulls have <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> identities. When asked by Molly about why they don't stay in female form all the time, Xavin replied that it was simply their nature to do so and doesn't see a problem in it, though it causes Xavin to start questioning their own nature. Although Karolina does truly love Xavin, even so much as to deny Xavin disguised as Nico, she does become depressed when Nico questions Xavin's true gender. In Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways, Xavin is mostly male, but female briefly. In vol. 3, #1, Xavin is only male, but in vol. 3 #2, Xavin is only female. Karolina is fixed on the idea that Xavin is female, and that Xavin isn't pretending to be a woman, just learning to be human. During an argument with Karolina, Xavin loses control and changes form into their female form, and Karolina takes that to mean Xavin's true form is a female. [...] However, on his blog, the artist Humberto Ramos notes that he was instructed to draw Xavin taking different genders depending on the situation, even when not plot-necessary.|$|E

50|$|Rosemary A. Joyce {{was born}} in 1956. She is an American {{professor}} of anthropology at UC Berkeley. She has conducted social archaeology in Honduras since 1977, focusing on analysis of households, ceramics and the cultural roles of sex and gender which are found in both the material remains and physical remains of Mesoamerican societies. Central America and Mexico were regions where sexuality and gender in ancient societies began being studied in the 1960s. Iconography showed that women had held positions of power in society even though men were more often portrayed than women. Joyce has stated that artistic works show that young males were often subjects being viewed by both men and women, which indicates a more <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> spectrum. In a comparative study conducted in tandem with Lynn Meskell, who has done similar studies on ancient Egyptian society, Joyce and Meskell contrast Maya civilization and that of the New Kingdom of Egypt. On the one hand, both societies existed before Plato's concept in dualism—the mind and body are separate—entered into acceptance. Also in both cultures, the archaeological remains tend to be objects, writings, and images of elite males. Both were phallic cultures but in Egyptian imagery the penis is exaggerated and perfect male bodies are the subject of female adoration. In the Mayan culture, penile imagery is also exaggerated, but typically the phallus is hidden, but highlighted, and offered by a young male to the gaze a politically dominant male. Egyptian women appear to be sexualized, even as girls, indicating no demarcation between childhood and adulthood, but Mayan women appear as unsexualized beings and are usually draped unless suckling an infant. Thus studies can give insight not only into how ancient worlds viewed sexuality and gender roles but how objects they used might have been used differently. Spiritual practices also show the concepts of sexuality and gender were different in pre-conquest Mesoamerica, as throughout the region deities, like the Mayan corn or moon gods, had both male and female attributes.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{writers like}} Djuna Barnes {{allow for the}} post-modern {{fluidity}} and explosion of sex and gender without finalizing either in a fixed form. Whereas the classical, archetypal androgyne {{is made up of}} two halves, one man and one woman; the deconstructed androgynous figure is not constituted of oppositional terms which would reflect an essential and unimpeachable truth. I reveal the way Djuna Barnes’ Nightwood not only thematizes the fluid androgyne, but also cleverly verbalizes David Wood’s perpetual and un-dischargable “debt” to extra-discursivity while poetically critiquing gender “appropriateness,” societal constraints, and the constitution of identity. Barnes presents a decentralized, ungrounded and non-prescribed world in Nightwood not only through her cross-dressing and androgynous characters, but also in her poetics, her assertion of the open-ended quality of language, and a strong imperative to negotiate our physical existence in a world of <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> and sexual boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Social stigma against gender diverse people {{continues}} to exist (Rieger 2 ̆ 6 Savin-Williams, 2012), and this extends to gender nonconforming youth (D’Augelli, Grossman, 2 ̆ 6 Starks, 2006). Expression and exploration of <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> identity and gender roles {{are part of}} typical human development (Institute of Medicine, 2011).

40|$|This {{essay will}} discuss Ernest Hemingway's Islands in the Stream, posthumously {{published}} 1970, focusing in particular {{on the importance}} of the protagonist's <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> identity and interest in queer sexuality. Central to my discussion is queer theorist Judith Butler's view of gender as something performed and contextual and her objection to the binary of man and woman. I will argue that the issues of gender identity and queer forms of sexuality are ever-present throughout the novel, and that in the protagonist Thomas Hudson, Hemingway presents a different hero in comparison to the hardboiled macho-man he has been claimed to glorify in his work. My thesis is that the protagonist's denial of his ambiguous gender identity and his interest in queer sexualitey are the underlying causes {{for the development of the}} plot. The novel will be discussed in relation to the thesis in chronological order: first, it examines the protagonist's detachment and separation from his sons; second, his difficulties to sustain any longer relationships with women, and third, why he never dares to trust the people who say they love him...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we discuss how gender {{relations}} are influenced by a 'girls only' martial arts-based sport, gender and development (SGD) programme that aims to improve young women's discipline, leadership skills and self-defence capabilities in a rural Ugandan community with widespread domestic and gender-based violence (GBV). The results of our qualitative research with a Ugandan non-governmental organization (NGO) staff members and martial arts instructors demonstrate that the young women's participation in the martial arts programme challenged gender norms and improved their confidence. However, the exclusion of boys and men from the programming, combined with the cultural inaptness of girls practicing martial arts, {{may have contributed to}} the girls' subordination. Our data also revealed that young men were also the targets of GBV. Overall, we argue that an exploration of the relational impact of gender in the context of SGD, and sport for development and peace terrain more broadly is necessary in order to: (1) understand how social relations shift and change in the face of variable and <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> dynamics; and (2) challenge gendered assumptions about prescribed/predetermined gender relations by acknowledging that young women may not be the only targets of violence...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the limitations of}} societal gender norms and expectations of the late nineteenth-century and how the fictional character Ántonia Shimerda adheres to and fails to conform to them. In nineteenth-century America {{men and women were}} divided into two different spheres. Women were expected to stay within the four walls of the home and take care of cooking, housekeeping and raising the family’s children. The home was believed to be the only place where a woman could be truly happy. However, in the novel Ántonia proves that women can be happy performing physically demanding tasks outside of the expected sphere for women. To explore Ántonia’s gender fluidity this essay focuses on gender expectations and norms in the historical setting of the novel and analyzes the reasons for her to abandon her gender and the consequences this has in her life. The representation of a character that both adheres to and fails to conform to the nineteenth-century gender perceptions indicates the performative nature of gender. Cather creates a <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> in Ántonia, who proves to be both an independent and strong character that clearly illustrates the limitations of rigid gender norms...|$|E

40|$|Using for {{the most}} part Kleinian analysis, this article {{presents}} Abdellah Taïa’s latest novel Un pays pour mourir as a work of reparative mourning. It is divided in three parts: “Mourning the father,” “Melancholy gender and mourning,” and “Reparative work through characterization. ” The approach encompasses the sociology of the author and a blend of online interviews, social media, and fictional accounts of “family”. The article finds that it is not in (psycho) analysis but within the realm of writing the self/selves, and more specifically the multiple characters invented in the novel, that Taïa the author revisits the relationship with the father, his younger self, sets up a dialogue between his more <b>fluid</b> <b>gender</b> and his more rigid identity, between his younger and his older self, and tries to reach some kind of mutual understanding, on the way to possible reintegration. Taïa accomplishes what Klein sees as a journey of reconciliation since, for the psychoanalyst, it is by reinstating inside himself the “good” parents, and by rebuilding his inner world that the patient overcomes his grief. Taïa has achieved a Vita Nova in the sense used by Roland Barthes for this expression: the discovery of a new practice of writing...|$|E
40|$|What is gender diversity? Most people {{experience}} little doubt about their gender, seeing themselves as either male or female. For most individuals, their natal or assigned sex is congruent with their physical body and their gender identity. It {{is important to}} note, however, that many people question the idea that male and female exist on a binary or are fixed opposites. Theorists have suggested {{that it may be}} more appropriate to think of gender as lying on a continuum or having multiple categories. Others have proposed a position of gender transcendence, arguing that traits, behaviours, and roles should be divorced from gender altogether. It {{is important to remember that}} the idea of two opposite sexes may be a recent, Western idea. Recorded history includes many descriptions of people, from a range of cultures, who did not fit into the simple categories of male or female. In some cases these people were highly regarded and viewed as holy or as blessings to their families by virtue of their insight into both female and male worlds. Many terms have been offered to describe children and youth who challenge gender norms, including gender diverse, gender <b>fluid,</b> <b>gender</b> creative, and gender independent. There is an increasing shift by many to view childhood gender nonconformity and gender variance as part of human diversity and not a reflection of pathology or disorder (e. g., Pyne, 2014).
