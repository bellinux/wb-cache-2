5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
30|$|As a conclusion, {{it looks}} like ‘Super’ shops <b>get</b> <b>closed</b> {{if they have a}} lower degree of {{retention}} on their closest customers, while ‘Iper’ shops <b>get</b> <b>closed</b> if they have lower catch rates on non-closest customers. ‘Gestin’ shops are harder to describe.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, Jason's {{investigation}} into the Black Legion turns {{into one of the}} deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life: the pursuit of the leader of a murderous terrorist group with roots in the darkest days of World War II. During all of this Leonid Arkadin, who is just as talented as, but even more damaged than Bourne, is <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> by the minute. While Bourne thinks he is <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> to Arkadin, Arkadin thinks he's <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> to Bourne.|$|R
50|$|Sink flow is the {{opposite}} of source flow. The streamlines are radial, directed inwards to the line source. As we <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> to the sink, area of flow decreases. In order to satisfy the continuity equation, the streamlines <b>get</b> bunched <b>closer</b> and the velocity increases as we <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> to the source. As with source flow, the velocity at all points equidistant from the sink is equal.|$|R
5|$|Nancy {{then starts}} {{to think that}} Darren and Sienna are having an affair, and sleeps with Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham) and his father Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener). Things are {{eventually}} sorted between Darren and Nancy, however as their wedding <b>gets</b> <b>closer,</b> they start to argue again as Nancy believes that Darren is not taking the wedding seriously. Nancy sleeps with Rick again although the next morning she has regrets. On the night of her hen do, Nancy is attacked by Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) following an argument, and he attempts to rape her while wearing a mask. However, she is saved by Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill), and Darren and Nancy get remarried anyway. Finn is arrested and Darren stands by Nancy in court, however due to the DNA tests, Nancy is forced to admit her affair and that she slept with Rick within 24 hours before the attack. This creates more strife between Darren and Nancy; Darren sleeps with Sienna. Darren cannot forgive Nancy for her affair, they realise that married life has not been right {{for a long time}} and they agree to get divorced again. Darren offers to buy Nancy's half of The Dog In The Pond Pub in order to give her enough money to restart her life. The deed of transfer for The Dog has been signed and Darren is now the sole owner of The Dog In The Pond.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} manifestation of ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy is intention (action) tremor, which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements, such as tying shoe laces or writing with a pencil.

25|$|The {{current line}} scheme allows for peak-time service {{frequencies}} {{of less than}} 6 minutes in each direction on the Av. Tibidabo, Terrassa and Sabadell branches, and 4 minutes on the Reina Elisenda branch. The overall service frequency reduces as the line <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to central Barcelona, where the core route between Pl. Catalunya and Gràcia stations provides a headway of less than 2 minutes in each direction during rush hours. Thus, with up to 32 trains per hour in each direction, the Pl. Catalunya–Gràcia section of the Barcelona–Vallès Line is one of Europe's busiest commuter rail lines by number of operations together with RER line A in Paris or portions of the Berlin S-Bahn.|$|E

25|$|The route {{continues}} on, {{running along}} {{the east side of}} the cemetery and the west side of Highland Park as it crosses into a predominately residential section of Rochester known as the South Wedge. NY15 finally breaks from the linear alignment it had followed since southern Henrietta and gradually <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to the nearby Genesee River as it heads northward through the neighborhood; however, it makes a sharp turn to the east just south of downtown Rochester to meet South Avenue in the shadow of I-490 and the Inner Loop. Mount Hope Avenue ends here while NY15 continues east onto Byron Street, a one-block connector between South and South Clinton Avenues. At its east end, NY15 turns north onto a unidirectional section of Clinton Avenue, passing over I-490 and the Inner Loop before reaching its northern terminus at the intersection of South Clinton Avenue and Woodbury Boulevard (NY31) in downtown Rochester.|$|E
25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard {{is higher than the}} object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it <b>gets</b> <b>closer</b> to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E
