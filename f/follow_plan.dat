40|$|Goal {{recognition}} {{is generally considered}} to <b>follow</b> <b>plan</b> recognition. The plan recognition problem is typically deﬁned {{to be that of}} identifying which plan in a given library of plans is being executed, given a sequence of observed actions. Once a plan has been identiﬁed, the goal of the plan can be assumed to follow. In this work, we address the problem of goal recognition directly, without assuming a plan library. Instead, we start with a domain description, just as is used for plan construction, and a sequence of action observations. The task, then, is to identify which possible goal state is the ultimate destination of the trajectory being observed. We present a formalisation of the problem and motivate its interest, before describing some simplifying assumptions we have made to arrive at a ﬁrst implementation of a goal recognition system, AUTOGRAPH. We discuss the techniques employed in AUTOGRAPH to arrive at a tractable approximation of the goal recognition problem and show results for the system we have implemented...|$|E
40|$|Process 329 The {{fact that}} you are reading this chapter {{indicates}} that you are seri-ously interested in implementing an electronic health record (EHR) system. A survey conducted in solo and small group practices re-vealed an estimated initial cost of up to $ 44, 000 per fulltime FTE and with on-going costs of about $ 8500 per year for a typical installation (1). Aside from the dollar cost, there is a price to be paid in lost income, low morale, and simple frustration when an implementation goes sour. Getting your EHR system successfully implemented requires planning and attention to detail. This chapter offers an easy to <b>follow</b> <b>plan</b> and a few words of advice. Take Your Time and Study Your Practice There is no rush. You do {{not have to worry about}} being the last on your block to have an EHR. Prudence dictates that you assess your short- and long-term practice goals, current economic situation, employee skills and attitudes, and your ability to deal with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Talk to your accountant in order to determine how much you can afford to spend and what overall economic benefit you may expect from your EHR. In-creased productivity does not necessarily mean fewer staff FTEs. Along the same lines, how will you manage the slow-down that frequently occurs af-ter a new system is installed? How do your employees feel about an EHR? Will their fears of being replaced lead to destabilizing resignations? Finally, do you have the patience to see this through to the end? Addressing these issues takes time and thought. Don’t rush...|$|E
