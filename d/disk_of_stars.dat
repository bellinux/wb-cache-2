5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E

25|$|In the General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens (Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels) (1755), Kant {{laid out}} the Nebular hypothesis, in which he deduced that the Solar System formed from a large cloud of gas, a nebula.

50|$|Riccioli {{also used}} {{telescopic}} observations <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> {{to argue against}} the Copernican theory. Viewed through the small telescopes <b>of</b> his time, <b>stars</b> appeared as small but distinct disks. These disks were spurious - caused by the diffraction of waves of light entering the telescope. Today they are known as Airy disks, after the nineteenth-century astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801-1892). The real <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> are generally too tiny to be seen even {{with the best of}} modern telescopes. But during most of the seventeenth century it was thought that these disks seen in a telescope were the actual bodies <b>of</b> <b>stars.</b> In the Copernican theory, the stars had to lie at vast distances from Earth in order to explain why no annual parallax was seen among them. Riccioli and Grimaldi made numerous measurements <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>disks</b> using a telescope, providing a detailed description of their procedure so that anyone who wanted could replicate it. Riccioli then calculated the physical sizes that the measured stars would need to have in order for them both to be as far away as was required in the Copernican theory to show no parallax, and to have the sizes seen with the telescope. The result in all cases was that the stars were huge - dwarfing the sun. In some scenarios one single star would exceed the size of the entire universe as estimated by a geocentrist like Tycho Brahe. This problem that the appearance <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> in the telescope posed for the Copernican theory had been noted as early as 1614 by Simon Marius, who said telescopic observations <b>of</b> the <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> supported the Tychonic theory. The problem was acknowledged by Copernicans such as Martin van den Hove (1605-1639), who also measured the <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> <b>stars</b> and acknowledged that the issue <b>of</b> vast <b>star</b> sizes might lead people to reject the Copernican theory.|$|R

Secular growth may explain not only the most distinct nuclear disks such as those in NGC 4486 A but also some of the disky distortions that are commonly seen in elliptical galaxies.
