40|$|Premature {{ventricular}} contractions (PVCs) and non-sustained {{ventricular tachycardia}} (NSVT) are frequently encountered and a marker of electrocardiomyopathy. In some instances, they increase the risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death. While often associated with a primary cardiomyopathy, they have also been known to cause tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in patients without preceding structural heart disease. Medical therapy including beta-blockers and class III anti-arrhythmic agents can be effective while <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillators</b> (ICD) are indicated in certain patients. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the preferred, definitive treatment in those patients that improve with anti-arrhythmic therapy, have tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or have certain subtypes of PVCs/NSVT.

40|$|BackgroundSkin erosion is a dire {{complication}} of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> pacemakers and <b>defibrillators.</b> Classical treatments involve {{removal of the}} entire generator and lead systems, however, these may result in fatal complications. In this study, we present our experience with a simplified salvage technique for exposed <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> electronic devices (ICEDs) without removing the implanted device, {{in an attempt to}} reduce the risks and complication rates associated with this condition. MethodsThe records of 10 patients who experienced direct ICED exposure between January 2012 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The following surgical procedure was performed in all patients: removal of skin erosion and capsule, creation of a new pocket at least 1. 0 – 1. 5 cm inferior to its original position, migration of the ICED to the new pocket, and insertion of closed-suction drainage. Patients with gross local sepsis or septicemia were excluded from this study. ResultsSeven patients had cardiac pacemakers and the other 3 had <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillators.</b> The time from primary ICED placement to exposure ranged from 0. 3 to 151 months (mean, 29 months. Postoperative follow-up in this series ranged from 8 to 31 months (mean follow-up, 22 months). Among the 10 patients, none presented with any signs of overt infection or cutaneous lesions, except 1 patient with hematoma on postoperative day 5.

The use of <b>implantable</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>defibrillators</b> is the most effective treatment to prevent sudden cardiac death.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether genetic polymorphisms found in the ryanodine receptor type 2 (Q 2958 R) and histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (S 96 A) might serve as markers for arrhythmias. Genotyping was performed in 235 patients treated with defibrillator for primary and secondary prevention of arrhythmias. No significant association was found between the S 96 A polymorphism and arrhythmia onset, whereas the QQ 2958 genotype in the ryanodine receptor gene was correlated with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Concurrent stressor conditions, such as hypertension, seem to increase this effect. Our findings might help to better identify patients who could benefit from defibrillator implantation...|$|R
