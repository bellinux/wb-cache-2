40|$|UV {{absorbers}} and antioxidants topically {{applied to}} <b>upholstery</b> <b>fabrics</b> to reduce fading, separately and {{in conjunction with}} soil repellent finish formulations containing UV absorbers, were evaluated in this study. Over fifty <b>upholstery</b> <b>fabrics</b> were initially evaluated and fourteen were selected for further study. The fabrics were then topically treated with commercially available soil repellent finishes (a fluorocarbon and a silicone finish) containing UV absorbers or immersion-treated with one of thirteen UV absorbers or antioxidants. Following light exposure, color changes were evaluated visually and instrumentally. The results showed that neither the fluorocarbon nor silicone-based soil repellent finishes containing UV absorbers significantly reduced fading in the <b>upholstery</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Furthermore none of the UV absorbers and antioxidants applied to the <b>upholstery</b> <b>fabrics</b> improved lightfastness properties substantially, so they cannot be recommended as additives to soil repellent finish formulations...|$|R

50|$|Tata Indigo is a {{class of}} {{sub-compact}} and sedan cars manufactured by Indian automobile company Tata Motors. The first generation of the Indigo, which was launched in the Indian market in 2002, {{is based on the}} Tata Indica, a sub-compact hatchback. The two cars shared a similar design, while the Indigo had a higher wheelbase, a 450-litre trunk, and turbocharged-diesel and petrol engine options. The car received its first design refresh in 2006, giving it distinguishing features from the Indica, such as more upmarket double-barreled headlamps, front fog-lamps, more upmarket interiors with <b>fabric</b> <b>upholstery,</b> etc.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the opportunities of wider characterization of textile materials, <b>fabrics,</b> <b>upholstery</b> <b>fabrics,</b> fibers, yarns or others, which may accumulate electric charge. A non-contact way for electrostatic properties measurement based on affecting those materials by ions with {{positive or negative}} charge is described. The method allows to measure simultaneously the time dependences of the surface voltage and the electric charge during the charging process and the time dependences of the surface voltage during the discharging process. From the measured dependencies the following set of parameters was measured or calculated: the surface voltage limiting value, the surface voltage semi-decay time, the maximum deposited charge, the layer capacitance, {{the energy of the}} accumulated charge and others. The surface voltage distribution measurement method when the investigated textile material is affected by ion flux was also described. To verify the applicability of the proposed methods for characterization of textile materials {{in order to determine the}} above-mentioned parameters of cotton, linen, wool, viscose, acetate, polyester, polyester coated with polytetrafluoroethylene, a series of experiments were performed. The surface voltage distribution measurement method based on affecting textile materials by ions with positive charge was described and a surface voltage distribution of a polyester-cotton <b>upholstery</b> <b>fabric</b> produced by a Jacquard mechanism was presented. The performed experiments demonstrate the possibilities of method application for comparison of the electrostatic properties of different textile materials used for the same tasks or the same materials produced by different technological processes.

Front seats received head restraints and <b>fabric</b> <b>upholstery.</b> In March 2000, Maruti introduced the 16-Valve MPFI G13BB engine and power was increased to [...] The MPFI Gypsy King received a brake booster as well.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} Tata Indigo {{was launched in}} 2002, and was largely based on the Indica. The two cars shared a majority of their parts. The Indigo had a greater wheelbase than the Indica, to hold the more acute-angled C-pillar, and the trunk. The front bumper had housing for fog-lamps, a feature which the Indica lacked at the time. While the Indica featured a 1.4L 55 HP diesel engine, the Indigo featured its turbocharged variant, which produced 68 HP of maximum power. The car was also offered with a 1.2L 4-cylinder MPFI petrol (gasoline) engine, which put out 68 HP of power. The interiors of the Indigo featured a few exclusives over the Indica, such as HVAC on all variants, power-windows for all doors on the top-variant, and <b>fabric</b> <b>upholstery</b> on all variants. The acute angle of the C-pillar, compared to the Indica, meant that the Indigo lacked a rear windshield wiper. A minor design refresh in 2004 introduced a new 1.4L TDI turbocharged diesel engine (not related to the similarly-named TDI family of diesel engines by Volkswagen).|$|E
