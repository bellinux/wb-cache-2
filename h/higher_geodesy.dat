The first period deals with mechanics, higher mathematics and with its applications to theory of machines. The second period deals with astronomy and <b>higher</b> <b>geodesy.</b> He derives the formula for the length of a mathematical seconds pendulum at any place on the Earth, compares it with that of Laplace and corrects de Prony's formula for the length of physical seconds pendulum. He determined the flattening of the Earth by finding formula's for 1) radius of the circle that passes through a point on Earth's surface and is parallel to the equator, 2) distance of the center of this circle {{from the center of the}} Earth, 3) meridian radius curvature at any point on Earth's surface, 4) size of one meridian degree, 5) the angle between the radius of the Earth at the equator and at some other point on Earth's surface, 6) the length of the quarter meridian, 7) the length of the meridian arc, 8) surface of Earth's zone between any two parallels.|$|E

50|$|As many {{publication}} {{in that era}} the ‘’Stieler’’ was published in issues. In fact this way of publishing was kept up {{for most of the}} Perthes’ atlases until the publication of the ‘Stielers International Atlas’. In 1823 the preliminary edition in 4 issues was completed and contained 50 maps. The demand for the atlas so outnumbered the amount of copies produced that during the publishing in 1816-23 the first issues were already updated and sold. Therefore, it is possible that hardly any of the atlases produced in this time contains all issues that were printed as first edition. That the atlas sold so well may have been caused also by its relative small size of 35x29 cm, which made it quite handy.Most maps carry the now somewhat curious scales of 1:3,700,000, 1:925,000 and 1:850,000. Stieler used as basic unit for scale the French toise, that became an international standard in <b>higher</b> <b>geodesy,</b> because of the French-Spanish map grid survey in Peru.The planning was such, that the first edition of the atlas would be accompanied by a textbook. This was published, however, only in 1840/46. While the preliminary edition was still being published Friedrich von Stülpnagel (1786-1865), who also was responsible for the 2nd and 3rd edition, already was revising the maps for the next edition.The first official edition of 1833 contained 75 maps. Through the years the amount of maps would increase and the final edition of 1925-1945 contained 254 main and auxiliary maps on 188 leaves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ocean tide}} {{can cause the}} {{redistribution}} of the seawater mass, resulting in earth's surface deformation, namely ocean tidal loading (OTL). OTL vertical displacement may reach several centimeters, especially in coastal areas, so its effect {{in the field of}} <b>high</b> precision <b>geodesy</b> must be considered. This study concentrates on the influences of OTL on InSAR deformation measurements. We improve the osu. chinasea. 2010 regional model and then compare the improved regional model with other regional models. It turns out that the improved regional model can achieve higher precision. Then we use it to replace the offshore part of the global model to generate the present model. We find that the displacement observed by the present model is 2 – 3  mm larger than that of other models on some sites. Finally, the present model is used to correct the deformation observed by InSAR of Shanghai and Los Angeles. A comparison between the displacements of IGS station with the corrected data shows that the OTL correction can improve the accuracy of InSAR deformation results by about 20 %...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the <b>Higher</b> <b>Geodesy</b> Laboratory of NTU and the Seismology Department of the Institut de Physique A Globe de Paris have {{carried out a}} {{research}} program concerning {{the evaluation of the}} tectonic behaviour of the Gulf of Corinth, in Greece, based on geodetic data. The area being one of the densely populated, seismically active parts of Greece, was considered suitable for monitoring deformations. Aus, a geodetic GPS control network of 193 points, spread over a broad area (of about 10 000 km(2)) {{on both sides of the}} Gulf, was established within seven years. During this period several points were re-occupied. Thus the GPS data acquired are sparse both in space and time. In order to estimate the deformation over longer periods of time 142 of the network points were chosen to belong to the Hellenic triangulation network. In the present paper, statistically acceptable strain parameters are evaluated via a multi-epoch deformation model using GPS data alone as well as in combination with positional information from old geodetic surveys...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Laserscanners {{have so far}} not {{frequently}} been used for <b>high</b> precision engineering <b>geodesy</b> measurement tasks, such as deformation monitoring, since the technical specifications of most laserscanners do not fulfil the accuracy requirements in such applications. The paper describes methods which allow {{for the use of}} laserscanners in this field. The methods are based on the analysis of highly redundant unstructured point clouds which represent the surface of objects. The precision potential in these applications is not limited by the single point accuracy of laserscanners, since surface elements derived from a large number of points are used for deformation analysis. The practical example presented here is the determination of the bending line of a television tower. Finally an outlook on future work- the analysis of deformations on water dams – will be shown...|$|R
40|$|The OPERA {{neutrino}} experiment at {{the underground}} Gran Sasso Laboratory has measured {{the velocity of}} neutrinos from the CERN CNGS beam over a baseline of about 730 km. The measurement is based on data taken by OPERA in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the CNGS timing system and of the OPERA detector, {{as well as a}} <b>high</b> precision <b>geodesy</b> campaign for the measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic and statistical accuracies. An arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of (6 : 5 ± 7 : 4 (stat:) + 8. 34 - 8. 0 (sys:)) ns was measured corresponding to a relative difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light (v - c) =c = (2 : 7 ± 3 : 1 (stat:) + 3. 4 - 3 : 3 (sys:)) × 10 - 6. The above result, obtained by comparing the time distributions of neutrino interactions and of protons hitting the CNGS target in 10. 5 μs long extractions, was confirmed by a test performed at the end of 2011 using a short bunch beam allowing to measure the neutrino time of ight at the single interaction level. 0 arXiv- 1109. 4897 v 4 info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) was {{developed}} by the Department of Defense primarily for navigation use by the United States Armed Forces. The system will consist of a constellation of 18 operational Navigation Satellite Timing and Ranging (NAVSTAR) satellites by the late 1980 's. During the last four years, the Satellite Emission Range Inferred Earth Surveying (SERIES) team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed a novel receiver which {{is the heart of the}} SERIES geodetic system designed to use signals broadcast from the GPS. This receiver does not require knowledge of the exact code sequence being transmitted. In addition, when two SERIES receivers are used differentially to determine a baseline, few cm accuracies can be obtained. The initial engineering test phase has been completed for the SERIES Project. Baseline lengths, ranging from 150 meters to 171 kilometers, have been measured with 0. 3 cm to 7 cm accuracies.

40|$|Present-day {{displacements}} {{within the}} Central Andes are being measured using <b>high</b> precision GPS <b>geodesy.</b> Until now, comparison of such ground motions within deforming plate boundary zones {{to those on}} a geologic time scale has not been possible {{due to lack of}} sufficient geological data. In the Central Andes, a comparable dataset for the past 25 Ma of mountain building can be reconstructed. Here, we use new interpretations of shortening rates averaged over 25 – 10 Ma and 10 Ma–present and find that whilst displacement directions have remained virtually constant and parallel, an acceleration has occurred synchronously with a slowing of convergence between the Nazca and South American plates. Geologic shortening rates in the Andes are initially ∼ 5 – 8 mm yr− 1, and increase to ∼ 10 – 15 mm yr− 1 whilst convergence slows from ∼ 150 mm yr− 1 to ∼ 70 mm yr− 1. Displacement and convergence rates inferred from GPS and marine magnetic data suggest that this trend may be continuing at present. Hence an increasing fraction of convergence is being absorbed by mountain building. This change may reflect increased plate coupling due to decreased sediment supply, younger subducting lithosphere, or increased normal stress at the interface from the effects of uplift...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{industrial}} <b>geodesy,</b> <b>high</b> {{demands are}} placed on the final accuracy, with expectations currently falling below 1 mm. The measurement methodology and surveying instruments used have to be adjusted to meet these stringent requirements, especially the total stations as the most often used instruments. A standard deviation of the measured distance is the accuracy parameter, commonly between 1 and 2 mm. This parameter is often discussed {{in conjunction with the}} determination of the real accuracy of measurements at very short distances (5 – 50 m) because it is generally known that this accuracy cannot be increased by simply repeating the measurement because a considerable part of the error is systematic. This article describes the detailed testing of electronic distance meters to determine the absolute size of their systematic errors, their stability over time, their repeatability and the real accuracy of their distance measurement. Twenty instruments (total stations) have been tested, and more than 60, 000 distances in total were measured to determine the accuracy and precision parameters of the distance meters. Based on the experiments’ results, calibration procedures were designed, including a special correction function for each instrument, whose usage reduces the standard deviation of the measurement of distance by at least 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Near-Earth asteroids are {{important}} exploration targets since they provide {{clues to the}} evolution of the solar system. They are also of interest since they present a clear danger to Earth. Our mission objective is to image the internal structure of two NEOs using radio reflection tomography (RRT) in order to explore the record of asteroid origin and impact evolution, and to test the fundamental hypothesis that some NEOs are rubble piles rather than consolidated bodies. Our mission s RRT technique is analogous to doing a CAT scan of the asteroid from orbit. Closely sampled radar echoes are processed to yield volumetric maps of mechanical and compositional boundaries, and to measure interior material dielectric properties. The RRT instrument is a radar that operates at 5 and 15 MHz with two 30 -m (tip-to-tip) dipole antennas that are used in a cross-dipole configuration. The radar transmitter and receiver electronics have heritage from JPL's MARSIS contribution to Mars Express, and the antenna is similar to systems used in IMAGE and LACE missions. The 5 -MHz channel is designed to penetrate greater than 1 km of basaltic rock, and 15 -MHz penetrates a few hundred meters or more. In addition to RRT volumetric imaging, we use redundant color cameras to explore the surface expressions of unit boundaries, in order to relate interior radar imaging to what is observable from spacecraft imaging and from Earth. The camera also yields stereo color imaging for geology and RRT-related compositional analysis. Gravity and <b>high</b> fidelity <b>geodesy</b> are used to explore how interior structure is expressed in shape, density, mass distribution and spin. Ion thruster propulsion is utilized by Deep Interior to enable tomographic radar mapping of multiple asteroids. Within the Discovery AO scheduling parameters we identify two targets, S-type 1999 ND 43 (approximately 500 m diameter) and V-type 3908 Nyx (approximately 1 km), asteroids whose compositions bracket the diversity of solar system materials that we are likely to encounter, from undifferentiated to highly evolved. The 5 - 15 MHz radar is capable of probing more primitive bodies (e. g. comets or C-types) that may be available given other launch schedules. 5 MHz radar easily penetrates, with the required SNR, greater than 1 km of basalt (a good analog for Nyx). Basalt has a greater loss tangent than expected for most asteroids, although iron-rich M-types are probably not appropriate targets. 15 MHz radar penetrates the outer approximately 100 m of rocky 1 km asteroids and the deep interiors of comets. Laboratory studies of the most common NE 0 materials expected (S-, C- and V-type meteorite analogs) will commence in 2005...|$|R
40|$|From Gibraltar to Anatolia, {{the active}} {{tectonics}} in the Mediterranean is studied {{by means of}} an integrated approach based on geophysical, geodetic, and seismological methodologies. The aim {{of this study is to}} gain a deep insight into the kinematics and dynamics of the crustal and lithospheric processes affecting the Mediterranean. Major tectonic processes, such as continental collision and subduction, characterize this region, which marks a broad transition zone between the African/Arabian and Eurasian plates. A thin-shell finite element approach allows us to simulate the deformation pattern in the Mediterranean, from 10 °W to 40 °E and from 30 ° to 50 °N. The global plate motion model NUVEL- 1 A is used to account for the convergence, while the relative velocities of the overriding and subduction plates are obtained from another family of models. These models simulate the effects of the negatively buoyant density contrasts of the subducted lithosphere on the horizontal velocity at the surface. A systematic comparison between model results and the seismic strain rates obtained from the National Earthquake Information Center catalog, the geodetic velocity field and strain resulting from GPS, satellite laser ranging, and very long baseline interferometry analyses and the World Stress Map, indicate that Africa/Arabia versus Eurasia convergence and subduction in the Aegean Sea and Calabrian Arc are the major tectonic mechanisms controlling the deformation style in the Mediterranean. It is shown that in order to carry into coincidence the modeled and the seismic strain rate patterns and the geodetically retrieved strain rate tensors, a deep subduction in the Aegean Arc must be included in the modeling.

40|$|The current thesis {{regards the}} {{comparison}} between two methods of GPS data analysis. The first one is the traditional double difference method and the second one is the precise point positioning (PPP). The PPP method entails advantages, such as being less time consuming and less infrastructure demanding compared to the double difference method, but its accuracy and reliability {{has yet to be}} proven. 	 The place of study is Santorini. Santorini was chosen due to the plethora of available data and because of its great geological interest. The time of study is 22 months, starting from June 2011 and ending in March 2013. The frequency of data resolution is one day per month, usually {{in the middle of the}} month. 	 	The network is the permanent GPS network of Santorini, consisted of 9 stations. Data was extracted from either public websites, where it is available for the science community, or from the NTUA Laboratory of <b>Higher</b> and Satellite <b>Geodesy.</b> Also worth noting, is that high accuracy data from IGS was also used for the PPP method. Finally several stations outside of Santorini were used, seven in number, and as equally spread as possible around Santorini. 	The software used for the analysis is Bernese v 5. 0. The reference frame is ITRF 2008 for the double difference method and IGS 08 for the PPP method, later named IGB 08. The Matlab software was also used for mathematical transformations and time-lines creation. 	The main text involves further analysis of the used networks and data, and the the methodologies that the GPS data resolutions were based on. Also differences between the two methods and their advantages and drawbacks are mentioned. The stages of resolution on the Bernese software are investigated, along with the problems that were encountered, and the results and time-lines are listed.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of tidal gravity final residuals {{is an issue}} of <b>high</b> debate in <b>geodesy.</b> Whereas some authors suggest that final residuals are related to possible instrumental and measurement errors or to errors in the evaluation of the oceanic load computations, others propose certain empirical relationships between the gravity tidal residuals and the heat flow, or the tectonothermal age of the lithosphere which, in turn, reveals structural variations with respect to a homogeneous elastic model. We examine such relationships in the Iberian Peninsula by studying correlations between the cosine component of the final residual vector for the M 2 and O 1 waves of the gravity tide potential and different structural parameters for a total of 21 gravity tide stations. The selected parameters, which are related to the capability of the lithosphere to deform, include surface heat flow as the main parameter and, to a lesser extent, lithospheric strength, Moho temperature and tectonothermal age of the lithosphere. Our study agrees with previous results by other authors and does not demonstrate the existence of empirical relationships between the gravity residuals and structural parameters. Actually, when we consider the most precise observations and recent ocean tide models the final residuals are mostly uncorrelated noise. Our results also agree with theoretical studies proposing that the distortions of the tidal gravity field from spherical symmetry are very small and hardly to observe. The research by J. F., L.
