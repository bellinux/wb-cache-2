5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>different</b> for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>different</b> {{for places}} with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical {{cyclones}} from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is known}} from three certain species, P. walkeri, P. tubicen, and P. cyrtocristatus. All {{of them can}} be {{distinguished}} from each other, and have many differences. The first named species, therefore the type, is P. walkeri. One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it, but many more are almost certainly referable. Like stated above, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>different</b> from the other two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than P. tubicen, a straighter crest and different internal structuring than P. cyrtocristatus.|$|E
5|$|The final {{development}} in the modern design of the clarinet used {{in most of the}} world today was introduced by Hyacinthe Klosé in 1839. He devised a different arrangement of keys and finger holes, which allow simpler fingering. It was inspired by the Boehm system developed for flutes by Theobald Boehm. Klosé was so impressed by Boehm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>different</b> from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to gain popularity but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as the Oehler system clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert system clarinets.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E

25|$|The e-krona is a {{proposed}} electronic currency {{to be issued}} directly by the Riksbank. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>different</b> than the electronic transfers using commercial bank money as central bank money has no nominal credit risk, as it stands for a claim on the central bank, which cannot go bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|The antineutron is the {{antiparticle}} of the neutron. An antineutron has {{the same}} mass as a neutron, and no net electric charge.

It was discovered by Bruce Cork, William Wenzell, Glenn Lambertson, and Oreste Piccioni in 1956.|$|E

Being consistent with the treatment is paramount.|$|E
25|$|Mathematics, {{first of}} all known as The Science of numbers which is {{classified}} in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences).

Arithmetica has very little in common with traditional Greek mathematics since it is divorced from geometric methods, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>different</b> from Babylonian mathematics in that Diophantus is concerned primarily with exact solutions, both determinate and indeterminate, instead of simple approximations.|$|E
