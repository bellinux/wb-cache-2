The BBQ Buddha is a fledgling food blog, soon to be a restaurant. In the beginning, {{the goal was to}} create a distinctive logo, or mark, while maintaining a high level of client interaction. After the mark was complete, my clients felt comfortable allowing me to use it to create a standard visual style. Final elements include the logo, letterhead, business card, <b>envelope,</b> <b>folder,</b> menu, to-go box, website, billboard, tee shirt, vehicle wrap, and a graphic standards guide. Designing a mark and applying it to a variety of print and digital collateral strengthened The BBQ Buddha's brand identity, and working with a real client helped me to hone the skills I have been learning in the classroom.

5000|$|Jackets - The {{term has}} several {{distinct}} and confusing meanings. In general, {{it refers to}} some set of standard boilerplate provisions which accompanies all policies {{at the time of}} delivery. Some insurers refer to a package of standard documents shared across an entire family of policies as a [...] "jacket." [...] Some insurers extend this to include policy forms, so that the only parts of the policy not part of the jacket are the declarations, endorsements, and riders. Other insurers use the term [...] "jacket" [...] in a manner closer to its ordinary meaning: a binder, <b>envelope,</b> or presentation <b>folder</b> with pockets in which the policy may be delivered, or a cover sheet to which the policy forms are stapled or which is stapled on top of the policy. The standard boilerplate provisions are then printed on the jacket itself.|$|R
500|$|The {{missions}} {{in the game}} are littered with [...] "intelligence items": briefcases, <b>envelopes,</b> and manila <b>folders</b> containing textual notes which often provide humorous side-notes and helpful hints to the game. The collection of intelligence items is optional. Special power-ups, called [...] "gear" [...] items are also available for collection during the game, such as [...] "fuzzy slippers" [...] that reduce noise made by movement, earplugs that reduce damage from explosions, and a fire extinguisher that protects the player from burn damage. These gear items are sometimes located in hard-to-reach areas. At {{the start of each}} mission, the player can choose which weapons, gadgets and gear to take with them. Some intelligence and gear items cannot be collected on the first playthrough of the game, as the necessary gadgets to reach them are not unlocked until later in the game. If the player wants to collect these items, they have to revisit the mission with the appropriate equipment.|$|R

Seymour PomrenzeDanda Pomrenze SteinSholom (Seymour) Jacob Pomrenze (1916 - 2011) was born in Brusilov, Ukraine. When he was a child, his family emigrated to Chicago. In 1942, Pomrenze joined the United States Army and in February 1946, he was appointed as the first head of the Offenbach Archival Depot (OAD), the central collection point for cultural materials looted from throughout Nazi-occupied Europe by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR). After his discharge, Pomrenze returned to Washington, DC and worked for NARA (1947 - 1949) and for the Army (1950 - 1977) as a records manager. After his retirement from the Army in 1977, he became a full-time records management consultant, primarily to Jewish organizations. His clients included the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), the Jewish Welfare Board (JWB), Federation Employment Guidance Services (FEGS), the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), and the UJA-Federation of New York (UJA). Pomrenze was widely known by his nickname, "The Colonel. "Two books were removed to the AJHS library collection: Libowitz, Richard.

"Reconstructing Jewish Culture: Jewish Scholars and the Fate of the Jewish Book after World War II. " (2004). Honors Thesis, University of Pennsylvania.
