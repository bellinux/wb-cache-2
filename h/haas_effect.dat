25|$|Straight {{delay is}} used in sound {{reinforcement}} systems, a straight delay is used {{to compensate for the}} passage of sound through the air. Unlike audio delay effects devices, straight delay is not mixed back in with the original signal. The delayed signal alone is sent to loudspeakers so that the speakers distant from the stage, as in a large outdoor rock festival, will reinforce the stage sound at the same time or slightly later than the acoustic sound from the stage. The delayed signal uses approximately 1 millisecond of straight delay per foot of air or 3 milliseconds per meter, depending on the air temperature's effect on the speed of sound. Because of the <b>Haas</b> <b>effect,</b> this technique allows audio engineers to use additional speaker systems placed away from the stage and still give the illusion that all sound originates from the stage. The purpose is to deliver sufficient sound volume {{to the back of the}} venue without resorting to excessive sound volumes near the front. Straight delay is also used in audio to video synchronization to align sound with visual media (e.g., on TV or web broadcasting), if the visual source is delayed. Visual media can become delayed by a number of mechanisms or reasons, in which case the associated audio should be delayed to match the visual content.|$|E

The model proposed means the extension of our previous one developed for studying the quantum Hall and Shubnikov-de <b>Haas</b> <b>effects</b> of a two-dimensional electron system in a semiconductor quantum well.

40|$|Spin current, {{a flow of}} spins, is a key {{concept in}} {{spintronics}} [1]. It can be generated by using couplings between an electron spin and other physical quantities such as a magnetic field, magnetization, and orbital degrees of freedom. These conventional methods, however, force us to use magnetic materials or rare metals with strong spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we have presented a new route for spin-current generation by considering the coupling between spin and mechanical rotation. Our method requires neither magnetic moments nor spin-orbit coupling. First we introduce spin-rotation coupling (SRC) : H S Ω, where S is the electron spin angular momentum and Ω is the mechanical rotation frequency. If we rewrite the SRC as H S B, where B Ω 1 is an effective magnetic field due to mechanical rotation with gyromagnetic ratio, the SRC {{can be regarded as}} the Zeeman coupling. Historically the SRC is known as a fundamental origin of the Barnett and Einstein-de <b>Haas</b> <b>effects</b> and plays a crucial role in tests of general relativity by use of gyroscopic effect in gravitational fields due to Earth.

Analyzing the data, we conclude that the electron and hole energy spectra are in qualitative agreement with those calculated within the framework of kP model. The electron and hole subbands are overlapped due to the nonmonotonic dispersion of the hole subband resulting in a semimetallic state. The main result of the paper, however, is the drastic quantitative difference in the experimental and calculated spectra of the hole subband.
