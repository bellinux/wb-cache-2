40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to know some factors affecting to <b>farm</b> size of <b>duck</b> <b>farming</b> (case study in Pinrang district, South Sulawesi province, Indonesia).

In {{order to assess}} production and hemato-biochemical status of Jinding ducks studies were conducted on household ducks of Chatkhil (August 2005 - 2006) and Sonagazi <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farm</b> (August 2008 -June 2009). One hundred Jinding ducks (60 Chatkhil and 40 Sonagazi <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farm)</b> were randomly selected each time of sampling from 2, 300 birds (300 Chatkhil and 2, 000 Sonagazi <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farm).</b> Sexual maturity and average egg production per duck was calculated. Ducks attained better (P< 0. 001) average weight at Chatkhil than at Sonagazi <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farm.</b> Annual egg production was significantly lower (P< 0. 001) at Chatkhil than at Sonagazi <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farm.</b> Lymphocyte counts, serum total proteins, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were recorded significantly higher in Chatkhil ducks than in Sonagazi <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farm</b> <b>ducks</b> while it was reverse for monocytes and heterophils. Hemoglobin and packed cell volume in ducks differed non-significantly. Total erythrocytes counts increased with advancing age of ducks in both sites.

There are two alternative approaches in <b>duck</b> breeding <b>farms</b> : (1) Group breeding farm, which belongs to duck farmers' group, as part of a group production system, and (2) Commercial breeding farm, by an individual private company/Semi-Government Institution in a commercial scale and particularly for export market. A good breeding farm requires appropriate systems for selection and mating of the animals in order to guarantee the quality of the breeding stocks being produced. A breeding farm must be economically and technically feasible as an economic entity, so that economic analysis and marketing must be prepared seriously...|$|R

40|$|Baiyangdian (BYD) {{virus is}} a recently-identified mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes severe disease in ducks, with {{extremely}} rapid transmission, up to 15 % mortality within 10 days and 90 % reduction in egg production on <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> within 5 days of infection. Because of the zoonotic nature of flaviviruses, {{the characterization of}} BYD virus and its epidemiology are important public health concerns. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of this novel virus. We validate the model against BYD outbreak data collected from <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> in Southeast China, as well as experimental data obtained from an animal facility. Based on our model, the basic reproductive number of BYD virus is high (R 0  =  21) indicating that this virus is highly transmissible, consistent with the dramatic epidemiology observed in BYDV-affected <b>duck</b> <b>farms.</b> Our results indicate that younger ducks are more vulnerable to BYD disease and that ducks infected with BYD virus reduce egg production (to about 33 % on average) for about 3 days post-infection; after 3 days infected ducks are {{no longer able to}} produce eggs. Using our model, we predict that control measures which reduce contact between mosquitoes and ducks such as mosquito nets are more effective than insecticides...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the prevalence, diversity, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and associated risk factors on 341 pig, chicken, and <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> in Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam). Sampling was stratified by species, district (four categories), and farm size (three categories). Pooled faeces, collected using boot swabs, were tested using ISO 6575 : 2002 (Annex D). Isolates were serogrouped; group B isolates were tested by {{polymerase chain reaction}} to detect S. Typhimurium and (monophasic) serovar 4,[5], 12 :i:- variants. The farm-level adjusted NTS prevalence was 64 · 7 %, 94 · 3 % and 91 · 3 % for chicken, <b>duck</b> and pig <b>farms,</b> respectively. Factors independently associated with NTS were <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> [odds ratio (OR) 21 · 2], farm with > 50 pigs (OR 11 · 9), pig farm with 5 - 50 pigs (OR 4 · 88) (vs. chickens), and frequent rodent sightings (OR 2 · 3). Both S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium were more common in <b>duck</b> <b>farms.</b> Isolates had a high prevalence of resistance (77 · 6 %) against tetracycline, moderate resistance (20 - 30 %) against chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and nalidixic acid, and low resistance (< 5 %) against ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins. Multidrug resistance (resistance against ⩾ 3 classes of antimicrobial) was independently associated with monophasic S. Typhimurium and other group B isolates (excluding S. Typhimurium) and pig farms.
