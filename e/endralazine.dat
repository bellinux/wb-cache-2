50|$|<b>Endralazine</b> is an {{antihypertensive}} of the hydrazinophthalazine chemical class.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>endralazine,</b> {{administered}} intravenously, on blood pressure, heart rate, forearm blood flow, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, adrenaline and noradrenaline were studied in five patients with essential hypertension. <b>Endralazine</b> reduced peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in decrease in {{mean arterial pressure}} from 141 to 116 mm Hg and increase in heart rate from 67 to 92 beats/min. Plasma renin activity, adrenaline and noradrenaline increased significantly after <b>endralazine</b> infusion. All effects observed are consistent with <b>endralazine</b> acting as a peripheral vasodilating drug...|$|E
40|$|The direct-acting vasodilator, <b>endralazine,</b> in {{combination}} with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker significantly reduced the blood pressures of normotensive volunteers and of patients with essential hypertension. The mean terminal elimination half-life for <b>endralazine</b> of 136 min in hypertensive patients {{did not differ significantly}} from the 155 min in normotensive subjects. In normal subjects the mean oral bioavailability for <b>endralazine</b> was 75 % and the mean clearance was 780 ml/min. There were no significant pharmacokinetic differences between fast and slow acetylators. The administration of <b>endralazine</b> to steady state in the hypertensive patients was associated with an increase in terminal elimination half-life and a decrease in the rate of absorption. However, there was no accumulation of <b>endralazine</b> with chronic dosing...|$|E
40|$|<b>Endralazine,</b> a new {{peripheral}} vasodilator, {{was given}} {{in conjunction with a}} beta-blocker to 21 patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure. All subjects were either poorly controlled on their previous antihypertensive regime or were experiencing unacceptable adverse effects from drugs. After 4 weeks blood pressure was reduced in all patients and symptomatic side effects were few. Two patients became anti-nuclear factor (ANF) positive in weak titre but without evidence of the lupus syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the 2, 3 -diazanaphthalene, phthalazine and its 1 -substituted derivatives with the molybdenum hydroxylases, aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, has been investigated both in vivo and /Ok in vitro. Metabolic studies, carried out by treating rabbits with both cold and 14 C-labelled phthalazine, have shown that this compound is extensively metabolised in vivo, the major metabolite being a glucuronide conjugate. Very little unchanged phthalazine or its molybdenum hydroxylase mediated oxidation product 1 -hydroxyphthalazine were excreted in the urine. Pretreatment of rabbits with phthalazine or 1 -hydroxyphthalazine had no effect upon {{the activity of the}} microsomal monooxygenases but caused {{a significant increase in the}} specific activities of both aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase. Determination of the molybdenum content of purified aldehyde oxidase fractions using electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy has confirmed that an increase in the molybdenum content of the enzyme fraction accompanies the increase in activity. A qualitative assessment of purified aldehyde oxidase fractions using iso-electric focusing has indicated that this enzyme may be composed of 2 or 3 active variants and following pretreatment with either phthalazine or 1 -hydroxyphthalazine a further band of enzyme activity is apparent on the electropherogram. The Km value for phthalazine is significantly reduced with enzyme prepared from phthalazine treated rabbits, indicating that a form of the enzyme with a high affinity for phthalazine may have been induced. 1 -Hydrazinophthalazine (Hydralazine) and two other hydrazine substituted N-heterocycles, <b>endralazine</b> and 1 -hydrazinoisoquinoline have been shown to exert a potent progressive inhibition of aldehyde oxidase in vitro, effective only in the presence of substrate, but are inactive towards xanthine oxidase. In addition, administration of hydralazine to rabbits results in a significant reduction in liver aldehyde oxidase activity. Investigations into the {{interaction of}} some of the metabolites of hydralazine with aldehyde oxidase in vitro suggest that hydralazine is also the inhibiting species in vivo.
