5|$|Morrison {{was known}} for his {{numerous}} books and television programs. He produced 68 popular science articles between 1949 and 1976, ten in issues of Scientific American. He provided the narration and script for Powers of Ten in 1977. With his wife, Phylis, they turned the same material into a coffee table book in 1982. He also appeared as himself in the science documentary film Target...Earth? in 1980. In 1987, PBS aired his six part miniseries, The Ring of Truth: An Inquiry into How We <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>We</b> Know, which he also hosted. In addition, he was a columnist and reviewer of books on science for Scientific American starting in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E

Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked.

However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of Life Is Strange before proceeding with the sequel to Remember Me.

500|$|A real-life {{journalist}} named Reid, who Gray {{interviewed for}} his book, states that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] mirrors well how some journalists actually work.

500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{rented a}} room in Manhattan, sharing it with the Sleeping and writing songs with laptops and guitars. Typically, they arrived at about 10 am; some evenings, Lazzara showed up after the band to write melodies. The group wrote 20 songs before {{discarding}} half, and recorded 14 or 15 demos in their home studio. According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics [...] "are coming into a golden age. The tracks are really more rocking and we’re trying some new things, but it’s still us." [...] Like Where You Want to Be, the band pushed themselves to write the best songs they could. For Where You Want to Be the group [...] "didn’t {{spend as much time}} playing together," [...] but for Louder Now [...] "we know each other’s playing.

500|$|Black Francis {{recalled}} {{that he wrote}} [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] around {{the time he was}} age 14 or 15. Years later after the Pixies were formed, producer Paul Kolderie noted the group didn't want to record [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] for its demo [...] "The Purple Tape". The group referred to it as [...] "the Tom Petty song", according to Kolderie. Producer Gary Smith said, [...] "There was some reluctance to do 'Here Comes Your Man' because it was too pop, there was something too straight about it." [...] When 4AD label head Ivo Watts-Russell handpicked the track listing for the group's debut release Come on Pilgrim, he intentionally left out [...] "Here Comes Your Man". Watts-Russell stated that he liked the song, but [...] "it felt just too obviously commercial and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were doing with [...] ". Watts-Russell also felt it was too reminiscent of Mink DeVille's [...] "Spanish Stroll". For a post-Surfer Rosa single, 4AD rejected another recording of the song; they later chose [...] "Gigantic", with [...] "River Euphrates" [...] on the B-side.|$|E
500|$|Several viewers {{outside the}} film industry, such as evangelical pastors and commentators, argued that Frozen {{promotes}} normalization of homosexuality, while others {{believed that the}} main character, Elsa, represents a positive image of LGBT youth, viewing the film and the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} coming out. These claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and the LGBT community. Writing for Film International, Robert Geal has argued that while the film offers a superficially progressive vision of homosexuality, it perpetuates conservative notions about sexuality and gender; whereas Elsa's female homosexuality is rendered visually pleasurable to a male gaze, male transgressions of heterosexuality are coded in various negative ways. When asked about perceptions of a homosexual undertone in the film, Lee said, [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> made. But at the same time I feel like once we hand the film over, it belongs to the world, so I don't like to say anything, and let the fans talk. I think it's up to them." [...] She also mentioned that Disney films were made in different eras and were all celebrated for different reasons, but a 2013 film would have a [...] "2013 point of view".|$|E

500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>we</b> put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|Executive producers/writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss had {{pitched the}} idea of {{adapting}} Martin's series for television to HBO in March 2006, and the network secured the rights in January 2007. The first actor cast was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion in May 2009. Benioff and Weiss later noted that the funny and [...] "incredibly smart" [...] Dinklage was their first choice for the role, as the actor's [...] "core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well {{in keeping with the}} character." [...] Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, [...] "he wouldn't play elves or leprechauns" [...] and – choosy about genre roles – he had just come from portraying the dwarf Trumpkin in 2008's [...] Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was [...] "a different kind of fantasy little person," [...] or in the actor's words, [...] "No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being." [...] Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because [...] "They told me how popular he was." [...] Martin said of Dinklage's casting, [...] "If he hadn't accepted the part, oh, boy, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would have done." [...] Benioff added, [...] "When I read George's books, I decided Tyrion Lannister {{was one of the great}} characters in literature. Not just fantasy literature – literature! A brilliant, caustic, horny, drunken, self-flagellating mess of a man. And there was only one choice to play him." ...|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E
