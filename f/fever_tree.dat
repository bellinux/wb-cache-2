5|$|French chemist Pierre Joseph Pelletier and French {{pharmacist}} Joseph Bienaimé Caventou {{separated in}} 1820 the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from powdered <b>fever</b> <b>tree</b> bark, {{allowing for the}} creation of standardized doses of the active ingredients. Prior to 1820, the bark was simply dried, ground to a fine powder and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) for drinking.|$|E
5|$|Spanish missionaries {{found that}} fever was treated by Amerindians near Loxa (Peru) with powder from Peruvian bark (later {{established}} to be from any of several trees of genus Cinchona). It {{was used by the}} Quechua Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills. Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in Lima and was an apothecary by training, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the <b>fever</b> <b>tree</b> bark. This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.|$|E

The group disbanded in 1970, but reformed in 1978 with only guitarist Michael Knust remaining from the original line-up. The new formation of the group had little commercial success; <b>Fever</b> <b>Tree</b> was not heard of again until 2003 when Michael Knust died.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fever</b> <b>Tree</b> is {{the debut}} album by the American {{psychedelic}} rock band <b>Fever</b> <b>Tree</b> {{and was released}} on March 28, 1968 on Uni Records (see 1968 in music). It blended multiple influences ranging from psychedelia to baroque pop and folk rock, and was marked by eerie ballads and hard rock numbers. Much of the group's material was penned by the husband-wife songwriting duo of Scott and Vivian Holtzman, along with renditions of contemporary rock songs. The album was preceded by arguably Fever Tree's best known song, [...] "San Francisco Girls (Return of the Native)", becoming the group's only nationally charting single. Like its attendant single, <b>Fever</b> <b>Tree</b> was also moderately successful and managed to reach number 156 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

However, as Rankine explained, the band could not escape its publicity as the Secrets: [...] "Our bookings increased and we were playing right across Canada.

50|$|Following {{the release}} of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, Kelley was {{dismissed}} from The Byrds in September 1968, largely due to pressure from the group's new lead guitarist Clarence White, who had come on board {{as a replacement for}} Gram Parsons in July 1968. After leaving The Byrds, Kelley next contributed drums to the psychedelic rock band <b>Fever</b> <b>Tree's</b> fourth album, For Sale, although it is unknown whether he was a fully-fledged member of the band or was simply hired as a sideman to embellish the album. Between 1969 and 1973, Kelley found work as a session musician, guesting on albums by John Fahey, Phil Ochs, Frank Kinsel, Jerry Jeff Walker, Judee Sill, Jesse Wolff & Whings, and Michael Cohen. Following {{the release of}} Cohen's What Did You Expect? album in 1973, Kelley appears to have retired from the music business and little is known about his subsequent life.|$|R
40|$|This thesis covers Daphne Rooke's eight {{published}} "South African" novels: A Grove of <b>Fever</b> <b>Trees,</b> Mittee, Ratoons, Wizards' Country, A Lover for Estelle, The Greyling, Diamond Jo, and Margaretha de la Porte. It {{supports the}} recent revival of critical interest in Rooke, and argues for the continuing relevance {{of her work}} in post-apartheid South Africa. This study also broadens the scope of recent Rooke research by including lesser known works like The Greyling and Margaretha de la Porte in its analysis. Recent criticism has focused on RookQ's~~nusual blend of romance and realism. The first three chapters concentrate more on "realism", emphasising the depth and extent of Rooke's engagement with serious social issues. The novels are examined {{in terms of their}} handling of the themes of class (chapter one), race (chapter two) and gender (chapter three). The concluding chapter_ shifts in focus to "romance" and examines the question of generic_identity [...] touching on Rooke's gothic, magical realist and "popular" qualities -within a consideration of the particular "South African-ness" of her work. ...|$|R
