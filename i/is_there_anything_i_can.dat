6000|$|... "Very sorry," [...] he said. [...] "Still, you see, {{you left}} me no {{other means of}} {{stopping}} you. Now, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come close, Ummanodda," [...] said Thumb. [...] "Tell me, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> see?" [...] They hobbled {{a little}} nearer, and stood stooping {{together}} with eyes fixed.|$|R
