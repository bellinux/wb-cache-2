5|$|Similarly to {{the rest}} of Dorset, Bournemouth's economy is {{primarily}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> which employed 95% of the workforce in 2010. This was 10% higher than the average employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> for Great Britain and 11% higher than the South West. Of particular importance are the financial and public service sectors which through 2011 continued to show sustained growth.

5|$|Oil and gas {{were first}} landed in 1978 at Sullom Voe, which has {{subsequently}} {{become one of}} the largest terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three quarters of the islands' workforce is employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> and the Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003. Shetland's access to oil revenues has funded the Shetland Charitable Trust, which in turn funds a wide variety of local programmes.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{estimates}} the local multiplier of manufacturing for Brazil (2000 - 2010). The method {{is based on}} (Moretti, 2010) and on (Moretti and Thulin, 2012), who estimated these multipliers for the U. S. and Sweden. The local multiplier of manufacturing {{estimates the}} impacts of employment changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industrial <b>sectors</b> on employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sectors,</b> and <b>the</b> impact of changes <b>in</b> employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-tech and low-tech tradable <b>sectors</b> on employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sectors.</b> These estimates help to assess the importance of industrial employment changes over local economies. We created instrumental variables, based on the shift-share method. The employment data cover 21 economic subsectors and 123 regions in 2000, 2005 and 2010. We have estimated that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian mesorregions, for each new job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradable sectors, almost four jobs were created locally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sectors.</b> Additionally, each job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-tech industrial sectors was estimated to create approximately seven jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sectors</b> over <b>the</b> long term...|$|R
5|$|Copenhagen is {{the major}} {{economic}} and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show {{that the vast majority}} of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2010, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of €88,366 million, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{attainment}} varied greatly {{depending on}} occupational field with 68% {{of those in}} the professional and professional support fields having a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> Considering the fact that the average American does not have a bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. All together the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20th. century with most workers today being employed in office and service occupations.|$|E
5|$|Primary income {{often comes}} from {{employment}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> including {{industries such as}} insurance and banking, defence related employment, retail and management. Employment within Nailsea includes work in shops, schools, estate agents and banks. Larger businesses in Nailsea include GE, and Bristol Wessex Billing Services Ltd., the billing company jointly owned by Bristol Water and Wessex Water. Other businesses are situated at units in the town. Nailsea has three large industrial and business estates located at Southfield road, Blackfriars road and Coates Estate (former site of the local cider making industry). Nailsea's shopping area includes Somerset Square, Crown Glass Place, Colliers Walk, and a high street. There are four supermarket chains in the town (Tesco, Waitrose, Co-op and Iceland) and some national banks and estate agents.|$|E
50|$|Toffler {{proposed}} one {{criterion for}} distinguishing between industrial society and post-industrial society: {{the share of}} <b>the</b> population occupied <b>in</b> agriculture versus <b>the</b> share of city labor occupied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>In</b> a post-industrial society, the share of <b>the</b> people occupied <b>in</b> agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share of city laborers occupied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> exceeds 50%. Thus, {{the share of the}} people occupied with brainwork greatly exceeds the share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and {{cultural}} development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; {{it is one of the}} major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector,</b> especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|Poole's {{economy is}} more {{balanced}} {{than the rest}} of Dorset. In the 1960s prosperity was fuelled by growth in the manufacturing sector, whereas the 1980s and 1990s saw expansion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> as office based employers relocated to the area. The importance of manufacturing has declined since the 1960s but still employed approximately 17% of the workforce in 2002 and remains more prominent than in the economy of Great Britain as a whole. Sunseeker, the world's largest privately owned builder of motor yachts and the UK's largest manufacturer, is based in Poole and employs over 1,800 people in its Poole shipyards. Other major employers in the local manufacturing industry include Faerch Plast, Hamworthy Heating, Hamworthy Combustion, Lush, Mathmos, Kerry Foods, Transmission Developments, Eurac, Siemens, Southernprint and Ryvita. Poole has the largest number of industrial estates in South East Dorset, including the Nuffield Industrial estate, Mannings Heath, Arena Business Park, Poole Trade Park and the Branksome Business Centre.|$|E

30|$|Another factor behind labor {{share is}} the {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector.</b> Because <b>the</b> labor income share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> is higher than that in industry, its average value will rise if there is a structural transformation from industry to <b>services.</b> <b>The</b> recent government experiment of replacing the business tax which is levied on sales revenue with the value added tax <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> should be a significant boost to <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector.</b> Reducing <b>the</b> biases against <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> <b>in</b> terms of land allocation and entry barriers should also have a positive effect. However, the effects of these measures on labor income {{are most likely to be}} slow.|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{energy is}} {{as one of}} the {{important}} effective factors on economic growth and development. In recent decades, numerous studies in different countries to estimate and forecast electricity demand {{in different parts of the}} economy have been made. In this paper, using the method ARDL, estimation and forecasting of electricity demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> of Iran are determined for the time period from 1983 to 2012. Estimated equations show that the added value of <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> and a significant positive impact on the demand for electricity <b>in</b> this sector. <b>The</b> price elasticity for <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> is smaller than 1 due to low electricity prices and subsidized electricity. Hence, electricity prices have little impact on the demand for electricity. The results of the estimate represents a long-term relationship between <b>the</b> variables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, based on amendments to the law on subsidies and estimated values, anticipated electricity demand until the end of the fifth development plan was carried out.
