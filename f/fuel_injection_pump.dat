500|$|Although {{regarded}} by its designer as a [...] "lash-up", BT19 {{had a very}} successful Formula One racing career, almost entirely {{in the hands of}} Jack Brabham. BT19 was entered in several non-championship Formula One races before the beginning of the 1966 world championship season. At the non-championship South African Grand Prix at East London on 1 January, BT19 was the only new 3-litre car present. It recorded the fastest time in the qualifying session before the race – therefore taking pole position {{for the start of the}} race – and led the majority of the event before the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> seized. Similar problems stopped the car on the second lap of the Syracuse Grand Prix in Sicily, but at the International Trophy at the Silverstone circuit, Brabham set pole position, a new lap record, and led the whole race to win ahead of 1964 champion John Surtees in a 3-litre works Ferrari.|$|E

40|$|Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) {{returned}} {{one high}} pressure fuel hose to Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) because CNS had found foreign material within the hose during receipt inspection. This fuel hose {{was one of four}} fuel hoses that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of the hose assembly. When installed, this fuel hose would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps.</b> Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps.</b> The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders. This could impact the load carrying capability of the diesel engine or possibly cause complete engine shutdown. Either scenario has the potential to prevent the emergency diesel generator from performing its safety related function. These hoses were supplied only to CNS. 02 - 03 - 12; 03 : 43 PM; # 11 /...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the engine}} was cylinder-ported and {{required}} no poppet valves, each bank had a camshaft, driven at crankshaft speed. This was used solely to drive the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps,</b> each cylinder having its own injector and pump, driven by its own cam lobe.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} valves per cylinder, driven by {{pushrods}} and rockers {{from a single}} camshaft between the cylinder banks. The fuel injector is centrally mounted between the valves, and is supplied {{by a pair of}} inline <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps,</b> one per bank.|$|R
50|$|Following the Bosch takeover, {{there was}} a series of {{ownership}} changes that resulted in the division of the major business groups: <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps,</b> automotive airconditioners, bus airconditioners and mobile refrigeration units, and the differential and airbag product lines. For example, M.C. Bernardo Inc. (the exclusive representative of Diesel Kiki/Zexel in the Philippines) had to turn over business to Robert Bosch Philippines, like other Zexel partners in other countries and regions.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanical}} fly-weight {{governors of}} inline and distributor diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> {{used to control}} fuel delivery {{under a variety of}} engine loads and conditions could no longer deal with the ever increasing demands for efficiency, emission control, power and fuel consumption.These demands are now primarily fulfilled by the Electronic Control, the system which provides greater ability for precise measuring, data processing, operating environment flexibility and analysis to ensure efficient diesel engine operation. The EDC replaces the mechanical control governor with an electro-magnetic control device.|$|R
50|$|The {{improved}} powerplant had its stroke lifted by 10 mm {{while the}} bore remained the same. The displacement was lifted to 12.6 litres {{which resulted in}} increased horsepower and torque. For military variants the engines were capable of running on alternative fuels (mixtures of diesel fuel, gasoline and or aviation kerosine fuel), albeit with a performance loss. The air cooling system was retained once again with the cooling fan driven via hydraulic clutch and engine oil temperature controlled. The <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> featured different types variable or combination governors depending on the vehicle application.|$|R
50|$|In May 1947 a {{deal was}} made with Victor D. Roosa to come to Hartford Machine Screw and perfect his <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> for diesel engines.

50|$|An unusual feature was {{the ability}} to build the engines with the {{flywheel}} and output drive arranged at either end. The supercharger, <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump,</b> and other auxiliaries also changed sides. Although the crankshaft always rotated the same way within the block, this {{was the equivalent of}} offering left and right-handed rotation engines (the C6SFR variant).|$|E
50|$|The drive {{between the}} {{crankshafts}} was unusual. Rather {{than the typical}} geared drive, as used by the Jumo, there was a triangular coupling rod frame, driven by an overhung crank {{on the end of}} each crankshaft. This frame in turn drove the flywheel and output shaft. The frame also drove the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump,</b> mounted in the top vee between the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|In 1926 CAV {{was bought}} by Lucas. In 1931, CAV in {{partnership}} with Robert Bosch Ltd., became CAV-Bosch Ltd and began making <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> for the diesel industry and later fuel systems for aircraft. Lucas bought Bosch's interest out in 1937 and it became CAV Ltd in 1939. In 1978 the company's name became Lucas CAV. In 1980 the Acton factory employed around 3,000 people making heavy duty electric equipment for commercial vehicles, by this time high volume diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> manufacturing had been relocated to larger modern factories in Kent, Suffolk, Gloucestershire and many countries throughout the world. Acton continued to make low volume specialist pumps for the military and for Gardner engines.|$|R

5000|$|It has {{a number}} of {{improvements}} over the previous generation of Ford diesel engines, including the electronically controlled <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> otherwise known as [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] In addition, the traditional oil sump is replaced with a cast aluminium lower crankcase and a shallow oil pan; there is an oil-to-water cooler, and a great many detail improvements to parts throughout. The engine has been a noted good performer and is a smoother, more powerful unit than the one it replaced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{volatility}} of the fuel, {{the more likely it}} is that vapor lock will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to vapor lock. Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from vapor lock. However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to air locks in their fuel lines, because standard diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> rely on the fuel being non-compressible. Air locks are caused by air leaking into the fuel delivery line or entering from the tank. Air locks are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system.|$|R

40|$|Amongst {{alternative}} fuels for diesel-engine application, biodiesel is very attractive {{because it is}} biodegradable, an environmentally-friendly and sustainable source that can meet future energy demands. However, there are few published studies {{of the impact of}} biodiesel fuel and its blends on <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> (FIPs). This study will investigate the influence of biodiesels derived from waste cooking oils with incremental blends of B 10, B 20, B 30, B 40 and B 100. The FIP in this study is a rotary type attached to a four-cylinder, four-stroke direct injection, turbocharged diesel engine. Vibration and pressure measurements were made on the FIP. The results show the peak pressure close to the pump increases slightly the higher the proportion of biodiesel because of increased viscosity, density and bulk modulus of the fuel. Low frequency vibration increased as the proportion of biodiesel increased. These results demonstrate an increase in dynamic load on the pump components. However, high frequency vibration levels are lowest for the blends B 10, B 20 and B 30, which may be helpful for improving the service life of the delivery...|$|R

50|$|The Endura-DE engine {{features}} a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which {{means there is}} a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a toothed belt driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> is rotated by a second toothed belt driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.|$|E
50|$|The Volvo FL6 {{is powered}} by Volvo’s D6B 180-250 hp, six-cylinder {{turbocharged}} intercooled diesel engine. The control system had a major update, with Volvo's TEA electronics architecture {{to bring it to}} line with the rest of its bigger cousins. Inline <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> was replaced with the EDC rotary distributor pump from Bosch with the identical horsepower; despite the loss of supercharger from the previous D6A engine. The cruise control, automatic exhaust brake and accelerator now became the so-called fly by wire as standard. Full integration {{with the rest of the}} vehicle system such as Electronic Suspension Control and ABS made it much more efficient and user friendly.|$|E
50|$|Negative G {{commonly}} {{occurs when}} manoeuvring to fire on an enemy aircraft in a dogfight. Moving the stick forward would starve {{the engine of}} fuel, producing a sudden loss of power. This would let the enemy get away, and if continued the manoeuvre would cause the carburettor valve to open, provide far too rich a mixture and stop the engine. During the Battles of France and Britain, the German fighter aeroplanes had fuel injected engines and therefore did not suffer from this problem as the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> kept the <b>fuel</b> at a constant pressure whatever manoeuvres were made. The German pilots could exploit this by pitching steeply forward while pushing the throttle wide open, the pursuing British aircraft being left flat footed since trying to emulate the manoeuvre would result in loss of power, or fuel flooding and engine shutdown. The British countermeasure, a half roll so the aircraft would only be subjected to positive G as they followed German aircraft into a dive, could take enough time to let the enemy escape.|$|R
