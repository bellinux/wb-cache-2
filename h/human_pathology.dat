25|$|The Queensland Stock Institute was a {{government}} scientific facility in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, {{for the research}} and prevention of disease in agricultural animals relevant to Queensland. Established in 1893, {{it was the first}} research institution in Queensland dedicated to the investigation of disease. In 1900, it was renamed the Bacteriological Institute when activities were officially extended to include <b>human</b> <b>pathology.</b> The institute ceased as a facility for livestock disease in 1910 when animal work was transferred to Yeerongpilly. Laboratory work relating to human disease remained at the purpose-built facility {{under the control of the}} health department until 1918.|$|E
25|$|After the {{bachelor}} courses, students {{are allowed to}} enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of 4 years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first 2 master years are very theoretical and teach the students in <b>human</b> <b>pathology,</b> diseases, pharmacology. The third year is a year full of internships {{in a wide range}} of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (basisartsen) who have yet to decide on a specialty.|$|E

It was reported the government decided that while Pound was to continue supervising the institute's work on plague outbreaks and other <b>human</b> <b>pathology,</b> his attention should again be directed to livestock: tick fever, pleuropneumonia, lumpy jaw, swine fever, swamp cancer, sheep parasites, and poultry diseases. As a result, in August 1907 supervision and control of the institute were returned to the agricultural department.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study {{applies the}} science of {{pathology}} to the human species {{in order to identify}} and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that <b>human</b> <b>pathology</b> has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that <b>human</b> <b>pathology</b> is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in <b>human</b> <b>pathology.</b> In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: [...] "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field." [...] The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as [...] "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed." [...] About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: [...] "he study of evil is just beginning and you are a pioneer." [...] Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: [...] "Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil." [...] Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: [...] "This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book." [...] Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} in further {{detail in the}} sections that follow, Bartlett's research and publications {{can be divided into}} two main groups: studies in philosophy and studies in clinical psychology. In philosophy, his research has focused on the theory of reflexivity, self-referential argumentation, and the metatheory of reference and identification. In clinical psychology, his research has focused on <b>human</b> <b>pathology</b> as it is expressed in genocide, the Holocaust, war, terrorism, obedience, hatred, human ecological destruction, and human conceptual pathology. In addition, Bartlett's research in clinical psychology has sought to develop our understanding of what he calls human moral intelligence, {{as well as of the}} psychology of peer review and editorial bias, the phenomenology of hatred, the psychology of mediocrity, and the psychology of stupidity. He has challenged the conventional understanding and treatment of mental disorders as promoted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

Comprehensive information on the molecular mechanisms of it is still lacking. However, recent evidence from distantly related species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mouse, points towards a role for non-coding RNA molecules in such a pattern of inheritance.

60|$|The Nun professes to be {{the story}} of a young lady whose family have thrust her into a convent, and her narrative, with an energy and reality that Diderot hardly ever surpassed, {{presents}} the odious sides of monastic life, and the various types of superstition, tyranny, and corruption that monastic life engenders. Yet Diderot had far too much genius to be tempted into the exaggerations of more vulgar assailants of monkeries and nunneries. He may have begun his work with the purpose of attacking a mischievous and superstitious system that mutilates human life, but he certainly continued it because he became interested in his creations. Diderot was a social destroyer by accident, but in intention he was a truly scientific moralist, penetrated by the spirit of observation and experiment; he shrunk from no excess in dissection, and found nothing in <b>human</b> <b>pathology</b> too repulsive for examination. Yet The Nun has none of the artificial violences of the modern French school, which loves moral disease for its own sake. The action is all very possible, and the types are all sufficiently human and probable. The close realistic touches which flowed from the intensity of the writer's illusion, naturally convey a certain degree of the same illusion to the mind of the reader.|$|E

40|$|Oxidative stress has a {{significant}} impact on the development and progression of common <b>human</b> <b>pathologies,</b> including cancer, diabetes, hypertension and neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress globally influences chromatin structure, DNA methylation, enzymatic and non-enzymatic post-translational modifications of histones and DNA-binding proteins. The effects of oxidative stress on these chromatin alterations mediate a number of cellular changes, including modulation of gene expression, cell death, cell survival and mutagenesis, which are disease-driving mechanisms in <b>human</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Targeting oxidative stress-dependent pathways is thus a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. We summarize recent research developments connecting oxidative stress and chromatin regulation...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress {{reflects}} an excessive accumulation of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and is a hallmark of several acute and chronic <b>human</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Although many antioxidants have been investigated, most have demonstrated poor efficacy in clinical trials. Here we discuss the limitations of current antioxidants and describe {{a new class of}} nanoparticle antioxidants, poly(ethylene glycol) -functionalized hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG-HCCs). PEG-HCCs show high capacity to annihilate ROS such as superoxide (O 2 (•-)) and the hydroxyl (HO(•)) radical, show no reactivity toward the nitric oxide radical (NO(•)), and can be functionalized with targeting moieties without loss of activity. Given these properties, we propose that PEG-HCCs offer an exciting new area of study for the treatment of numerous ROS-induced <b>human</b> <b>pathologies.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the potential role of apple phenolic compounds in <b>human</b> <b>pathologies</b> by integrating chemical characterization of phenolic compounds in three apple varieties, computational approaches to identify potential protein {{targets of the}} compounds, bioinformatics analyses on data from public archive of gene expression data, and functional analyses to hypothesize {{the effects of the}} selected compounds in molecular pathways. Starting by the analytic characterization of phenolic compounds in three apple varieties, i. e. Annurca, Red Delicious, and Golden Delicious, we used computational approaches to verify by reverse docking the potential protein targets of the identified compounds. Direct docking validation of the potential protein-ligand interactions has generated a short list of human proteins potentially bound by the apple phenolic compounds. By considering the known chemo-preventive role of apple antioxidants' extracts against some <b>human</b> <b>pathologies,</b> we performed a functional analysis by comparison with experimental gene expression data and interaction networks, obtained from public repositories. The results suggest the hypothesis that chemo-preventive effects of apple extracts in <b>human</b> <b>pathologies,</b> in particular for colorectal cancer, may be the interference with the activity of nucleotide metabolism and methylation enzymes, similarly to some classes of anticancer drugs...|$|R

40|$|Inflammation is {{the local}} {{response}} of a complex organism to an injury {{that serves as a}} mechanism initiating the elimination of noxious agents and of damaged tissues. It is now well understood that damaging mechanisms at the basis of very common <b>human</b> <b>pathologies,</b> such as atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, i. e. the most common <b>human</b> <b>pathologies</b> are driven by the inflammatory process. Free radicals, and the very special free radical nitric oxide, are playing a relevant role in the pathogenesis of inflammation. The initial chapters introduce to the general knowledge necessary to understand the inflammatory process and the role played by free radical and oxidative stress. The interplay between inflammatory molecules and cell signaling is also dealt with in depth. A second part is dedicated to nitric oxide, redox regulation and antioxidant function in inflammation. The final chapters are devoted to diseases where inflammation plays the dominant role: septic shock, end-stage renal disease, neurodegenerative, ischemic and lung diseases. This book, while not covering the whole gamut of the massive literature on inflammation and human diseases, gives an updated and concise view on the major issues concerning the pivotal role of inflammation in so many different <b>human</b> <b>pathologies.</b> At the same time it gives directions for future paths of research leading to a control of the pathologic process...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of behaviour and environmental exposures, particularly during childhood, on health outcomes are well documented. Particularly thought provoking {{is the notion that}} exposures to different social environments have a long-lasting impact on human physical health. However, the mechanisms mediating the effects of the environment are still unclear. In the last decade, the main focus of attention was the genome, and interindividual genetic polymorphisms were sought after as the principal basis for susceptibility to disease. However, it is becoming clear that recent dramatic increases in the incidence of certain <b>human</b> <b>pathologies,</b> such as asthma and type 2 diabetes, cannot be explained just {{on the basis of a}} genetic drift. It is therefore extremely important to unravel the molecular links between the "environmental" exposure, which is believed to be behind this emerging incidence in certain <b>human</b> <b>pathologies,</b> and the disease's molecular mechanisms. Although it is clear that most <b>human</b> <b>pathologies</b> involve long-term changes in gene function, these might be caused by mechanisms other than changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence. The genome is programmed by the epigenome, which is composed of chromatin and a covalent modification of DNA by methylation. It is postulated here that "epigenetic" mechanisms mediate the effects of behavioural and environmental exposures early in life, as well as lifelong environmental exposures and the susceptibility to disease later in life. In contrast to genetic sequence differences, epigenetic aberrations are potentially reversible, raising the hope for interventions that will be able to reverse deleterious epigenetic programming. </p...|$|R
