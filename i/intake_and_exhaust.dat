Aerodynamic covers were {{initially}} {{placed over the}} D-21's <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> to reduce drag, but {{had to be removed}} after the first few tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised.|$|E
5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time on land, they are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|Kuhnke assumed {{command of}} the 33rd U-boat Flotilla upon {{arriving}} at Flensburg. He relinquished command of U-853 back to Frömsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure U-853 was fitted with a Schnorchel, a retractable air <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The Schnorchel reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{standard}} for airflow and cooling of rack mounted equipment. A variety of airflow patterns can be found, including front <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>exhausts,</b> {{as well as}} side <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhausts.</b> Low-wattage devices may not employ active cooling, but use only passive thermal radiation and convection to dissipate heat.|$|R
2500|$|The head {{used during}} this time was the {{so-called}} [...] "rectangle port", named after its exhaust port shape.

5|$|The Senior Prom {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to be expendable; however, it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced, with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under the fuselage. The aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with folding wings to facilicate carriage by the launching aircraft, and was powered by a single turbofan engine, with the air <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground, reducing the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures.|$|E

25|$|Using {{separate}} <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> passages with one-way valves {{placed in}} the mouthpiece. This limits the dead space to between the non return valves and the user's mouth and/or nose. The additional dead space can be minimized by keeping the volume of this external dead space as small as possible, but this should not unduly increase work of breathing.|$|E

25|$|Used {{primarily}} for testing the <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> ports of cylinder heads of internal combustion engines. It {{is also used}} to test the flow capabilities of any component such as air filters, carburetors, manifolds or any other part that is required to flow gas. It is one of the primary tools of high performance engine builders and porting cylinder heads would be strictly hit or miss without it.|$|E
25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} exhaust stream, emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This problem may be overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> side ports, suppressed the loss of unburned mix to exhaust formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E
25|$|The {{radial engine}} {{normally}} uses fewer cam lobes than other types. As with most four-strokes, the crankshaft takes two revolutions {{to complete the}} four strokes of each piston (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust). The camshaft ring is geared to spin slower and {{in the opposite direction}} to the crankshaft. The cam lobes are placed in two rows for the <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust.</b> For the example, four cam lobes serve all five cylinders, whereas 10 would be required for a typical inline engine with the same number of cylinders and valves.|$|E

25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E
25|$|The new Corolla was {{introduced}} to the Australian market on 18 May 2007. It is available in both sedan and hatchback models, with more safety features and higher levels of luxury. The new 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i - with variable valve timing for both <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> camshafts - will be the only engine available for the Australian model, promising better fuel economy than before, it also regains its 100kW power output. This figure decreased when the old model's 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine dropped to 93kW of power and 161Nm of torque (from 171Nm) in late 2005 to meet the 2006 Euro IV emissions requirements. A new 6-speed manual gearbox is standard, with a 4-speed automatic optional, despite speculation of a 5-speed like the new Honda Civic, a robotized 5-speed optional in the European Auris, or a CVT available in the Japanese model.|$|E
500|$|The updates {{introduced}} in Belgium included {{changes to the}} combustion chamber, <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> aimed at reducing stress on other engine components {{to allow them to}} operate at peak efficiency. An analysis of the team's mechanical problems further suggested that there was a critical fault in the internal combustion chamber that was having a residual effect on the other components by placing undue stress on them, and an inefficient MGU-H that was using energy faster than it could be harvested with the net effect that the engine would lose up to [...] halfway through a lap. During the race, the car was observed to be harvesting energy {{at the top of the}} Kemmel Straight—the fastest point on the circuit—while other cars were deploying their energy at the same place. Despite Arai's insistence that the RA615H had an advantage over the Renault engine, Fernando Alonso estimated that the car was losing up to three seconds per lap to Mercedes at the [...] and was unable to attack or defend its position against the Renault-powered Scuderia Toro Rosso cars, even with the drag reduction system deployed. Alonso's comments came amidst the first public signs of tension between McLaren and Honda with reports that the team had requested that Arai be removed from his position as Project Manager. An analysis of the development carried out by rival manufacturers revealed that both Mercedes and Ferrari had found an additional [...] over the course of the season through the development of bespoke fuel blends and the reconfiguration of their combustion chambers to promote more efficient fuel burning, offsetting the gains made by Honda.|$|E
5000|$|The Hemi-6 valves are 18 degrees (included angle) {{along the}} {{crankshaft}} axis opposed valves, with intake valves {{as large as}} 1.96". The 6 <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>exhaust</b> valves open toward each other, and {{into the center of}} the combustion chamber. In addition, both valves are slightly inclined across the crankshaft axis (similar to a conventional [...] "wedge" [...] chamber).The cylinder head is a non-crossflow design, meaning the 6 <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>exhaust</b> ports are on the same (left, Australian and British passenger's side) of the engine.|$|R
50|$|Early VG30DE's used large oval <b>intake</b> ports, <b>and</b> round <b>exhaust</b> ports, {{though the}} flange {{was similar to}} the SOHC VG engine, bolt spacing was {{slightly}} different. Late VG30DE's used slightly smaller oval <b>intake</b> ports, <b>and</b> oval <b>exhaust</b> ports. The bolt spacing was shared with the round-port variant from earlier years.|$|R
5000|$|The head {{used during}} this time was the {{so-called}} [...] "rectangle port", named after its exhaust port shape. The 290 heads use smaller valves, 1.787 in <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> 1.406 in <b>exhaust,</b> {{in order to prevent}} problems with the small bore. The 343 and the AMX 390 use the same larger valve heads, 2.025 in <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> 1.625 in <b>exhaust.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{secondary}} effect of increased duration {{can be increased}} overlap, which {{is the number of}} crankshaft degrees during which both <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> valves are off their seats. It is overlap which most affects idle quality, inasmuch as the [...] "blow-through" [...] of the intake charge immediately back out thru the exhaust valve which occurs during overlap reduces engine efficiency, and is greatest during low RPM operation. In general, increasing a camshaft's duration typically increases the overlap, unless the <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> lobe centers are moved apart to compensate.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{military}} {{vehicles are}} capable of [...] "wading" [...] using waterproof screens to keep the upper hull dry. In World War II the tanks following the Sherman DDs were given waterproofed hulls and trunking was fixed to the engine <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhausts</b> {{to allow them to}} come ashore from landing craft in shallow water. The Germans gave their Tiger tank a long snorkel, essentially a long tube on the commander's hatch that allowed it to wade through four metres of water.|$|R

2500|$|The RAF 1 {{was based}} on the Renault 70/80 hp engine, being {{intended}} specifically to replace that engine in the B.E.2c. It featured larger cylinders (...) for a total displacement of 540 cubic inches (8.8 L). It was rated at 92hp (70kW) at 1,600 rpm. The heads were cast integrally with the cylinders, with the <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> valves set one above the other in an upside-down F-head configuration.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} iron block {{straight}} configurations {{the engine is}} considerably heavier than an equivalent V configuration, requiring more materials for the crank and crankcase and so increasing overall vehicle weight in even greater proportion. The long crankshaft tends to exhibit torsional vibration modes under high power, while side-valve flathead engines inhibit smooth <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas flow, limiting power. None of these disadvantages were disabling until the [...] "horsepower race" [...] initiated in the early 1950s ensured {{the dominance of the}} overhead valve V8.|$|E
50|$|The 660 engine {{incorporates}} a five valve cylinder head. There are three <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> two <b>exhaust</b> valves. The {{theory is that}} the smaller valves have a larger area at a lower weight than a four valve system <b>and</b> allow maximum <b>intake</b> flow <b>and</b> velocity.|$|R
50|$|It {{has several}} {{advantages}} over L- and F-head designs, {{but the most}} notable {{is the fact that}} the <b>intake</b> charge <b>and</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases have a more direct path into and out of the combustion chambers, increasing power, improving fuel efficiency <b>and</b> reducing noxious <b>exhaust</b> emissions.|$|R
