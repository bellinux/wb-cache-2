50|$|Dual Tension Restorer (DTR) {{can be used}} {{either as}} a {{bi-directional}} restoration device or as a tugger. It is a simple device which {{is very easy to}} use and easy to clean. It is almost entirely made up of nylon. It consists of a pusher plate attached to shaft on which the nylon bell can move freely. The bell is also fitted with a tension <b>holding</b> <b>screw</b> by which the bell can be fixed in place. There is a silicone gripper which holds the foreskin in place. The bell also has two nylon screws by which rubber bands are held in place which is passed through the shaft. The rubber band provides the required tension. The shaft with the pusher plate can be removed and replaced by a rod with a ring with hook in this arrangement it {{can be used as a}} tugger.DTR has two kinds of grippers; one is simple and the other has holes which provides a good hold on the foreskin.The tension on the foreskin by DTR depends mainly on the size of the shaft rod and the size & strength of the rubber band.|$|E

50|$|Kauri is {{considered}} a first rate timber. The whiter sapwood is generally slightly lighter in weight. Kauri is not highly resistant to rot and when used in boatbuilding must be protected from the elements with paint, varnish or epoxy to avoid rot. Its popularity with boatbuilders is due to its very long clear lengths, relative light weight and beautiful appearance when oiled or varnished. The timber has a beautiful sheen. It planes and saws very well. It <b>holds</b> <b>screws</b> and nails very well. It darkens with age to a richer golden brown colour. It does not easily crack or split or warp. Very little New Zealand kauri is now sold, and the most commonly available kauri in New Zealand is Fiji kauri, which is very similar in appearance but lighter in weight.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of {{the accuracy of the}} operators' assessments of the <b>hold</b> of bone <b>screws</b> is reported. These assessments of <b>screw</b> <b>hold</b> were compared with measurements from pullout testing. Four operators, encompassing a range of experiences in terms of screw insertion, prepared the pilot holes, and inserted a number of screws, assigning each with a score from 0 to 10 on the basis of how good the hold was felt to be. The pullout strength for each screw was then measured using a tensometer. The results were analysed and correlation coefficients calculated. Significant correlation was observed in all four subjects, with P P > 0. 001 in the other two. The conclusions were that there is a strong correlation between the subjective assessment of <b>screw</b> <b>hold</b> and actual pullout strength within the four subjects analysed.

5000|$|Chinese elm {{heartwood}} ranges in tone from reddish brown {{to light}} tan or flesh coloured, while the sapwood approaches off-white. The grain is often handsome and dramatic. Unlike other elms, freshly cut Chinese elm has a peppery or spicy odour. While it turns easily {{and will take}} a nice polish off the lathe without any finish, and it holds detail well, the fibrous wood is usually considered too tough for carving or hand tools. Chinese elm contains silica which is hard on planer knives and chainsaws, but it sands fairly easily. Like other woods with interlocking grain, planes should be kept extra sharp to prevent tearing at the grain margins. It steam-bends easily, <b>holds</b> <b>screws</b> well but pilot holes and countersinking are needed. It {{tends to be a}} [...] "lively" [...] wood, tending to warp and distort while drying.

5000|$|Cabinet body. The cabinet carcase {{is usually}} made from plywood or {{high-quality}} particle board, particularly for flat sections {{that do not}} need to be shaped, such as shelves, cabinet sides, or drawer bottoms. Typical plywood thickness in these applications varies from 3/8 in to 3/4 in 1/4 in. Stiffness and strength are important factors since cabinets are expected to retain their shape over time and avoid bend or sag while continuing to support a heavy load. The best choices for strength are plywood and higher-quality particle board; they also have the benefit of being less susceptible to warping from moisture. Stiffness increases rapidly with shelf thickness; regardless of material choice, a 3/4 in shelf is 73% stiffer than a 5/8 in shelf, even though it is only 20% thicker. Shelves made of some particle board formulations, especially where not reinforced, may sag or deform. Particle board strength and rigidity varies by formulation and is determined by the resin used. Plywood carcases are usually assembled with screws and nails while particle board carcases do not <b>hold</b> <b>screws</b> or nails as well and therefore are typically joined with glue, groove joints, or mechanical fasteners such as confirmat-cam assemblies. Generally, plywood-carcase cabinets are more expensive than particle-board-carcase cabinets.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation on the flexural and shear behaviour of a new type of fibre composite sleeper for railway turnout application. The building block of this innovative railway sleeper is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre composite skins and modified phenolic core material that has been specifically developed for civil engineering applications. Three different section configurations for railway sleepers were produced by gluing layers of fibre composite sandwich structure together in flatwise (horizontal) and in edgewise (vertical) orientations and tested under 4 -point static bending and asymmetrical beam shear tests. The effects of the orientation of sandwich lamination on the mechanical behavior of sleepers were investigated. The capacity of the fibre composite sleepers in holding spike-screws was also evaluated. The results showed that the orientation of sandwich laminations has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of fibre composite railway sleepers. The sleeper section with glued sandwich structures in the edgewise position presented appropriate strength and stiffness for railway sleeper application and has high resistance to <b>hold</b> <b>screw</b> spikes. The mechanical properties of the fibre composite sleeper are far better than most of the available composite railway sleepers and are comparable with the existing timber turnout sleepers demonstrating that the new fibre composite sleeper is a viable alternative sleeper material for railway turnouts. ...|$|R

The weight of the molded parts served as the main measure to probe the process’s capabilities. The results of the verification experiments revealed that the end-point control mode based on cavity pressure could yield better consistency of part weight than the traditional control method by holding time, however, the benefits were not significant.
