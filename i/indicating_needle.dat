5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an <b>indicating</b> <b>needle</b> and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|E

40|$|Background: Determining {{the stage}} of non-small-cell lung cancer often {{requires}} multiple preoperative tests and invasive procedures. Whole-body positron-emission tomography (PET) may simplify and improve the evaluation of patients with this tumor. Methods: We prospectively compared {{the ability of a}} standard approach to staging (computed tomography [CT], ultrasonography, bone scanning, and, when <b>indicated,</b> <b>needle</b> biopsies) and one involving PET to detect metastases in mediastinal lymph nodes and at distant sites in 102 patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. The presence of mediastinal metastatic disease was confirmed histopathologically. Distant metastases that were detected by PET were further evaluated by standard imaging tests and biopsies. Patients were followed postoperatively for six months by standard methods to detect occult metastases. Logistic-regression analysis was used to evaluate the ability of PET and CT to identify malignant mediastinal lymph nodes. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of PET for the detection of mediastinal metastases were 91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 81 to 100 percent) and 86 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 78 to 94 percent), respectively. The corresponding values for CT were 75 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 60 to 90 percent) and 66 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 55 to 77 percent). When the results of PET and CT were adjusted for each other, only PET results were positively correlated with the histopathological findings in mediastinal lymph nodes (P Conclusions: PET improves the rate of detection of local and distant metastases in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

40|$|Abstract — Many medical {{procedures}} involve {{the use of}} needles, but targeting accuracy can be limited due to obstacles in the needle’s path, shifts in target position caused by tissue deformation, and undesired bending of the needle after insertion. In order to address these limitations, we have developed robotic systems that actively steer a needle in soft tissue. A bevel (asymmetric) tip causes the needle to bend during insertion, and steering is enhanced when the needle is very flexible. An experimental needle steering robot was designed that includes force/torque sensing, horizontal needle insertion, stereo image data acquisition, and controlled actuation of needle rotation and translation. Experiments were performed with a phantom tissue {{to determine the effects}} of insertion velocity and bevel tip angle on the needle path, as well as the forces acting on the needle during insertion. Results <b>indicate</b> that <b>needle</b> steering inside tissue does not depend on insertion velocity, but does depend on bevel tip angle. In addition, the forces acting on the needle are directly related to the insertion velocity. Index Terms — Keywords: medical robotics, needle steering, nonholonomic systems...|$|R
