40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{critically}} examine the reasons behind the relatively poor level of implementation of e-services. To this end, records management procedures in a particular Belgian federal administration — the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) Employment, Labor and Social Dialogue — will be studied. Based on this concrete and relevant case study, the authors examine how cross-organizational differences in terms of implementation speed of <b>digital</b> <b>workflows</b> can hinder the development of innovative e-services. By doing so, the authors raise relevant questions about the efficacy of <b>digital</b> <b>workflows</b> and work processes. The impact on the consultation and exchange of government records amongpublic services and towards citizens will be examined as well. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Trials {{comparing}} the overall performance of digital {{with that of}} conventional workflows in restorative dentistry are needed. PURPOSE The purpose of the third {{part of a series}} of investigations was to test whether the marginal and internal fit of monolithic crowns fabricated with fully <b>digital</b> <b>workflows</b> differed from that of crowns fabricated with the conventional workflow. MATERIAL AND METHODS In each of 10 participants, 5 monolithic lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated for the same abutment tooth according to a randomly generated sequence. <b>Digital</b> <b>workflows</b> were applied for the fabrication of 4 crowns using the Lava, iTero, Cerec inLab, and Cerec infinident systems. The conventional workflow included a polyvinyl siloxane impression, manual waxing, and heat-press technique. The discrepancy between the crown and the tooth was registered using the replica technique with polyvinyl siloxane material. The dimensions of the marginal discrepancy (Discrepancymarginal) and the internal discrepancy in 4 different regions of interest (Discrepancyshoulder, Discrepancyaxial, Discrepancycusp, and Discrepancyocclusal) were assessed using light microscopy. Post hoc Student t test with Bonferroni correction was applied to detect differences (α=. 05). RESULTS Discrepancymarginal was 83. 6 ± 51. 1 μm for the Cerec infinident, 90. 4 ± 66. 1 μm for the conventional, 94. 3 ± 58. 3 μm for the Lava, 127. 8 ± 58. 3 μm for the iTero, and 141. 5 ± 106. 2 μm for the Cerec inLab workflow. The differences between the treatment modalities were not statistically significant (P>. 05). Discrepancyshoulder was 82. 2 ± 42. 4 μm for the Cerec infinident, 97. 2 ± 63. 8 μm for the conventional, 103. 4 ± 52. 0 μm for the Lava, 133. 5 ± 73. 0 μm for the iTero, and 140. 0 ± 86. 6 μm for the Cerec inLab workflow. Only the differences between the Cerec infinident and the Cerec inLab were statistically significant (P=. 036). The conventionally fabricated crowns revealed significantly lower values in Discrepancycusp and Discrepancyocclusal than all the crowns fabricated with <b>digital</b> <b>workflows</b> (P<. 05). CONCLUSIONS In terms of marginal crown fit, {{no significant differences were found}} between the conventional and <b>digital</b> <b>workflows</b> for the fabrication of monolithic lithium disilicate crowns. In the occlusal regions, the conventionally manufactured crowns revealed better fit than the digitally fabricated crowns. Chairside milling resulted in less favorable crown fit than centralized milling production...|$|R

50|$|Filmed in Supermarionation {{is notable}} for the filmmakers' {{efforts to create}} new puppet and special effects {{sequences}} that match {{the look and feel}} of the programmes produced by AP films during the 1960s. Dialogue was recorded with members of the original Thunderbirds voice cast and puppets and sets were recreated to as close to the specification of the original Supermarionation series as possible. In addition to attempting to recreate 1960s film-making techniques, 21st century methods were also employed in the interest of matching the original productions. Although special effects sequences were shot on 35mm film stock, puppet sequences were captured digitally. This allowed for the image to be manipulated in post production to better match the unique qualities of 1960s film photography. The <b>digital</b> <b>workflow</b> also allowed for wire removal and digital set extensions to be utilised.|$|E
