40|$|Ever-growing {{impact of}} rubber and its {{products}} form an inseparable and integral part in human life. But today, rubber industries suffer {{from lack of}} quality latex for production. Over the last few decades, various efforts {{have been carried out}} to study the ability of Fatty Acid soaps to enhance stability of latex upon mechanical forces. However, an investigation has never been carried out in Sri Lanka on property variation of low quality latex upon soap addition. This study was undertaken with the view to fulfill this requirement. Current study consists of determination of MST and other properties of low quality latex and brief investigation on anti foaming behaviour of phenol on latex base. Latex was obtained with absence of added soap on a special request from centrifuge plant of Lalan group. They were collected from small holders of Matale, which represents the non-specific climatic conditions for latex production. Soap was added in different strengths at different maturity times. Following properties were investigated ut intervals: MST, <b>KOH</b> <b>number,</b> Viscosity, Foaming Height, and Conductivity. Anti-foaming behaviour of phenol on latex base was determined. Results of this study provide information of low quality latex upon soap addition and aging. Out 01 " entire investigated properties response to the soap was remarkable in MST and Foaming Height upon aging. Viscosity showed great variation within 3 weeks maturation. Prevalence of soap was critical between soap levels of 4. 2 x 10 - 4 and 5. 0 x 10 - 4 moles per 100 g of latex. Results suggest that the system attain to critical micelle concentration within this range. Minimum soap level that is necessary to create observable change in MST and Foaming Height lies between 0. 5 x 10 - 4 and 0. 84 x I 0 - 4 moles per 100 g latex. Soap level of 0. 5 x I 0 - 4 makes great variatiohs in Viscosity, Conductivity and KOH No. Effect of soap on Conductivity and KOH No diminishes after 8. 41 x Io' moles of soap. Both properties are responsible for the total molecules that are present in the ionized form and not the total molecules in the medium. Since, the soap effect upon KOH No diminishes after certain soap level it cannot be used as an identification of soap addition to latex. However added soap can be identified by variation in the Foaming Height. Significant relationship between soap addition and foaming height reveals that the foreign soap molecules increase the froth formation in latex. Phenol addition can reduce the foaming in latex. But it reduces the MST of the latex and hence detri mental for the quality of latex. Variation in MST and Viscosity by deliberate soap addition primarily causes by Fatty Acid soap ions that are adsorbed at the particle surfaces. Variations in KOH No, Conductivity and Foaming Height has brought about by consequent changes taking place in the medium...|$|E

40|$|Abstracts: The OH-initiated {{reaction}} rate constants (kOH) are {{of great importance}} to measure atmospheric behaviors of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) in the environment. The rate constants of 75 PCDDs with the OH radical at 298. 15 K have been calculated using high level molecular orbital theory, and the rate constants (kα, kβ, kγ and kOH) were further analyzed by the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study. According to the QSAR models, the relations between rate constants and the numbers and positions of Cl atoms, {{the energy of the}} highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), the difference ΔEHOMO-LUMO between EHOMO and ELUMO, and the dipole of oxidizing agents (D) were discussed. It was found that EHOMO is the main factor in the <b>kOH.</b> The <b>number</b> of Cl atoms is more effective than the number of relative position of these Cl atoms in the kOH. The kOH decreases with the increase of the substitute number of Cl atoms...|$|R
40|$|Increase in the ion {{concentration}} in the medium was found to increase conductivity and potassium hydroxide <b>number</b> (<b>KOH</b> No) in natural rubber latex (NRL). Addition of long chain fatty acids can increase the {{ion concentration}} in themedium and stability of NRL. A series of concentrated natural rubber latex samples from three different areas with different soils and climatic conditions were tested for the parameters such as KOH No and conductivity. They have been measured {{over a period of}} 62 days, upon addition of soap to natural rubber latex concentrate. The result showed that there was a strong positive linear correlation between conductivity and KOH No. The regression equation to express the relationship between the variables has also been found...|$|R
50|$|Kim {{was born}} in Iowa City, Iowa on April 10, 1976 to South Korean parents who had met and married in Korea, then moved to the U.S. together. When Kim was 2, {{his family moved to}} Chicago. Two years later his brother Marvin was born. Though no member of Kim's family was {{involved}} in music (his mother is a registered dietician, while his father is a communications professor), as a young boy he enjoyed listening to classical violin recordings at home with his mother. Soon, Kim asked for violin lessons, as had his friend Jennifer <b>Koh</b> and a <b>number</b> of his other friends around the same time. His parents enrolled him in a local Suzuki class, where he thrived under the tutelage of Suzuki instructor William Fuhrburg.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{devices in}} silicon often require mirror-quality surfaces. Membranes etched in KOH using the {{electrochemically}} controlled etch (ECE) stop {{have been found}} to have sidewalls less smooth than expected from the (111) etch-bordering planes. Furthermore, the membrane surfaces were also not as smooth as could be expected from the wafer surface quality before epitaxial growth, despite the use of the ECE stop. The influence of the concentration and temperature of the KOH solution on the roughness of both membrane and sidewalls has been investigated. The concentration of the KOH solution was varied between 5 and 50 weight percent, and the temperature between 30 and 100 degrees C. It was found that the membrane surface quality is highly dependent on the initial surface condition and the solution conditions, while the sidewall surface quality is primarily dependent on the oxygen content of the wafer and the thermal budget due to the integration of active bipolar devices in the epilayer prior to etching in <b>KOH.</b> A <b>number</b> of measures to be taken before, during, and after the etching for improving the membrane as well as the sidewall surface smoothness are presented. Under the best conditions, the etched surfaces had a roughness of less than 0. 1 mu m peak to peak. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of artemisinin-resistant malaria in Southeast Asia {{is a major}} problem. The fact that many people become infected with malaria when they are outside has prompted the development of ‘spatial’ rather than topical repellents. The respective effects of one or four slow-release emanators of metofluthrin, a pyrethroid, were tested in Pailin, Pursat and <b>Koh</b> Kong, Cambodia. <b>Numbers</b> of mosquitoes counted in outdoor landing catches when one or four emanators were suspended close to the collector were compared with control collections. In Pailin, the effects of emanators on catches in Furvela tent traps and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps suspended underneath houses were also investigated. Rate ratios {{were used to determine}} differences. A total of 29 [*] 255 mosquitoes were collected over 2934 [*]h of landing collections, 87 nights of tent trapping and 81 nights of light trap capture. In Pailin, landing rates were reduced by 48 % by a single emanator and by 67 % by four emanators (P[*] [*] 0. 05). These findings suggest that although the product can produce a significant effect, it requires further improvement...|$|R
40|$|Titanium-sapphire laser {{ablation}} of silicon {{was investigated in}} atmospheric air, water and 20 % <b>KOH</b> solution. The <b>number</b> of overlapping pulses was tuned between 3 and 1000 by changing the processing time. The ablated surfaces were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis and stylus profilometry. In each ambient, plasma formation was observed during ab-lation. X-ray microanalysis indicated that the process starts with surface oxidation in case of air and water ambient. With increasing pulse number the surface was roughened, resulting in larger struc-tures. Crater formation was observed in air and in water, with higher etching rate in the latter case. The depth profile of the ablation holes and grooves is rather different for this two ambient. Narrow conical grooves were observed in case of ablation in air, while flat bottom grooves were produced in water. Laser processing in KOH solution {{did not result in}} etching, only the native oxide layer was removed. Etching occurred in these areas, if the samples were left in KOH solution for a longer time. Based on these observations the material removal by fs laser pulses is attributed to evaporation and reactions of Si with radicals in the laser induced plasma, such as atomic or ionic oxygen. The appli-cation of KOH introduces K ions or atoms into the laser induced plasma, which may react faster with oxygen than with Si, thus resulting in decrease in etching rate during laser processing...|$|R
