2500|$|In May 2010, The NTSB {{warned that}} the {{low-pressure}} turbine rotor disks could fail. Four uncontained failures of CF6-45/50 engines in the preceding two years prompted it to issue an [...] "urgent" [...] recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft : none of the four incidents of rotor disk imbalance and subsequent failure resulted in an accident, but parts of the engine did penetrate the <b>engine</b> <b>housing</b> in each case ...|$|E
2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the <b>engine</b> <b>housing,</b> from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Rotor sealing. This {{is still}} a minor problem as the <b>engine</b> <b>housing</b> has vastly {{different}} temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials leads to imperfect sealing. Additionally, {{both sides of the}} seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is being exposed to fuel, allowing for oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase. To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of engine. The [...] "heat pipes" [...] effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine, with resulting decreases in efficiency and performance. In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from 231°C to 129°C, and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of engine from 159°C to 18°C.|$|E

50|$|Jet {{turbine engines}} employ both poly and mono {{crystalline}} components {{to take advantage}} of their individual strengths. The disks of the high-pressure turbine, which are near the central hub of the engine are polycrystalline.

Both drove a two-bladed propeller. Electric generator and starter were provided. Fuel and oil tanks were in the enclosed cabin, which had two side-by-side seats, with a large transparency in the wing centre section above them and accessed via a door on each side. The cabin was equipped with dual controls, radio and blind-flying instrumentation. Behind the seats there was [...] of luggage space in which loads of up to 100 lb could be accommodated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pilot and}} {{observer}} {{were located in}} tandem cockpits located {{high up in the}} front of the deep, narrow fuselage, creating a decidedly [...] "curious" [...] profile. They sat atop the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop in front and the weapons bay to the rear of them. The design had originally called for the tried and tested Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engine but the Royal Navy had made it policy to phase out piston engines, in order that supplies of highly flammable high octane aviation fuel need not be carried in large quantities on ships. The turboprop engine also caused less airframe vibration so that the pilot could be sat directly over it with the absence of a piston engine ignition system which would have interfered with the radar scanner mounted below the <b>engine</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

50|$|The stock Chrysler {{engine was}} {{modified}} for aeronautics use {{by removing the}} flywheel and cooling fan. The automotive electrical ignition system was replaced by an air plane magneto and a new lighter exhaust system was installed. The standard carburetor {{was replaced by the}} updraught type where the air entered from below and exited {{at the top of the}} unit. The cylinder heads were replaced by new ones made from aluminium which had the effect of decreasing the weight of the engine while increasing the compression ratio from 6.7:1 to 7:1. The reduction gearbox was mounted on the <b>engine</b> <b>housing</b> directly connected to the crankshaft, lubricated by the engine oil system.The propeller was driven via the gearbox using a 2:1 gear-reduction ratio, which enabled the engine to operate at full power driving the propeller at its optimum speed of 1800 rpm.

50|$|The Porsche-Diesel Standard 218 has the Porsche F 218 engine, an {{air-cooled}} two cylinder {{four stroke}} diesel engine with swirl chamber injection. Unlike its predecessor Porsche Nr. 2066, the Porsche F 218 has an aluminum crankcase {{instead of a}} cast iron crankcase. Bore and stroke of the engine are 95 × 116 mm, the displacement is 1644 cm³. The <b>engine</b> <b>housing</b> consists of two parts. The crankshaft with balance weights bolted onto, the conrods, the in-line injection pump by Bosch and the aluminum valve pushrods have been taken from the Porsche Nr. 2066 engine. It has a radial cooling fan. The crankshaft has three bearings. A pressure lubrication lubricates the engine, the air is cleaned by an oil-bath air cleaner. The overhead valves are driven by a gear driven camshaft. Each piston has five piston rings. The Flywheel has a radius of 40 cm. At 2000 min−1 the engine produces a power of 18,4 kW and delivers a torque of 88 N·m. The maximum torque of 91 N·m is served up at 1800 min−1. The minimum compression of the engine must be 18,6 bar, the compression ratio is 19:1. The fuel injetion pressure is 147 bar. The cetane number of the fuel must not be fewer than 44.|$|E
