50|$|The Rocket Ball, {{patented}} in 1848 by Walter Hunt, {{consisted of}} a lead bullet with a deep hollow in the rear, running {{a majority of the}} length of the cartridge. The hollow, like that of the Minie ball, served to seal the bullet into the bore, but Rocket Ball put the cavity to further use. By packing the deep cavity with powder, and sealing it with a cap with a small hole in the rear for ignition, the Rocket Ball replaced the earlier paper cartridge with a <b>durable</b> <b>package</b> capable of being fed from a magazine. The cap was blown out of the bore upon firing. The Rocket Ball was used in magazine fed lever action guns, allowing the first easily manufactured repeating single chamber firearms.|$|E
50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and air driven motors. Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a built-up custom unit, designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more <b>durable.</b> <b>Package</b> units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. Built-up units are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged hoist. A machine shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a built-up unit to meet durability, performance, and repairability requirements. NASA has also seen a change in the use of package hoists. The NASA Astronaut training pool, for example, utilizes cranes with packaged hoists.|$|E

In particular, transport of a batch of chemicals by means of disposable fibre drums vs. reusable steel drums is investigated from a life cycle perspective, and the associated environmental impact in terms of Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Gross Energy Requirement and solid waste generation is assessed. Results prove beyond reasonable doubt that, even {{in the case of}} <b>durable</b> <b>packaging</b> containers requiring the use of comparatively energy-intensive materials for their production, the reuse scenario is characterized by lower environmental impact indicators across the board, and as such is the most advisable and environmentally sound optionPreprin...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{viability}} monitoring is {{an important}} part of biosafety evaluation for the detection of toxic effects on cells caused by nanomaterials, preferably by label-free, noninvasive, fast, and cost effective methods. These requirements can be met by monitoring cell viability with a capacitance-sensing integrated circuit (IC) microchip. The capacitance provides a measurement of the surface attachment of adherent cells as an indication of their health status. However, the moist, warm, and corrosive biological environment requires reliable packaging of the sensor chip. In this work, a second generation of low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology was combined with flip-chip bonding to provide a <b>durable</b> <b>package</b> compatible with cell culture. The LTCC-packaged sensor chip was integrated with a printed circuit board, data acquisition device, and measurement-controlling software. The packaged sensor chip functioned well in the presence of cell medium and cells, with output voltages depending on the medium above the capacitors. Moreover, the manufacturing of microfluidic channels in the LTCC package was demonstrated. Funding Agencies|Academy of Finland [268944]; TEKES [1427 / 31 / 2010]</p...|$|E

40|$|Metal oxide {{films such}} as SiO 2 are known to provide an {{effective}} barrier to the transport of moisture as well as gaseous species through polymeric films. Such thin film coatings {{have a tendency to}} crack upon flexure of the polymeric substrate. Sputter co-deposition of SiO 2 with 4 to 15 percent fluoropolymers was demonstrated to produce thin films with glass-like barrier properties that have significant increases in strain to failure over pure glass films which improves their tolerance to flexure on polymeric substrates. Deposition techniques capable of producing these films on polymeric substrates are suitable for <b>durable</b> food <b>packaging</b> and oxidation/corrosion protection applications...|$|R
40|$|Research has {{identified}} that humidity plays a fundamental {{role on the}} conversion of hydrogen sulphide into sulphuric acid during corrosion of concrete in gravity sewers and that potentially minor reductions in humidity can reduce corrosion rates. The high levels of hydrogen sulfide and the high relative humidity (typically > 98 %) that leads to condensation in sewer air makes humidity measurement within such environment difficult. The work presented here aims to tackle this issue by applying a more <b>durable</b> <b>packaging</b> that could withstand the harsh environment. The humidity monitoring element in the probe {{is based on a}} moisture-sensitive polymer coated fibre grating in series with an uncoated grating for temperature compensation. To optimize the device to be operational, two designs of the probe assembly were configured using different material, thus aiming to provide long term durability. The aim of the probe design evaluated was to achieve both a good sensitivity to humidity and to protect the sensing elements from the aggressive environment and which had rendered ineffective the electrical sensors placed in the sewer and used for cross-comparison. The packaged sensors were trailed in situ over a period of 5 months, during which the sensors were constantly subjected to the prevailing high, but varying levels of humidity and hydrogen sulfide gas. The results show the significant promise for tailor made packaging which will protect the sensor element from the harsh environment while retaining good sensitivity. These outcomes show a promising future for optical fiber sensors to be employed for the measurement of humidity in the long term in harsh environmental applications...|$|R

40|$|Polypropylene (PP) is {{a widely}} used plastic with {{consumer}} applications ranging from food packaging to automotive parts, including car battery casings. To differentiate it from other recyclable plastics, it is designated as # 5. Here, the factors contributing to PP recycling rates are briefly reviewed. Considerations include collection and separation efficiency, processing chemistry, and market dynamics for the products derived from recyclates. In 1970, recycling of plastics from the munic-ipal solid waste (MSW) stream was virtuallynonexistent. By 1994, the recycling rate {{of different types of}} plastics found in the United States MSW (containers and <b>packaging,</b> <b>durable</b> goods, and nondurable goods) increased to 4. 7 % (1), and it reached 8 % in 2010 (2).

40|$|Dedicated multi-project wafer (MPW) {{runs for}} {{photonic}} integrated circuits (PICs) from Si foundries mean that researchers and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) can now afford {{to design and}} fabricate Si photonic chips. While these bare Si-PICs are adequate for testing new device and circuit designs on a probe-station, they cannot be developed into prototype devices, or tested outside of the laboratory, without first packaging them into a <b>durable</b> module. Photonic <b>packaging</b> of PICs is significantly more challenging, and currently orders of magnitude more expensive, than electronic packaging, because it calls for robust micron-level alignment of optical components, precise real-time temperature control, and often a high degree of vertical and horizontal electrical integration. Photonic packaging is perhaps the most significant bottleneck in the development of commercially relevant integrated photonic devices.

40|$|Packing fragile {{heritage}} artefacts is {{a challenge}} almost all heritage organisations {{have to deal with}} when faced with the task of transporting or storing the artefacts. The packaging solution requires fitting the artefact correctly in order to ensure the protection and safety of the item; but also to be easy and cost effective to produce. Different techniques have been traditionally used, such as double boxing, padding negative spaces and cushioning braces. However, the introduction of 3 D technologies for documenting these artefacts enables innovative uses of this data for packaging purposes. Hence, this paper proposes the use of the generative modelling language in order to produce unique 3 D-fitted containers for packaging heritage artefacts which fit tightly the artefact, and can be made to be reusable and more <b>durable</b> than traditional <b>packaging</b> solutions. We propose to adopt an octet lattice as a low density internal structure to the proposed container. By combining the parametric package design, 3 D meshes acquisition and 3 D printing techniques, we present a technology based solution to the traditional problem of protecting these valuable artefacts for transportation and/or storing purposes...|$|R
40|$|Various {{large-scale}} neutron sources already build {{or to be}} constructed, {{are important}} for materials research and life science research. For all these neutron sources, neutron detectors are very important aspect. However, {{there is a lack}} of a high-performance and low-cost neutron beam monitor that provides time and temporal resolution. The objective of this SBIR Phase I research, collaboratively performed by Midwest Optoelectronics, LLC (MWOE), the University of Toledo (UT) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is to demonstrate the feasibility for amorphous silicon based neutron beam monitors that are pixilated, reliable, <b>durable,</b> fully <b>packaged,</b> and fabricated with high yield using low-cost method. During the Phase I effort, work as been focused in the following areas: 1) Deposition of high quality, low-defect-density, low-stress a-Si films using very high frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (VHF PECVD) at high deposition rate and with low device shunting; 2) Fabrication of Si/SiO 2 /metal/p/i/n/metal/n/i/p/metal/SiO 2 / device for the detection of alpha particles which are daughter particles of neutrons through appropriate nuclear reactions; and 3) Testing of various devices fabricated for alpha and neutron detection; As the main results: · High quality, low-defect-density, low-stress a-Si films have been successfully deposited using VHF PECVD on various low-cost substrates; · Various single-junction and double junction detector devices have been fabricated; · The detector devices fabricated have been systematically tested and analyzed. · Some of the fabricated devices are found to successfully detect alpha particles. Further research is required to bring this Phase I work beyond the feasibility demonstration toward the final prototype devices.
