During his time with TASW, Michaels replaced Nick Kiniski in the American Breed tag team, teaming with Paul Diamond.

5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 1995 college {{football}} season <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> and Virginia Tech, the 1995 Sugar Bowl provided a final opportunity for players to demonstrate their skills on the field prior to the next NFL Draft. Several players from both teams announced their intention to enter the draft and attempt to play in the National Football League. Star Virginia Tech defender Cornell Brown was not one of these players. Prior to the draft, he announced his intention to remain at Tech for his senior year.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun, {{though as}} avid a proponent <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> {{acquisition}} as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims.

5|$|Estimates {{for total}} death toll range from 55 to 153. Death toll {{estimates}} <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> range from 17 to 38, though official records {{indicate that the}} 38 deaths occurred in Mexico rather than Texas. Estimates of the deaths in Mexico, where records are less complete, vary more widely. Several of the deaths in Texas were homeless people attempting to enter the United States, {{and as a result}} their deaths were not counted. Monetary damage figures are not available, but it is known that flooding from Alice caused considerable damage to crops, primarily cotton.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the {{combined}} {{enrollment in the}} Texas Tech University System was greater than 42,000 students—a 48% increase since 2000.

5|$|On April 12, 1716, an {{expedition}} led by Domingo Ramón left San Juan Bautista <b>for</b> <b>Texas,</b> intending to establish four missions and a presidio {{which would be}} guarded by twenty-five soldiers. The party of 75people included 3children, 7women, 18soldiers, and 10missionaries. These were the first recorded female settlers in Spanish Texas. After marrying a Spanish woman, St. Denis also joined the Spanish expedition.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, 1863, General Ewing retaliated {{against the}} Confederate guerrillas by issuing General Order No. 11, an {{evacuation}} order that evicted almost 20,000 people from four Missouri counties and burned {{many of their}} homes. The order was intended to rob the guerrillas of their support network in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill's leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County and left <b>for</b> <b>Texas.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the ground, Texas' rushing {{offense was}} led by two running backs: Ricky Williams and Shon Mitchell. Together, they {{averaged}} 207 yards per game, good enough for No. 22 nationally. Mitchell started at running back and gained 1,099 rushing yards. Williams accumulated 990 rushing yards during the regular season. That figure was a record <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> freshmen. Protecting Williams, Mitchell, and Brown was a successful offensive line led by All-America guard Dan Neil.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence <b>for</b> <b>Texas.</b> After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac in June, local leaders began {{calling for a}} public meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step towards revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{veterans}} included Neely, Frank Godchaux, Doc Kuhn, Tot McCullough, Pink Wade, Alvin Bell, Alf Sharpe, and Percy Conyers.

Tackle Tex Bradford had played <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> Christian University for two years; after sitting out a year at Vanderbilt, he was eligible to play for the Commodores.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his strong support <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing {{the new republic}} until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Laws of Scourge became Sarcófago's {{best selling}} record, and {{responsible}} for their most extensive touring schedule to this date. Their tour trek also included their first international dates: they visited South American countries such as Peru and Chile, and in Europe they played shows in Portugal and Spain.

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Pascagoula, Mississippi {{to the mouth of}} the Mississippi River as Bertha became {{a tropical storm}}. The warning occurred 90minutes before the storm made landfall. All warnings were discontinued when Bertha weakened to a tropical depression over Louisiana. No watches or warnings were required <b>for</b> <b>Texas,</b> due to the improbability of it re-intensifying.|$|E

5|$|The same Senate {{that had}} {{rejected}} the Tyler–Calhoun treaty {{by a margin}} of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session. (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.|$|E
5|$|This {{meeting was}} also the first-ever match-up between the twostoried programs; the twoteams had {{combined}} to play 1,594games before meeting. <b>For</b> <b>Texas,</b> it also meant playing a second Big Ten Conference powerhouse soon after winning the first-ever matchup between Texas and the University of Michigan {{at the end of}} the 2004 season.|$|E
5|$|When University of Kentucky head {{football}} coach Bear Bryant left <b>for</b> <b>Texas</b> A University after the 1953 season, Collier accepted an offer to succeed him. He stayed at Kentucky for eight years, a span during which the Wildcats football team had a 41–36–3 record, including a 5–2–1 record against arch-rival Tennessee. Notable wins included a 1954 victory at Georgia Tech, then ranked 15th in the AP Poll, and defeats of eighth-ranked Ole Miss in 1955 and 12th-ranked Tennessee in 1957. In 1954, Collier was named {{the coach of the}} year in the Southeastern Conference.|$|E
