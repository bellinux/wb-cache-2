50|$|Turbo cornutus, {{common name}} the <b>horned</b> <b>turban,</b> is {{a species of}} sea snail, marine {{gastropod}} mollusk in the family Turbinidae.|$|E
5000|$|Turbo cornutus can {{be found}} in {{relatively}} shallow coastal waters (up to 30 meters deep). It {{can be found}} around the Japanese islands from Honshu to Kyushu and Okinawa. It feeds on various kinds of algae. Young <b>horned</b> <b>turban</b> shells eat red-turf algae, while adults eat larger seaweed.|$|E

Larvae {{have a very}} short period as free-floating plankton at approximately five days, after which they settle and begin to develop a shell. The planktonic and early shell-growing stages are highly dangerous times for young <b>horned</b> <b>turban</b> shells, and they are eaten in large numbers.|$|E
