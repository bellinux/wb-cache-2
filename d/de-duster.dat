40|$|This paper {{describes}} a laboratory-scale {{study on the}} use of recirculating cyclones as reaction chambers for dry scrubbing of gaseous HCl with solid slaked lime particles. This gas cleaning system combines a numerically optimized reverse flow gas cyclone (RS_VHE geometry) with a straight-through cyclone concentrator, which simultaneously increases the capture of the solid particles and promotes their partial recirculation. A laboratory-scale study was undertaken to test this technology and to compare its performance to a modified Stairmand HE reverse flow cyclone without recirculation. The experimental conditions were: reaction temperature ≈ 326 K, gas flow rate ≈ 2. 9 x 10 - 4 Nm 3. s- 1 and relative humidity of the gas ≈ 8. 5 %. The experimental variables tested were the solids load (1. 0 - 9. 2 x 10 - 7 kg. s- 1) and HCl concentration (0. 4 - 2. 8 x 10 - 2 mol. m- 3) in the inlet gas. The experimentally obtained particulate removal efficiencies with the recirculating cyclones (≈ 98 %) were higher than those obtained with the Stairmand HE cyclone (≈ 93 %), with the additional advantage of having significantly lower pressure drop. As for the acid removal efficiencies (≈ 10 to 96 %), {{no significant differences were found}} between the two systems tested under the same experimental conditions. The possibility of using optimized recirculating cyclones for gas cleaning in a dry scrubbing process is very promising, since this is a low cost technology, highly efficient both for the removal of acid gases and for the capture of solid particles, which has the advantage of not requiring a post-reaction <b>de-duster.</b> The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through the contract POCTI/EQU/ 37992 / 2001 /FEDER and the scholarship BD 8191 / 200...|$|E
