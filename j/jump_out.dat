5|$|Some marine halfbeaks, {{including}} Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, {{are known}} for their ability to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the water and glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks.|$|E

After talking to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Johann Fennhoff about his marital issues, Dooley is hypnotized by the latter into aiding the Russians before being placed in an exploding vest designed by Stark. Dooley manages to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> a nearby window before the vest explodes and kills him, saving the SSR agents.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, {{and the main}} objective involves Charlie the Chef baking a cake from evil, sentient ingredients. The five ingredients vary from Mixed Peel, Chunky Chocolate, Crafty Cheese, Sneaky Sugar and Colonel Custard, who will all <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the pantry and try and avoid the player whenever possible.|$|E

5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will <b>jump</b> <b>out.</b> Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will <b>jump</b> <b>out,</b> but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

5|$|The girl, near death, {{is being}} ministered to by paramedics, fantasizing and being 'sexually aroused {{by a large}} python and writhing on a bed that lit up {{in time with the}} music, while {{surrounded}} by a group of bemused, semi-naked dancers'. When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
5|$|They then {{discover}} {{that they are in}} the sheriff's home, who returns soon after. Peter tries to pretend to be his wife while hiding in a closet, and he convinces the sheriff to let the fugitives go free. This exchange ends with the sheriff asking for a hug, which makes Peter <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the closet and reveal the group. The entire police force then comes after them, until they are able to jump on a train and arrive in Quahog, only to be met by the sheriff and his deputies. Joe, however, had called ahead and arranged for the Quahog police department to arrive and rescue them. Joe then smashes the sheriff's vehicle, shoots him in the leg, and demands he leave Quahog.|$|E

Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke.|$|E
5|$|Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos' {{group to}} the Mercury Lighthouse, joined by Ivan and Mia. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from {{activating}} Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star. Saturos' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac's party remaining in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage: the female Jupiter Adept, Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse with the Venus Star, and are confronted by Isaac's party immediately thereafter. Attempting to annihilate their opponents, Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two-headed dragon, but Isaac's party slay Saturos and Menardi. Directly following this, Sheba falls from the lighthouse and Felix proceeds to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> after her. The remnants of Saturos' group (unbeknownst to the players until Golden Sun: The Lost Age), headed by Felix and Alex, continue their quest to light the remaining two Lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard's open seas to continue their mission.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot. He went to the free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} up from Sarah, Lydia becomes jealous of Zoe and Sarah's friendship. Lydia then begins {{going out with}} Sarah again although she is more invested in the relationship with Sarah. Lydia's true colours start to show when she tells Sarah she has received dead flowers on her and former girlfriend Charlotte's anniversary, she tells Sarah she thinks they are from Charlotte, she then shows the same bouquet to Charlotte and accuses Zoe. It is then revealed during an argument with Charlotte that Lydia tried to kill herself when she and Charlotte split up. Lydia sees Sarah and Zoe going on an adventure holiday with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and is jealous when she takes Zoe. Lydia follows them and has an argument with Sarah. She continues to pretend Charlotte is stalking her {{in order to gain}} sympathy.
