5|$|Eddie Costa {{was born}} in Atlas, Pennsylvania, near Mount Carmel, in Northumberland County. He was taught and {{influenced}} on piano by his older, musically trained brother, Bill, and a local piano teacher. Eddie took paid jobs as a pianist {{from the age of}} 15. In contrast to his piano training, he was self-taught on vibes. In 1949 Costa played and toured for a few months with violinist Joe Venuti. He then worked for his brother in New York until, in 1951, <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> drafted into the army. During his time in the armed forces, Costa performed in Japan and Korea. Upon release after two years, Costa again worked around the New York area, including for bands led by Kai Winding, Johnny Smith, and Don Elliott.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E

25|$|The main feud for the SmackDown! brand {{was between}} Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. In the {{beginning}} of 2004, Angle and Guerrero were allies while Guerrero feuded with his nephew Chavo Guerrero. On SmackDown! on January 29, Eddie Guerrero last eliminated Angle in a 15-man Royal Rumble style match to earn {{a shot at the}} WWE Championship. At the prior pay per view, No Way Out, Kurt Angle defeated The Big Show and John Cena in a Triple threat match to earn himself a title shot at WrestleMania on the same event where Guerrero defeated Brock Lesnar for the WWE title. On the February 19 episode of SmackDown!, Angle was the special guest referee in a match between WWE Champion, Eddie Guerrero and WWE Cruiserweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero. As <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> about to close in on the victory, Angle stopped the 3 count and would turn on Guerrero. On the following week's SmackDown!, Guerrero was eager to get his revenge on Angle while looking for him but when he finally saw Angle, he shoved SmackDown General Manager, Paul Heyman and his assistant Dawn Marie out of his way only for Heyman to have Guerrero escorted out of the arena by security. Guerrero was scheduled to team with John Cena to take on Chavo Guerrero and the Big Show in a tag team match on that night but due to Guerrero being escorted out of the arena, he was replaced by Rey Mysterio for the tag match, which Mysterio and Cena won. Later that night, Angle appeared and stated that he attacked Guerrero for the SmackDown! fans and for the WWE. He then referred to Guerrero as a former drug addict that shouldn't represent SmackDown! as the WWE Champion and stated that one day people would be thanking him for a champion to be proud of. Guerrero then re-entered the arena and assaulted Angle until he got arrested by orders of Paul Heyman. As Guerrero got taken out of the building in handcuffs, Angle made some insulting comments to him before the officers drove away with Guerrero in the Police car. On the March 4 episode of SmackDown!, during Guerrero's match with Heyman (while he was handcuffed), Angle interfered and knocked him down a few times until Guerrero defended himself by spitting on Angle. As Guerrero begged Angle to nail him with the WWE Championship belt, Angle did so and raised title the belt overhead to hype their match at Wrestlemania XX.|$|E

5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when <b>Eddie</b> <b>is</b> playing Findley, <b>Eddie</b> <b>is</b> positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she <b>is</b> below <b>Eddie</b> in two shot while in a three shot <b>Eddie</b> <b>is</b> still below Bert. When <b>Eddie</b> <b>is</b> kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him.

500|$|Mega Man series artist Keiji Inafune, {{credited}} as [...] "Inafking", {{stated that}} the development team had very few problems while working on Mega Man 4. Inafune designed Dr. Cossack and Kalinka as two new storyline characters for the game. Cossack, who was originally named [...] "Dr. Vice", was made much younger than Dr. Light and Dr. Wily. Inafune also considered giving him American traits, but decided upon influences from Russia instead. Kalinka was created because so many male characters already existed in the series at this point. However, Inafune did not intend for players to compare her to Mega Man's sister Roll. The idea for Eddie originally came about during the development of Mega Man 2. <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> designed as a supporting character that [...] "would behave like a lottery", either pleasantly surprising or disappointing the player with the item he gives Mega Man.|$|E
500|$|Iron Maiden's mascot, Eddie, is a {{perennial}} {{fixture in the}} band's science fiction and horror-influenced album cover art, {{as well as in}} live shows. Originally a papier-mâché mask incorporated in their backdrop which would squirt fake blood during their live shows, the name would be transferred to the character featured in the band's debut album cover, created by Derek Riggs. <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from numerous other artists as well, including Melvyn Grant. Eddie is also featured in the band's first-person shooter video game, Ed Hunter, as well as their mobile role-playing game, Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast, in addition to numerous T-shirts, posters and other band-related merchandise. In 2008, he was awarded the [...] "Icon Award" [...] at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods, while Gibson.com describes him as [...] "the most recognisable metal icon in the world {{and one of the most}} versatile too".|$|E
500|$|Other storylines have {{concentrated}} on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). The episode where <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991. Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, [...] "he got away with murder" [...] {{for a second time}} in the serial. Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely {{responsible for the death of}} his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) in 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick.|$|E

500|$|Silent Hill 2 also {{incorporates}} some {{references to}} real-life events. In the original scenario, the developers designed Maria and James with dual personalities: Maria's other personality was [...] "Mary", {{a reference to}} Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last victim, while James' was [...] "Joseph", a reference {{to one of the}} Jack the Ripper suspects. Eddie Dombrowski's name was taken from actor Eddie Murphy during the beginning phases of production when <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> originally designed with a pleasantly optimistic personality. The name of Angela Orosco was derived from Angela Bennett, the name of the protagonist in the 1995 film The Net, and Laura's from the 1970 novel No Language But a Cry by Richard D'Ambrosio. The developers satirized guns in American society by allowing James to find a handgun in a shopping cart. There are also indications that the layout of Silent Hill was based to a certain extent on the town of San Bruno, California.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} Bono and The Edge's {{acoustic}} [...] "Original of the Species" [...] (2004). Turlington {{said of the}} track, [...] "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind.

Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: <b>Eddie</b> <b>was</b> amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start.
