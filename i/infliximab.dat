5|$|Certain medications, such as {{corticosteroids}} and <b>infliximab</b> (an anti-αTNF monoclonal antibody), {{are becoming}} increasingly important risk factors, especially in the developed world.|$|E
5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as <b>infliximab</b> or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
25|$|In psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as <b>infliximab,</b> improve {{the signs and}} symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and <b>infliximab.</b> Based on studies in AS, the results suggest <b>infliximab,</b> etanercept, and adalimumab {{have the potential to}} reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (<b>infliximab</b> and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. Results suggest <b>infliximab</b> is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of azathioprine and <b>infliximab</b> treatment {{may be more}} effective than a single dose of <b>infliximab</b> to induce steroid-free remission for people with active Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} case reports of the efficacy of <b>infliximab</b> in various inflammatory skin conditions diseases; the FDA approved <b>infliximab</b> for chronic severe plaque psoriasis in adults in September 2006.|$|E
25|$|Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and {{pancytopenia}} (some fatal) {{have been}} reported with <b>infliximab.</b> The FDA issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of <b>infliximab</b> instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully. The FDA issued a warning to doctors {{that there is an}} increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers {{associated with the use of}} <b>infliximab</b> and other tumor necrosis factor blockers in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> {{works by}} binding to TNF-α. TNF-α is a {{chemical}} messenger (cytokine) {{and a key}} part of the autoimmune reaction. In rheumatoid arthritis, <b>infliximab</b> seems to work by preventing TNF-α from binding to its receptor in the cell.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> (trade names Remicade among others) is a {{chimeric}} {{monoclonal antibody}} biologic drug that works against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) {{and is used}} to treat autoimmune diseases. <b>Infliximab</b> {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is used off-label outside its FDA approval for Behçet's disease and other conditions. <b>Infliximab</b> is administered by intravenous infusion, typically at six- to eight-week intervals. It cannot be given by mouth because the digestive system would destroy the drug.|$|E
25|$|Adalimumab, like <b>infliximab,</b> is an {{antibody}} that targets tumor necrosis factor. It {{has been}} shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of, and is approved for treatment of, moderate to severe Crohn's disease in adults who have not responded well to conventional treatments and who have lost response to or are unable to tolerate <b>infliximab.</b>|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects of}} <b>infliximab,</b> like other immunosuppressants of the TNF class, can be serious and {{potentially}} fatal, and <b>infliximab</b> carries an FDA black-box warning on the label. Listed side effects include hypersensitivity and allergic reactions, risk of re-activation of tuberculosis, serum sickness, {{and risk of}} multiple sclerosis. Serious side effect also include lymphoma and severe infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> biosimilars {{have been}} {{approved}} in the EU (2013), Japan (2014), and USA (2016).|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> {{has been}} tested in COPD {{but there was no}} {{evidence}} of benefit with the possibility of harm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> is {{available}} in the Republic of Ireland through the HSE's Medical Card and Drug Payment Scheme.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> {{has high}} {{specificity}} for TNF-α, {{and does not}} neutralize TNF beta (TNFβ, also called lymphotoxin α), an unrelated cytokine that uses different receptors from TNF-α. Biological activities attributed to TNF-α include induction of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukins IL-1 and IL-6), enhancement of leukocyte movement or migration from the blood vessels into the tissues (by increasing the permeability of endothelial layer of blood vessels), and increasing the release of adhesion molecules. <b>Infliximab</b> prevents disease in transgenic mice (a special type of mice biologically engineered to produce a human form of TNF-α and which are {{used to test the}} results of these drugs that might be expected in humans). These experimental mice develop arthritis {{as a result of their}} production of human TNF-α, and when administered after disease onset, <b>infliximab</b> allows eroded joints to heal.|$|E
25|$|Anti-TNF {{therapy has}} shown only modest effects in cancer therapy. Treatment of renal cell {{carcinoma}} with <b>infliximab</b> resulted in prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients. Etanercept was tested for treating patients with breast cancer and ovarian cancer showing prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients via downregulation of IL-6 and CCL2. On the other hand, adding <b>infliximab</b> or etanercept to gemcitabine for treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer {{was not associated with}} differences in efficacy when compared with placebo.|$|E
25|$|It was {{approved}} for treating ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis. <b>Infliximab</b> is also prescribed (out of indication) {{for the treatment}} of Behçet's disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} anti–tumor {{necrosis}} factor medications such as <b>infliximab</b> and etanercept are unclear and possibly harmful. Evidence is unclear for pentoxifylline. Propylthiouracil {{may result in}} harm.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, <b>infliximab</b> and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> is {{available}} through the PBS in Australia for Crohn's disease treatment provided the patient has not responded to conventional treatment and is suffering from a severe case of the condition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used biological agent in treating relapsing polychondritis. Half of the patients saw benefit from this treatment, and a few other patients experienced infections that in some cases lead to death.|$|E
25|$|High-dose {{corticosteroid}} {{therapy is}} often used for severe disease manifestations. Anti-TNF therapy such as <b>infliximab</b> has shown promise in treating the uveitis associated with the disease. Another Anti-TNF agent, etanercept, {{may be useful in}} people with mainly skin and mucosal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Natalizumab is an anti-integrin {{monoclonal}} antibody that has shown utility as induction and maintenance treatment for {{moderate to severe}} Crohn's disease. Natalizumab may be appropriate in patients who {{do not respond to}} medications that block tumor necrosis factor-alpha, such as <b>infliximab.</b>|$|E
25|$|Etanercept was {{developed}} by researchers at Immunex, and was released for commercial use in late 1998, soon {{after the release of}} <b>infliximab</b> (Remicade), which was the first chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNFα to be marketed for clinical use.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all of the}} TNF inhibitors, <b>infliximab</b> is an {{expensive}} medication, costing about US$900 for a 100mg dose, and within the United States is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans {{make it possible to}} be covered for only a subset of treatments {{in the course of a}} year). <b>Infliximab</b> is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> is a purified, {{recombinant}} DNA-derived chimeric human-mouse IgG {{monoclonal antibody}} {{that consists of}} mouse heavy and light chain variable regions combined with human heavy and light chain constant regions. It has a serum half-life of 9.5 days and can be detected in serum 8 weeks after infusion treatment.|$|E
25|$|TNF is {{a protein}} that is {{released}} by activated white blood cells, triggering more inflammation, an immune system response and {{more damage to}} the mucosa of the colon because of the immune activation. Certain drugs inhibit TNF, hence reducing inflammation and immune system involvement. <b>Infliximab</b> {{was approved by the}} FDA for treating ulcerative colitis in March 2005. It is usually given as an intravenous infusions at weeks 0,2 and 6 and then every eight weeks thereafter. It is very useful for inducing and maintaining a remission of ulcerative colitis. <b>Infliximab</b> works better when used in combination with immunmodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, but a corresponding increase in adverse events means that the decision to use one drug or two must be based on an individualized discussion between the patient and their doctor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Infliximab</b> (trade name Remicade, among others) is a mouse-human {{chimeric}} antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a cytokine in the inflammatory response. It is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. It is administered intravenously and dosed per weight starting at 5mg/kg and increasing according to character of disease.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis can develop anti-dsDNA antibodies, however {{they are usually}} treatment related. Anti-TNFα biological therapies, such as adalimumab, <b>infliximab</b> and etanercept, can often induce the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. They are usually low avidity and are only detectable transiently after treatment. The presence of these antibodies can induce a lupus-like syndrome in some cases.|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitis {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or <b>infliximab</b> may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{used for}} autoimmune diseases include <b>infliximab</b> and adalimumab, which {{are effective in}} rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative Colitis by their ability to bind to and inhibit TNF-α. Basiliximab and daclizumab inhibit IL-2 on activated T cells and thereby help preventing acute rejection of kidney transplants. Omalizumab inhibits human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is useful in moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.|$|E
25|$|Biologic {{treatments}} {{such as the}} TNF inhibitors <b>infliximab,</b> adalimumab, and golimumab {{are commonly}} used to treat people with UC who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Tofacitinib, vedolizumab, and etrolizumab can also produce good clinical remission and response rates in UC. Usually, these medications are only used if other options have been exhausted (i.e., the person has received and not responded favorably to high-dose corticosteroids and immunomodulators such as azathioprine and mesalazine).|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{therapeutic}} market for monoclonal antibodies has grown exponentially. In 2006, the “big 5” therapeutic antibodies {{on the market}} are bevacizumab, trastuzumab (both oncology), adalimumab, <b>infliximab</b> (both autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, ‘AIID’) and rituximab (oncology and AIID) accounted for 80% of revenues in 2006. In 2007, eight of the 20 best-selling biotechnology drugs in the U.S. are therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. This rapid growth in demand for monoclonal antibody production has been well accommodated by the industrialization of mAb manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is {{generally}} treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need {{to remain on}} steroids long-term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, thalidomide and <b>infliximab</b> {{have been reported to}} be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Infliximab</b> targets TNF, {{thought to}} be more related to Th1 cytokines. [...] Ulcerative colitis was {{thought to be}} a Th2 disease, and <b>infliximab</b> would be of limited use. [...] However, {{patients}} with ulcerative colitis have begun to be treated with <b>infliximab</b> on the basis of two large clinical trials conducted in 2005 by Paul Rutgeerts and William Sandborn. [...] The Acute ulcerative Colitis Treatment trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to evaluate the utility of <b>infliximab</b> in ulcerative colitis showed 44-45% of patients treated with <b>infliximab</b> for a year maintained a response to the medication, compared with 21% of patients who were treated with placebo medication. [...] At two months, the response was 61-69% for patients treated with <b>infliximab,</b> and 31% for those treated with placebo.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Infliximab</b> {{was first}} used for closure of fistulae in Crohn's disease in 1999. In a 94-patient, phase II {{clinical}} trial, the researchers showed <b>Infliximab</b> was effective in closing fistulae between the skin and bowel in 56-68% of patients. [...] A large, 296-patient, Phase III clinical trial called the ACCENT 2 trial, showed <b>infliximab</b> was additionally beneficial in maintaining closure of fistulae, with almost two-thirds of all patients treated with the three initial doses of <b>infliximab</b> having a fistula response after 14 weeks, and 36% of patients maintaining closure of fistulae after a year, compared with 19% who received placebo therapy. [...] This final trial resulted in the FDA approval of the drug to treat fistulizing disease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{monoclonal}} antibody <b>infliximab</b> is a mouse-human chimeric antibody to TNF-α. [...] It first {{was used in}} the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and was the first biological agent used in the treatment of IBD. [...] It is also used in the treatment of psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. [...] <b>Infliximab</b> has shown significant success in treating Crohn's disease.|$|E
