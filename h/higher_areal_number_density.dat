As a result, the FTO/Ag-NPs/TiO 2 photo-anode showed an enhancement of its photocurrent, whereas the FTO/Au-NPs/TiO 2 photo-anode showed less photocurrent than even a standard photo-anode fabricated by simply coating TiO 2 paste onto the modified FTO glass through screen printing.

40|$|Mats of {{free-standing}} {{manganese oxide}} (MnxOy) nanowires have been fabricated as experimental electrode materials for rechargeable electrochemical power cells and capacitors. Because they are free-standing, the wires in these mats are electrochemically accessible. The {{advantage of the}} mat-of-nanowires configuration, relative to other configurations of electrode materials, arises from the combination of narrowness and <b>high</b> <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>density</b> of the wires. This combination offers both high surface areas for contact with electrolytes and short paths for diffusion of ions {{into and out of}} the electrodes, thereby making it possible to charge and discharge at rates higher than would otherwise be possible and, consequently, to achieve greater power densities. The nanowires are fabricated in an electrolytic process in which there is no need for an electrode binder material. Moreover, there is no need to incorporate an electrically conductive additive into the electrode material; the only electrically conductive material that must be added is a thin substrate contact film at the anchored ends of the nanowires. Hence, the mass fraction of active electrode material is close to 100 percent, as compared with about 85 percent in conventional electrodes made from a slurry of active electrode material, binder, and conductive additive pressed onto a metal foil. The locations and sizes of the nanowires are defined by holes in templates in the form of commercially available porous alumina membranes. In experiments to demonstrate the present process, alumina membranes of various pore sizes and degrees of porosity were used. First, a film of Au was sputtered onto one side of each membrane. The membranes were then attached, variously, to carbon tape or a gold substrate by use of silver or carbon paste. Once thus attached, the membranes were immersed in a plating solution comprising 0. 01 M MnSO 4 + 0. 03 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The pH of the solution was kept constant at 8 by addition of H 2 SO 4 or NH 4 OH as needed. Mn(x) O(y) nanowires were potentiostatically electrodeposited in the pores in the alumina templates. Depending on the anodic deposition potentials, Mn(x) O(y) was deposited in various oxidation states [divalent (Mn 3 O 4), trivalent (Mn 2 O 3), or tetravalent (MnO 2) ]. The Mn(x) O(y) wires were made free-standing (see figure) by dissolving the alumina templates, variously, in KOH or NaOH at a concentration of 20 volume percent...|$|R

After cross-linking between 200 ° and 400 °C, debonding from the elastomeric PDMS mold yielded freestanding structures of PCS micropillars. Due to the low stiffness of cross-linked PCS (E~ 2. 5 GPa), surface adhesion forces might result in the deformation of the micropillars into ordered domains. The PCS micropillar arrays were pyrolyzed in inert atmosphere at 900 ° and 1500 °C to yiel d amorphous and nanocrystalline SiC (b-SiC) with crystallite sizes {{in the range of}} tenths of micrometers, respectively.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{influence}} of sample temperature on the development of hydrogen-induced blisters in Mo/Si thin-film multilayers. In general, the <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>density</b> of blisters decreases with increasing exposure temperature, whereas individual blister size increases with exposure temperatures up to ~ 200 °C but decreases thereafter. Comparison as a function of sample temperature is made between exposures to a flux containing both hydrogen ions and neutrals and one containing only neutrals. In the case of the neutral-only flux, blistering is observed for exposure temperatures ≥ 90 °C. The inclusion of ions promotes blister formation at < 90 °C, while retarding their growth at higher temperatures. In general, ion-induced effects become less evident with increasing exposure temperature. At 200 °C the main effect discernable is reduced blister size as compared with the equivalent neutral-only exposure. The temperature during exposure is a much stronger determinant of the blistering outcome than either pre- or post-annealing of the sample. The trends observed for neutral-only exposures are attributed to competing effects of defect density thermal equilibration and H-atom induced modification of the Si layers. Energetic ions modify the blistering via (temperature dependent) enhancement of H-mobility and re-crystallization of amorphous Si...|$|R

Accidents related to storage, transport and transshipment {{may result in}} severe injury and material damage. Dispersion of structural debris {{is one of the}} main hazards resulting from detonations inside structures. Reliable prediction models for debris dispersion are essential for risk assessment methods. In this article we give a statistical description of the dispersion of explosion produced debris.

Combined with engineering models for the launch conditions, predictions can be made. An analytical solution to the equations of motion may be used to allow for fast calculations. A parameter study shows consistent results. The model has been validated with internal detonation tests of bare charges in reinforced concrete structures. The validation clearly shows the prediction capabilities of the model for three loading regimes described in the literature. We give a thorough description of the validity and limitations of the model, and an outlook of current and future research.

These exposures result in blister formation characterized by layer detachment occurring exclusively {{in the vicinity of the}} Mo-on-Si interfaces. This localization is attributed to strained centers introduced within the interfacial region during silicide formation and subsequent Mo crystallization. The correlation between D-content and blistering was studied. After an initial uptake period the D-content stabilized at ~ 1. 3 × 1016 at. /cm 2. Blister development is not simply a function of the content. Different blistering processes are simultaneously operative, with three distinct distributions being observed. The <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>densities</b> of the initial two blister distributions to appear are established before the content stabilizes, while the multilayer is susceptible to successive stages of blistering associated with the effects of energetic ions. H-atom depth profiling of hydrogen-exposed samples by resonant nuclear reaction analysis shows preferential accumulation in the Mo layers. A distinct local maximum with a remarkably high hydrogen concentration (~ 19 at. %) develops in the outermost Mo layer. This is attributed to enhanced accommodation of hydrogen in voids and vacancies within the layer as a consequence of its polycrystalline structure and its highly-constrained state...|$|R

Spatial patterns of mounds were assessed using high-resolution satellite images for 24 plots of variable size (3 to 27 ha). Soil morphological features were described for five termite-mound profiles of 5 to 9 m depth/height. A mean <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>density</b> of 2. 9 ± 0. 4 mounds ha- 1 is estimated for the degraded miombo woodland {{of the study}} area. Spatial statistical analyses document that termite mounds are regularly distributed in all studied plots. The overall mean nearest-neighbour distance between termite mounds is 44. 6 ± 0. 6 m. The high relative number of inactive mounds in the region, with regular distribution patterns, suggests that current termite mound occurrences are largely relict features. There are no clear indications for an impact {{of the nature of}} the parent material on the spatial distribution of the mounds. One aspect of differences in morphology between the studied mounds is that the stone layer occurs at greater depth in topographic low areas than at crest and slope positions. This is interpreted as being mainly conditioned by erosion. Mn–Fe oxide concentrations occurring in all studied termite mound profiles reflect a seasonally high perched water table beneath the mound, which is more pronounced at lower landscape positions. In summary, mound positions in the habitat are consistent with intraspecific competition rather than soil and substrate characteristics as controlling factor, whereas variation in morphological characteristics between termite-mound profiles appears to be a function of the parent material...|$|R
40|$|Transitions between {{explosive}} and effusive {{activity are}} commonly observed during dome-forming eruptions {{and may be}} linked to factors such as magma influx, ascent rate and degassing. However, the interplay between these factors is complex and the resulting eruptive behaviour often unpredictable. This paper focuses on the driving forces behind the explosive and effusive activity during the well-documented 2010 eruption of Merapi, the volcano’s largest eruption since 1872. Time-controlled samples were collected from the 2010 deposits, linked to eruption stage and style of activity. These include scoria and pumice from the initial explosions, dense and scoriaceous dome samples formed via effusive activity, as well as scoria and pumice samples deposited during subplinian column collapse. Quantitative textural analysis of groundmass feldspar microlites, including measurements of <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>density,</b> mean microlite size, crystal aspect ratio, groundmass crystallinity and crystal size distribution analysis, reveal that shallow pre- and syn-eruptive magmatic processes acted to govern the changing behaviour during the eruption. High-An (up to ∼ 80  mol% An) microlites from early erupted samples reveal that the eruption was likely preceded by an influx of hotter or more mafic magma. Transitions between explosive and effusive activity in 2010 were driven primarily by the dynamics of magma ascent in the conduit, with degassing and crystallisation acting via feedback mechanisms, resulting in cycles of effusive and explosive activity. Explosivity during the 2010 eruption was enhanced by the presence of a ‘plug’ of cooled magma within the shallow magma plumbing system, which acted to hinder degassing, leading to overpressure prior to initial explosive activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} magma ascent, {{degassing}} and changing magmatic properties are {{widely recognized as}} critical factors controlling the style of silicic volcanic eruptions. Microlite textures in samples from the prolonged dome-forming eruption of Merapi in 2006 provide a record of changing magmatic ascent conditions and shallow conduit processes throughout the eruption. Analysis of microlite textural parameters, including measurements of <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>density</b> (NA), mean microlite size, crystal aspect ratio and groundmass crystallinity (φ), combined with the monitoring record and field observations, indicate that magma ascent paths change between continuous ascent at varying rates from a deeper magma storage region, to ascent being temporarily stalled at shallow depths in the latter stages of the eruption, supporting {{the idea of an}} ephemeral shallow magma storage region at Merapi. Plagioclase microlite compositions show evidence of decompression-induced degassing, often displaying rims of anorthoclase and more K-rich alkali feldspar (sanidine). Anorthite contents also support the textural data of later erupted magma being temporarily stalled at shallow depths. Crystal size distributions (CSDs) are interpreted to show that both growth-dominated and nucleation-dominated crystallisation regimes existed during the 2006 eruption, resulting from changing conditions of undercooling (ΔT) during variable magma ascent paths. By contrast, microlite textural analysis and feldspar microlite compositions of samples from the fast-growing lava dome of {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruption prior to the cataclysmic events on 5 November indicate faster ascent rates, a crystallisation regime more strongly dominated by nucleation due to high ΔT and interaction of the 2010 magma with more hotter magma from depth...|$|R
40|$|The {{role that}} {{energetic}} (&gt; 800 eV) hydrogen ions play in inducing and modifying {{the formation of}} blisters in nanoscale Mo/Si multilayer samples is investigated. Such samples are confirmed to be susceptible to blistering by two separate mechanisms. The first is attributed to the segregation of H atoms to voids and vacancies associated with the outermost Mo layer, driving blister formation {{in the form of}} H 2 filled bubbles. This process can occur in the absence of ions. A second blister distribution emerges when energetic ions are present in the irradiating flux. This is attributed to an ion-induced vacancy clustering mechanism that produces void blisters. The defects and strained states associated with the Mo-on-Si interfaces provide the preferred nucleation points for blistering in both cases. The effects of ions are ascribed to promotion of hydrogen uptake and mobility, in particular through the Si layers; to the generation of additional mobile species in the Si and Mo layers; and to the creation of new blister nucleation points. In addition to directly stimulating blistering via vacancy clustering, ions modify the development of H 2 -filled blisters. This is most evident in the formation of multi-component structures due to overlapping delaminations at different layer interfaces. This affect is attributed to the introduction of active transport of hydrogen from the H 2 filled blisters across the outermost Mo-on-Si interface to the underlying layers. Ion-induced variations in hydrogen uptake and distribution and in the rates of blister nucleation and growth produce lateral differences in blister size and <b>areal</b> <b>number</b> <b>density</b> that create a macroscopic concentric pattern across the surface...|$|R

Comparison between 6 -month and 12 -month-old rats indicated a substantial reduction in the density of NADPH-d-reactive neurons in the fascia dentata (69 %) and Ammon's horn (54 %) of the latter group. This reduction was relatively uniform along the septotemporal and radial axes, but appeared to be more pronounced in the fascia dentata and in the proximal region of Ammon's horn. Our finding showed that the hippocampal NO system can undergo significant changes within adulthood. It further highlighted the possibility that an age-related reduction in the capacity to produce NO may not be directly responsible for the cognitive decline associated with senescence, but rather predisposes neuronal degeneration in later life...|$|R
