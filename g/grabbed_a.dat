5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds {{and bolts of}} cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply {{and were able to}} eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between the {{champion}} Kurt Angle, who was accompanied by Karen Angle, and the challenger Christian Cage.

5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|Three {{straight}} draws {{followed in}} December, the first away to league leaders Aston Villa.

Solskjær put United two goals ahead, but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence, tugging on David Ginola's shirt. Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and on the cusp of stoppage time powered a header in the top left-hand corner, sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane. Chelsea <b>grabbed</b> <b>a</b> creditable draw at Old Trafford to stake their championship credentials four days later and United, who were without their manager Ferguson for the Middlesbrough game were beaten 3–2; their last defeat of the season. On Boxing Day the team collected three points against Nottingham Forest and merited a point at Stamford Bridge in the last match of 1998 to solidify their position in the top four.|$|E
