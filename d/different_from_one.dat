5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another.|$|E
25|$|I {{sometimes}} {{think there are}} two Wagners in our culture, almost unrecognizably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another: the Wagner possessed by those who know his work, and the Wagner imagined by those who know him only by name and reputation.|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Constantin Brâncuși differ {{considerably}} from others through lack of severe planar faceting {{often associated with}} those of prototypical Cubists such as Archipenko, Csaky and Duchamp-Villon (themselves already very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another). However, in common is the tendency toward simplification and abstract representation.|$|E

25|$|The debate focused {{primarily}} {{on the nature of}} the relationship between the civilian and military worlds. There was widespread agreement that there were two distinct worlds and that they were fundamentally <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another. The argument was over how best to ensure that the two could coexist without endangering liberal democracy.|$|E
25|$|A few sociologists {{studying}} TCKs, however, {{argue that}} the commonality found in international TCKs is {{not the result of}} true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture. They believe that some of the superficial attributes may mirror each other, but that TCKs from different countries are really <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another. The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the world around them differs.|$|E
25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means {{that one of the most}} interesting parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E

30|$|It is {{worthwhile}} {{to mention that}} comparing with the results in [2], our blow-up results are new and quite different. There is twofold meaning: firstly, our blow-up criteria and the proof of them are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the <b>ones</b> in [2]. Then, our blow-up phenomena (see Theorem  4.1) are also <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the <b>ones</b> in [2], because the conditions of Theorem  4.1 in our paper are <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the <b>ones</b> [2]. When ρ_ 0 (-x)= 0, system (1) is degenerated into μ-version Camassa–Holm equation essentially. So the blow-up phenomena in [2] belong to μ-version Camassa–Holm equation.|$|R
25|$|Because some {{traits are}} dominant, crossbreed dogs tend to {{manifest}} some physical characteristics {{more frequently than}} others. Border Collies and some Spaniels, for example, often produce crossbreed offspring with similar coats and ears. The crossbreed offspring of German Shepherds often have characteristic Shepherd faces. But all crossbred dogs will vary in which characteristics of their purebred parents that they inherit, and may look very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another, even within the same litter of puppies.|$|E
25|$|The {{radial artery}} {{is the easiest}} to use to check the heart rate. However, in {{emergency}} situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is {{not strong enough to}} be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.|$|E
25|$|The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory {{was first}} {{developed}} in 1990 by Scott J. Dickman. This scale {{is based on}} Dickman's proposal {{that there are two}} types of impulsivity that are significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another. This includes functional impulsivity which is characterized by quick decision making when it is optimal, a trait that is often considered to be a source of pride. The scale also includes dysfunctional impulsivity which is characterized by making quick decisions when it is not optimal. This type of impulsivity is most often associated with life difficulties including substance abuse problems and other negative outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Myers paired ESTJs with ENTJs, ISFPs with INFPs, INTPs with ISTPs, and ENFJs with ESFJs {{because they}} share the same {{dominant}} function attitude. ESTJs and ENTJs are both extraverted thinkers, ISFPs and INFPs are both introverted feelers, INTPs and ISTPs are both introverted thinkers, and ENFJs and ESFJs are both extraverted feelers. Keirsey holds that these same groupings are very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another because they are of different temperaments. ESTJs are Guardians whereas ENTJs are Rationals; ISFPs are Artisans whereas INFPs are Idealists; INTPs are Rationals whereas ISTPs are Artisans; and ENFJs are Idealists whereas ESFJs are Guardians.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was no question that the engines were <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{problems}} with the Embedded SQL approach. Like the different varieties of SQL, the Embedded SQLs that used them varied widely, not only from platform to platform, but even across languages on one platform – a system that allowed calls into IBM's DB2 would look very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> that called into their own SQL/DS. Another key problem to the Embedded SQL concept was that the SQL code could only be changed in the program's source code, so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify. The SQL market referred to this as static SQL, versus dynamic SQL which could be changed at any time, like the command-line interfaces that shipped with almost all SQL systems, or a programming interface that left the SQL as plain text until it was called. Dynamic SQL systems became a major focus for SQL vendors during the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} {{fundamental}} differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in COROT-7b mass {{does not allow}} precise modelling of the planet structure. Nevertheless, educated guesses could still be put forth. Assuming a 5-Earth-masses planet, the planet was modeled to have convection in the mantle with a small core {{with no more than}} 15% the mass of the planet, or 0.7 M⊕. The lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary has more sluggish convection than the upper mantle because the greater pressure causes fluids to become more viscous. The temperature of the upper convecting mantle is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> side of the planet to the other with lateral temperature differences for downwellings up to several hundred kelvins. However, the temperature of the upwelling is unaffected by downwelling and surface temperature variations. On the permanent dayside of the tidally locked planet where the surface temperature is hot from continuously facing its sun, the surface takes part in convection, which is the evidence that all the surface of this hemisphere being covered in oceans of lava. On the permanent nightside, the surface is cool enough for the formation of the crust with pools of lava above the convective mantle with intense volcanism. The dayside of the planet has larger convection cells than the nightside. Researchers also investigated the physical state of the interior of CoRoT-7b, indicating as likely a solid iron core, thus a self-generated magnetic field should be absent on the planet.|$|E

500|$|Young did so, {{with two}} results that {{together}} {{paved the way}} for the final decipherment. In the hieroglyphic text, he discovered the phonetic characters [...] "p t o l m e s" [...] (in today's transliteration [...] "p t w l m y s") that were used to write the Greek name [...] "Ptolemaios". He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the Demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and Demotic texts on the stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another. This led him to deduce correctly that the Demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of ideographic characters imitated from hieroglyphs. Young's new insights were prominent in the long article [...] "Egypt" [...] that he contributed to the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1819. He could make no further progress, however.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Baradwaj Rangan {{finds the}} {{sequence}} where Haasan's character, Cheenu, narrates {{the story of}} The Blue Jackal to Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, to be a distant echo of the arc negotiated by Cheenu: [...] "He is, after all, a nobody [...] who, through a salubrious twist of fate, becomes the ruler of a woman's life, until he is restored, at the end, to the nobody he was, a fraudulent claimant to her emotions." [...] In his book Dispatches from the wall corner: A journey through Indian cinema, Rangan says that although Haasan is inspired by Marlon Brando, the scene where Haasan burns himself while cooking and vents his anger on Sridevi, {{is reminiscent of the}} acting style of Marcel Marceau. In another book of Rangan, Conversations with Mani Ratnam, he states that in the scene where Cheenu enters Bhagyalakshmi's room in the brothel, there was fumbling and embarrassment, whereas in another Haasan film Nayakan (1987), Haasan's character, Velu Nayakar, behaves as if he has visited a brothel before. Nayakans director Mani Ratnam replied by saying that the two scenes are very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another and that it [...] "can't be played the same way".|$|E

In a review for Pitchfork, Matt LeMay described the album as [...] "elegant and graceful", but felt that the [...] "songs aren't all that <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> another." [...] Sacha Esterson of musicOMH compared Felt Mountain to Portishead and wrote {{that it could be}} a [...] "contender for the year's best album". Yahoo!

[...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie noted that [...] "lthough at times it [...] a little contrived, for the most part this is stylishly decadent music that should appeal to all fans of film noir." [...] The NME viewed the album as [...] "cold, desolate and old-fashioned" [...] and argued that Felt Mountain was not a [...] "bad concept" [...] except that [...] "Portishead got there first, and managed to update the spy-film vibe with a hefty dose of break-driven twilight melancholia." ...|$|E
