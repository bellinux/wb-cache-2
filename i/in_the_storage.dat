5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E
5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations.|$|E

Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E

Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn.

25|$|Controlling gas and vapor {{concentrations}} {{outside the}} explosive limits {{is a major}} consideration in occupational safety and health. Methods used to control the concentration of a potentially explosive gas or vapor include use of sweep gas, an unreactive gas such as nitrogen or argon to dilute the explosive gas before coming in contact with air. Use of scrubbers or adsorption resins to remove explosive gases before release are also common. Gases can also be maintained safely at concentrations above the UEL, although a breach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> container can lead to explosive conditions or intense fires.|$|E

25|$|The {{injection}} system {{consists of a}} 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line. The LINAC was operated for over 30 years {{as part of the}} Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2586MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> ring, operates at 1Hz, with an RF frequency of 500Hz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.|$|E
