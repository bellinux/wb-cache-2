40|$|Purpose – To {{take a more}} {{holistic}} {{and integrated}} view than in existing studies of <b>export</b> <b>capability</b> among small and medium-sized enterprises, by exploring the key components of marketing management, and the blend of processes, practices and activities most closely associated {{with high levels of}} overall export performance. Design/methodology/approach – The principal research instrument is the export marketing profiling system developed by the authors over a five-year period, which provided the framework for data collection and analysis. Findings are derived from 250 semi-structured interviews conducted in SMEs in the Yorkshire and Humber region of the UK. Findings – The study identified 17 key practices, processes and activities that, taken together, are closely associated with export performance. They relate primarily to export marketing strategy, and suggest that a blend of capabilities in the areas of knowledge management (including market research and marketing intelligence), relationship-building, product strategy and pricing are most closely associated with success. Practical implications – The study has particular implications for business-support providers. The findings could be used to assess and evaluate <b>export</b> <b>capability</b> in a wider sense. The conceptual framework could serve as a diagnostic tool for the identification of the areas of operation in which support, intervention and investment might have the greatest impact on overall <b>export</b> <b>capability.</b> Further research in these areas would be of particular importance in the drive to understand the relationship between <b>export</b> <b>capability</b> and performance. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the evolution of}} country export performance {{over the last five}} decades. Using the gravity model of trade, we extract a measure of country <b>export</b> <b>capability</b> by industry which we use to evaluate how absolute advantage changes over time for 135 industries in 90 countries. We alternatively use the Balassa RCA index as a measure of comparative advantage. Part I of the analysis documents two em-pirical regularities in country export behavior. One is hyperspecialization: in the typical country, export success is concentrated in a handful of industries. Hyperspecialization is consistent with a heavy upper tail in the distribution of absolute advantage across industries within a country, which is well approxi-mated by a generalized gamma distribution whose shape is stable both across countries and over time. The second empirical regularity is a high rate of turnover in a country’s top export industries. Churning in top exports reflects mean reversion in a typical country’s absolute advantage, which we estimate to be on the order of 30 % per decade. Part II of the analysis reconciles hyperspecialization in exports with high decay rates in <b>export</b> <b>capability</b> by modeling absolute advantage as a stochastic process. We specify a generalized logistic diffusion for absolute advantage that allows for Brownian innovations (accounting for surges in a country’s export prowess), a country-wide stochastic trend (flexibly transforming absolut...|$|E
