5|$|At {{its peak}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the U.S. ice trade {{employed}} an estimated 90,000 people in an industry capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms), using ice houses capable of storing up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) each; Norway exported a million tons (910 million kg) of ice a year, drawing on a network of artificial lakes. Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant ice was being produced in the U.S. each year than naturally harvested ice. Despite a temporary increase in production in the U.S. during the war, the inter-war years saw the total collapse of the ice trade around the world. Today, ice is occasionally harvested for ice carving and ice festivals, but little remains of the 19th-century <b>industrial</b> <b>network</b> of ice houses and transport facilities.|$|E

The inter-city rail network on Java is complemented by local commuter rail services in the Jakarta metropolitan area (KRL Jabotabek) and in Surabaya.

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>networks</b> offer great {{opportunities}} for adapting their processes and structures to changing circumstances, {{expressed by the}} criteria of innovation, speed and flexibility or changeability. Especially, more integrated approaches, like Dispersed Manufacturing Networks, present new challenges to decision-making, during all stages of product development and manufacturing, at strategic, tactical and operational levels for all companies involved. As a response to these challenges, this paper presents three models (Innovation Impact Point Model, Collaboration Model and Continuous Outsourcing Model) and a method for reconfiguration that support decision making in <b>industrial</b> <b>networks.</b> Together with the longer existing models for the Order Entry Points, these approaches will facilitate successful exploitation of <b>industrial</b> <b>networks.</b> However, many current approaches rely on the conversion to networks of models that fit the monolithic company.

Firstly, it seems that manufacturing is becoming a commodity rather than a unique capability, which accounts especially for low-technology approaches in downstream parts of the network, for example in assembly operations. Secondly, the increased tendency to specialize forces other parts of <b>industrial</b> <b>networks</b> to introduce advanced manufacturing technologies for niche markets. Thirdly, the capital market for investments in capacity and the trade in manufacturing as a commodity dominates resource allocation to a larger extent.

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} contention {{within the}} <b>Industrial</b> <b>Networks</b> literature - that business relationships {{are one of}} the firm´s most important resources - has not been, in our viewpoint, thoroughly explored. Hence we argue that the ‘Resource-based View of the Firm’ (‘RBV’) may complement the network-based reasoning on the strategic relevance of business relationships. A theoretical framework is proposed – a competence-based view of the firm – which solves RBV´s terminological and inconsistency problems and, more importantly, assures compatibility with the network perspective´s assumptions. The possibility of cross-fertilizing the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Networks</b> and RBV theories seems not only real, but also conceptually profitable for both theoretical fields.

50|$|Industrial {{networks}} {{often use}} network switches to segment a large system into logical sub-networks, divided by address, protocol, or application. Using network switches allows the network {{to be broken}} up into many small collision domains. This {{reduces the risk of}} a faulty or mis-configured device generating excess network traffic. When an <b>industrial</b> <b>network</b> must connect to an office network or external networks, a firewall system can be inserted to control exchange of data between the networks. To preserve the performance and reliability of the <b>industrial</b> <b>network,</b> general office automation systems are separated from the network used for control or I/O devices. Some Industrial Ethernets use a ring topology to avoid collisions and provide deterministic performance.|$|E
40|$|An <b>industrial</b> control <b>network</b> is {{a system}} of {{interconnected}} equipment used to monitor and control physical equipment in <b>industrial</b> environments. These <b>networks</b> differ quite significantly from traditional enterprise networks due to the specific requirements of their operation. Despite the functional differences between <b>industrial</b> and enterprise <b>networks,</b> a growing integration between the two has been observed. The technology in use in <b>industrial</b> <b>networks</b> is also beginning to display a greater reliance on Ethernet and web standards, especially at higher levels of the network architecture. This {{has resulted in a}} situation where engineers involved in the design and maintenance of control networks must be familiar with both traditional enterprise concerns, such as network security, as well as traditional industrial concerns such as determinism and response time.

40|$|Networks {{have been}} a hot topic in recent years, not only in {{mainstream}} media but also in academic literature. The sociological interest in <b>industrial</b> <b>networks</b> is one of multiple levels and surely stems from the question if networks can benefit society. It was {{the purpose of this}} paper to research the emergence of the study of <b>networks</b> or <b>industrial</b> <b>networks</b> and validate, using articles concerned with the matter, if they are in fact a new concept in business or not. Considering the review of literature, one can conclude that by no means are networks in business a novelty but a logical consequence of human relationships in general and also that network structures have been present long before their discovery through academia, only not identified as such. It was found that the previous definition of market structures in business, while maneuvering between the two extremes of hierarchy and a free market, may have been too rigid and networks provided an excellent alternative term. It can further be suggested that the study of networks should focus on exchange mechanisms, cultural differences and emotional involvement as <b>industrial</b> <b>networks</b> may differ in their degrees of freedom, scale and purpose but always rely on reciprocity, as do all human relationships.
