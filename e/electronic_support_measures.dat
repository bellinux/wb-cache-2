40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} present postintegration processing {{in order to}} improve the sensitivity of <b>electronic</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> (ESM) receivers. Correlation methods take advantage of the periodic character of radar signals. In such cases, autocorrelation and cross-correlation improve the detection of signals with high- repetition frequency. Furthermore, since the extraction of radar parameters is necessary to identify received signals, we study three types of estimators: straightforward method, interpolation method and maximum likelihood one. Simulation studies with realistic models and real signals are carried out to validate performances of such processing. With a view to implanting correlation functions, some architecture are studied. The choice of method is of interest since we need a lot of samples to be integrated. To conclude, as radar ESM receiver requires most information on received signals, the enhancement of the sensitivity using correlation method is of great interest. ...|$|R
