40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of IT {{standardization}} on bank performance based on a panel of 457 German savings banks over the period from 1996 to 2006. We measure IT standardization as the fraction of <b>IT</b> <b>expenses</b> for centralized services over banks' total <b>IT</b> <b>expenses.</b> Bank efficiency, in turn, is measured by traditional accounting performance indicators {{as well as by}} cost and profit efficiencies that are estimated by a stochastic frontier approach. Our results suggest that IT standardization is conducive to cost efficiency. The relation is positive and robust for small and medium-sized banks but vanishes for very large banks. Furthermore, our study confirms the often cited computer paradox by showing that total IT expenditures negatively impact cost efficiency and have no influence on bank profits. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is first to empirically explore whether IT standardization enhances efficiency by employing genuine data of banks' IT expenditures. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: CEOs {{and their}} {{management}} teams {{decide how much}} a firm will spend on IT. Though managers make IT spending decisions {{with the intent of}} generating value, such benefits are risky and not guaranteed (Dewan et al. 2007). While CEOs may perceive that IT spending could translate into competitive advantage and increase productivity, they also realize that IT expense will reduce current net income and contain non-diversifiable risks. Our results suggest that boards of directors consider IT spending an important contribution to the firm’s investment opportunity set and consequently provide incentives for CEOs to invest in IT. First, we find that <b>IT</b> <b>expenses</b> are associated with higher ratios of equity compensation, which suggests that boards of directors understand the uncertainty and risk profile of some IT spending and therefore tie CEO compensation to future outcomes by placing greater weight on equity compensation. Second, we find that <b>IT</b> <b>expenses</b> are unrelated to CEO cash compensation, which suggests that BODs shield CEO cash compensation from the income-decreasing effects of IT spending. Third, we find that firms with both higher IT spending and higher ratios of equity to total CEO compensation have higher market values. We conclude that the synergistic relationshi...|$|E

30|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a current}} trend in healthcare services and is partially motivated by cost-saving concerns. Adopting a cloud computing system {{can result in}} various savings; the more the expenses an adopted cloud computing system saves, the greater is the system’s effectiveness. For example, the SaaS model allows enterprises to pay software usage fees monthly and purchase version updates according {{to the number of}} system users, thereby reducing <b>IT</b> <b>expenses.</b> Hence, as long as hospitals pay monthly license fees, they can prolong the lifecycle of software products without being bound to traditional software licensing models or bearing the risks of product ineffectiveness. The IaaS model provides information infrastructure service platforms, allowing consumers to purchase infrastructure-related services, such as host computers and firewalls, without purchasing a physical infrastructure; this model saves consumers’ hardware expenses. In addition, service providers supply dynamically adjustable, pay-per-use, and unlimited client services by establishing virtual resource pools, saving consumers the expenses of designing, implementing, and maintaining customized infrastructures. Cloud services also eliminate the expenses associated with purchasing maintenance and management software, data storage devices, or other hardware. Without cloud services, consumers must bear the expense of maintaining and upgrading hardware and software. Therefore, cost effectiveness is a critical factor in the assessment of healthcare-oriented cloud computing service systems.|$|E

Although a great deal of progress has so far been made with respect to the low-level technological underpinning of the clouds, today’s clouds are still considered to be insufficiently trustworthy to serve as a computing platform for critical infrastructure (such as e. g., financial or power grid) operators and public administration sectors.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{can reduce}} cost significantly because businesses can share computing resources. In recent years Small and Medium Businesses (SMB) have used Cloud effectively for cost saving and for sharing <b>IT</b> <b>expenses.</b> With {{the success of}} SMBs, many perceive that the larger enterprises ought to move into Cloud environment as well. Government agency s stove-piped environments are being considered as candidates for potential use of Cloud either as an enterprise entity or pockets of small communities. Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing as a service {{rather than as a}} product, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility over a network. Underneath the offered services, there exists a modern infrastructure cost of which is often spread across its services or its investors. As NASA is considered as an Enterprise class organization, like other enterprises, a shift has been occurring in perceiving its IT services as candidates for Cloud services. This paper discusses market trends in cloud computing from an enterprise angle and then addresses the topic of Cloud Computing for NASA in two possible forms. First, {{in the form of a}} public Cloud to support it as an enterprise, as well as to share it with the commercial and public at large.

40|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{are currently}} exploring {{the possibility of}} migrating {{some or all of}} their IT functionalities to public clouds with the objective of reducing their overall IT service costs or to open new business frontiers. Unfortunately, making such a decision is not a straightforward task; it requires a vigorous evaluation of the various benefits, risks and costs associated with the migration of their diverse business processes that comprise of their current IT services. Yet, this problem has received very little attention in the literature, mainly due to its interdisciplinary nature. This thesis aims at filling this gap by aiding the enterprises during the phase of making their cloud migration decision. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, a novel cloud-migration framework is introduced to guide the enterprises through a sequence of well-defined recommended analysis steps. These steps culminate with the formulation of the migration decision problem as a mathematical optimization one. The second contribution is a decision engine that efficiently solves this optimization problem. More precisely, the proposed framework gradually guides the enterprise to first identify the various business processes that are related to their IT services and then to determine the relationship and the communication needed among those processes. The identified inter-process communication represents an indicator of how tightly coupled these business processes are to each other. When outsourcing business processes, tightly coupled processes add a high communication cost and may introduce service latency if they are not co-located. As such, inter-process communication becomes an important input parameter that affects the migration decision. Enterprises can then determine to partially or completely migrate IT services to clouds. Furthermore, multiple vendors can be used for different services. However, when different vendors are involved, the communication cost between different processes increases. The objective is to maximize profit for an organization which includes lowering <b>IT</b> <b>expenses</b> in the long term without compromising data integrity or security. An optimization formula is finally constructed to help the enterprise determine which services to migrate given input parameters of {{the cost of doing business}} in-house, cost of outsourcing, and communication costs. Finally, a case study is utilized to demonstrate the performance of the proposed work by analyzing the process of migrating the services to clouds for an IPTV service provider. More specifically, the case study focuses on the content delivery network (CDN) within the IPTV provider’s infrastructure which is responsible for delivering contents to viewers. The CDN network can use the proposed profit-optimization formula to determine whether to utilize a cloud service or to use its internal resource to deliver the content. A performance evaluation from a simulation is presented to demonstrate the proposed profit-optimization formula can return a set of optimal mix of both internal and external services to maximize profits...|$|E
