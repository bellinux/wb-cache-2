40|$|ABSTRACT: A PE/EPDM {{environment}} friendly blend was processed via a critical method to an elastic film backing imitating conventional PVC <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> tape. The film backing was surface treated, {{coated with a}} pressure sensitive adhesive, dried, and unwound in sequence to become an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> tape for evaluation. The evaluation procedure was according to authoritative <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> tape standard UL- 510. The general physical properties and the unique characteristics of samples, composed of different materials, were tested. PE/EPDM was qualified to meet most of the require-ments for UL- 510 except exposure to heat. Among other characteristics, exposure to cold test, breakdown voltage, and flame resistance of PE/EPDM were significant. Therefore, an {{environment friendly}} PE/EPDM <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> tape is well suited to low temperature and room temperature environments...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{effective}} electrical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coating insulating induced current path {{is one of}} key fusion technologies for fusion blanket research and development. <b>Electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> coating is extremely important for lead lithium (PbLi) MHD thermofluid study from pointview of secure electric insulating wall condition. The alumina (Al 2 O 3) coatings fabricated by a sol-gel method have never studied as <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> coating against PbLi as a working fluid. The present paper discusses the feasibility of the Al 2 O 3 coating by the sol-gel method as an <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> coating for PbLi MHD flows.

It is shown that better dispersion is achieved and C-O bonds are created between the surface functional groups of the nanoparticles and the host epoxy polymer. <b>Electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> tests demonstrate that the nanocomposites with plasma polymerized silica nanoparticles feature better resistance against electrical treeing, lower dielectric constant, and also mitigated space charge built-up.

And these improved values of <b>electrical</b> <b>insulation</b> properties are much higher than these of epoxy nanocomposites reported in previous studies.
