40|$|In many {{countries}} worldwide access networks {{are in the}} transition from copper to <b>fiber</b> <b>access.</b> During the transition phase copper and fiber networks are operated in parallel. All regulators facing this situation of technological change have {{to decide how to}} price unbundled access to the copper loop in this transition phase. Should they keep the usual forward looking long-run incremental cost standard charge, or should they move to some different approach? The authors propose to price copper access based on the modern equivalent asset (MEA) of <b>fiber</b> <b>access.</b> Since <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> is superior to copper access, the cost of <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> (as a basis for pricing copper access) should, however, be corrected by the performance delta between copper and <b>fiber</b> <b>access.</b> Instead of using quality of service (QoS) differences, the authors determine the performance delta based on the market valuation of services provided over the copper and <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> represented by the end-user prices of services and corrected by cost differences downstream of the access provision. Under this approach an access seeker becomes indifferent (on the margin) between using the copper or the <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> network and wholesale pricing (or regulation) becomes competitively neutral towards technology choice between copper and <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> and does not distort the platform competition towards cable. To test its practicability numerical simulations of the approach are performed by means of a quantitative competition model. The model analysis suggests that the approach leads to unique and robust results. Its main conclusion is that the method tends to be conservative relative to the theoretical case of pure vertical product differentiation, meaning that the measured performance delta underestimates the theoretical performance delta...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the access charges of copper and fiber {{unbundling}} on an incumbent's incentives to invest in <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> networks. Once the fiber deployment is in place, the incumbent and the entrant compete for consumers in both copper and fiber markets. We show that when the regulator can freely set either the copper or the <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> charge, there is a positive correlation between the fixed <b>fiber</b> (respectively, copper) <b>access</b> charge and the copper (respectively, <b>fiber)</b> <b>access</b> charge that maximizes the incumbent's profit after the investment. On the contrary, when the regulator is free to set both access charges, the incumbent's profit is an increasing function of both access charges. However, the decision of the incumbent to undertake the investment in fiber deployment is not only affected by its profit after the investment, but also by the opportunity cost of the investment. This cost is reflected by the profits that the incumbent earns when it does not invest in <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> networks, and hence, the two firms compete for the provision of only copper-based services. We find that the optimal regulatory policy in terms of investment incentives is to set the copper access charge at the cost of providing the access to the copper access network and the <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> charge at the level that maximizes the incumbent's profit after the investment. It {{should be noted that the}} proposed regulatory policy confirms the methodology of the EC Recommendation (2013 / 466 /EU) for setting the copper and <b>fiber</b> <b>access</b> charges in order to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment environment...|$|R
