5|$|Despite taking massive {{losses on}} the Saturn, {{including}} a 75 {{percent drop in}} half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders. Sega announced that Sonic Adventure, the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would arrive {{in time for the}} Dreamcast's launch and promoted the game with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall.s Tokyo premiere was a grand event–three stadium-packed showings, a demonstration of the game and more... Afterward, Segata Sanshiro led the crowd in a Sonic chant, which will be used in the game.}} However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process. As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out {{by the end of the}} day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of Virtua Fighter 3, the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Key Dreamcast software titles Sonic Adventure and Sega Rally Championship 2, which had been delayed, arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient <b>installed</b> <b>base</b> to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software. Seaman, released in July 1999, was considered the Dreamcast's first major hit in Japan. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales. The price reduction and release of Namco's Soul Calibur helped Sega to gain 17 percent on its shares.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies decision {{problems facing}} the manufacturer that offers cash incentive to encourage a fraction of its <b>install</b> <b>base</b> to return end-of-use devices. Marketing managers often use such tactics as a promotion tool to motivate sales of new products. Supply chain managers often use such tactics to obtain used products for profitable recovery operations. The first essay, “Product Acquisition for Remanufacturing: A Dynamic Analysis,” analyzes the performance of buyback and trade-in policies for acquiring products to be remanufactured. A key distinguishing feature of this analysis is the consideration of time dynamics. In particular, both the quantity-condition profile of used products and the market interest in remanufactured products evolve over time, and the manner of evolution is influenced by new product sales. Essay 1 introduces and analyzes a series of models that reflect the dynamics of customer willingness-to-return and willingness-to-pay attitudes, the size and condition of the OEM product <b>install</b> <b>base,</b> the demand for remanufactured product, {{and the demand for}} new product.

Several security consultants have condemned the move by Microsoft, saying that leaving a large <b>install</b> <b>base</b> unpatched from various security holes is irresponsible because this unpatched <b>install</b> <b>base</b> can be leveraged in large scale Internet attacks, such as Trojan horses used to send spam e-mail. Others have come to Microsoft's defense, arguing that Microsoft should not have to provide support for illegal users.

Users of existing installations of Windows XP can also change their product key by following instructions from Microsoft.|$|R
