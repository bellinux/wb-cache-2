40|$|An {{important}} economic instrument {{in the management}} of a river catchment's water resources is the charges made by government for the abstraction of water from ground and surface sources. Abstraction charges are a form of rent. However, the classical theory of differential rent has limited application to abstraction prices because that theory's assumption of competition in the supply of the natural resource does not hold in this case. Here, the property rights of individual households and of institutions to draw water are assigned by a state monopoly. In order to understand the specific and contingent practices of government in different countries, a taxonomy of charge-setting principles is proposed. This paper sets out six principal fields of action for sustainable water resource planning and, in that context, recommends full <b>incentive</b> <b>charging</b> as the basis of catchment policy. ...|$|E

30|$|Some {{relevant}} {{work has}} been done to study other researchers on the impact of V 2 G on the grid and the benefit of V 2 G participation for the vehicle owners. Sierzchula et al. [1] have explored the relationship between financial incentives and other socio-economic factors to the adoption of EVs in several countries. They found that financial <b>incentives,</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure, and local presence of an EV manufacturing facility can significantly affect a country's electric vehicle market share [1]. Pieltain et al. [5] have proposed a way to evaluate the impact of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) on the energy loss and investment of distribution network. Clement et al. [6, 7] have shown that uncoordinated charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in distribution network can lead to local grid problems, and therefore they proposed a coordinated charging and discharging approach to minimize the power losses and maximize the load factor within the system.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a scheme}} of economic incentives for environmental protection, in which spatially differentiated pollution taxes are {{in use in}} compensating the pollution abatement costs. A simple mathematical model is described which determines an incentive system that encourages polluters to reduce the discharges to an acceptable level of ambient quality standards in a “cost-effective” manner. It is shown that the vector of pollution charges has to be proportional to the marginal abatement cost vector, but is smaller than the latter in magnitude. It is demonstrated that a necessary incentive effect may be achieved even if the total pollution charge is much lower (about three times) than the total abatement costs. It is also estimated how this <b>charge</b> <b>incentive</b> system reconciles conflicting criteria of cost-effectiveness and of equity. These conclusions are verified by numerical experiments with real data.

Unlike previous work, this paper addresses the latter question by explicitly modeling firm behavior under various market structure conditions. The most interesting result from {{this analysis is}} that conditions of upstream competition and aftermarket control result in lower welfare than system monopoly.

From 1989 to 1999, the average underwriting fee for IPOs in Taiwan is 0. 99 %-far below the regulatory limit. Although the Taiwanese underwriting industry is highly concentrated, underwriting fees do not cluster at any particular level. We examine the underwriting fee and income structure in Taiwan and find support for an incentive hypothesis. Underwriters have an <b>incentive</b> to <b>charge</b> lower underwriting fees when market demand for IPO shares increases and capital gains account for a larger portion of their total income.

40|$|When {{courts are}} congested, the risk {{associated}} with facing a defaulting tenant is high for landlords. They tend to compensate for this risk by increasing rents to include a “risk premium. ” This {{has the effect of}} making the probability of defaulting increase, as well as further overloading the courts. Using a simple model we show in this paper how a better equilibrium can be reached when the resources of the judiciary are slightly increased. Our explanation is that a rise in public legal resources not only allows courts to produce more decisions (direct effect), but also reduces the number of cases coming in by giving landlords an <b>incentive</b> to <b>charge</b> lower rents (indirect effect). The synergy of the two effects creates a multiplier of public expenditure on justice. ...|$|R
40|$|More {{intensive}} copyright enforcement reduces piracy, raises prices, {{and lowers}} consumer surplus. We show that these results {{do not hold}} regarding the extent rather than intensity of enforcement. When enforcement is targeted at high-value buyers such as corporate and government users, the copyright holder has an <b>incentive</b> to <b>charge</b> super-monopoly prices, thereby encouraging piracy among low-value buyers. Extending enforcement down the demand curve broadens the copyright holder 9 ̆ 2 s captive market, leading to lower prices and higher sales that can increase both profits and consumer surplus. The standard tradeoff between the incentive to generate intellectual property {{and the cost of}} monopoly power is therefore avoided. Private enforcement by copyright holders may be insuciently extensive since consumers can also benefit from more extensive enforcement. Similarly, new technologies which lead to stronger control over illicit use can paradoxically benefit consumers...|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{privacy and}} the market for {{customer}} information in electronic retailing are investigated. The value of customer information derives from the ability of firms to identify individual consumers and charge them personalized prices. Two settings are studied, an anonymity regime in which sale of customer information is not possible, and a recognition regime in which a firm may compile and sell a customer list. Welfare comparisons depend critically on whether consumers anticipate sale of the list. If consumers do not foresee sale of their data, then firms possess <b>incentives</b> to <b>charge</b> higher prices under the recognition regime because this enhances {{the value of the}} list. If consumers anticipate sale of the list, then some types engage in strategic demand reduction. This undermines the market for customer information and often results in lower prices than would prevail under the anonymity regime. Firms prefer the recognition regime when consumers are myopic and the anonymity regime when consumers are strategic. More generally, welfare comparisons depend critically on demand elasticity.

40|$|Do {{switching}} costs reduce or intensify price competition in markets where firms charge {{the same price}} to old and new consumers? The answer is theoretically ambiguous because a firm prefers to charge a higher price to previous purchasers who are “locked-in” and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher future profitability. 800 -number portability provides empirical evidence to determine whether {{switching costs}} reduce or intensify price competition under a single price regime. Before portability, a customer had to change toll-free numbers in order to change service providers. In May 1993, 800 -numbers became portable, under a regulatory regime that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers. I test how AT&T and MCI adjusted their toll-free services prices in response to portability. I find that the firms reduced prices with portability, implying that the switching costs arising from non-portability made the market less competitive. Thus, despite rapid growth in toll-free services, the firms’ <b>incentives</b> to <b>charge</b> a higher price to “locked-in” consumers exceeded their incentive to capture new consumers...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the performance of}} private equity (PE) investments is sufficient to compensate investors (LPs) for risk, long-term illiquidity, management, and <b>incentive</b> fees <b>charged</b> by the general partner (GP). We analyze the LPs’portfolio-choice problem and find that management fees, carried interest, and illiquidity are costly, and GPs must generate substantial alpha to compensate LPs for bearing these costs. Debt is cheap and reduces these costs, potentially explaining the high leverage of buyout transactions. Conventional interpretations of PE performance measures appear optimistic. On average, LPs may just break even, net of management fees, carry, risk, and costs of illiquidity. (JEL G 11, G 23, G 24) While it is generally accepted that the average return of private equity (PE) funds exceeds the return on the market (e. g., Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan 2011), it remains controversial whether this outperformance is sufficient to compensate investors (LPs) for the costs of risks and long-term illiquidity.

40|$|This thesis investigates, in {{accordance}} to the analysis made by Metrick and Zeckhauser (1998) for the U. S. automobile market, the relationships between price and quality and/or quantity and quality in the Swedish automobile market. The results show no significant relationship between price and quality, but there exists a relationship between quantity and quality. In these markets, where the prices are similar but the qualities differ, we exhibit quantity clearing. This means that the high-quality producer sells more than the low-quality producer, but at no higher prices. When consumers are uncertain {{about the quality of}} the products, the low-quality seller has an <b>incentive</b> to <b>charge</b> the same price as the high-quality seller, resulting in an undesirable price for consumers. The theoretical sections of the thesis proceed from studies of the subject of industrial organization. These chapters are designed to explain the empirical results in a theoretical manner with the intentions of providing insights.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{concession}} revenue sharing between an airport and its airlines. It is found {{that the degree of}} revenue sharing will be affected by how airlines' services are related to each other (complements, independent, or substitutes). In particular, when carriers provide strongly substitutable services to each other, the airport has <b>incentive</b> to <b>charge</b> airlines, rather than to pay airlines, a share of concession revenue. In these situations, while revenue sharing improves profit, it reduces social welfare. It is further found that airport competition results in a higher degree of revenue sharing than would be had in the case of single airports. The airport-airline chains may nevertheless derive lower profits through the revenue-sharing rivalry, and the situation is similar to a Prisoners' Dilemma. As the chains move further away from their joint profit maximum, welfare rises beyond the level achievable by single airports. The (equilibrium) revenue-sharing proportion at an airport is also shown to {{decrease in the number of}} its carriers, and to increase in the number of carriers at competing airports. Finally, {{the effects of}} a 'pure' sharing contract are compared to those of the two-part sharing contract. It is found that whether an airport is subject to competition is critical to the welfare consequences of alternative revenue sharing arrangements.

40|$|This study explores and quantifies the {{benefits}} of connecting more distributed generation (DG) with and {{without the use of}} smart connections in Great Britain. We examine the impacts on different parties (Distribution Network Operators, wider society and generators). As illustration we use a specific case study. Alternative connection scenarios are proposed (with partial and full interruptible capacity quota under a mix of generation with different technology-specific curtailment levels) for integrating DG units in a constrained area of the East of England covered by the Flexible Plug and Play project. The smart (interruptible) connection option is the preferred option across all the scenarios (higher NPV/MW). The analysis of the distribution of benefits between the different parties suggests that generators capture most of {{the benefits}} while DNOs and wider society capture much less benefit. A smart connection incentive, which recreates the benefits to DNOs from an earlier losses incentive, is proposed. By contrast with other societally desirable metrics which are usually incentivised or penalised, there is currently no direct connection between more DG MWs connected and DNO incentive payments. Our proposed smart connection <b>incentive,</b> by <b>charging</b> DG for smarter connection may help to distribute more efficiently the benefits for connecting more DG.
