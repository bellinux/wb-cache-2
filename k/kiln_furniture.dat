50|$|A saggar {{is a type}} of <b>kiln</b> <b>furniture.</b> It is {{a ceramic}} boxlike {{container}} used in the firing of pottery to enclose or protect ware being fired inside a kiln. Traditionally, saggars were made primarily from fireclay. Saggars have been used to protect, or safeguard, ware from open flame, smoke, gases and kiln debris: the name is a contraction of the word safeguard. Their use is widespread, including in China, Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom. Saggars are still used in the production of ceramics to shield ware from the direct contact of flames and from damage by kiln debris. Modern saggars are made of alumina ceramic, cordierite ceramic, mullite ceramic silicon carbide and in special cases from zirconia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} {{the use of}} hydratable alumina binder (Alcoa) instead of Calcium Aluminate (CA) cement as binder in the {{production}} of SiC based self-flowing castable has been investigated. Spent SiC particles were classified into different fractions following crushing and grinding operations and have been utilized as aggregate. Tabular alumina, calcined monodipersed alumina, and hydratable alumina/CA cement were used as binder matrix. Anorthite (CaO. Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2) a gehlenithe (2 CaO. Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2) phases were formed according to the CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 three phase diagram. Molten phase negatively affects refractoriness of the materials. For that reason, by using hydratable alumina instead of CA cement mullite binder was created. Mullite was studied by SEM. In addition to CA cement supplementary samples, molten phase produced with CaO lessened the value of the hot modulus of rupture (HMOR).

40|$|For the {{processing}} of ceramic green tapes to form 3 D components, different technologies are known, for instance lamination to multilayer or folding. In the metal and plastic industry, deep drawing is after bending one of the famous method for reshaping of sheet metals and polymers. However, for processing green tapes this technology is not used because of the following debinding and sintering steps. During the complex shaping process, the within the polymer matrix arranged ceramic particles become rearrange and an inhomogeneous particle distribution can arise. During sintering this can result in defect because of inhomogeneous shrinkage behavior. This study presents basic investigations of the deep drawing of ceramic green tapes.

Because of its low expansion coefficient and dielectric properties, cordierite is also used in advanced ceramics, catalyst supports automotive, industrial waste gas purification and parts subjected to sudden temperature changes.

In this work a cordierite-mullite precursor was prepared from a mixture of magnesium oxide, calcined alumina, silica fume and monoaluminum phosphate solution that produces fast setting at room temperature (â¼ 20 minutes) and then, by calcination, cordierite-mullite is generated. The evolution of the mineralogical phases was studied from room temperature to 1350 Â°C by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry. A possible sequence of chemicals reactions throughout the heat treatment is also proposed.

The material legacy of this age of industrialisation is extensive, and archaeological work in the modern city over the last 20 years has, for the most part, focused on the above and below ground industrial archaeology relating to metals trades' production sites spanning the 19 th and 20 th centuries. This article describes recent archaeological work around the Upper Chapel, a Unitarian Meeting House in the city centre where archaeological work recovered a possible buried medieval soil deposit, which contained an assemblage of medieval pottery dating from the 12 th to 15 th centuries. The presence of waster sherds and fragments of <b>kiln</b> <b>furniture</b> within this assemblage suggests that pottery production may have taken place on or near the site, making this the first putative evidence for pottery production in medieval Sheffield. The archaeological investigations also recovered four human burials from the 18 th- to 19 th-century burial ground associated with the Upper Chapel. The Upper Chapel burial ground differs from other recently excavated cemeteries in Sheffield as it potentially contained graves of high-status individuals, with at least a proportion of the skeletons and coffins well-preserved owing to waterlogged ground conditions. Detailed studies of the human remains, coffins, and incorporated material, including brass shroud pins are also discussed. ...|$|E

The exhibited properties resulted {{wide range of}} industrial applications, especially in the catalytic converter, <b>kiln</b> <b>furniture,</b> diesel particulate filter and high frequency insulator. It occurs rarely in nature and its formulation from the indigenous raw materials is sensitive to the peak sintering temperature and holding time. Both the parameters are again affected on the source of raw materials. Hence optimization of peak temperature and holding time is crucial for each source of raw materials. In this paper three indigenous raw materials, clay, kaolin and talc were taken and mixed with different dopants. The prepared powder batch was sintered at different peak temperature and holding time. Among the three indigenous raw materials kaolin {{was found to be}} most suitable to formulate cordierite. The peak temperature was varied within the range of 1340 Â°C- 1400 Â°C and the holding time was considered from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. Both the parameters had significant influence on the production of cordierite. The percent of cordierite formation was affected with both the variation of holding time and peak temperature. Tough thermal shock resistance was not influenced by any of the parameters, but the influence on the porosity was quite significant.

Since 1970, Italian researchers performed an extensive archaeological investigation uncovering huge amounts of finds. This study aims at investigating the technological features and provenance of the unglazed pottery finds by using a minero-petrographic approach. Twenty-three samples of storage, table and cooking wares were selected based on the recurrence of typologically identifiable fragments and fabrics. Two bricks, seven production indicators (spacers, <b>kiln</b> <b>furniture,</b> slags) and a local clay were analysed for comparison. The production indicators and most of the pottery show high-CaO concentration. Thick-walled wares contain coarse sedimentary/metamorphic inclusions. Samples with thinner walls contain similar but fine/well-sorted inclusions. The mineralogy and microstructure indicate firing temperatures mainly ranging from 850 to 1000 Â°C. Low-CaO samples contain coarse sedimentary inclusions; in one sample, volcanic lithics are present. Firing temperatures range from about 800 to 950 Â°C, and the low-CaO character can be related to their specific function for cooking foods. One sample, found in older stratigraphic levels, differs for its peculiar calcitic temper and lower firing temperature. Local production of most samples was constrained by the composition of the inclusions compatible with the sediments of the Isfahan area. High-CaO pottery shows compositional affinity with production indicators, local clay and tiles produced in Isfahan during the Safavid period.

40|$|Since the 1990 s KERAFOL - Keramische Folien GmbH is {{developing}} zirconia based ceramic tapes and sintered substrates for Electrolyte Supported Cells (ESC). Together with Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (IKTS) in Dresden investigations and developments {{had taken place}} to improve {{the properties of the}} ESC. The result of this cooperation is the possibility to produce ESCs at KERAFOL which meet all requirements for an application in stacks and systems like mechanical strength, long-term stability during operation at temperatures of 750 deg C to 950 deg C, thermal cycling, very low degradation during repeated anode reduction/oxidation cycles and an enhanced power density that is comparable to ASCs (Anode Supported Cells). The cells are based on scandia doped zirconia electrolytes (ScSZ) and are completely manufactured at KERAFOL including electrolyte production, paste preparation, screen printing, firing and quality assurance. With improving the electrolytes at KERAFOL and the electrodes at IKTS and combining both technologies it was possible to make high performance ESCs commercially available. The ESCs show an excellent long term operation at high power densities (> 400 mW/cm(exp 2)). The values for the degradation of the ionic conductivity and the activation energy measured on 10 mol% stabilized ScSZ electrolytes during 1000 h were significantly lower than those of 8 mol% stabilized YSZ electrolytes. Even though KERAFOL uses hard conditions for reduction/oxidation cycles, the degradation rate is very low. By optimizing the functional layers low polarization resistances < 0. 25 Wcm(exp 2) could be realized as well as low electrolyte resistances (0. 06 Ohm cm(exp 2)) due to the facts of using highly ionic conducting materials and decreasing the electrolyte thicknesses. The electrolyte part of the total cell resistance at 850 deg C is only 27 %. So there is potential to increase power density by improving the electrodes especially for intermediate temperatures. The possibilities at KERAFOL and the results of the measurements are shown in the paper.

40|$|International audienceThe TÃ¼rbe {{excavations}} {{provided information}} about the Byzantine and Turkish periods of Ephesos / Ayasuluk. Chemical analyses confirm the presence of several categories of ceramic imports belonging to the main "middle Byzantine production" that were widespread in the Mediterranean and {{date back to the}} 12 th and 13 th centuries. Ephesos is part of the distribution area of this production, together with several other Western Anatolian sites such as Pergamon and the nearby castle of Anaia/Kadikalesi, where it is present in significant quantities. Pottery was also manufactured in Anaia. It was diffused not only at a regional level, as shown here through examples found in Ephesos, but also reached the Crusader states as seen by its noticeable presence in Saint-Jean-d'Acre. Ceramic production in Ephesos is documented in the TÃ¼rbe excavations through the discovery of rubefied layers, <b>kiln</b> <b>furniture</b> and wasters (Parrer, this volume). Several local groups, showing different chemical features, were identified thanks to local reference samples. These groups do not differ from those previously defined in a preliminary study of the Artemision material. The present study complements the previous chemical characterization and further illustrates the local manufacture of various types of table wares, from coarsely potted plain glazed to more "sophisticated" ceramics of "Islamic" types (turquoise glazed and molded wares). The latter would correspond to the introduction in the local repertoire of new stylistic and technological traditions, a phenomenon which would have occurred at the Beylik period in other Western Anatolian sites as well, such as Milet and Sardis. In Ephesos, the association of turquoise glaze or molded decoration with low-calcareous pastes, instead of calcareous ones, suggests an adaptation of the initial pottery traditions, as may be observed for example in Syria. The high degree of fragmentation of the sherds in the TÃ¼rbe excavations on the one hand, and the fluvial disturbances of the stratigraphy on the other hand, made it difficult to reconstruct the typo-chronological features of the local repertoire. Some connections could be made with the better preserved material from the Artemision, but were limited within our sampling. It is hoped that further sampling and analyses of ceramics coming from other excavations in Ephesos / Ayasuluk (Tribune, Isa Bey Hammam, etc [...] .) will make it possible for us to give further insight into these questions...|$|E

Efficiency in consumption of energy and its conservation {{would be one of}} the most important means of energy cost reduction and also for meeting future energy demand. The ceramic industry is one of energy intensive industry in Sri Lanka which uses massive quantity of thermal energy as well as electrical energy for the manufacturing processes. An analysis was carried out to asses the energy consumption of two industrial processes in manufacturing ceramic wall tiles using technologies of conventional and fast firing. Conventional firing technology is the oldest technology and fast firing technology is the latest technology that are being used to fire ceramic products. / The main objective of the study was to analyze the energy efficiency of technologies in a broad view and as secondary to study the energy conservation techniques used and can be used in order to reduce the energy consumption. The method of embedded energy analysis was used to analyze the energy of two processes under certain boundary conditions. Analysis of embedded energy was calculated in three levels such as level I direct energy supplied by the fuels and electricity, level 2 all ancillary energy inputs and level 3, energy in raw materials. The calculated embedded energy of wall tiles manufactured with the technology of conventional firing is 16 GJ/ MT and similarly the embedded energy of wall tiles manufactured with the technology of fast firing is 9 GJ / MT. The energy consumption in each levels, level 1, level 2 and level 3 of conventional firing technology is 96. 7 %, 2. 4 %, and 0. 9 % respectively and in fast firing technology is 96. 5 %, 2. 4 %, 1. 1 % respectively. / 1 'he latest technology of fast firing technology has been developed highly considering of energy efficiency productivity and product quality. The fast firing technology consist of many kinds energy saving technologies such as waste heat recovery, high thermal efficient <b>kiln</b> <b>furniture</b> and refractory, high efficient burners, efficient tile transportation methods. Out of two technologies of fast firing and conventional firing the most energy efficient technology is the fast firing technology which is 12 % more efficient than the conventional tiring with compared to the result of the study. Further the implementation of energy conservation techniques to the existing plants will be incorporated to reduce energy consumption by 5 to 10 percent on electrical and 2 to 5 percent on thermal...|$|E
