There is also no need to add restriction sites when designing primers and thus shorter primers can be used saving time and money.

Although novel cloning methods have recently been developed, many laboratories worldwide continue to use traditional restriction digestion-ligation methods to construct expression vectors owing to financial constraints and the unavailability of appropriate vectors.

40|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{techniques}} in biomedical research is cDNA cloning for expression studies in mammalian cells. Vaccinia topoisomerase I-mediated cloning (TOPO cloning by Invitrogen) allows fast and efficient recombination of PCR-amplified DNAs. Among TOPO vectors, a pcDNA 3. 1 <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> vector is particularly convenient, since it can be used for expression analysis immediately after cloning. However, I found that the cloning efficiency was reduced when RT-PCR products were used as inserts (about one-quarter). Since TOPO vectors accept any PCR products, contaminating fragments in the insert DNA create negative clones. Therefore, I designed a new mammalian expression vector enabling positive blue white selection in Vaccinia topoisomerase I–mediated cloning. The method utilized a short nontoxic LacZα peptide as a linker for GFP fusion. When cDNAs were properly inserted into the vector, minimal expression of the fusion proteins in E. coli (harboring lacZΔM 15) resulted in formation of blue colonies on X-gal plates.

40|$|Acidobacterium capsulatum is an {{environmental}} bacterium that is relatively abundant in soil and aquatic environments, prefers a pH 3 for optimal growth and encapsulates {{itself in a}} polysaccharide. Little {{is known about the}} biochemistry and physiology of this organism, but its genome has been completed and growth conditions have been found that support growth on glucose as a single carbon source. We are focusing on the metabolism of glucose and the proteins that are involved with the first and last steps of glycolysis. These two proteins were hand chosen by the Gods because in similar organisms they are important in glucose metabolism. In these studies, PEP carboxykinase and glucokinase were characterized and cloned with the ultimate goal of expressing them and defining their activities. PEP carboxykinase catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phophoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide within glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In the 3 assays we found on PEPCK, they all described conditions for the assay at pH 8. The pI of PEP carboxykinase was found to be 6. 09. Glucokinase converts glucose to glucose- 6 -phosphate in the first step of glycolysis. After searching NCBI for the appropriate assay, it was determined that for glucokinase a glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled reaction would work best at pH 7. 5. The pI of glucokinase was found to be 5. 48. Because A. capsulatum has optimal growth at pH 3, our hypothesis is that the cytoplasm of these organisms is at a somewhat lower pH than the normal physiological pH of 7. 5, which is supported by the calculated pIs for these proteins. The genes that encode for PEP carboxykinase and glucokinase were determined using KEGG. Primers were designed using the primer design function on NCBI. Once the desired primers were created, the genes were amplified using PCR followed by a PCR cleanup to isolate our amplicon. The purified gene was inserted into the TOPO-TA plasmid using a <b>directional</b> TOPO <b>cloning</b> kit. To continue this study we will characterize the gene insert by sequencing, and if glucokinase and PEP carboxykinase are inserted correctly then they will have lengths of 1, 000, and 1, 500 bp, respectively...|$|R

Allergy to melon (cucumis melo) {{is one of}} the most frequent fruit allergies in Iran. Three different major allergens have been found in Cucumis melo that Cuc m 1 (cucumisin) has been identified as the major allergen of melon. Cucumisin is an alkaline serine protease that it is found as a 78 kDa protein in precursor form. The aim of this study was production of recombinant Cuc m 1 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells and characterization of its allergenicity property. MethodsProduction of recombinant Cuc m 1 was carried out by cDNA cloning technique into the pET 32 b(+) vector using specific primers designed based on cucumisin nucleotide sequence available in Genebank database, cucumisin encoding gene and <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> method. Cloned plasmid into E. coli TOP 10 was transformed into E. coli BL 21 and expression of the protein was induced by iptg. The recombinant protein was purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography using histidine tag in recombinant protein. IgE binding of this protein was assessed by IgE-immunoblotting, ELISA and inhibition ELISA. ResultsThe <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> was resulted in expression of a fusion Cuc m 1. Immunoblotting with sera of patients allergic to melon showed strong reactivity with purified protein band. Inhibition assays demonstrated that purified rCuc m 1 could be the same with natural form of Cuc m 1 in total extract. ConclusionsIn the present study, we have provided a functional recombinant cucumisin allergen, rCuc m 1 with 86 kDa, which may be used as a standard allergen for clinical diagnosis and study of allergy to melon...|$|E

40|$|Argonaute (Ago) {{proteins}} are the effector proteins of RNA interference (RNAi) {{and related}} silencing mechanisms that are mediated by small RNAs. Ago proteins bind directly to microRNAs (miRNAs) and to short interfering RNAs {{and are the}} core protein components of RNA induced silencing complexes (RISCs) and microRNPs (miRNPs). Here we report that an ~ 70 -nt RNA associates specifically with immunopurified Ago 2 expressed in human 293 cells. By <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> we identified this RNA as the mitochondrial tRNAMet (mt tRNAMet). Various exported (mt) tRNAs were detected in the cytosol of 293 cells, but Ago 2 was found selectively bound to (mt) tRNAMet.

40|$|AIM: To {{construct}} a vacA-knockout Helicobacter pylori mutant strain, whose only {{difference from the}} wild strain is its disrupted vacA gene. METHODS AND RESULTS: A clone containing kanamycin resistance gene used for homologous recombination was constructed in a <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> procedure into pBluescript II SK, and then transformed into vacA + H pylori by electroporation. Colonies growing on the selective media containing kanamycin were harvested for chromosomal DNA extraction, and the allelic exchange was determined by polymerase chain reactions and sequencing. Loss of vacuolating activity of the vacA-knockout strain was confirmed by examining the gastric cells co-cultured with cell-free supernatants from H pylori wild strain or the mutant. CONCLUSION: We constructed a vacA-knockout strain of H pylori through direct mutagenesis, which creates an important precondition for the future research on virulence comparison with gene expression analysis...|$|E

40|$|By modifying current cDNA cloning and {{electroporation}} methods, {{large and}} representative murine cDNA libraries were synthesized from 10 to 100 ng mRNA isolated from unfertilized egg and preimplantation mouse embryos. High cloning efficiency {{is essential for}} complete representation of genes expressed in egg and preimplantation embryos and for the isolation of stage-specific genes using subtractive hybridization. Because the mouse embryo contains no more than 50 pg of poly(A) + mRNA at any stage of preimplantation development, approximately 5000 - 10, 000 embryos are required to obtain enough mRNA to synthesize libraries using current methods. To obtain a representative library that also includes rare transcripts, {{the size of the}} library should be at least 10 (6) clones. The average percent conversion of mRNA to single-stranded cDNA was 20 - 40 %, so that a cloning efficiency of nearly 2 x 10 (8) cfu/microgram cDNA is required for such a cDNA library. No previous methods have provided <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> of cDNA into plasmids with these high efficiencies. The advent of electroporation methods for the introduction of nucleic acids into bacteria has made possible the use of standard plasmid vectors for high-efficiency cDNA cloning. Plasmid vectors are currently available that can accommodate the <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> of cDNA such that T 7 and T 3 RNA polymerase promoter sequences can be used to generate sense and anti-sense transcripts for subtractive hybridization and riboprobe synthesis. The cDNA libraries we derived using this methodology are a reusable and abundant source of genetic information about the control of preimplantation development. Specialized subtractive cDNA libraries enriched for genes expressed exclusively at a predetermined time in development give access to genes expressed in a stage-specific manner. The ability to construct new cDNA libraries from limited amounts of starting material ensures the provision of new and important resources for the identification and study of novel genes or gene families, and it is an important new tool for understanding the molecular control of mammalian development...|$|E

To express urate oxidase protein with a native N terminus, the Xho I site at base pairs 1184 – 1189 of the expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen easy select Pichia Expression kit) was used to clone the gene flush with the Kex 2 cleavage site.

40|$|Bacterial cDNA {{expression}} libraries {{are made}} to reproduce protein sequences present in the mRNA source tissue. However, there is no control over which frame of the cDNA is translated, because translation of the cDNA must be initiated on vector sequence. In a library of nondirectionally cloned cDNAs, only some 8 % of the protein sequences produced {{are expected to be}} correct. <b>Directional</b> <b>cloning</b> can increase this by a factor of two, but it does not solve the frame problem. We have therefore developed and tested a library construction methodology using a novel vector, pKE- 1, with which translation in the correct reading frame confers kanamycin resistance on the host. Following kanamycin selection, the cDNA libraries contained 60 – 80 % open, in-frame clones. These, compared with unselected libraries, showed a 10 -fold {{increase in the number of}} matches between the cDNA-encoded proteins made by the bacteria and database protein sequences. cDNA sequencing programs will benefit from the enrichment for correct coding sequences, and screening methods requiring protein expression will benefit from the enrichment for authentic translation products...|$|E

AVC 2. null is an adenoviral expression vector containing unique restriction sites between the human CMV-IE promoter and the SV 40 intron/polyadenylation site. Transgenes were prepared for cloning into this vector by introduction of compatible restriction sites by PCR. A vector expressing rat granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was constructed using DNA-protein complex as well as by traditional recombination techniques. The efficacy of our adenoviral cloning system utilizing DNA-protein complex was two logs higher than that seen using homologous recombination. All viruses generated by directional ligation of the insert into the vector DNA-protein complexes contained the desired transgene in the correct orientation. This technique greatly simplifies and accelerates the generation of recombinant adenoviral vectors...|$|E

Preliminary experiments revealed that in vitro recombinational cloning (RC) provided important advantages over conventional ligation-assisted cloning: it eliminated restriction digestion for <b>directional</b> <b>cloning,</b> generated low levels of chimeric clones, reduced size bias and, in our hands, gave a higher cloning efficiency than conventional ligation reactions. In a cDNA cloning experiment using an in vitro synthesized long poly(A) + RNA (7. 8 kb), the RC gave a higher full-length cDNA clone content and about 10 times more transformants than conventional ligation-assisted cloning. Furthermore, characterization of rat brain cDNA clones yielded by the RC method showed that the frequency of cDNA clones > 2 kb having internal NotI sites was ∼ 6 %, whereas these cDNAs could not be cloned at all or could be isolated only in a truncated form by conventional methods. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} the RC method makes it possible to prepare cDNA libraries better representing the entire population of cDNAs, without sacrificing the simplicity of current conventional ligation-assisted methods...|$|E

The cloning of protein-coding genes into expression vectors is required to be directional for proper expression, and versatile {{in order to facilitate}} gene insertion in multiple different vectors for expression tests. In this study, the TA-GC cloning method is proposed, as a new, simple and efficient method for the <b>directional</b> <b>cloning</b> of protein-coding genes in expression vectors. The presented method features several advantages over existing methods, which tend to be relatively more labour intensive, inflexible or expensive. The proposed method relies on the complementarity between single A- and G-overhangs of the protein-coding gene, obtained after a short incubation with T 4 DNA polymerase, and T and C overhangs of the novel vector pET-BccI, created after digestion with the restriction endonuclease BccI. The novel protein-expression vector pET-BccI also facilitates the screening of transformed colonies for recombinant transformants. Evaluation experiments of the proposed TA-GC cloning method showed that 81 % of the transformed colonies contained recombinant pET-BccI plasmids, and 98 % of the recombinant colonies expressed the desired protein. This demonstrates that TA-GC cloning could be a valuable method for cloning protein-coding genes in expression vectors...|$|E

Efficient transformation methods to obtain site-directed gene replacement, targeted over-expression by promoter replacement, in-frame epitope tagging or fusion of coding sequences with fluorescent markers such as GFP are essential for this process.

Results Here, we present a USER Friendly cloning based technique that allows single step cloning of the two required homologous recombination sequences into different sites of a recipient vector. The advantages are: A simple experimental design, free choice of target sequence, few procedures and user convenience. The vectors are intented for Agrobacterium tumefaciens and protoplast based transformation technologies. The system has been tested by the construction of vectors for targeted replacement of 17 genes and overexpression of 12 genes in Fusarium graminearum. The results show that four fragment vectors can be constructed in a single cloning step with an average efficiency of 84 % for gene replacement and 80 % for targeted overexpression.
