40|$|This thesis {{considered}} {{the perception of}} floor <b>impact</b> <b>sounds</b> in apartment buildings and focused on relationships between non-acoustic factors and annoyance caused by floor <b>impact</b> <b>sounds.</b> Firstly, a qualitative {{study was conducted to}} investigate exposure to floor <b>impact</b> <b>sounds.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 residents in apartments in South Korea using a grounded theory methodology. These data were analysed using three coding phases; several key themes were identified and grouped into five categories. Two major noise sources (heavy-weight and light-weight impact source) were grouped together with retaliatory noise under the category of ‘noise exposure’. Different ways to manage noise exposure or cope with negative noise perceptions were categorised under ‘coping’. Health issues and concerns were grouped together under ‘health effects’. ‘Intervening conditions’ were identified and non-acoustic variables in this category included attitudes to authorities and neighbours, noise sensitivity, past experience, and dwelling satisfaction. A conceptual model was proposed to give an overview of how residents perceive and react to floor <b>impact</b> <b>sounds.</b> Secondly, a quantitative study was performed to empirically test the findings of the qualitative study. Survey questions were developed based on a literature review of studies on environmental noise and the findings from the qualitative study. A conceptual model was hypothesised and tested using structural equation modelling. Relationships between non-acoustic factors (noise sensitivity, disturbance, health complaints, coping, negative attitudes to authorities, and closeness with neighbours) and annoyance caused by floor <b>impact</b> <b>sounds</b> were tested using path analysis. The impacts of moderators on the perceptions and reactions to floor <b>impact</b> <b>sounds</b> were examined using two different tests. Noise from footsteps increased the direct impact size of noise sensitivity on perceived disturbance. Empathy, past experience, and dwelling satisfaction were also found to have moderation effects on the relationship between negative attitudes to authorities and coping. A positive relationship was found between annoyance and avoidant coping which was influenced by the moderators of negative attitudes to authorities and neighbours. Findings from path analysis and moderation tests supported and extended the previous findings of environmental noise studies and the qualitative study...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the acoustics characteristics obtained from <b>impact</b> <b>sounds</b> excited by <b>impact</b> on tiled-walls and hence to develop a rapid, effective and robust non-destructive evaluation method for bonding integrity inspection. Most of the previous research on impact acoustics evaluation relies on the frequency-domain characteristics of the free-vibration component of <b>impact</b> <b>sounds</b> for detection and feature extraction. This method proves to be too sensitive to the surface roughness of the practical structures. In the present work, special attention is paid to the time-domain acoustics to present a solution tolerant of high surface non-uniformity. Based on the impact dynamics analysis, the relationship between the acceleration and ringing components of <b>impact</b> <b>sounds</b> and the corresponding bonding state is firstly clarified. Investigation performed on the pattern of the initial acceleration component in the time record reveals its effectiveness in indicating the existence of bonding defects in tile-walls with satisfactory immunity to surface roughness. By properly selecting the feature vectors extracted from the initial acceleration peaks of the <b>impact</b> <b>sounds,</b> a multilayer back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) classifier is developed for automatic health monitoring of the tile-walls. The inspection results obtained experimentally on sample slabs are presented and discussed, confirming the validity of the proposed method. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
