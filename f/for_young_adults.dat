5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b> During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references to substance abuse and sexual intercourse; The A.V. Club said Henson was probably influenced {{by the work of}} Ralph Bakshi, who was also active during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules.

Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E

From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009.

5|$|Pratchett's {{first two}} adult novels, The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a {{disc-shaped}} world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and Nation (2008), a book <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b>|$|E

5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|Despite 17th Street Productions {{holding the}} rights to The Last Dog on Earth, Dell Publishing gained {{permission}} to publish it. The company released the novel in hardcover in 2003 and in paperback in 2004. Throughout 2009, the book was published on various e-book readers, including the Nook, Kindle, and several Apple Inc. products. The Last Dog on Earth was a winner of the Texas Lone Star Reading List and recognized by YALSA on a 2006 book list <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b> The novel garnered mixed feedback from critics, who generally felt that the plot held appeal, but that Ehrenhaft tended to rely on coincidence.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has won several awards. In 2007, {{the book}} was named one of The New York Times 100 Notable Books, {{and one of its}} Notable Children's Books.

5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> {{to have their own}} casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse and skirt ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar sweater, blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|Andre Norton Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees {{do not need to be}} members. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November15 and February15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. A SFWA panel of jurors determines if the nominated works are written <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>adults,</b> and they may add up to three works to the ballot. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.|$|E
