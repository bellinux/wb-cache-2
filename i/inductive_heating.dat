The paper asserts that it will avoid reference to Carnot cycles, and then proceeds to base its argument on cycles of forward and backward quasi-static adiabatic stages, with isothermal stages of zero magnitude.|$|E

40|$|In laser {{cladding}} weld bead tracks, {{which are often}} made of wear and corrosion resistant materials, are strongly joined to the subjacent work piece forming surfaces as well as complex volume build-ups. The process is typically characterized by high laser-related temperature gradients and also density changes due to phase transformations arising during cooling. That results in high thermal stresses which even {{may lead to the}} formation of cracks in case of brittle materials. An optimized temperature distribution of the process zone which might be reached by optimized process conditions or by additional <b>inductive</b> <b>heat</b> sources can significantly reduce critical stresses and, hence, the danger of cracking. Additionally the stress formation can be strongly influenced by a suitable placement of neighboring weld beads. Stresses of multi-track formations are completely different compared to the stress distribution of a single weld bead. By means of a heuristic as well as a three-dimensional FEM-model the interaction between process parameters, tailored temperature distributions and the placement of tracks has been clarified.

40|$|Laser {{cladding}} is {{a modern}} technology for the precise generation of coatings, for the repair and maintenance of tools, and for rapid prototyping. Thereby the molten coating material is welded on the substrate without large dilution of the coating with substrate material. Thermal contraction during cooling leads to tensile stresses in the coating which may cause cracks and delamination, in particular {{in the case of}} very hard coating materials and at high feed rates as required for the efficient generation of wear and corrosion resistant coatings. Aim of this work is {{a better understanding of the}} influence of various parameters such as temperature-time cycles, phase tansformations, and the geometrical conditions on the stress and strain evolution. This opens possibilities to minimize the danger of cracking by an appropriate process management. First stress and strain fields at a single weld bead were calculated numerically for various process parameter sets. Thereafter stress states have been calculated for overlaying weld beads since the coating stresses depend strongly on the mutual interaction of these beads and on the track pattern chosen.

40|$|We {{describe}} the synthesis, characterisation and surface-modification of magnetic narroparticles and a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgel, {{followed by the}} assembly and characterisation of magnetic nanoparticles on the microgel. To facilitate this deposition, {{the surface of the}} microgel is first modified via the layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolytes. One advantage of this concept is that it allows an independent optimization and fine tuning of the magnetic and thermoresponsive properties of individual components (nanoparticles and microgels) before assembling them so that the hybrid core-shell structure retains all the individual properties. The,decisive parameter when exploiting the thermoresponsive and magnetic properties in such hybrid core-shell structures is the amount of heat transfer from the magnetic core onto the thermosensitive (loaded) microgel (for the subsequent heat-triggered release of drugs). <b>Inductive</b> <b>heat</b> study reveals that the heat generated by the magnetic narroparticles is sufficient to cause the collapse of the microgel above its volume phase transition temperature. Successful confinement of positively and negatively charged magnetic nanoparticles between polyelectrolyte layers is achieved using the layer-by-layer deposition onto the microgel. Dynamic light scattering measurements show (i) the presence of each layer successfully deposited, (ii) the preservation of thermoresponsivity in the coated microgel, and (iii) that the magnetic nanoparticles do not get detached during the phase transition of the microgel. Electrophoresis measurements confirm charge reversal at every stage of layering of polycations, polyanions and magnetic nanoparticles. This unique combination of thermoresponsivity and magnetism opens up novel perspectives towards remotely controlled drug carriers. (c) 200...|$|R
