It was found that <b>grain</b> refinement decreased the <b>grain</b> size and made the <b>grain</b> morphology more globular. Therefore refining the <b>grain</b> size of an equiaxed dendritic <b>grain</b> decreased the hot tearing susceptibility. However, when the alloy was <b>grain</b> refined such that globular <b>grain</b> morphologies where obtained, further <b>grain</b> refinement increased the hot tearing susceptibility. Increasing the cooling decreased the <b>grain</b> size and made the <b>grain</b> morphology more dendritic and therefore increased the likelihood of hot tearing.

30|$|<b>Grain</b> {{size and}} shape are both {{determined}} by <b>grain</b> length and width. While <b>grain</b> size is the major determinant of <b>grain</b> weight, <b>grain</b> shape is mainly related to consuming preference (Calingacion et al., 2014) {{and may not be}} associated with <b>grain</b> weight. For genes having similar effects on <b>grain</b> length and width with opposite directions, such as GL 7 /GW 7 (Song et al., 2015), the influence is usually exerted on <b>grain</b> shape rather than <b>grain</b> weight. One of the two QTL we identified, qGS 1 - 35.2, affected <b>grain</b> shape without influencing <b>grain</b> weight and other yield traits. The MY 46 allele decreased <b>grain</b> length but increased <b>grain</b> width, resulting in little effect on <b>grain</b> weight and enhanced effect on the ratio of <b>grain</b> length to width (Table 3). This type of QTL could be used to modify <b>grain</b> shape without yield penalty. For genes simultaneously controlling <b>grain</b> length and width with the same allelic direction, and those contributing to either <b>grain</b> length or width, such as most of the cloned genes conditioning these traits (Li and Li, 2016; Yu et al., 2017), the same direction of QTL effect is always simultaneously detected on <b>grain</b> size and <b>grain</b> weight. Another QTL we identified, qGW 1 - 35.5, falls into this category (Table 3). The MY 46 allele significantly increased both the <b>grain</b> length and width, and in the meantime enhanced <b>grain</b> weight. This type of QTL could be used for yield improvement. More and more choices for breeding utilization can be anticipated with the identification of new genes for <b>grain</b> size traits.|$|R

30|$|<b>Grain</b> size {{is one of}} {{important}} agronomic traits in crops. <b>Grain</b> size is determined by <b>grain</b> length, <b>grain</b> width and <b>grain</b> thickness.

Failure is more likely to occur in large <b>grain</b> systems. The chemical diffusion coefficients increase with increasing <b>grain</b> orientation angle irrespective of <b>grain</b> boundary diffusivity, due to alignment of global Li ion diffusion path with high <b>grain</b> orientations. <b>Grain</b> boundary diffusivity has opposite effect on the hydrostatic stress. As small <b>grain</b> boundary diffusivity, the stress increases with increasing <b>grain</b> orientation angle, due to <b>grain</b> boundary blockage of Li ion diffusion. In contrast, with large <b>grain</b> boundary diffusivity, the stress decreases with increasing <b>grain</b> orientation angle due to reduced concentration gradients in <b>grain</b> boundary regions...|$|R
