5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% of the <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> risk to schizophrenia {{is explained by}} <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the {{methodology}} {{to quantify the}} <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> temperature regulation of human body for transient simulation of body temperature. Experiments of transient thermal exposure were conducted for four subjects and the characteristics of <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> themoregulatory response were observed quantitatively. As the result, the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> core temperature and heart rate were significant. For each subject, the physiological coefficients used in the two-node model were adjusted {{in order to minimize}} the difference between experimental and calculated values in a series of a representative transient state in core and skin temperature. With the combination of the coefficients determined, the skin and core temperatures calculated with the two-node model agreed well with the experimental results for all the subjects involved in the experiments. This shows that the <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the regulation of body temperature is well described with the combination of the coefficients determined by the optimization...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{the striped}} hyena, {{for which a}} number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E
