5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to <b>hostile</b> <b>action</b> from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived in Kabul in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) and Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E

From 13–22 December, 420 vehicles and 23 tanks {{were destroyed by}} StG 77, greatly improving {{the morale of the}} German infantry, who were by now on the defensive. StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective dive bomber wing. It had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to <b>hostile</b> <b>action.</b> At the end of Barbarossa, StG 1 had lost 60 Stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground. StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, StG 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action).

5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a <b>hostile</b> <b>action,</b> the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from <b>hostile</b> <b>action,</b> but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|A Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} {{was shot down}} over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. The nearest Axis bases were on Rhodes, and so the aircraft had to stage through somewhere {{to be able to}} get to Iraq. The only possible place was Vichy-controlled Syria. This overtly <b>hostile</b> <b>action</b> could not be tolerated. Consequently, after victory in Iraq, British forces invaded Syria and Lebanon to remove the Vichy officials from power there. Vigorous resistance was put up by the French against British and Australian forces moving into Lebanon from Palestine. However, pressure there eventually overwhelmed, and when this combined with an advance on Damascus from Iraq, the French surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of their work 1 ACAU {{personnel}} were quite vulnerable to enemy action and potentially could have suffered heavy casualties if the Viet Cong had decided to target them. Many members spent time alone in villages while civil affairs vehicles often traveled routes with just a driver and one passenger. Yet overall, there was little <b>hostile</b> <b>action</b> against members of the unit. In the early days after the unit's arrival in Nui Dat, there were sniper incidents in Hoa Long, and a medical team became involved in a contact in Hoi My, south of Dat Do, during which several 1 ACAU members sustained minor gunshot wounds. There were other minor incidents later also, for example, when the Viet Cong destroyed the water reticulation system on Long Son island, just days after it came into operation. However, by 1969–70 the security situation in the province had greatly improved.|$|E
25|$|Assisting clergy Gregório Amúrrio of Mission San Luis Obispo {{arrived from}} San Gabriel eight days {{later with a}} supply of goods and cattle. Unfortunately, word arrived from San Diego {{at the same time}} that a group of natives {{attacked}} the mission and brutally murdered one of the missionaries (Luís Jayme). Since it was feared at the time that any <b>hostile</b> <b>action</b> by the natives against the few burgeoning outposts might break Spain's tenuous hold on Alta California, the priests quickly buried the San Juan Capistrano Mission bells. Lieutenant José Francisco Ortega, military leader of the expedition, led all but a small contingent of Spanish soldiers back to El Presidio de San Diego to help quell the uprising; the priests, along with the few remaining soldiers as an escort, gathered up their belongings and fled to the safety of the Presido, where they were given further details of the disaster.|$|E

25|$|A Yakima Chief, Qualchan, who was disgruntled {{following}} {{the loss of}} the Yakima War to the U.S. Army, gathered the Colville, the Coeur d'Alene, the Columbia River, and the Kalispel tribes at a council in order to convince the tribes that the white man was encroaching on their lands and that they needed to defend them. The Coeur d’Alene and other tribes subsequently held a council discussing their concerns that the army would invade their territory {{as a result of the}} growing tensions. A line was drawn at the Snake River, agreeing that if the army crossed it, they would have effectively crossed into the Indians’ territory, and this would be considered a <b>hostile</b> <b>action.</b> Interestingly, the Coeur d’Alene tribe was split in their feelings toward war. The tribal leaders did not want war, fearing that the consequences to their people would be devastating, while the younger warriors, led by Milkapsi, were angry and wanted to fight.|$|E
25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and kissed the Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then strode to {{the centre of the}} chamber without any forewarning of what he was about to say, and, instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or <b>hostile</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{policy was}} the {{responsibility}} of Józef Beck, under whom Polish diplomacy attempted balanced approaches toward Germany and the Soviet Union, unfortunately without success, {{on the basis of}} a flawed understanding of the European geopolitics of his day. Beck had numerous foreign policy schemes and harbored illusions of Poland's status as a great power. He alienated most of Poland's neighbors, but is not blamed by historians for the ultimate failure of relations with Germany. The principal events of his tenure were concentrated in its last two years. In the case of the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania, the Polish action nearly resulted in a German takeover of southwest Lithuania. Also in 1938, the Polish government opportunistically undertook a <b>hostile</b> <b>action</b> against the Czechoslovak state as weakened by the Munich Agreement and annexed a small piece of territory on its borders. In this case, Beck's understanding of the consequences of the Polish military move turned out to be completely mistaken. In the end, the German occupation of Czechoslovakia ushered in by the Munich Agreement markedly weakened Poland's own position. Furthermore, Beck mistakenly believed that Nazi-Soviet ideological contradictions would preclude their cooperation.|$|E
