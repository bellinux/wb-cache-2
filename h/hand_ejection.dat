40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{left and}} right ventricular filling and ejection performances by use of Doppler echocardiography in healthy, conscious dogs submitted to dobutamine stress testing. ANIMALS: 10 unsedated, healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURE: Doppler echocardiography was performed during cardiac stress testing on each dog twice at 24 -hour intervals. Dobutamine was infused in 10 micrograms/kg of body weight/min incremental dosages, from 12. 5 to 42. 5 micrograms/kg/min. Duration of each step was 15 minutes. Doppler measurements were recorded at baseline and at each stage of dobutamine infusion, whereas aortic diameter was measured at baseline and at peak dosage by use of two-dimensional echocardiography. RESULTS: Dobutamine infusion induced {{a significant increase in}} velocity time integrals and in peak flow velocities at the aortic, pulmonic, mitral, and tricuspid valves. Acceleration time-to-deceleration time ratio at the aortic wave also was increased significantly. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>ejection</b> time, acceleration time, and deceleration time at the aortic and pulmonic valves and peak flow velocity of the E wave-to-peak flow velocity of the A wave ratio at the mitral and tricuspid valves decreased significantly during the test. The acceleration time-to-deceleration time ratio at the pulmonic wave was unchanged. A significant, progressive increase in cardiac index also was observed during dobutamine infusion, with a maximal increase of 104 % from baseline. This was mediated initially by an increase in stroke index and, at higher dosages, by an increase in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Doppler echocardiography performed during dobutamine stress testing may be a reliable method of assessing myocardial function in dogs with cardiovascular disease.

50|$|First {{unveiled}} in 1997, the rifle uses the bullpup layout. This enables the rifle {{to be as}} short as a typical carbine, whilst still retaining the muzzle velocity of longer assault rifles. However, this makes the CR-21 only capable of being fired from the right <b>hand</b> as the <b>ejection</b> port {{is located on the}} back right side of the rifle. The port can not be changed from side to side.|$|R
40|$|Since {{recognition}} of factors which modify {{the duration of}} ejection in aortic stenosis is of clinical importance, the relations among rate-corrected left ventricular ejection time, aortic valve area, and determinants of ventricular performance were studied in 54 catheterised patients. In patients with a normal cardiac index, increasing duration of ejection was linearly related to increasing obstruction. In patients with failing ventricles, on the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>ejection</b> time was less prolonged, and the duration of ejection was unrelated to valve area. At fixed valve area, relation with cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, mean aortic valve pressure gradient, mean aortic pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure could not adequately explain the observed scatter in ejection time. This suggests a multifactorial basis for {{the wide range of}} ejection times observed with severe aortic stenosis...|$|R

With no sign that she ejected, Apollo cries out in despair. In orbit, Admiral Adama asks if Apollo has visual contact with Starbuck. Apollo replies [...] "negative...she went in". Adama orders search-and-rescue ships to be dispatched, but Apollo tells him that Starbuck is gone; there is nothing to find. There is stunned silence across the bridge.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{contribution}} of regional wall motion to global ejection in left ventricle (LV) in 14 normal subjects (N) and 18 patients with chronic LV volume overload (CVL : 8 with mitral regurgitation and 10 with arotic regurgitation; NYHA<II). LV cineangiograms (RAO 30 °) at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) were divided into 30 sections by a long axis (LA) and 15 short axes which divided LA equally into 15 lengths. Volumes of each section (SLV) at ED and ES were calculated as : (πR^ 2 / 2) ×LA/ 15 (R=short hemiaxis). In CVL, total ED volume (EDV) and total stroke volume (TSV) were larger than N (144 ± 59 vs 78 ± 12 (ml/m^ 2) and 82 ± 33 vs 47 ± 7 (ml/m^ 2) : both p< 0. 01), but ejection fraction was normal (57 ± 8 vs 61 ± 7 (%) : NS), indicating the compensated LV in CVL studied. In all subjects, the ratio (RC) of the ejected SLV (SLV at ED minus SLV at ES) to TSV correlated well with the ratio (%SLVed) of the SLV at ED to EDV (r= 0. 90), suggesting that the region with the longer short axis at ED more contributes to global ejection than that with lesser short axis. The slope of RC-%SLVed relation in N and that in CVL were not different. That is, regional contribution to global ejection in well compensated CVL is similar to N. On the other <b>hand,</b> regional <b>ejection</b> fraction (REF : ejected SLV divided by SLV at ED times 100 percent) didn't correlate with %SLVed, suggesting existence of nonuniformity of LV contraction. This discrepancy between RC-%SLVed relation and REF-%SLVed relation indicates the uniformity in nonuniformity of LV contraction in normal subjects {{as well as in}} patients with chronic, compensated volume overloading heart...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{assess whether}} {{contractile}} reserve during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) can predict left ventricular functional recovery {{in patients with}} peripartum cardiomyopathy and to assess myocardial fibrosis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in these patients. Methods: Nine patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy were enrolled. All patients underwent DSE and were followed for six months, when a rest Doppler echocardiogram was repeated. MRI was also performed {{at the beginning of}} follow-up to identify myocardial fibrosis. Results: Mean age was 29 +/- 7. 9 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 39. 4 +/- 8. 6 % (range 24 - 49 %). Eight of the nine patients showed left ventricular functional recovery with mean ejection fraction at follow-up of 57. 1 +/- 13. 8 %. The ejection fraction response to DSE did not predict recovery at follow-up. On the other <b>hand,</b> left ventricular <b>ejection</b> fraction at baseline correlated with ejection fraction at follow-up. Mild fibrosis was detected in only one patient. Conclusion: Left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was a predictor of left ventricular functional recovery in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Dobutamine stress echocardiography at presentation of the disease did not predict recovery at follow-up. Myocardial fibrosis appeared to be uncommon in this cardiomyopathy.

40|$|Exercise {{plays an}} {{important}} role to improve cardiovascular performance. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of aerobic continuous and interval training on the left ventricular structure and function. Twenty untrained healthy male students (aged 18 - 22 yrs.) were randomly divided into two groups: continuous (C; n= 10) and interval (I; n= 10). The training program consisted of running at 700 of maximum heart rate (MHR) for 45 min during 8 weeks three times a week. In each session C group was running 45 min and I group running was done in 5 nine-minute stages with a four-minute inactive rest between them. M-mode, 2 -dimensional, color and Doppler transthoracic echocardiography were performed, during resting conditions, before and after the training period. After 8 -week training the end diastolic diameter, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in C and I groups, the post-wall thickness and the end systolic diameter in I group showed no significant difference (P> 0. 05). On the other <b>hand</b> percent of <b>ejection</b> fraction and shortening fraction in C and I groups, the end systolic diameter and the post-wall thickness in C group and the interventricular septum thickness in I group demonstrated significant difference (P≤ 0. 05). Comparing the two groups, only the value of the interventricular septum thickness was significant (P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|We present optical {{observations}} and Monte Carlo {{models of the}} dust coma, tail, and trail structures of comet 22 P/Kopff during the 2002 and 2009 apparitions. Dust loss rates, ejection velocities, and power-law size distribution functions are derived as functions of the heliocentric distance using pre- and post-perihelion imaging observations during both apparitions. The 2009 post-perihelion images can be accurately fitted by an isotropic ejection model. On the other <b>hand,</b> strong dust <b>ejection</b> anisotropies are required to fit the near-coma regions at large heliocentric distances (both inbound at $r_h$= 2. 5 AU and outbound at $r_h$= 2. 6 AU) for the 2002 apparition. These asymmetries are compatible with a scenario where dust ejection is mostly seasonally-driven, coming mainly from regions near subsolar latitudes at far heliocentric distances inbound and outbound. At intermediate to near-perihelion heliocentric distances, the outgassing would affect much more extended latitude regions, the emission becoming almost isotropic near perihelion. We derived a maximum dust production rate of 260 kg s$^{- 1 }$ at perihelion, and an averaged production rate over one orbit of 40 kg s$^{- 1 }$. An enhanced emission rate, accompanied also by a large ejection velocity, is predicted at $r_h>$ 2. 5 pre-perihelion. The model has also been extended to the thermal infrared {{in order to be}} applied to available trail observations with IRAS and ISO spacecrafts of this comet. The modeled trail intensities are in good agreement with those observations, which is remarkable taking into account that those data are sensitive to dust ejection patterns corresponding to several orbits before the 2002 and 2009 apparitions.

5000|$|... “17 January {{was a heavy}} day for me. The {{radar station}} picked up the {{approach}} {{of a group of}} ground attack aircraft on their way to Anju. Our regiment was sent out to repulse them. Arriving in the area of combat operations, we just spotted the last group of Thunderjets sliding along above the clouds to our south. Vishnyakov went to go after them, but {{we were not able to}} attack as the Thunderjets went into a cloud and we found ourselves over the coastline. Not seeing the usual Sabre escort, we made a left turn and began a level climb and had just turned around when I spotted two groups of Sabres diving down to attack Vishnyakov. We were engaging under the most unfavorable conditions, but nevertheless we beat off the first attack of the Sabres and, by using maneuver, climbed back up to about 9000 meters. At that moment another group of Sabres showed up, and moved to come down to attack the regimental commander’s group from above. As for me, as I virtually had no speed due to the climb, managed to increase my climb angle and at 600 meters I opened fire on the Sabre group leader. His aircraft ran through my tracers, and I saw several explosions on it. He increased his dive and angle and headed down. Turning around, I saw that my group was also being attacked from above by a group of Sabres. I gave the command: “Everybody break!” and we turned under the Sabres, but now I saw that my rear wingman, Senior Lieutenant Voronoy, was being fired on by two Sabres. Voronoy went into a sharp dive and headed down. I returned to the battle. At that moment my third pair came under attack from two Sabres coming down from above which, as they opened fire, cut through them and headed out directly towards above me. I followed them, firing at the wingman. He, evidently damaged, turned and banked over into a dive. I was not able to go after the damaged aircraft, as I suddenly felt a sharp blow and the aircraft around me began to rapidly spin. I kicked hard left rudder, but the controls did not respond. It was so sudden that one wing suddenly broke off. I made the decision to bail out of the uncontrollable aircraft, as it was now in a vertical spin downward. With a great deal of difficulty - as I was rammed into the left side of the aircraft - I managed to get my <b>hand</b> on the <b>ejection</b> seat control lever and pull it. A sharp blow momentarily pressed down on my eyes, so I have no idea how I flew out of the aircraft. As I came back to life I was falling together with the seat, I released the harness and kicked out of the seat with my legs. I could see that the clouds below me were coming up rapidly, so I pulled on the parachute ripcord ring, and after I yanked it the canopy opened. I came to a sharp halt, and now I was floating under the parachute. Above me was the blue sky, below me the clouds. They were about 800 meters below. I glanced around and saw a Sabre coming at me very quickly. He came on for a few more seconds, and suddenly I saw the smoke and tracers that he was firing his six machine guns. Death was coming for me, and all I could do was wait as he came after me. Fortunately, the Sabre was about 800-1000 meters away, and the tracers flew by tens of meters below me. But for those very few seconds the tracers began to head up towards my legs and only stopped a few meters away.Perhaps at the last second I could pull my legs up at the moment that I felt the bullets were about to hit my legs. But at that precise moment the tracers stopped. I could see the Sabre bank away sharply when 500 meters away, and passing about 50 meters away from me, make a quick turn. I got nauseous from his jet exhaust as he passed. I saw the Sabre make another turn and come back to attack me again. Now I understood that he wanted to get even for the death of his leader, but then I didn’t want to think about that so silently waited for the end to come. The second time, I thought, he won’t miss.I looked down. The cloud was now much closer - perhaps 50-100 meters away. I thought: ‘What will happen first - will I go into the cloud or will his tracers hit me? If the Sabre opens fire, he won’t miss.’ But when the Sabre closed to 800 meters and new tracers flew from it, I poked into the cloud. It immediately became quite dark, humid, but it was a beautiful sensation that I was safe, as he could not see me and I did not see the approaching Sabre and his tracers." ...|$|R
