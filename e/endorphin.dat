25|$|Endogenous opioids include <b>endorphins,</b> enkephalins, dynorphins, {{and even}} {{morphine}} itself.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of chemical synapses is that they are the site of action for the majority of psychoactive drugs. [...] Synapses are affected by drugs such as curare, strychnine, cocaine, morphine, alcohol, LSD, and countless others. These drugs have different effects on synaptic function, and often are restricted to synapses that use a specific neurotransmitter. For example, curare is a poison that stops acetylcholine from depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane, causing paralysis. Strychnine blocks the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter glycine, which causes the body to pick up and react to weaker and previously ignored stimuli, resulting in uncontrollable muscle spasms. Morphine acts on synapses that use <b>endorphin</b> neurotransmitters, and alcohol increases the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. LSD interferes with synapses that use the neurotransmitter serotonin. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine and therefore increases its effects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the data {{related to the}} relations between enkephalins and <b>endorphins</b> and the immune system. It is shown that lymphocytes have surface receptors for <b>endorphins</b> and enkephalins. Furthermore, <b>endorphins</b> and enkephalins can influence several immune functions such as antibody synthesis, lymphocyte proliferation, and natural killer cytotoxicity. It is thus possible that the receptors play a functional role. In view of these observations, several hypotheses are proposed. <b>Endorphins</b> and enkephalins are physiological regulators of the immune response (two-hit opioid peptide lymphocyte receptor hypothesis) and they are humoral mediators between {{the central nervous system}} and the immune system. They may play a pathogenic role in a variety of diseases with primary or secondary immunological defects. Finally, enkephalins and <b>endorphins</b> can be considered as immunomodulators and modifiers of the biological response and as such may become a tool in the field of immunotherapy.

40|$|BIOBEHAV. REV. 4 (1) 77 - 86, 1980. [...] Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} endogenous opioid peptides <b>endorphins</b> {{may play a role}} in the defensive response of the organism to stress. The present paper summarizes these findings as well as evidence linking endorph/ns to the anterior pituitary polypeptide hormone adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). Evidence is presented that <b>endorphins</b> may function as trophic hormones inperipheral target organs uch as the adrenal medulla nd the pancreas. As such they may be part of the physiological mechanisms that mediate adrenaline and glucagon release in response to stress. <b>Endorphins</b> (enkephalins) are also suggested to play a role in the control of the pituitary gland during stress. In such capacity they may act as hormone-releasing or inhibiting factors. Finally, <b>endorphins</b> appear to play a role in the behavioral concomitants of stress. In such capacity eodorphins are suggested to function as modulators of neural systems that mediate the elaboration and expression of the reactive/affective components ofstress.
