He ordered 220soldi be paid to Giovanni Giustiniani for his work as a notary and his prayers.|$|E
5|$|Leuthen was {{the last}} battle at which Prince Charles {{commanded}} the Austrian Army, before <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> Empress Maria Theresa, appointed him as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun {{in command of the}} army. The battle also established beyond doubt Frederick's military reputation in European circles. After Rossbach (5 November), the French had refused to participate further in Austria's war with Prussia; after Leuthen (5 December), Austria could not.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} at court until October, apparently restored to favour. In {{the absence of}} any children, Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> was the Queen of Scots, who was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1923 Stroheim {{arrived in}} San Francisco, where he scouted {{locations}} and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for Greed, he attended society functions {{in town and}} met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother Charles and <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> Kathleen. To capture the authentic spirit of the story, Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.|$|E
5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E

5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} {{the new political}} reality and cultivated <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law.</b> She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, {{who had grown up}} in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{launched}} the coup {{in response to}} Diệm's autocratic rule and the negative political influence of his brother Ngô Đình Nhu and <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> Madame Nhu. They also bemoaned the politicisation of the military, whereby regime loyalists {{who were members of}} the Ngô family's covert Cần Lao Party were readily promoted ahead of more competent officers who were not insiders. Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, whose uncle was a prominent official in a minor opposition party. The main link in the coup was Đông's commanding officer Thi, whom he persuaded to join the plot.|$|E
5|$|Yusef is wrongly {{accused of}} {{having an affair with}} Zainab, due to <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> overhearing them speaking. A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster.

Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob. Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror, he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise. Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character, but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Pilcher married Kathleen Mary Gonne, {{daughter}} of Colonel Thomas Gonne of the 17th Lancers; her sister, Maude Gonne, {{later became a}} prominent Irish nationalist and mother of the politician and Nobel laureate Seán MacBride, {{as well as a}} close associate and muse of W. B. Yeats. Pilcher disapproved of <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> particularly after her marriage to John MacBride, and relations were frequently strained; however, the two sisters remained close. The couple would have a daughter, Thora, and three sons – Toby, Tommy, and Pat. The elder son, Gonne ("Toby", to his family), became a Judge of the High Court of Justice, while Tommy would be killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, aged 21.|$|E
5|$|Priestley’s son, William, {{now living}} in Philadelphia, was {{increasingly}} embarrassed by his father's actions. He confronted his father, expressing John and Benjamin Vaughan’s unease, his own wife's concerns about Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley's dietary care, and his own concerns at the closeness of Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper's relationship, and their adverse influence on Dr Priestley; but this only led to a further estrangement between William and <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law.</b> When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from milk sickness or a bacterial infection, Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused William of having poisoned the family's flour. Although this allegation has {{attracted the attention of}} some modern historians, it is believed to be without foundation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} to his paternal dukedom, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who was second-in-line to the English and Scottish thrones, died. By {{the terms of}} the English Act of Settlement 1701, George's mother, Sophia, was designated as the heir to the English throne if the then reigning monarch (William III) and <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> Princess Anne of Denmark (later Queen Anne) died without surviving issue. The succession was so designed because Sophia was the closest Protestant relative of the British royal family. Fifty-six Catholics with superior hereditary claims were bypassed. The likelihood of any of them converting to Protestantism {{for the sake of the}} succession was remote; some had already refused.|$|E

5|$|James's overthrow, {{known as}} the Glorious Revolution, {{was one of the}} most {{important}} events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The Bill of Rights 1689 affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister Anne would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne's children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as Jacobites, might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William's nearest Protestant relations, the family of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, next in line to the throne after <b>his</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> Anne. Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne.|$|E
