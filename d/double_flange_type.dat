Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange.

40|$|Pancreatic fluid {{collections}} (PFCs) {{represent a}} complication of acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic management of PFCs {{is an alternative}} to surgery [1]. Classic strategies include access to the collection under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guidance and placement of several double-pigtail stents. PFCs containing organized necrosis are classified as walled-off necrosis (WON). In those cases necrosis is hardly evacuated and will require necrosectomy in most cases. Every necrosectomy session needs prior removal of the stents, dilatation of the tract, debridement and placement of new stents adding up a considerable overall cost to the intervention. A novel double-flanged lumen-apposing fully-covered self-expandable metal stent (FC-SEMS) with a 15  mm diameter accelerates exit of the necrosis and facilitates multiple necrosectomy sessions. We present a 60 year old patient admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} for severe acute pancreatitis that developed WON with superinfection. The intensivists and surgeons indicated endoscopic cystgastrostomy to evacuate the collection. Using the echoendoscope we found a large collection adherent to the gastric wall. The collection was accessed under EUS-guidance using the Hot AXIOS™ catheter that features a cautery tip, then a 15  mm AXIOS™ stent was deployed through the cystgastrostomy orifice to keep it patent.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{accelerating}} gradients of 15 - 25 MV/m with the superconducting cavi-ties in the TESLA Test Facility, considerable effort is put into preparing the cavities and the auxiliary components to avoid field emission due to particle contamination. The particle cleanliness has to be preserved throughout the whole assembly procedure of the cavities. Most crucial is the mounting of the flange connections which have to be UHV-leaktight with the cavities immersed in superfluid helium. In the present design, the niobium cavities are fabricated with Nb sealing surfaces with a thickness of 3 mm. Split stainless steel rings and spring-type gaskets (Helicoflex) are used to provide UHV-tight connections to the stainless steel counter flanges. This design has several disadvantages. The gaskets can not be prop-erly made “particle-free ” and {{the handling of the}} split flanges may contaminate the cavities during assembly. Moreover, the sealing surfaces of the Nb cavities get quite soft during the 1400 ˚C heat treatment, which often results in leak problems due to plastic deformations.

40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes – Part 2 Full scale experimental investigationsLeakage that sometimes occurs in flange joints in large size plastic pipelines for water supply {{is a serious}} problem. Research was undertaken {{in order to improve}} the knowledge about the function of such flange joints. The objectives were partly to find out the degree of sensitivity of the design, i e if small deviations from recommended practise is critical, partly to be able to suggest improved design and mounting procedures. One part of the investigation was a numerical (FEM) study of several geometries, which was reported in [2]. Use of a time-dependent material model made it possible to follow the development of deformations and flange surface pressures for long times. Although several important principal findings were made, the tightening procedure and exact material behaviour could not be modelled. Therefore a series of full-scale experiments were made on 630 mm pipes, for a number of combinations of flange dimension and gasket type. This second part of the research is reported here. Since four of the twenty bolts were instrumented, the bolt forces could be monitored and be related to the torque and to the pressure in the pipe over time. This resulted in novel, important information about the functioning of plastic flange joints. In short, the experiments were performed in the following way. First, the bolts were tightened in the recommended criss-cross fashion to pre-determined torque levels. Then the pressure in the pipe was increased until leakage occurred. For combinations of flanges, gaskets and torques where the joint was tight for pressures above 13 bars, the 13 bar pressure level was maintained for up to one week. The relationship between bolt force and torque does not agree at all with the frequently used rule of thumb formula, for the galvanized bolts used here. The bolt force was typically less than half the value obtained by the formula. Hence it is critical to verify the friction for the used combination of bolt material, surface treatment, and lubrication. The bolt forces also appear to be unevenly distributed, which is partly due to successive creep during the tightening procedure. For the high stresses in the flange creep is significant already for so short times as a few minutes, and the effect is increased {{by the fact that the}} bolts and backing rings are much stiffer than the plastic flange. For both the wide and the narrow (ISO) <b>flange</b> <b>type</b> used it appears that rubber gaskets perform better, in the sense that the joint is tight for lower applied torques. The hyper- elastic material properties help to smooth unevenness in the flange surface and to compensate for creep in the plastic. Use of SDR 17 pipes at pressure levels of 13 bars means considerable creep expansion of the pipe, although it is possible to obtain a tight joint. The expansion gives a wringing effect at the flange, also observed in [2], which contributes to concentrate the flange pressure to the outer parts of the flange surface. In summary, flange joints are possible to mount so that they are tight, also for 630 mm pipes. Since the design is a sensitive one it is vital to follow recommendations for 4 mounting of different combinations of flanges and gaskets. In particular, knowledge about the relationship between torque and bolt force is important...|$|R
5000|$|Further {{development}} of the classic effect is attributed to Ken Townsend, an engineer at EMI's Abbey Road Studio, who devised the process {{in the spring of}} 1966. Tired of laboriously re-recording dual vocal tracks, John Lennon asked Townsend if there was some way for the Beatles to get the sound of double-tracked vocals without doing the work. Townsend devised Artificial Double Tracking or ADT. According to historian Mark Lewisohn, it was Lennon who first called the technique [...] "flanging". Lennon asked George Martin to explain how ADT worked, and Martin answered with the nonsense explanation [...] "Now listen, it's very simple. We take the original image and we split it through a <b>double</b> vibrocated sploshing <b>flange</b> with <b>double</b> negative feedback". Lennon thought Martin was joking. Martin replied, [...] "Well, let's flange it again and see". From that point, when Lennon wanted ADT he would ask for his voice to be flanged, or call out for [...] "Ken's flanger". According to Lewisohn, the Beatles' influence meant the term [...] "flanging" [...] is still in use today, more than 40 years later. The first Beatles track to feature flanging was [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] from Revolver, which was recorded on April 6, 1966. When Revolver was released on August 5, 1966, almost every song had been subjected to flanging.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed experimental testing program {{is to determine the}} elastic rotational restraint, kφ, provided by sheathing to joists (studs, rafters, etc). This restraint, kφ, serves to partially or fully restrict the distortional buckling failure mode. Given newly adopted AISI-Committee on Specifications (COS) provisions for distortional buckling (Ballot 227 B) it is important to formally establish the system benefits of light-frame construction as embodied in kφ. The proposed work plan is split into two phases.

500|$|A {{key feature}} of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal {{processing}} {{to shape the}} sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented by Townsend during the Revolver sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music. Martin playfully explained to Lennon that his voice had been [...] "treated with a <b>double</b> vibrocated sploshing <b>flange...</b> It <b>doubles</b> your voice, John." [...] Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as flanging, a label that was universally adopted by the music industry. Another important effect was varispeeding. Martin cites [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] as having the most variations of tape speed on Sgt. Pepper. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.|$|R
