40|$|AIMS: Routine outcome {{monitoring}} (ROM) {{is receiving}} growing attention. However, <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> are time-consuming and costly. This study examines the feasibility {{and validity of}} low-budget telephonic <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> for ROM in a substance abuse treatment centre (SATC). DESIGN: Observational study using data collected for routine outcome monitoring. SETTING: The study was performed in a SATC in an urban area in the Netherlands. Participants Feasibility and validity were assessed on data of 2325 patients. MEASUREMENTS: Data on pre-treatment socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were collected using electronic patient records (EPRs) and the European version of the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI). Data on intensity of treatment were also collected through the EPRs. Telephonic <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> were conducted between 9 and 10 months after intake. FINDINGS: A 53 % follow-up rate was achieved; 35 % of the patients could not be contacted, 3 % explicitly refused and in 8 % other reasons accounted for non-participation. About 50 % of the interviews {{took place in the}} intended time-frame. Costs were Euro 40 (57 US dollars) per completed interview. There were indications of selection bias, because patients with cocaine as their primary problem and patients with polysubstance abuse were under-represented in the follow-up sample; the presence of these disorders is associated with negative treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing telephonic low-budget <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> for ROM is feasible, but selection bias threatens internal validity of data, limiting generalization to the total treatment population.

40|$|Background: Telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviewing</b> is {{one method}} of {{monitoring}} treatment outcomes of individuals involved in {{drug and alcohol}} treatment programs. The present study {{is the first to}} examine the feasibility and generalizability of data obtained from telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> after drug and alcohol treatment in Australia. Methods: Participants attended 1 of 8 Salvation Army Recovery Service Centres where staff administered outcome measures at intake. Three-month postdischarge telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> were conducted by researchers from the Illawarra Institute for Mental Health, University of Wollongong. Results: A sample of 700 clients was obtained for follow-up (582 males; 118 females). A 51 % follow-up rate was achieved at a cost of US$ 82 per completed interview. No significant differences in baseline characteristics between responding and nonresponding participants were found. Conclusions: Overall, the telephone methodology was shown to be feasible and relatively inexpensive. However, the introduction of outcome measures at the service level in parallel with follow-up data collection procedures complicated the collection of response data. The burden of introducing outcome measures in residential services may be reduced by utilizing a phased implementation strategy...|$|R

In a remote region in the Northern Territory in 2001, 131 Indigenous people (aged 13 - 36 years) were approached for interview regarding their substance use. Of these, 108 (54 males, 54 females) were <b>interviewed</b> successfully. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> were attempted in 2004. Study records traced progress and costs. In 2001, the response rate was 82 % (108 / 131). In 2004, 22 participants could not be found after four attempts although they were known by health workers to still reside in the region. Fifteen were not residing in the region during 2004 and were lost to follow-up, four were in prison and three were deceased. Fourteen contacted either refused directly (n = 1) or repeatedly postponed interview (n = 13). Fifty <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> were completed, a response rate of 78 % among 64 participants contacted. The overall response rate in those approached was 64 % (0. 82 * 0. 78). Costs for 108 interviews were 45 person-days and $A 19 000 (32 % = travel/associated costs). Costs for 50 <b>follow-up</b> <b>interviews</b> were 60 person-days and $A 25 500 (39 % = travel/associated costs).
