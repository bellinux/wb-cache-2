The lavish second floor ballroom was extensively used prior to WWII as the de facto meeting place for the most wealthy and influential families in Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casino is associated with the social club that made the structure come to life, a club that has ceased to exist as today's way of life have pushed aside the lifestyle of the aristocracy of yesterday.|$|E

During John Adams' term as president, national parties became clearly defined. Burr loosely associated with the Democratic-Republicans, though he had moderate Federalist allies, such as Sen. Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey. Burr quickly became a key player in New York politics, more powerful in time than Hamilton. This was due largely {{to the power of the}} Tammany Society, later to become the infamous Tammany Hall.

25|$|Fascism {{operated}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Social</b> Darwinist view {{of human}} relations. Their aim was to promote superior individuals and weed out the weak. In terms of economic practice, this meant promoting the interests of successful businessmen while destroying trade unions and other organizations of the working class. Fascist governments declared the trade union movement illegal, {{and replaced it with}} labor organizations under the direct control of the government, which ensured that workers could not undertake any effective economic action. Membership in these labor organizations was compulsory, their leaders were appointed by the ruling party rather than elected by the members, and they were presented as a new type of unions which would serve to harmonize the interests of workers and businesses. However, in practice, they primarily served the interests of major business owners, who were able to lobby the ruling party to appoint the leaders they desired. In order to maintain and increase the profits of industry, fascist states eliminated the possibility of mass protest and then cut wages either directly or indirectly. Strikes were strictly banned, and prison sentences could be given to employees who stopped working as a group.|$|E
25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E
25|$|Kat {{begins to}} have second {{thoughts}} about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family. Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E

[...] Despite this, he was not an adherent of social credit monetary theories, but joined Social Credit because he viewed it as a vehicle of reform. [...] He was also concerned about the constitutionality of a provincial government legislating on banking and monetary issues, as was advocated by many Social Crediters, and sought (and, by his account, received) assurances from Aberhart that no such legislation would be forthcoming <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Social</b> Credit government.

[...] In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella's work was only a [...] "fashionable" [...] stance to take and that the cook's writing [...] "simply makes you want to cook". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the [...] "relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930" [...] may instead be explained by the [...] "progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers". David comments that [...] "when plain English cooks" [...] were active in their kitchens, [...] "they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a [...] "fascinating source of information" [...] <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be [...] "the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era".|$|E
