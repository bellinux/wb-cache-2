25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{commonly}} encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin {{to protect the}} delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from polyvinyl acetate or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the <b>encapsulant</b> to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces, diffractive elements, prism arrays, air prisms, v-grooves, diffuse elements, as well as multi-directional waveguide arrays. Prism arrays show an overall 5% increase in the total solar energy conversion. Active coatings that convert infrared light into visible light have shown a 30% increase.|$|E

40|$|Typical {{scenario}} for {{the integration of}} electronics into a car is a control unit in the engine compartment, where ambi-ent temperatures are around 150 °C and package junction temperatures may range from 175 °C to 200 °C, peak temperature may exceed these values. Apart from the high temperature load, electronics in automotive applications can be exposed to harsh environment conditions as e. g. to gas oil, brake fluid or accumulator acid. If advanced packaging technologies are used under harsh environment conditions, {{it is clear that}} especially the polymeric materials, i. e. Epoxy Molding Com-pound, Underfiller, solder mask or the organic substrate base material, are challenged. Generally, the development goal for <b>encapsulants</b> compatible with high temperature applications are materials with high Tg and low degradation even at temperatures beyond 200 °C. For these polymeric <b>encapsulants</b> the material suppliers provide basic information about thermo-mechanical and mechanical prop-erties directly after processing, but no information about material data after a certain time of use especially in a harsh environment is given. To yield more insight in transient material parameter changes, material properties of typical <b>encapsulants</b> used for high reliable pack-aging are studied in initial state and after aging under various harsh environment conditions relevant for automotive applications. With these data an evaluation of the material degradation and the related influence on package reliability should be possible. To do this <b>encapsulants</b> need to be robust in terms of chemical inertness when subjected to harsh environment, the second section of this paper is describing the reliability potential of epoxy <b>encapsulants.</b> An example for the reliability potential of such <b>encapsulants</b> is given in the third section, where direct Flip Chip encapsulation leads to extreme thermal cycling performance of 14. 000 cycles without electrical failure.

50|$|Conventional c-Si solar cells, {{normally}} wired in series, are encapsulated in a {{solar module}} {{to protect them}} from the weather. The module consists of a tempered glass as cover, a soft and flexible <b>encapsulant,</b> a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant material and an aluminium frame around the outer edge. Electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure, solar modules build a string of modules, often called solar panel. A solar array consists of one or many such panels. A photovoltaic array, or solar array, is a linked collection of solar panels. The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to form an array. Most PV arrays use an inverter to convert the DC power produced by the modules into alternating current that can power lights, motors, and other loads. The modules in a PV array are usually first connected in series to obtain the desired voltage; the individual strings are then connected in parallel to allow the system to produce more current. Solar panels are typically measured under STC (standard test conditions) or PTC (PVUSA test conditions), in watts. Typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts. The array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings, in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.|$|E
