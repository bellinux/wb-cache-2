5|$|A Chera coin {{with the}} {{portrait}} of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has {{the portrait of}} a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no <b>ear-ring.</b> The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E

50|$|In the {{chapters}} (14-53 to 58) Uttanka's history is repeated where the <b>ear-rings</b> were mentioned {{to be of}} queen Madayanti, the wife of king Saudasa (an Ikshwaku king) (14,57). A Naga in the race of Airavata is said to steal away the <b>ear-rings</b> (14,58).|$|R

"This was {{the first}} time I had taken a weather <b>ear-ring,</b> and I felt not a little proud to sit astride of the weather yard-arm, past the <b>ear-ring,</b> and sing out 'Haul out to leeward!'" [...] He had been over a year at sea before he essayed this able seaman's task, but he did it, and he did it with pride. And with pride, he went down a four-hundred foot cliff, on a pair of top-gallant studding-sail halyards bent together, to {{dislodge}} several dollars worth of stranded bullock hides, though all the acclaim he got from his mates was: [...] "What a d-d fool you were to risk your life for half a dozen hides!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have none, sir, in that connexion, and I {{am willing}} to do as you suggest." [...] He thrust his hand into his pocket, and drew forth the rings, the brooch and the <b>ear-ring</b> he had won. [...] "Here, sir, are your trinkets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have a badge if I'm going to belong to your select society; but I don't know any lady who will give me an <b>ear-ring</b> or a cream-pot," [...] said Ned, when the {{conversation}} got round again to the cheerful side of the question.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Snell {{was correct}} in his surmise, that {{somebody}} else would remember the pedlar's <b>ear-rings.</b> For on the spread of inquiry among the villagers it was stated with gathering emphasis, that the parson had {{wanted to know whether}} the pedlar wore <b>ear-rings</b> in his ears, and an impression was created that a great deal depended on the eliciting of this fact. Of course, every one who heard the question, not having any distinct image of the pedlar as without <b>ear-rings,</b> immediately had an image of him with <b>ear-rings,</b> larger or smaller, as the case might be; and the image was presently taken for a vivid recollection, so that the glazier's wife, a well-intentioned woman, not given to lying, and whose house was among the cleanest in the village, was ready to declare, as sure as ever she meant to take the sacrament the very next Christmas that was ever coming, that she had seen big <b>ear-rings,</b> {{in the shape of the}} young moon, in the pedlar's two ears; while Jinny Oates, the cobbler's daughter, being a more imaginative person, stated not only that she had seen them too, but that they had made her blood creep, as it did at that very moment while there she stood.|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{makes you}} so cold?" [...] said Grandcourt, when he had {{fastened}} the last <b>ear-ring.</b> [...] "Pray put plenty of furs on. I hate to see a woman come into a room looking frozen. If you are to appear as a bride at all, appear decently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next August, remember, Jacob," [...] said Mrs. Durrant, {{shaking hands}} {{with him on the}} terrace where the fuchsia hung, like a scarlet <b>ear-ring,</b> behind her head. Mr. Wortley came out of the window in yellow slippers, {{trailing}} the Times and holding out his hand very cordially.|$|E
6000|$|The {{entry to}} the house was on the left, and it was garnished as the outer gateway was, with two printed bills in French and English, announcing Furnished Apartments to let, with {{immediate}} possession. A strong cheerful peasant woman, all stocking, petticoat, white cap, and <b>ear-ring,</b> stood here in a dark doorway, and said with a pleasant show of teeth, 'Ice-say! Seer! Who?' ...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the local}} legend goddess Parvati while engaged in her fight with the demons Kirtti and Basa lost her ear rings that were studded with gem(mani).After killing the demons Parvati told lord Siva about the {{earrings}} (mani-kundala) which lost. Lord Siva with his trident struck upon the earth on the Kapila Kunda, where from the <b>ear-rings</b> were recovered. Parvati offered the <b>ear-rings</b> to Lord Kapilesvara. Hence another name of Kapilesvara is Kapila-muni and the kunda or tank where from the <b>ear-rings</b> were recovered was known as Manikarnesvara kunda or tank. Every day Lord Kapilesvara is given ritual bath with the waters of Manikarnika tank. Hence the tank is held in high esteem ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{was very}} fond of adorning herself, so he would tie a piece of cotton round her ear, and hang a blue bead on it {{underneath}} for an <b>ear-ring.</b> The ear-rings varied with a red bead, and a golden bead, and a little pearl bead. And as he came home at night, seeing her bridling and looking very self-conscious, he took notice and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Round reproofs for sin, {{when they}} light upon {{penitent}} hearts, then brave {{work is in}} the church: then the snuff is not only pulled away, but carried out of the temple of God aright, &c.

60|$|We {{stood and}} looked below, at the puff of steam, {{far down the}} wooded valley where we had come yesterday. There was an old, low house on this eagle-perching piazza. I would like to live there. The real village--or rather two villages, like an <b>ear-ring</b> and its pendant--lay still beyond, in front, ledging near {{the summit of the}} long, long, steep wooded slope, that never ended till it ran flush to the depths away below there in shadow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it {{the latest}} fashion to wear odd <b>ear-rings</b> instead of lockets?" [...] she asked, {{touching}} the delicate trinket with an amused smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do! Ariadne plagues {{me every}} time I see her, because I don't wear <b>ear-rings</b> after all the trouble I had getting ready for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] he answered. [...] "My dear mother's <b>ear-rings!</b> Uncle Aubrey {{would be}} so angry if he knew I'd sold them. I daren't face Uncle Aubrey." ...|$|R
6000|$|Enoch, is taught, or dedicate: The true {{effect of}} rule or government, be it good or bad: in Cain's posterity it was bad; [...] "for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit." [...] By Enoch here, {{we are to}} understand, one taught in, and {{dedicated}} unto, God. This Enoch therefore was a son that would hear the rules, and submit {{to the government of}} his father Jared. [...] "As an <b>ear-ring</b> of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear" [...] (Pro 25:12).|$|E
6000|$|Now Ariadne, {{though she}} looked like a wax doll, had {{feelings}} within her instead of sawdust, and these feelings were hurt by Rose's lofty tone. She thought her more [...] "stuck up" [...] than ever, but {{did not know how to}} bring her down, yet longed to do it, for she felt as if she had received a box on the ear, and involuntarily put her hand up to it. The touch of an <b>ear-ring</b> consoled her, and suggested a way of returning tit for tat in a telling manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mr. Braden, I've {{no doubt}} of it--Mr. Crewe's so popular," [...] she cried, {{removing}} her <b>ear-ring</b> abruptly from the danger zone. [...] "Do make yourself at home," [...] she added, and retired from Mr. Braden's company a trifle disconcerted,--a new experience for Mrs. Pomfret. She wondered whether all country people were like Mr. Braden, but decided, after another experiment or two, {{that he was an}} original. More than once during the afternoon she caught sight of him, beaming upon the festivities around him. But she did not renew the conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{not much}} {{difference}} in principle," [...] said Harold, laughing, [...] "but {{there is a}} great difference in appearance. <b>Ear-rings</b> hang gracefully; lip-rings stick out horribly." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{was here}} {{overtaken}} by a messenger with letters from Dr. Campbell, announcing that the Sikkim Rajah had disavowed {{the refusal to}} the Governor-General's letter, and authorising me to return through any part of Sikkim I thought proper. The bearer was a Lepcha attached to the court: his dress {{was that of a}} superior person, being a scarlet jacket over a white cotton dress, the breadth of the blue stripes of which generally denotes wealth; he was accompanied by a sort of attache, who wore a magnificent pearl and gold <b>ear-ring,</b> and carried his master's bow, as well as a basket on his back; while an attendant coolie bore their utensils and food. Meepo, or Teshoo (in Tibetan, Mr.), Meepo, as he was usually called, soon attached himself to me, and proved an active, useful, and intelligent companion, guide, and often collector, during many months afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{apartment}} {{was in the}} wildest disorder--the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown {{into the middle of}} the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an <b>ear-ring</b> of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of m√©tal d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Erwin entered {{about the}} {{completion}} of her preparations, and without turning round from her glass she said, [...] "I {{want you to think}} of the worst thing you can, Henshaw. I don't see how I'm ever to lift up my head again." [...] As if this word had reminded her of her head, she turned it from side to side, and got the effect in the glass, first of one <b>ear-ring,</b> and then of the other. Her husband patiently waited, and she now confronted him. [...] "You may as well know first as last, Henshaw, and I want you to prepare yourself for it. Nothing can be done, and you will just have to live through it. Lydia--has come over--on that ship--alone,--with three young men,--and not the shadow--not the ghost--of another woman--on board!" [...] Mrs. Erwin gesticulated with her hand-glass in delivering the words, in a manner at once intensely vivid and intensely solemn, yet somehow falling short of the due tragic effect. Her husband stood pulling his mustache straight down, while his wife turned again to the mirror, and put the final touches to her personal appearance with hands which she had the effect of having desperately washed of all responsibility. He stood so long in this meditative mood that she was obliged to be peremptory with his image in the glass. [...] "Well?" [...] she cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Hetty, hastily turning {{round and}} {{reaching}} the second {{chair in the}} room, glad that Dinah {{looked as if she}} did not notice her <b>ear-rings.</b>|$|R
60|$|Honora {{still remembers}} the blank {{expression}} which {{appeared on the}} countenance of her hostess when she spoke these words. Mrs. Holt's cheeks twitched, her <b>ear-rings</b> quivered, and her bosom heaved-once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Charlie, wouldn't {{anything}} else do as well? I've {{been through so}} much teasing and trouble, I do want to enjoy my pretty <b>ear-rings,</b> for I can wear them now." ...|$|R
