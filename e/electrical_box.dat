5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage <b>electrical</b> <b>box).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{various parts}} of the city, <b>electrical</b> <b>boxes</b> are painted as a {{beautification}} of the city. There are 190 large dull grey <b>electrical</b> <b>boxes</b> which sit on street corners all over town. In 1993, the Springdale Neighborhood Association commissioned a local artist to paint the boxes in the section of town to [...] "brighten" [...] up the eyesores. The trend caught on and now over 100 boxes have been painted by various painters and artists through much of the city.|$|R

500|$|The chase scene {{involving}} Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as {{the crew}} had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a [...] "mechanical trip" [...] to support an electrical cable, which he then strung {{to the other side}} of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with [...] "sparking devices", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, [...] "What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground." [...] Misiano said of the sequence, [...] "This young man runs by an <b>electrical</b> <b>box</b> and it blows up. It really blew!" [...] The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, [...] "that was actually really scary" [...] to film. After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar, actor Joshua Jackson joked, [...] "Finally I'm going to get a little respect on this set." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hammer drills {{almost always}} have a lever or switch that locks off the special [...] "hammer clutch," [...] turning the tool into a {{conventional}} drill for wood or metal work. Hammer drills are more expensive and more bulky than regular drills, but are preferable for applications where the material to be drilledconcrete block or wood studsis unknown. [...] For example, an electrician would use a hammer drill for attaching items (such as an <b>electrical</b> <b>box)</b> to either wood studs (if used as a conventional power drill) or masonry walls (if used as a hammer drill).|$|E
2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and was out of sight, but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both took her by the arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an <b>electrical</b> <b>box</b> and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and reached into his pocket for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] Folding chairs were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford onto the table and around the building to the triage area.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{systematic}} study investigating {{the effect on the}} sound insulation of wood stud walls having penetrations made by <b>electrical</b> outlet <b>boxes</b> are presented. The effect on sound insulation is shown to be almost negligible, regardless of box separation, if the boxes are themselves airtight and form an airtight seal with the gypsum board surfaces. However, if the boxes are not airtight, then the degradation to the sound insulation is strongly dependent on the separation between the boxes. Other significant factors include the presence of cavity absorption, and its method of installation. A series of retrofits for poorly installed boxes is examined and show that commonly available devices for reducing airflow (and sound insulation) through <b>electrical</b> <b>boxes</b> can be very effective but are highly dependent on installation.

50|$|A {{building}} design may have limited capacity for insulation {{in some areas}} of the structure. A common construction design is based on stud walls, in which thermal bridges are common in wood or steel studs and joists, which are typically fastened with metal. Notable areas that most commonly lack sufficient insulation are the corners of buildings, and areas where insulation has been removed or displaced to make room for system infrastructure, such as <b>electrical</b> <b>boxes</b> (outlets and light switches), plumbing, fire alarm equipment, etc.|$|R
50|$|A sconce {{is a type}} {{of light}} fixture affixed to a wall {{in such a way that}} it uses only the wall for support, and the light is usually {{directed}} upwards, but not always. It does not have a base on the ground. For this reason, lighting fixtures will need an <b>electrical</b> <b>box</b> to be installed. A sconce may be a traditional torch, candle or gas light, or a modern electric light source affixed in the same way. Modern fittings are more often called wall lights or similar terms, especially if the light source is wholly covered by glass.|$|E
50|$|While small {{solar panels}} used for battery {{charging}} and similar tasks may not require special connectors, larger systems normally connect the panels together in series to form strings. In the past this {{was accomplished by}} opening a small <b>electrical</b> <b>box</b> {{on the back of}} the panel and connecting user-supplied wires to screw terminals within. However, bare terminals of this sort are limited to 50 V or less by the NEC code, above that only a licensed electrician can make the connections. Additionally, these sorts of connections were subject to problems caused by water leakage, electrical corrosion and mechanical stress on the wires.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{concerns}} about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as <b>electrical</b> <b>boxes,</b> that may encourage risky behaviour, especially amongst children. Hides {{in these areas}} are discouraged, and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting {{to search for a}} cache, and report any problems.|$|R
