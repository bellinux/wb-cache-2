500|$|From his cell, Turpin {{wrote to}} his brother-in-law, Pompr Rivernall, who also lived at Hempstead. [...] Rivernall was married to Turpin's sister, Dorothy. [...] The letter was kept at the local post office, but seeing the York post stamp Rivernall refused to pay the <b>delivery</b> <b>charge,</b> {{claiming}} that he [...] "had no correspondent at York". [...] Rivernall may not have wanted to pay the charge for the letter, or he may have wished {{to distance himself from}} Turpin's affairs, and so the letter was moved to the post office at Saffron Walden where James Smith, who had taught Turpin how to write while the latter was at school, recognised the handwriting. [...] He alerted JP Thomas Stubbing, who paid the postage and opened the letter. [...] Smith travelled to York Castle and on 23February identified Palmer as Turpin. [...] He received the £200 (about £ as of [...] ) reward originally offered by the Duke of Newcastle following Turpin's murder of Thomas Morris.|$|E

40|$|Price Levels on the Internet have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} research and managerial attention. Similar to initial predictions that Internet would lead to lower prices, empirical research shows that online prices are lower than conventional stores. There have been few studies comparing price levels at online and offline retailer, but not much is known about how prices compare among pure play e-retailers and bricks and clicks (multichannel) retailers. This research addresses this important issue through an analysis of price levels in the Mp 3 player market among two types of retailers in UK. The result in this study, based on analysis of 212 different retailers, shows that when prices both excluding <b>delivery</b> <b>charges</b> and including <b>delivery</b> <b>charges</b> are considered bricks and clicks retailers have high prices than pure-play e-retailers. Additionally, this study finds that Price level is positively related {{to the quality of the}} Mp 3 player. This study also finds that as number of sellers for a particular Mp 3 player increases, price (excluding and including <b>delivery</b> <b>charges)</b> increases. Thus contradicting the general phenomenon that increase in number of seller will intensify competition and ultimately decrease the prices of a particular product...|$|R

25|$|The {{principle}} and slogan never knowingly undersold adopted in 1925, is still honoured {{and has been}} widely copied.
