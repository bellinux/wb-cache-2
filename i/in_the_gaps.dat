5|$|Gravitational aggregations {{clustered}} into filaments, leaving voids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> Gradually, {{organizations of}} gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies.

5|$|Worth was {{originally}} a village {{with its own}} civil parish, lying just beyond {{the eastern edge of}} the Crawley urban area and borough boundary; but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps,</b> and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village. The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the Mid Sussex district.|$|E
50|$|In some models, {{if there}} are some bulbs at the top (Figure 4, left) and some at the bottom, but one {{floating}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> then <b>the</b> one floating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> (green 76 F) tells the temperature. If there is no bulb <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> (Figure 4, right) then {{the average of the}} values of the bulb above and below <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> gives <b>the</b> approximate temperature. <b>In</b> other models, <b>the</b> lowest floating bulb gives the approximate temperature.|$|R

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of <b>the</b> air <b>gaps</b> {{is of great}} importance for the high voltage applications. One of the most determinant factors of the dielelectric strength of <b>the</b> air <b>gaps</b> is <b>the</b> field strength distribution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>The</b> corona space charges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> influence <b>the</b> distribution of the field strongly, and the breakdown voltage of <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present paper the arrangements of a rod-plate air gap {{with or without a}} barrier for the two different cases with the rod or the plate grounded are experimentally investigated and analyzed, using the Finite Element Method. Values of <b>the</b> field strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> when stressed by the breakdown voltage, are recorded and analyzed. The results show that the distribution of the field along the axis of <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> is strongly affected by the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> and especially by the grounded electrode (Ground Effect). The values of the breakdown voltage depend on the maximum value of <b>the</b> field strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>the</b> value of the corona leakage current through <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> A charged barrier between the electrodes influences the distribution of the field significantly as well as the breakdown voltage...|$|R
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only {{at very high}} temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down {{to wait for the}} first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E

40|$|In {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM), appropriate average current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> has to be selected for the given machining surface {{in order to obtain}} the highest material removal rate at low electrode wear. Thus, rough machining parameters have to be selected according to <b>the</b> machining surface. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> caseof sculptured features, the machining surface varies with the depth of machining. Hence, the machining parameters have to be selected online to obtain appropriate current density <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, inductive machine learning is used to derive a model based on the voltage and current inthe <b>gap.</b> <b>The</b> sufficient inputs to the model are only two discharge attributes extracted from <b>the</b> voltage signal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>The</b> model successfully selects between two machining parameter settings that obtain different average surface current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> It requires only voltage signal acquisition during the machining process and a simple algorithm that is easy to implement on industrial machines...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. The {{possible}} {{role of the}} diffuse background {{gamma radiation}} <b>in</b> triggering <b>the</b> polar <b>gap</b> discharges <b>in</b> pulsars is examined.

5|$|The group bring Tom back {{to their}} camp. Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and Lourdes (Seychelle Gabriel) operate on Tom. While Tom is in surgery, flashbacks appear, filling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> of his 3 month departure. He is {{apparently}} tortured by the alien “Overlords” while on the spaceship. Later, the Overlords wish to speak with him. They communicate through Karen (Jessy Schram), who was once part of the 2nd Mass. It tells Tom about a “Neutral Zone”, in which survivors can live in peace – detained in a camp run by The Overlords. Tom quickly realizes that negotiation with their invaders {{is out of the}} question, and he immediately refuses. He attacks a nearby Skitter and is knocked unconscious in the process.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} in a horizontal channel partially filled {{with a layer of}} 12. 7 mm ceramic-oxide beads filled with a nitrogen-diluted stoichiometric methane–oxygen mixture, i. e., CH_ 4 + 2 (O_ 2 + 2 / 3 N_ 2). Ionization probes and pressure transducers were used to track the explosion front velocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1. 22 m long, 76 mm wide and 152 mm high horizontal channel. Schlieren photography and smoked foil techniques are used to gain insight into the explosion front structure. The explosion propagation phenomenon was characterized by <b>the</b> combustion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bead layer and <b>the</b> unobstructed <b>gap</b> above. It was determined that for a fixed <b>gap</b> height <b>the</b> bead layer thickness had very little effect on the explosion propagation phenomenon. However, for a fixed bead layer height the explosion propagation was strongly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> height. <b>The</b> combustion products vented from the bead layer behind <b>the</b> flame propagating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> affects <b>the</b> structure of <b>the</b> shock-flame front <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>the</b> maximum flame velocity achieved. The coupling between the vented products and <b>the</b> flame velocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> was strongly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> height. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> height also affects the structure of the detonation wave propagating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> following DDT that always occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>The</b> DDT run-up distance was found to increase with increasing gap height and inversely with initial pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of increasing the}} sound-power transmission loss of a double panel by using helium gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> is investigated. <b>The</b> transmission loss of a panel is defined as ten times the common logarithm of {{the ratio of the}} sound power incident on the panel to the sound power transmitted to the space {{on the other side of}} the panel. The work is associated with extensive research being done to develop new techniques for predicting the interior noise levels on board high-speed advanced turboprop aircraft and reducing the noise levels with a minimum weight penalty. Helium gas was chosen for its inert properties and its low impedance compared with air. With helium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> <b>the</b> impedance mismatch experienced by the sound wave will be greater than that with air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> It is seen that helium gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> increases <b>the</b> transmission loss of the double panel over a wide range of frequencies...|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> present paper {{methods of}} {{minimizing}} or maximizing {{the values of}} the Corona onset voltage and <b>the</b> Corona current <b>in</b> small rod-plate air <b>gaps</b> are investigated. <b>The</b> geometry and the way of grounding and charging the electrodes, (Ground Effect), <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> length, <b>the</b> existence of barrier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> (Barrier Effect), and the conditions of <b>the</b> air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> are some factors, which influence greatly the distribution of <b>the</b> electric field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> and hence <b>the</b> above values. Combining experimental and simulation-theoretical work, it is resulted that: a) the electrode chosen to be ground, strongly influences the distribution of the field and hence the Corona onset voltage and <b>the</b> corona current <b>in</b> rod-plate air <b>gaps.</b> When <b>the</b> rod is grounded the value of the corona onset voltage is higher and the corona current is significantly smaller. b) A dielectric barrier, when placed in specific positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> increases <b>the</b> Corona onset voltage to a maximum value, and annihilates the Corona Current. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
