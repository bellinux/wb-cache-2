25|$|Because {{most of the}} Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} by {{widespread}} mafic-ultramafic magmatism 1,884to 1,864million years ago along the Superior craton margin during these orogenies, {{a number of different}} suggestions have been made to explain the questionable origins of this large igneous province. It is also not clear if the Circum-Superior Belt has a single origin or it has several origins. Suggestions include back-arc rifting, <b>foredeep</b> flexure, mantle plumes and the breakup of a microcontinent. The geochemical indication of the Circum-Superior Belt is also poorly known; either it contains major regional differences or it is the same throughout the magmatic zone. With the discovery of the Pickle Crow dike swarm throughout the western Superior craton, the likelihood of other 1,880million year old dike groups throughout the Superior craton remains. This is partly because several dike zones in the Superior craton remain undated. The relationship of the Circum-Superior Belt with similar age magmatism throughout the nearby Trans-Hudson belt and elsewhere on Earth is also unknown. This includes the 1,860million year old magmatism of the East Kimberly event in Australia and 1,860million year old magmatism of the Mashonaland event in Africa. The other questionable suggestion related to the Circum-Superior Belt is the existence of a suggested 1,900million year old global superplume event.|$|E

The {{asymmetry}} between orogens or accretionary wedges {{related to}} geographically opposed subduction zones {{is marked by}} volumes of the orogens above sea-level that are about 6 – 8 times smaller for those belts associated to W-di-rected subduction zones {{with respect to the}} orogens related to E- or NE-directed slabs.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} various parameters influencing the thermal regime in orogenic belts and related <b>foredeeps</b> shows that (i) the increasing heat flow in internal zones is mainly due to the thickening of radiogenic layers, {{although there is no}} simple proportionality between crustal thickness and heat flow signal at large scale; (ii) in external zones, where the horizontal strain rate is large (such as in the Bolivian Andes), surface processes can be of first order within the first kilometers of the crust. Hence, they induce a large scatter in the thermal data which are acquired at shallow depths. The deep thermal regime can be restored only by a quantitative assessment of these parameters. Active erosion (respectively sedimentation) can increase (resp. reduce) the heat flow by a factor of 2 in the uppermost kilometers. The effects of fluid circulation percolating at depth can also generate significant local disturbances. Other processes such as heat advection during thrusting, surface morphology and climate change have a minor influence in most settings, compared to the aforesaid effects. In the Bolivian Sub Andean Zone, between 18 S and 22 S, the very active deformation enhances the surface thermal perturbations (particularly erosion and sedimentation) and disturb the thermal field. The analysis of these data accounting for the kinematics of the belt allows the lateral variations of the thermal regime at various scales to be assessed.

40|$|Two {{fundamentally}} different {{views on the}} origin of the sialic crust of the earth are possible. According to one view the sialic crust has been produced from the inside by progressive physico-chemical differentiation of the earth's material into concentric spheres. Such an endogenic origin of the crust is supported by most contemporaneous geological theories. According to the other view the crust has been acquired from the outside, shortly after the earth's agglomeration, as an outer layer of more acid satellitic material. This exogenic origin of the crust is suggested by Berlage's theory {{on the origin of}} the planetary system. In this paper it is attempted to test Berlage's astronomical theory by means of geonomical facts. It appears that the postulate of the acquisition of the crustal matter from the outside leads to a satisfactory theoretical model of the earth's evolution. Three major phases can be distinguished: 1. (I) The acquisition of an acid layer from without. 2. (II) Its transformation. 3. (III) Its incorporation (see Fig. 1). An important aspect of this model is that it provides a synthesis of the two main trends in the geological thought of our time, the fixistic concepts (recently represented, for example, by Subbotin et al., 1965 a,b,c), and the mobilistic concepts (recently represented, for example, by Blackett et al., 1965). This synthesis is obtained by means of the relativistic principle in the analysis of the crustal movements and deformations. The effects of the causative mass displacements at various depths, and occurring at various times, are superimposed on each other. The processes in depth produce in combination the structural phenomena observable at the surface. The Alpine cycle of orogeny is analysed according to this relativistic principle (Fig. 3). The influence of mega-, geo- and meso-undations can be distinguished. The mega-undations are generated in the lower mantle. They cause the “Tethys-Twist” and the continental drift, which is accompanied by mega-shears and the formation of new ocean basins (Atlantic type of oceanization). The geo-undations are related to physico-chemical processes, which occur in {{the upper part of the}} upper mantle (the asthenosphere). They result in the formation of eugeosynclines, accompanied by ophiolitic magmatism (the eugeosynclinal phase). Thereafter, centres of orogeny are formed in the geosynclinal area by subcrustal mass circuits, which corrode the crust from beneath (Mediterranean type of oceanization). By this penetrative type of convection, the overlying crustal matter (covered by geosynclinal sediments) is rafted outward from these centres. Meanwhile migmatized sialic matter is injected sidewards into the flysch <b>foredeeps.</b> This tectogenesis produces nappe structures of East Alpine and Pennine character (flysch phase). Finally, an isostatic equilibration of the matter that accumulated in the <b>foredeeps</b> produced meso-undations, namely the uplift of the Alpine mountain ranges and the subsidence of sidedeeps (molasse phase, see Fig. 4 and 5). An analysis of the present picture of the structural features of the earth (Fig. 6) confirms the concept that the seemingly opposed mobilistic and fixistic mechanical models should be combined into a synthesis of relativistic character. During the third phase of the earth's geological evolution (the last half billion years of its history), the sialic crust is progressively incorporated into the upper mantle by means of the Mediterranean type of oceanization. The crustal fragments thereby acquired a greater freedom of movement and they started drifting towards the Pacific area (Pacifico-petal drift), opening new oceanic basins in their wake (the Atlantic type of oceanization). The expectation of this relativistic model of the earth's evolution appears to conform to the diagnostic data of the post-war geonomic researches, so that this hypothesis deserves further elaboration and testing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{an effort}} to define the {{conditions}} distinguish-ing underthrusting and subduction in the Venus environment, we have modeled the thermal and buoyancy consequences of the subduction endmember. Predictions of the thermal evolu-tion of a slab subducting at a fixed angle into the Venusian mantle are used to find slab densities based on slab composi-tion and changes of temperature, pressure, and phase. The sustainability of subduction is assessed by considering the effects of slab buoyancy and mantle flow on the subduction angle. Mantle flow induced by slab motion applies torques on the slab, which are compared to buoyancy torques. Flow torques tend to decrease the angle of subduction. Buoyancy torques also act to decrease the subduction a gle when the slab is positively buoyant. The basalt-eclogite phase transition dominates the transformation of positively buoyant slabs to negative buoyancy. Slabs that have descended todepths less than about 275 km remain positively buoyant. Beyond 275 km slabs become negatively buoyant. We predict hat the combina-tion of flow and buoyancy torques will tend to force initially suMucted slabs to assume an underthrusting position, leading to crustal thickening, deformation, melting, and volcanism. This may provide a model explaining the association of com-pressional mountain belts and tessera blocks with apparent flexural rises, <b>foredeeps,</b> and voluminous volcanic deposits. Only special circumstances appear capable of promoting the conditions for negative slab buoyancy. These might include one where an underthrust slab becomes attached to or included in a densifted crustal root created in a zone of crustal thicken-ing. The subsequent delamination and sinking of the root may then lead to the subduction of the slab...|$|R

40|$|This work {{discusses}} the stratigraphy and facies {{analysis of the}} Ranzano Sandstone, in the northern Apennines (Italy), a confined low-efficiency turbidite system deposited {{in a series of}} small piggy-back basins, which show strong analogies with intraslope minibasins commonly observed in divergent margins. The detailed physical stratigraphy of these deposits, which are the counterpart of the Annot Sandstone of the classic “Trilogie Priabonienne” cropping out in the western Alps, shows a cross-current asymmetrical distribution of the facies related to basin morphology. In an E-W oriented transect, roughly perpendicular to the general paleocurrents directed towards SSW, coarse-grained amalgamated massive sandstones that onlap against the eastern basin margin, grade towards the west, over very short distances, into a stratigraphic succession dominated by coarse-grained sandstones reworked in megaripples. This westward lateral facies change is also associated with: a) progressive deviation of the megaripple paleocurrents towards the west, b) progressive eastward increase in the sandstone/mudstone ratio, impact flow structures and beds with mudstone clasts, and c) progressive westward decrease in bed thickness characterizing massive facies. This cross-current transition is interpreted as related to bipartite turbidity currents experiencing deceleration against a relatively steeper eastern margin, producing flow decoupling and consequent bypass of upper turbulent flows that can spread out towards the less steep western bounding slope. The lateral spreading of turbulent flows causes reworking of the coarse-grained massive facies, producing tractive structures that indicate westward flow divergence. The lack of medium, fine-grained sands and mud testifies that these grain sizes must have been transported by turbulent flows into another adjacent basin, allowing the described deposits to be interpreted as recording a “flow stripping” phase as found in the ponded intraslope basins of the Gulf of Mexico and other confined settings, such as wedge-top basins and inner <b>foredeeps...</b>|$|R
40|$|West-directed {{subduction}} zones show east-verging arcs of 1500 – 3000 km. They {{are usually}} younger than 50 Ma and {{are characterized by}} a frontal accretionary wedge and a back-arc basin propagating together toward the east. The accretionary wedge scrapes off superficial layers of the downgoing plate (thin-skinned tectonics) whereas the back-arc extension cross-cuts the entire subduction hanging wall (thick-skinned tectonics). The slab {{of this type of}} subduction is steep to vertical and the hanging wall of the subduction has a mean elevation of 1000 m below sea level. Trenches and <b>foredeeps</b> are the deepest basins of the Earth and the mean depth is of 5000 m below sea level. West-directed subduction occurs both in case of the highest E-W convergence rates among plates (e. g. W Pacific examples) and no or very low convergence (e. g. Carpathians). Following Atlantic W-directed subduction examples, the W-directed subductions seem to develop along the back-thrust belt of former E-directed subduction zones, where oceanic lithosphere occur in the foreland to the east with the narrowing of the American continents. This could be applied to the onset of the Apennines subduction along the back-thrust belt of the Alpine-Betic orogen where Tethys oceanic crust was present. The Alpine orogen was stretched and scattered in the Apennines back-arc basin. The back-arc extension is internally punctuated by necks (sub-basins) and boudins (horsts of continental lithosphere). Asymmetric extension in the back-arc basin appears controlled by differential drag between the eastward mantle flow and the overlying passively transported crustal remnants. Compression in the accretionary prism may be interpreted as the superficial expression of the shear occurring between the downgoing lithosphere and the horizontally moving mantle which compensates the slab roll-back. The area of the Apennines appears lower than the area of the sedimentary cover before subduction: this favours the idea that not significant crustal slices {{have been involved in the}} Apenninic accretionary prism, and the basement thrust sheets included in the western part of the belt are mainly relicts of the Alpine-Betic orogen...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} the Jurassic-Eocene sedimentary record of northwestern Montana and the geometry and kinematics of the thrust belt, {{in order to develop}} a unifying geodynamic-stratigraphic model to explain the evolution of the Cordilleran retroarc of this region. Provenance and subsidence analyses suggest the onset of a foreland basin system by Middle Jurassic time. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons and detrital modes of sandstones indicate provenance from accreted terranes and deformed miogeoclinal rocks. Subsidence commenced at ∼ 170 Ma and followed a sigmoidal pattern characteristic of foreland basin systems. Jurassic deposits of the Ellis Group and Morrison Formation accumulated in a back-bulge depozone. A regional unconformity/paleosol zone separates the Morrison from Cretaceous deposits. This unconformity was possible result of forebulge migration, decreased dynamic subsidence, and eustatic sea level fall. The late Barremian(?) -early Albian Kootenai Formation is the first unit in the foreland that consistently thickens westward. The subsidence curve at this time begins to show a convex-upward pattern characteristic of <b>foredeeps.</b> The location of thrust belt structures during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous is uncertain, but provenance information indicates exhumation of the Intermontane and Omineca belts, and deformation of miogeocline strata, possibly on {{the western part of the}} Purcell anticlinorium. By Albian time, the thrust belt had propagated to the east and incorporated Proterozoic rocks of the Belt Supergroup as indicated by provenance data in the Blackleaf Formation, and by cross-cutting relationships in thrust sheets involving Belt rocks. From Late Cretaceous to early Eocene time the retroarc developed a series of thrust systems including the Moyie, Snowshoe, Libby, Pinkham, Lewis-Eldorado-Steinbach-Hoadley, the Sawtooth Range and the foothills structures. The final stage in the evolution of the compressive retroarc system is recorded by the Paleocene-early Eocene Fort Union and Wasatch Formations, which are preserved in the distal foreland. A new ∼ 145 Km balanced cross-section indicates ∼ 130 km of shortening. Cross-cutting relationships, thermochronology and geochronology suggest that most shortening along the frontal part of the thrust belt occurred between the mid-Campanian to Ypresian (∼ 75 - 52 Ma), indicating a shortening rate of ∼ 5. 6 mm/y.

40|$|To {{statistically}} {{test and}} evaluate the significance of asymmetric upward thickening and thinning trends and other cyclic patterns in turbidite successions, twenty-eight bed-by-bed sections with a wide coverage in geological time, tectonic settings, facies characteristics, and depositional environments were measured and described. First, 286 sandstone packets were selected from the 28 turbidite sections through statistically based segmentation. Then, these packets were examined by three powerful correlation tests (Kendall's, Spearman's, and Pearson's correlation tests) and four tests for randomness. Only 34 (11. 9 %) of the sandstone packets pass tests designed to identify asymmetry at the 10 % significance level. Monte Carlo simulation and the binomial probability analysis indicate {{that the number of}} asymmetric sequences identified in the original set of turbidite sandstone packets is indistinguishable from the number which can be produced by random processes. [...] Eighty-six sandstone packets were tested for upward coarsening and fining trends. It was found that as many as 50 % of sandstone packets from coarse-grained channel fills fine or coarsen upward. Upward fining sequences dominate, which is interpreted as the result of channel filling or the stacking of onlapping deposits at a channel mouth. [...] The Hurst statistic provides a measure of long-term persistence. Sixteen (84. 2 %) of 19 turbidite sections show the Hurst phenomenon, i. e., irregular and non-periodic clustering of high and low values of bed-thickness, grain-size, and sandstone percentage. This clustering is related to vertical changes of sedimentary facies caused by lateral shifting of environments on the fan surface. The strength of the clustering, inferred from Hurst K values, might be useful as an index to distinguish submarine fan environments: channel-Ievee complexes tend to have strong clustering; lobe-interlobe deposits tend to display moderate clustering; and basin-floor sheet sand systems tend to have weak clustering. [...] Combining facies characteristics observed in the field with the statistical results provides some criteria for the identification of submarine fan environments, and yields four preliminary fan models. (1) Type 1 sandy fans typically form in forearc basins, are fed by littoral sources or fan deltas, and are characterized by very coarse (pebbly sandy) sediments. Both channel and lobe deposits are well developed. A significant number of upward fining sequences can be found in channel deposits. Channel-interchannel complexes, particularly channel-levee complexes, display strong clustering of bed-thickness, grain-size and other parameters. (2) Type 2 sandy fans mainly form in forearc basins but also in foreland basins, and are fed by littoral sources or small rivers. The basic features of this model {{are similar to those of}} model 1, but pebbly sediments are absent or rare, and upward fining sequences lack significance. (3) Type 1 muddy fans tend to form in passive margins, foreland basins or <b>foredeeps,</b> and are fed by a large river delta. They are typically characterized by nested sandy bodies of channel and crevasse-splay-lobe deposits in very well-developed muddy levee deposits, which causes strong clustering of bed-thickness, grain-size and other parameters. Channels might gradually die out without a sandy lobe at the end. (4) Type 2 muddy fans form in the same tectonic settings as model 3, but sediments are mainly derived from failure at the shelf break, resulting in well-developed megaturbidite beds with thick mud caps. The large, muddy turbidity currents responsible for these beds are usually unchannelized and efficiently transport sandy sediments to form wide spread basin-floor sand sheets...|$|R
40|$|After the {{establishment}} of the N-S Andib-Ganamub trough, the ubiquitous Lower Nosib subarkose was succeeded in the west by the Upper Nosib greywacke which indicates that orthogeosynclinal subsidence was already active in pre-Damara times. A pulse of NNE folding (F₁N) concluded this sedinentary cycle and was accompanied by amphibolite-grade metamorphism (M₁), occasional migmatisation (A₁), and later feldspar blastesis. This episode was most intense in the west, so that the overlying Damara rocks paraconformable in the east, are unconformable there. Martin's (1965) separation of the succeeding Damara basin into a western eugeosyncline and an eastern miogeosyncline applies very well to this area, though the separating hinge-line appears to have been located farther to the west (± 80 Km) of the Kamanjab inlier, along the western flank of a N-S geanticlinal belt. The Lower Bakos semipelite and lenticular carbonate, thinning out against the eastern flank of this positive element controlling the deposition, may, prior to deformation, have created a transition between the western eugeosynclinal greywacke and the eastern miogeosynclinal Lower Otari carbonates. The fractured hinge-zone provided channels for the ascent of syndepositional intrusions and volcanics. Regional erosion following upwarping in the east caused a large influx of detritus into the Khomas furrow prior to the disconformable deposition of the Tillite Substage, which is the only reliable chronostratigraphic link between the base of the Upper Otavi and that of the Upper Bakos Series, the latter partially intertongueing with the succeeding Khomas Series. Gravitational creeping of the miogeosynclinal carbonates down the western slope of the upwarped Kamanjab inlier towards the sinking basin, produced the first folding (F₂O) in the east. Almost contemporaneously, buoyant uplifting forces, related to anatexis (A₂) along the axis of the eugeosyncline, created slopes sufficient to convey nappes (F₂S) of scarcely metamorphosed Damara schists towards the eastern foreland, overriding the miogeosyncline along the N-S Sesfontein Thrust. Eastern <b>foredeeps</b> were rapidly filled by the Mulden molasse. Steep slip folding (F₂S and F₄) in the cores and roots, and the formation of scattered domes at depth, controlled the successive structural evolution of the nappes. Large-scale axial undulations were later produced by orthogonally superposed F₃ folds striking east. The Damaran metamorphism (M₂), which outlasted deformation, has a Barrovian character and grades in the Damara sediments from amphibolite (sillimanite) grade in the west to greenschist (sericite- chlorite) grade in the east. In the previously dehydrated, deformed and metamorphosed, polymetamorphic (M₁/M₂) Nosib terrains, retrograde parageneses and transition granulites developed to the east and {{to the west of the}} Damaran hornblende-oligoclase isograd respectively. The Damaran tectono-thermal episode culminated in advanced migmatisation of the Khomas greywacke (possibly equivalent to the Salem granite-gneiss) and final anatexis (A₂) in the late-kinematic Ganias -Uhima (possibly equivalent to the Donkerhoek) granite, followed by widespread feldspar blastesis. The drop in rheomorphism in the deformed mass at the margin of the migmatite zone induced intense shearing and produced belts of mylonite and cataclastic gneiss. At a later stage, the Sesfontein Thrust was buffered against the Otavi dolomite relief and its speed of advancement reduced to match that of the erosion of its frontal toe, which now separates two completely different structural-stratigraphic domains: i) an eastern miogeosynclinal, feebly metamorphosed and volcanic-free domain (Damara System, Outjo Facies) deformed into non-basement-involving tectonites, overridden by ii) a western domain of suprastructural nappes and metamorphosed eugeosynclinal sediments (Damara System, Swakop Facies) deformed in response to basementinvolving tectonic processes promoted by deeply seated anatexis along the axis of the former eugeosyncline. The present model involves many stratigraphic revisions, one of the most important being that no rocks older than the Nosib Formation outcrop in the area and possibly along most of the Damara mobile belt in the western Kaokoveld...|$|R
