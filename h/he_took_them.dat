5|$|Leopold Mozart {{had been}} {{employed}} since 1747 {{as a musician}} in the Archbishop of Salzburg's court, becoming deputy Kapellmeister in 1763, but he had also devoted much time to Wolfgang's and sister Nannerl's musical education. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> on a European tour between 1764 and 1766, and spent some of 1767 and most of 1768 {{with them in the}} imperial capital, Vienna. The children's performances had captivated audiences, and the pair had made a considerable impression on European society. By 1769, Nannerl had reached adulthood, but Leopold was anxious to continue 13-year-old Wolfgang's education in Italy, a crucially important destination for any rising composer of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} was to broach the matter with the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who had been involved in Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
5|$|His father Goronwy ab Ednyfed (d. 1268) was seneschal to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also {{known as}} Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd by 1258, {{continuing}} {{in the role}} until his death on 12 October 1268. In that role, Goronwy had followed {{in the footsteps of}} his father, Ednyfed Fychan, and by doing so had tied the fortunes of the early House of Tudor to those of Llywelyn. Goronwy led Llywelyn's military forces, and in February 1263 <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords. Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, alongside Goronwy ap Goronwy (also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan) and Hywel ap Goronwy. Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur: he was preceded by his uncle, Tudur ab Ednyfed, {{who had been in the}} service of the previous Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn.|$|E

5|$|Hours earlier, Lucan had again {{called his}} mother, at about 12:30am. He {{told her that}} he would be in touch later that day, but {{declined}} to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand-Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand-Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> to Ranson.|$|E
5|$|In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa María de la Barca {{set sail}} along the Central American coast {{under the command}} of Pedro de Valdivia. The ship was sailing to Santo Domingo from Darién to inform the colonial {{authorities}} there of ongoing conflict between conquistadors Diego de Nicuesa and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa in Darién. The ship foundered upon a reef known as Las Víboras ("The Vipers") or, alternatively, Los Alacranes ("The Scorpions"), somewhere off Jamaica. There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán. There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates. Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord who was an enemy of Halach Uinik; <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> prisoner and kept them as slaves. After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal. Guerrero became completely Mayanised and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan's daughters, Zazil Ha, by whom he had three children. By 1514, Guerrero had achieved the rank of nacom, a war leader who served against Nachan Chan's enemies.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his conflicts with rebels and rivals, Tewodros encountered difficulties with the European powers. Seeking aid from the British government (he proposed a joint expedition to conquer Jerusalem), he became unhappy with {{the behavior of those}} Britons whom he had counted on to advance his request, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> hostage and chained them. In 1868, as a British expeditionary force sent from India to secure release of the hostages stormed his stronghold, Tewodros committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|The race among Europeans {{to obtain}} live coffee trees or beans was {{eventually}} {{won by the}} Dutch in 1616. Pieter van den Broecke, a Dutch merchant, obtained some of the closely guarded coffee bushes from Mocha, Yemen, in 1616. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> back to Amsterdam and found a home {{for them in the}} Botanical gardens, where they began to thrive.

Soon afterwards Greenidge was named as an the honorary citizen of the country. He also was at the helm of Bangladesh as <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> to the 1999 Cricket World Cup altogether.

25|$|From {{the fall}} of 1952 to the spring of 1953 Rauschenberg {{traveled}} through Europe and North Africa with his fellow artist and partner Cy Twombly.
