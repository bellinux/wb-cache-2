5|$|A {{couple of}} months after the {{beginning}} of the French occupation, the Maltese people rebelled against the French and blockaded them in the Harbour area with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support.

5|$|If {{you do not}} {{hurry to}} fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily {{accomplish}} what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes {{are not able to}} <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.|$|E
5|$|Nodes were {{designated}} 'A', 'B' or 'C' depending upon {{how long they}} were expected to <b>hold</b> <b>out.</b> Home Guard troops were largely responsible for the defence of nodal points and other centres of resistance such as towns and defended villages. Category 'A' nodal points and anti-tank islands usually had a garrison of regular troops.|$|E

In {{command of the}} garrison at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general George Palaiologos, sent by Alexios with orders to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> at all costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to relieve the city.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, {{along with}} the 8th Lancashire Fusiliers, were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the {{battalion}} headquarters based at Le Paradis. The battalions had been ordered to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> {{for as long as}} possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was {{dismissed}} from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after Dragon Rouge, ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville putting an end to the Simba rebellion.

5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to <b>hold</b> <b>out,</b> Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|By June 1992, the Nordiques {{announced}} that they were moving towards trading Lindros, and were engaged in trade discussions with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, New Jersey Devils, Philadelphia Flyers, and Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings were reported {{to be willing to}} trade Steve Yzerman, Steve Chiasson, and numerous draft picks to the Nordiques for Lindros. Yzerman indicated that he would also <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> from the Nordiques, should Detroit trade him to Quebec.|$|E
5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E

5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. Despite {{the fact that the}} revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience of the rebels in laying sieges would allow him to <b>hold</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the night, he {{was joined}} by his relatives, {{including}} Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis and {{spent the night in}} safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.|$|E
5|$|In May 1783, General Matthews {{was accused}} of {{procrastination}} and suspended by the Bombay Government. Thereafter Colonel John Campbell received provisional command of the strategic fort of Mangalore on 5 May 1783. Tipu made several assaults on the Mangalore fort up until January 1784, all of which resulted in failure. Looking at the wounded embattled garrison, Colonel Campbell considered it futile to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> any longer. He finally delivered the Mangalore fort to Tipu when the British capitulated on 30 January 1784. On 11 March 1784, Tipu and the British East India Company signed the Treaty of Mangalore, thus bringing {{an end to the}} Second Anglo-Mysore War.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet {{arrived and}} – after joining with the Venetian fleet – {{attacked}} the Norman fleet, which was again routed. The garrison at Dyrrhachium managed to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> all summer, despite Robert's catapults, ballistae and siege tower. The garrison made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaiologos fought {{all day with}} an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert's siege tower.|$|E
5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to have understood the limits of the stop lines and never expected them to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan army {{managed to}} <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> for three days, but were {{eventually}} forced {{to surrender to}} Ploscânea.

Once in control of the camp, the Mongols slaughtered the Kievan army including Mstislav of Kiev and several other noble prisoners.|$|E
