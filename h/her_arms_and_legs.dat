5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs,</b> while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> {{close to the}} vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part {{of the mass of}} her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.|$|E
25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom {{in the back of}} the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E

25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} {{who was going}} to kill the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen was to say he was in his workshop, while Andersen was to say he was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of}} her head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

25|$|Genie (born 1957) is the {{pseudonym}} for an American feral {{child who}} {{was a victim of}} severe abuse, neglect, and social isolation. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal child psychology. When she was a baby her father concluded that she was severely mentally retarded, a view which intensified as she got older, causing him to dislike her and withhold care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible {{as a result of this}} belief, so from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time he almost always kept her strapped to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished. The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.|$|E
500|$|Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, {{became a}} fan of MOBA after seeing the {{portrait}} in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs,</b> and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1990, ISO was {{performing}} {{not just in}} the US but also abroad. The troupe was regularly reviewed by The New York Times. A 1988 review said that, [...] "Unfortunately, many of [...] effects looked too self-consciously clever." [...] A 1990 review concluded that, [...] "It is easy to be optimistic about ISO; its shows are goofy fun. But the apparently casual silliness derives from great theatrical shrewdness." [...] A 1991 review said that, [...] "The evening got off to a good, punchy start, then dwindled irretrievably into sophomoric hijinks." [...] A 1993 review stated that, [...] "Iso is after laughs and it gets them. But its targets are threadbare just when dance could use some sharp satirists." [...] In one 1990 performance, Steinberg used elastic bands to playfully reshape <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> as noodles, then flew from wires like an angel.|$|E

But before the clash, Saudi officials tweeted that she had injured <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> during training <b>and</b> that medics had told her to pull out. Afterwards, media outlets in Israel reportedly suggested that 22-year-old Fahmy was not injured. According to the Times of Israel, Channel 2 broadcaster said she had dropped out to avoid a fixture against an Israeli.|$|R
500|$|In the series, Khan {{takes the}} name Ms. Marvel from Carol Danvers, who now {{goes by the}} alias Captain Marvel.

She is very deliberately placed in a position where she sees Carol protecting civilians from Yon-Rogg." [...] According to Wilson, Khan idolizes Carol so when Khan acquires superhuman abilities, she emulates Danvers. [...] "Captain Marvel represents an ideal that Kamala pines for. She's strong, beautiful and doesn't have any of the baggage of being Pakistani and 'different,'" [...] Wilson explained. [...] "Khan is a big comic book fan and after she discovers her superhuman power – being a polymorph and able to lengthen <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> and change her shape – she takes on the name of Ms. Marvel," [...] Amanat elaborated.

Interviews with a guard a decade later implied that [...] "higher-ups" [...] had ordered her to be repeatedly raped. Two other prisoners gave an account of seeing the guards handing Sun over to several male convicts in the prison to be raped. [...] These accounts match written or eyewitness accounts of other female prisoners who were tortured {{to death in the}} era, notably Zhang Zhixin and Lin Zhao. After hearing of Sun's death and her condition {{at the time of her}} death, Zhou Enlai ordered an autopsy, but Jiang intervened and had Sun's body quickly cremated. After cremating Sun's body, Jiang had her ashes disposed of, in order to prevent Sun's family from taking possession of them.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTetanus {{vaccination}} {{is part of}} the Norwegian childhood vaccination program. An {{elderly woman}} injured <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> after a minor fall on her outdoor stairs. Two weeks later she presented with trismus. This developed into tetanic spasms, obstructed airways and the need for a tracheostomy. She died 14 days later due to pneumonia and multi-organ failure. ELISA for tetanus toxoid IgG was negative, probably because the patient was born before the introduction of tetanus vaccination in the Norwegian childhood vaccination program. Lack of adherence to the vaccination programs should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms resembling diseases they normally would be protected from. Although the patient presented with typical symptoms the diagnosis was not suspected initially, probably due to the rareness of this disease in Norway...|$|R

Re-examination of the CT scan taken {{before the start of}} thrombolytic treatment revealed a recent silent infarct with cortical petechial haemorrhage at this site. A month later the patient still suffered from a partial paralysis in <b>her</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> but could now walk without help; she did not have any lasting symptoms of the haemorrhage.
