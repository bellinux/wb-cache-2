The charged coal is gradually heated by the heating wall of the oven in the absence of air to attain a temperature of 1000°-1050 °C at the central axis of the coke mass toward the end of coking period. the coking period is generally specified between 16 hrs and 19 hrs depending on oven condition and production requirement. the volatile matter of coal liberated during carbonization is collected in gas collecting mains in the form of raw coke oven gas passing through stand pipes and direct contact cooling with ammonia liquor spray.

40|$|FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking) {{catalyst}} iron poisoning {{would not}} only influence units’ product slate; when the poisoning is serious, it could also jeopardize FCC catalysts’ fluidization in reaction-regeneration system and further cause bad influences on units’ stable operation. Under catalytic cracking reaction conditions, large amount of iron nanonodules is formed on the seriously iron contaminated catalyst due to exothermic reaction. These nodules intensify the attrition between catalyst particles and generate plenty of fines which severely influence units’ smooth running. A dense layer could be formed on the catalysts’ surface after iron contamination and the dense layer stops reactants to diffuse to inner structures of catalyst. This causes extremely negative effects on catalyst’s heavy oil conversion ability and could greatly cut down gasoline yield while increasing yields of <b>dry</b> gas, <b>coke,</b> and slurry largely.

5000|$|Pale ale was a {{term used}} for beers made from malt <b>dried</b> with <b>coke</b> [...] Coke had been first used for {{roasting}} malt in 1642, but it wasn't until around 1703 {{that the term}} pale ale was first used [...] By 1784 advertisements were appearing in the Calcutta Gazette for [...] "light and excellent" [...] pale ale [...] By 1830 onward the expressions bitter and pale ale were synonymous[...] Breweries would tend to designate beers as pale ale, though customers would commonly refer to the same beers as bitter.

30|$|From {{their results}} in Table  7, {{they found that}} raising the {{hydrocarbon}} partial pressure increased the amount of <b>dry</b> gas and <b>coke</b> {{at the expense of}} gasoline. They attributed the higher coke yield to a higher rate of oligomerization, which is a bimolecular reaction and favored at high pressure. They also found that increasing the hydrocarbon partial pressure substantially lowered the C 3 and C 4 olefinicities leading to a decrease in the yield of propylene and butylene. These yield shifts suggest that the rate of hydrogen transfer increases with hydrocarbon partial pressure, as would be expected for a bimolecular reaction [26, 49].|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the initial cracking reactions to form alkane and olefin, {{there are a number}} of secondary acid-catalyzed reactions that occur during hydrocarbon cracking, such as skeletal and/or double-bond position isomerizations, cyclization reactions, aromatization, alkylation, dealkylation, branching and polymerization. The secondary reactions produce a large amount of low carbon molecules such as aromatics and alkenes which are in favor of improving octane number of gasoline and propylene and butane yields. However, overcracking reactions of distillates also decrease light distillate yields and increase <b>dry</b> gas and <b>coke</b> formation, which are usually unexpected.

30|$|As {{the crude}} oils are getting heavier {{and the demand}} for high value {{petroleum}} products is increasing, the FCC technologies are developing under the following directions: (a) reducing the yields of <b>dry</b> gas and <b>coke,</b> and increasing the yield of light oil; (b) increasing the diesel to gasoline ratio of the product; (c) increasing the processing capacity of inferior feedstocks; (d) improving the product quality; and (e) increasing the yield of light olefins.

This paper will describe the TSR FCC process for maximizing light oil and its development for increasing diesel yield, enhancing the conversion of heavy oil, and reducing the olefin content of gasoline.

30|$|According to thermal {{cracking}} and secondary reactions of heavy hydrocarbons {{occurring in the}} FCC process, {{it is believed that}} radical reactions for hydrocarbon precracking happen mainly on catalyst matrix at high temperature in the first reaction zone of the catalyst riser. Because chain paraffin reacts to mainly form ethylene, methane and α-olefins by radical reactions, heavy oil cracking on matrix easily forms <b>dry</b> gas and <b>coke</b> in this section. Dominant reactions in catalytic cracking take place in the secondary reaction zone of the catalyst riser. The cracking reactions in this section are based on the carbenium reaction mechanism and dependent on catalyst zeolites. The supercage of zeolite Y is critical to heavy oil cracking for offering acid sites and promoting carbenium ion formation. The unconverted slurry yield decreases remarkably with increasing zeolite Y content of the FCC catalysts.|$|R

30|$|The HS–FCC process {{developed}} {{jointly by}} Saudi Aramco {{and its partners}} is operated under considerably higher reaction temperatures (550 – 650  °C) than conventional FCC units and the main objective is to produce more propylene and high octane number gasoline [3, 5, 24, 41, 64, 65, 82]. Under these conditions, however, thermal cracking of hydrocarbons also takes place concurrently with catalytic cracking, resulting in increased undesirable products as <b>dry</b> gas and <b>coke.</b> Short contact time (less than 0.5  s) of the feed and product hydrocarbons in the downer minimizes thermal cracking. Undesirable successive reactions, such as hydrogen transfer, which consume olefins, are suppressed. To attain the short residence time, the catalyst and the products have to be separated immediately at the reactor outlet. For this purpose, a high efficiency, short residence time product separator has been developed, and is capable of suppressing side reactions (oligomerization and hydrogenation of light olefins) and coke formation [5, 6, 24, 41, 65].|$|R
