5|$|After {{travelling}} to Tangiers in 1912, Rix held several successful {{exhibitions of}} her work, with one drawing, Grande marche, Tanger, {{purchased by the}} French government. She {{was one of the}} first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, was made a member of the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français, and had works hung in the Paris Salon first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's search for <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, {{the film was}} shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E

5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E
5|$|Nigel and Vanessa Lawson {{divorced}} in 1980, when Nigella was 20. They both remarried: her father that {{year to a}} House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>in</b> the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death). As her father {{was at the time}} a prominent political figure, some of the things Nigella found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. In the mid 1990s, he decided to lose weight for medical reasons, and subsequently wrote the best-selling The Nigel Lawson Diet Book. Nigella has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998 Kingsley Plantation {{has hosted}} an annual one-day event in October called the Kingsley Heritage Celebration that {{coincides with the}} Kingsley family reunion. Several {{relatives}} of Kingsley and Anna Jai are notable. Kingsley's youngest sister's daughter, Anna McNeill, participated with <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> attempting to block Anna Jai from inheriting Kingsley's property. McNeill served {{as the model for}} her son, the artist James Whistler, in his , popularly known as Whistler's Mother. Kingsley Beatty Gibbs' brother was George Couper Gibbs, a planter in St. Johns County, south of Fort George Island near St. Augustine. Former governor of South Carolina Duncan Clinch Heyward is descended from him.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks before}} her mother's death in 1967, 16-year-old Jayne Marie accused Sam Brody, her mother's boyfriend at that time, of beating her. The girl's {{statement}} to {{officers of the}} Los Angeles Police Department the following morning implicated <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> encouraging the abuse, and days later a juvenile court judge awarded temporary custody of Jayne Marie to Paul's uncle William W. Pigue and his wife Mary. Following her 18th birthday, Jayne Marie complained {{that she had not}} received her inheritance from the Mansfield estate or heard from her father since her mother's death.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>in</b> Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
