5|$|Sex steroids {{are known}} to affect the rate of sebum secretion; androgens such as {{testosterone}} {{have been shown to}} stimulate secretion, and estrogens have been shown to inhibit secretion. <b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> acts as the primary androgen in the prostate and in hair follicles.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is <b>dihydrotestosterone.</b> Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E
25|$|Several C17β ester prodrugs of DHT, {{including}} androstanolone benzoate, androstanolone enanthate, androstanolone propionate, and androstanolone valerate, {{have been}} developed and introduced for medical use as AAS. Conversely, <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> acetate, <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> butyrate, and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> formate {{have been developed}} but have not been marketed.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{injections}} of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) {{were applied to}} males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Analysis showed that testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> regulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, {{but not in the}} TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, flutamide, an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> for androgen receptors, and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> were administered to normal male rats. <b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} {{testosterone}} on hair follicles is mainly {{due to the}} more potent androgen, <b>dihydrotestosterone,</b> DHT.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT): a {{metabolite}} of testosterone, and a {{more potent}} androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, {{along with}} its {{metabolite}} <b>dihydrotestosterone,</b> is extremely important to normal sexual functioning in men and women. <b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women. Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half {{of what they were}} before the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; this is because the ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Male pattern {{hair loss}} is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone <b>dihydrotestosterone.</b> The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) is a {{metabolite}} of testosterone, and a {{more potent}} androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors. It is produced in the skin and reproductive tissue.|$|E
25|$|The optimal ranges {{listed for}} {{testosterone}} only apply to individuals taking bioidentical hormones {{in the form}} of testosterone (including esters) and do not apply to those taking synthetic AAS (e.g., nandrolone) or <b>dihydrotestosterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{function}} properly, {{the prostate}} needs male hormones (androgens), which {{are responsible for}} male sex characteristics. The main male hormone is testosterone, which is produced mainly by the testicles. It is <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, that predominantly regulates the prostate.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{injected}} both orchidectomized (ORX) (castrated) and sham castrated male rats with BrdU {{to determine}} if the number of new cells was increased. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> in the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|At a {{high dosage}} of 1,600mg/day orally for 4weeks, {{treatment}} of postmenopausal women with prasterone {{has been found}} to increase serum levels of DHEA by 15-fold, testosterone by 9-fold, DHEA-S, androstenedione (A4), and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) all by 20-fold, and estrone and estradiol both by 2-fold.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{promotes}} {{prostate cell}} proliferation, but relatively {{low levels of}} serum testosterone are found in patients with BPH. One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> levels in the prostate.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{sex hormone}} levels {{may play a}} role in the {{development}} of osteoarthritis as it is more prevalent among post-menopausal women than among men of the same age. A study of mice found natural female hormones to be protective while injections of the male hormone <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> reduced protection.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hormonal}} {{change in}} males takes {{place during the}} teenage years for most young men. At this point in a male's life the testosterone levels slowly rise, {{and most of the}} effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> in target organs (especially that of the bowels).|$|E
25|$|The {{first period}} occurs between 4 and 6 {{weeks of the}} gestation. Examples include genital {{virilisation}} such as midline fusion, phallic urethra, scrotal thinning and rugation, and phallic enlargement; although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of <b>dihydrotestosterone.</b> There is also development of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{and maintenance of}} the seminal vesicles, {{as well as their}} secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. The seminal vesicles contain 5α-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into its much more potent metabolite, <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT). The seminal vesicles have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), {{also known}} as {{androstanolone}} or stanolone, is an endogenous androgen sex steroid and hormone. The enzyme 5α-reductase catalyzes the formation of DHT from testosterone in certain tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 double bond of testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is considerably more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR).|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., norethisterone, dienogest) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated with androgenic or antiandrogenic effects depending on the progestin in question.|$|E
25|$|As men age, the enzymes {{aromatase}} and 5-alpha reductase {{increase in}} activity. Aromatase and 5-alpha reductase {{are responsible for}} converting androgen hormones into estrogen and <b>dihydrotestosterone,</b> respectively. This metabolism of androgen hormones leads to a decrease in testosterone but raised levels of DHT and estrogen. Estrogen has {{a key role in}} the growth of cells in the prostate and DHT is an anabolic hormone many times more potent than testosterone that when combined, cause a synergy to induce BPH.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} found to possess {{clinically}} significant albeit weak antiandrogen activity at high doses. It {{has been found}} to directly and competitively displace testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) and antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) in animals. In addition, cimetidine {{has been found to}} inhibit 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased levels of estrogen. By increasing estrogen levels, cimetidine can also decrease testosterone and increase prolactin levels.|$|E
25|$|Finasteride is a {{medication}} of the 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) class. By inhibiting type II 5-ARI, finasteride prevents {{the conversion of}} testosterone to <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> in various tissues including the scalp. Increased hair on the scalp can be seen within three months of starting finasteride treatment and longer-term studies have demonstrated increased hair on the scalp at 24 and 48 months with continued use. Treatment with finasteride more effectively treats male-pattern hair loss at the vertex than male-pattern hair loss {{at the front of}} the head and temples.|$|E
25|$|Certain antiandrogens do {{not reduce}} {{testosterone}} or prevent its action upon tissues, but instead prevent its metabolite, <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), from forming. These medications {{can be used}} when the patient has male-pattern hair loss and/or an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia), both of which DHT exacerbates. Two medications are currently available to prevent the creation of DHT: finasteride and dutasteride. DHT levels can be lowered up to 60–75% with the former, and up to 93–94% with the latter. These medications have also {{been found to be}} effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{the first}} anti{{androgen}}, or androgen antagonist, was discovered. Antiandrogens antagonise the androgen receptor (AR) and thereby block the biological effects of testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT). Antiandrogens {{are important for}} men with hormonally responsive diseases like prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP), acne, seborrhea, hirsutism and androgen alopecia. Antiandrogens are mainly used {{for the treatment of}} prostate diseases. Research from 2010 suggests that ARs could be linked to the disease progression of triple-negative breast cancer and salivary duct carcinoma and that antiandrogens can potentially be used to treat it.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. <b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal therapy uses {{medications}} or {{surgery to}} block prostate cancer cells from getting <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), a hormone {{produced in the}} prostate and required for the growth and spread of most prostate cancer cells. Blocking DHT often causes prostate cancer to stop growing and even shrink. However, hormonal therapy rarely cures prostate cancer because cancers that initially respond to hormonal therapy typically become resistant after one to two years. Hormonal therapy is, therefore, usually used when cancer has spread from the prostate. It may also be given to certain men undergoing radiation therapy or surgery to help prevent return of their cancer.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of hair follicles begins in utero. The physiology is primarily androgenic, with <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) the major contributor at the dermal papillae. Men with premature androgenic alopecia tend to have lower than normal values of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and epitestosterone when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, {{they are more likely}} dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose.|$|E
25|$|As female fetuses {{have two}} X {{chromosomes}} and male ones a XY pair, the chromosome Y is the responsible for producing male differentiation on the defect female development. The differentiation process {{is driven by}} androgen hormones, mainly testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT). The newly formed testicles in the fetus {{are responsible for the}} secretion of androgens, that will cooperate in driving the sexual differentiation of the developing fetus, including its brain. This results in sexual differences between males and females. This fact has led some scientists to test in various ways the result of modifying androgen exposure levels in mammals during fetus and early life.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{functions}} as an endogenous precursor to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT, DHEA {{has been found}} to possess some degree of androgenic activity in its own right, acting as a low affinity (Ki = 1 μM), weak partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). However, its intrinsic activity at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to competition for binding with full agonists like testosterone, it can actually behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) levels, and hence, like an antiandrogen. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs with}} anti-androgen effects include flutamide, and spironolactone, which can give some {{improvement}} in hirsutism. Metformin can reduce hirsutism, perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, {{and is often}} used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes, or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a drug that {{is applied to the}} skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride and dutasteride) may also be used; they work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (the latter of which responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) (referred to as {{androstanolone}} or stanolone {{when used}} medically) {{can also be}} used in place of testosterone as an androgen. The availability of DHT is limited; it is not available in the United States or Canada, for instance, but it is available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg. DHT is available in formulations including topical gel, buccal or sublingual tablets, and as esters in oil for intramuscular injection. Relative to testosterone, and similarly to many synthetic AAS, DHT has the potential advantages of not being locally potentiated in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase (as DHT is already 5α-reduced) and of not being aromatized into an estrogen (it is not a substrate for aromatase).|$|E
25|$|As an antiandrogen, {{ketoconazole}} operates {{through at}} least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 400mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading {{to a reduction in}} circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{directly}} blocks androgen signaling {{and also}} {{acts as an}} inhibitor of androgen production. Due to the antiandrogenic effects that result from these actions, it is frequently used off-label to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens, such as testosterone and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), play a role. Some of these uses include androgenic alopecia in men (either at low doses or as a topical formulation) and women, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and seborrhea in women. Spironolactone is {{the most commonly used}} drug in the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. Higher doses of spironolactone are not recommended in males due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Similarly, it is also commonly used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and <b>dihydrotestosterone</b> (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a deep voice, broad shoulders, and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
