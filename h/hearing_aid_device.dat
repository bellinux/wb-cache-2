A severe hearing loss diagnosis in young children raises the urgent question on the optimal type of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>device.</b> As there is no recent data on comparing selection criteria for a specific <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>device,</b> the goal of the Hearing Evaluation of Auditory Rehabilitation Devices (hEARd) project (Coninx & Vermeulen, 2012) evolved to collect and analyze interlingually comparable normative data on the speech perception performances of children with hearing aids and children with cochlear implants (CI). METHOD: In various institutions for hearing rehabilitation in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands the Adaptive Auditory Speech Test AAST was used in the hEARd project, to determine speech perception abilities in kindergarten and school aged hearing impaired children. Results in the speech audiometric procedures were matched to the unaided hearing loss values of children using hearing aids and compared to results of children using CI. 277 data sets of hearing impaired children were analyzed. Results of children using hearing aids were summarized in groups as to their unaided hearing loss values. The grouping was related to the World Health Organization‚Äôs (WHO) grading of hearing impairment from mild (25 ‚Äì 40 dB HL) to moderate (41 ‚Äì 60 dB HL), severe (61 - 80 dB HL) and profound hearing impairment (80 dB HL and higher).

This paper investigates to what extent sound fields recreated by Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) {{can be used to}} evaluate the performance of spatially selective multi-microphone processing schemes (beamformers) inside complex acoustic environments. Two example schemes are considered: an adaptive directional microphone (ADM) and a contralateral suppression bilateral beamformer (BBF), both implemented {{in the context of a}} <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>device.</b> The acoustic scenarios consist of a single speech target (0 ¬∞) competing against three speech jammers (¬± 90 ¬∞ and 180 ¬∞) set either in an anechoic or in a reverberant simulated classroom (T‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ = 0. 6 s). The HOA effect on the directional algorithm performance is quantified through: (a) the adaptive, frequency-dependent, algorithm gains, (b) the SNR improvement calculated in one-third octave bands, and (c) the processed target frequency response. The HOA reconstruction errors influence the beamformers in mainly two ways; first, by altering the spatial characteristics of the sound field, which in turn modifies the adaptation of the algorithms, and second, by affecting the spectral content of the sources. The results suggest that although HOA (here 7 th order) does not degrade the broadband, long-term, intelligibility-weighted SNR improvement of the two beamformers, it imposes a low-pass effect on the processed target. This renders the HOA coding problematic above the system's cut-off frequency. 4 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Hearing loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{physical}} and sensory impairments among all ages, especially elders. Hearing loss may affect only one ear or both ears of a patient at a different degree of impairment. This asymmetrical nature of hearing loss makes it more difficult for the patient to localize the source of the sound properly. One possible solution for this asymmetry of hearing problem is to use a pair of hearing aid devices. Each <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>device</b> should be able to deal with such asymmetry of the ears, as well as the natural asymmetry induced by spectral sound differences. By using a pair of hearing aid devices operating at 2. 4 GHz- 2. 5 GHz Bluetooth band, wirelessly communicating with each other, the binaural processing will be improved for the person who suffers from unbalanced hearing loss between the two ears and one can properly localize the source of the sound. A novel lumped elements loaded miniaturized differential dipole antenna for Bluetooth enabled hearing aid devices is proposed. Miniaturization of the proposed antenna is achieved by planting lumped components directly on the optimized locations of the antenna traces. The lumped elements also serve as a matching circuit which matches the antenna‚Äôs input impedance directly to the radio, without need for an additional dedicated matching circuit. The effect of the human body is taken into consideration during the antenna design stages. The proposed antenna was simulated, fabricated and measured. There are some good agreements between simulated and measured results. Radio link tests were done after integrating the proposed antenna with a hearing aid package, and good link ranges were observed. Integrating tunable elements, for example voltage controlled capacitors; directly on the antenna structure to achieve adaptive matching according to different human bodies will be a valuable future work for this research...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} a filterbank for digital hearing aids using a Multidimensional Logarithmic Number System (MDLNS). Hearing loss {{is a function of}} both frequency and input level. In a typical digital hearing instrument, the hearing loss compensation is performed by separating the incoming sound into several frequency bands which are then compressed to allow the amplification of low level signals while maintaining the amplitude of high level signals. The demands of low power consumption and small size have led to a number of advances in algorithms, semiconductor technologies and system architectures for completely-in-canal (CIC) <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>device.</b> Based on research for digital hearing aids that started in the early 19902 ÃÜ 7 s, we have developed a new number system (MDLNS) and associated architecture that benefit the digital hearing aid processor in both of these requirements. Although the LNS has been previously considered for digital hearing aid processors, this thesis presents an exploration of the MDLNS for digital hearing aid circuitry. As with the LNS, the MDLNS provides a reduction {{in the size of the}} number representation, but the MDLNS promises a lower cost (area. power) implementation of the arithmetic operations required in both the linear and non-linear domains of filtering and compression. In this thesis we discuss an application of the MDLNS on the construction of a finite impulse response FIR filterbank, a major component of digital hearing aid processors. The MDLNS filterbank processor chip was fabricated using a 0. 18 micron CMOS technology. After evaluating the MDLNS filterbank and the two state-of-the-art filterbanks using classic binary implementation, we found power, area, and performance of the MDLNS filterbank processor showed competitive results compared to those binary filterbank processors.

In all those situations, the subjects mentioned the search for a definitive cure, which was not found. In the professional health care system, they received the indication of hearing aids as the only "solution". At this point, we identified difficulties to access the indicated treatment and lack of support and follow-up after the subjects bought the hearing aid. Participation in the elderly group was a positive aspect, as it seemed to be a strategy that provided shelter and an environment of disease acceptance, leading to enhanced adherence to treatment.
