5|$|Fishing {{does not}} cease when the lakes freeze; ice fishing {{has been around}} since the arrival of early Scandinavian immigrants. Minnesotans <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> embrace their long, harsh winters in ice sports such as skating, hockey, curling, and broomball, and snow sports such as {{cross-country}} skiing, alpine skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. Minnesota is the only U.S. state where bandy is played.|$|E
5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, and {{the major}} items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> peck {{open the}} foil caps of milk bottles {{left on the}} doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Atangana's childhood. Like other Beti boys, he would <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fish, hunt, and trap, and would have {{memorised}} his family's genealogy and folk wisdom. Explorers from the German Empire appeared near his village in 1887 {{in search of a}} direct route to the ivory trade in the savannas to the north. They had claimed Beti lands as part of their Kamerun colony in 1884, and by February 1889 they had established a permanent base in the area, which they named Jaunde after the local people. The Ewondo opposed the foreigners at first, although Atangana was probably not yet old enough to participate in the fighting. After the defeat of Omgba Bissogo in 1895 and others like it, Ewondo resistance waned. The Germans randomly appointed chiefs and mayors to serve under them, and took local youths to perform menial tasks; Atangana was among them, sent by his uncle to be a houseboy.|$|E

5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived {{through the ages}} and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Navajo may <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> weave {{from their}} Pueblo Indian neighbors {{when they moved}} into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
5|$|Venturers are {{expected}} to know and live by the Venturing Oath and Venturing Code. They associate and work directly with adults as partners, but the crew is led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills. Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth. Each award requires the Venturer to teach what they <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> others returning the skill and knowledge {{back to the community}} and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.|$|E

5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt what they <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> novel situations. This {{is reflected in the}} integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

25|$|Several {{experimental}} findings seem to {{run counter}} to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see Classical conditioning). Further, animals that <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.|$|E
25|$|North American brown bears (Ursos arctos) make a paste of Osha roots (Ligusticum porteri) and saliva and rub {{it through}} their fur to repel insects or soothe bites. This plant, locally known as bear root, {{contains}} 105 active compounds, such as coumarins that may repel insects when topically applied.
