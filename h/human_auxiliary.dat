40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} lambda (pol lambda) is {{a member}} of the X family DNA polymerases and is endowed with multiple enzymatic activities. In this work we investigated the in vitro miscoding properties of full-length, human pol lambda either in the absence or in the presence of the <b>human</b> <b>auxiliary</b> proteins proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RP-A). Our data suggested that (i) pol lambda had an intrinsic ability to create mismatches and to incorporate ribonucleotides at nearly physiological Mn++ and Mg++ concentrations; (ii) the sequence of the template-primer could influence the misincorporation frequency of pol lambda; (iii) pol lambda preferentially generated G:T and G:G mismatches; (iv) RP-A, but not PCNA, selectively prevented misincorporation of an incorrect nucleotide by pol lambda, without affecting correct incorporation and (v) this inhibitory effect required a precise ratio between the concentrations of pol lambda and RP-A. Possible physiological implications of these findings for the in vivo fidelity of pol lambda are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} high-level {{control language}} {{is an important}} element in the ongoing task of introducing automated guided vehicles (AGV) to new application domains. A new application domain is row crops, where small AGV’s will perform weed control around individual crop plants. This paper defines the requirements and scope of a process- and behaviour-based scripting language needed to control the weeding AGV in an agricultural row crop. The goal is to traverse and cover the whole field with no <b>human</b> <b>auxiliary</b> input during the field operation. The basis is the transparent and tactical real-time control language (CL) for small mobile robots (SMR). This SMR-CL has been modified to include some necessary motion commands and a supplemental supervisory function to monitor and record the progressive coverage of the field. The control language was then tested by applying it to a scenario representing typical field conditions for row crops. The construction of a suitable SMR-CL script for use in a field clearly demonstrates the feasibility of adapting behaviour-based control systems to field structures. The conducted case study indicated the importance of including goal-directing modules. Such a module is described here as the ‘supervisory field coverage monitor’ (SFCM), which acts to coordinate the behaviours. The applicability of this modified SMR-CL has been successfully demonstrated using a vehicle test in a specially designed artificial row crop field. The analysis of the operational performance verified {{that it is possible to}} cover all rows in a field without conducting time-consuming planning procedures...|$|E

5000|$|The T'au Empire's {{practice}} of tolerating and incorporating other races stands {{in stark contrast}} with essentially all other major races in the galaxy, which exterminate other races completely rather than conquer and subjugate them. Reports vary on the exact conditions of the alien races working for the T'au themselves, ranging from that they are full allies within the Empire, to that they are mercenary armies hired out by the T'au {{to aid in the}} umbrella of protection the T'au military provides their region of space, to reports that these [...] "auxiliaries" [...] are glorified slaves. Still, the fact that the T'au want to co-exist with other races on any level, even if they are subjugated, makes them far more tolerant than other races, particularly the xenophobic Imperium of Man. Most reports generally indicate that the <b>human</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> serving the T'au Empire are relatively well-treated, with many serving the T'au voluntarily.|$|R

We instead propose {{a method that}} relies on <b>human</b> gaze as <b>auxiliary</b> information, exploiting that even non-expert users have a natural ability to judge class membership. We present a data collection paradigm that involves a discrimination task to increase the information content obtained from gaze data. Our method extracts discriminative descriptors from the data and learns a compatibility function between image and gaze using three novel gaze embeddings: Gaze Histograms (GH), Gaze Features with Grid (GFG) and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS). We introduce two new gaze-annotated datasets for fine-grained {{image classification}} and show that human gaze data is indeed class discriminative, provides a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes, and outperforms other baselines for zero-shot image classification...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>human</b> {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) protein Vpr causes arrest of primate host cells in G 2. Expression of this protein in budding yeast {{has been previously}} reported to cause growth arrest and a large-cell phenotype. Investigation {{of the effect of}} Vpr expression in budding yeast, reported here, showed that it causes disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of HSP 42, the gene for a small heat shock protein (sHSP), from a high-copy-number plasmid reversed this effect. The sHSPs are induced by exposure of cells to thermal, osmotic, and oxidative stresses and to mitogens. In animal cells, overexpression of sHSPs causes increased resistance to stress and stabilization of actin stress fibers. Yeast cells subjected to mild stress, such as shifting from 23 to 39 degrees C, arrest growth and then resume cell division. Growth arrest is accompanied by transient disorganization of the cytoskeleton. Yeast in which the HSP 42 gene was disrupted and which was subjected to moderate thermal stress reorganized the actin cytoskeleton more slowly than did wild-type control cells. These results demonstrate that in yeast, as in metazoan cells, sHSPs promote maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R

Housing as a mass production had been concerned more about human settlements, social grouping, community living and some symbolic meanings only. It {{had not been able}} to perform well as homes with required qualitative nature, had become a common global phenomena today due to lots of factors. This has been quite acute in the urban situations of the third world. Many solutions have also been given by the respective governments, public authorities, NGO's, professionals, etc., from time to time, but the problem remains a it is. There have been many arguments for this too, brought forward by the same and different parties. In this context, this study also put forward its argument by analyzing the issue of designing homes for the homeless in urban situations and with respect to the government and professional intervention. It argues that contrary to the long established views, the people themselves have to be brought into the scene and what all the others can and should play is the necessary supportive roles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} design of control algorithms and calibration methods forMicroscale Rate Integrating Gyroscopes (MRIGs). As its name implies, a MRIG operatesin rate integrating mode and can directly measure the rotation angle of the base where itis mounted. However, the MRIG mechanical system does not spontaneously operate in arate integrating mode, but requires an active controller. Such a controller enables the MRIG to oscillate in a specific pattern that {{is related to the}} input rotation angle in a measurable way. Conventional micro-machined gyroscopes (i. e. MEMS gyroscopes) operate in rate mode (as apposed to rate integrating mode). That is, the gyroscope directly measures the rotation rate of the base. The measured rotation rate is then numerically integrated over time to obtain the input rotation angle. The main drawback of this measuring mechanism is that, by integrating, the rate measurement error will propagate over time, causing the angle measurement to drift from the real input angle. MRIG, by its operating principle, can directly measure the input rotation angle; hence it suffers from no such error propagation. A well-known control scheme for rate integrating gyroscopes was proposed by Lynch in 1995 [51]. This control scheme has demonstrated its efficacy on precisely fabricated rate integrating gyroscopes such as Hemispherical Resonance Gyroscopes (HRGs). However, for MRIGs fabricated by micro-fabrication technology, fabrication imperfections significantly degrade the gyro performance. In addition, the Lynch-proposed-scheme is essentially nonlinear. As a consequence, the controller performance is hard to predict and analyze prior to real tests. In this dissertation, a novel demodulation method is developed to transform the original nonlinear control problem into a linear time invariant controller design problem. This technique is based on the averaging method proposed by Lynch [50] but enables the use of well studied linear system theory for MRIG controller design and analysis. The resulting controller design for MRIGs is much more tractable and the performance is rather predictable. This fundamental improvement also opens up new opportunities for implementing and analyzing control systems based on linear control theory. Two schemes are proposed in this dissertation to compensate for the parameter mismatches caused by fabrication imperfections. The first one is based on electrostatic spring softening and tuning. The basic operation principle is first introduced. Then a full derivation of this method on a real MRIG configuration is conducted. Experimental results confirm that this compensation scheme can significantly attenuate the parameter mismatch. The other compensation scheme considered in this dissertation is an adaptive compensation scheme consisting of three feedforward controllers. Each of them runs on top of the corresponding feedback control loop and estimates and compensates parameter mismatches in real time. We also present a stability and convergence analysis that shows such adaptive controllers converge to the correct values and perfectly cancel the parameter mismatch. A simulation study performed on a MRIG model also confirms the efficacy of the compensation scheme. Then a self-calibration process is proposed to automatically calibrate the gyroscope. This self-calibration method requires no <b>human</b> involvement or <b>auxiliary</b> device, hence enables the gyroscope to calibrate itself whenever necessary, even in use...|$|R
