After the emperor took the Maltese knights under his protection, Quarenghi also joined the Order and served as its official architect until 1800. His commissions became less frequent, as the monotonous rhythm of solemn collonnades and the laconic clarity of symmetrical compositions appeared boring to those courtiers who had found Quarenghi's designs so delightful a decade earlier.|$|E

25|$|The show {{captured}} a key feature of Britain in the 1960s—the widening generation gap.

They supported the aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores, fashions, music, etc. The same things were anathema to Alf—and indicative of <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced.|$|E

For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number of people would be listening to Sakanaction for the first time for this album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E
