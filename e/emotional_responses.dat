5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study was}} to {{determine}} the <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> among autism and typically developing children in Malaysia. 50 autism and 50 typically developing children with age ranged 8 to 12 years old were participated in this study. The <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> measured by Mood and Feelings Questionnaire Short (MFQS) - parent version. The descriptive data and Independent T-Test had shown that there was a significant difference in <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> between autism and typically. The study concluded <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> shown a difference between autism and typically developing children. Future research needs to develop the intervention on an <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to enhancing the quality of life among autism...|$|R
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E

Its employees have stated that, {{while they are}} not opposed to making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping out what they want the player to feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Employees have stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that high levels of negative emotions may affect health. However, {{it is likely that}} the absence of an <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> following stressful events may also be problematic. Accordingly, we investigated whether a non-linear association exists between negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to major life events and allostatic load, a multisystem indicator of physiological dysregulation. Study sample was 6764 British civil service workers from the Whitehall II cohort. Negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> was assessed by self-report at baseline. Allostatic load was calculated using cardiovascular, metabolic and immune function biomarkers at three clinical follow-up examinations. A non-linear association between negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> and allostatic load was observed: being at either extreme end of the distribution of negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> increased the risk of physiological dysregulation. Allostatic load also increased with age, but the association between negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> and allostatic load remained stable over time. These results provide evidence for a more nuanced understanding of the role of negative emotions in long-term physical health...|$|R

It was hypothesized that those who provided a personal <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> would colour more features and would use a larger variety of colours than the participants who did not provide a personal <b>emotional</b> <b>response.</b> Describing a personal <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> led to overall differences in colour use in drawings.

40|$|Social {{media is}} {{becoming}} {{an important part of}} an organization's media strategy. This study examines the effects of trust and consumer <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to advertisements on brand evaluation in an online social media context. The study used a survey method, and the studied population consisted of 927 Brazilian social media users (Facebook subscribers). The results showed the following: (1) the <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to advertising on social media had a positive influence on brand evaluation; and (2) consumer trust had a positive influence on brand evaluation and <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to advertisements on social media. It is possible to conclude that consumer trust is the key variable to a positive <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to advertisements on social media and to a positive brand evaluation. Finally, this study demonstrates that companies must measure the <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> to advertising in their social media activities as a way of enhancing brand evaluation...|$|R
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous <b>emotional</b> <b>responses.</b> In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in <b>emotional</b> <b>responses.</b> Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} when using fMRI or PET to study <b>emotional</b> <b>responses.</b> Because fMRI measures changes in blood oxygenation, using the BOLD effect, its temporal resolution {{is limited by}} the haemodynamic response to several seconds.

50|$|The {{sense of}} {{presence}} in virtual reality is also {{linked to the}} triggering of <b>emotional</b> and physiological <b>response.</b> Research suggests that a strong presence can facilitate <b>emotional</b> <b>response,</b> and this <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> can further increase one's feeling of presence. Similarly, breaks in presence (or a loss {{in the sense of}} presence) can cause physiological changes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> of family members of physically restrained patients in the intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: The study subjects were 200 family members of ICU patients who had been on physical restraints in two university hospitals. Data were collected using the "Instrument of family's <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> toward physically restrained patients". Results: The mean score of familial <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> was 2. 69 out of a possible 5. The subcategory of acceptance was the highest with 3. 56 points followed by depression (3. 02), helplessness (2. 94), anxiety (2. 87), shock (2. 74), avoidance (2. 64), and grudge (2. 08). Multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that the age of family members, side effects of restraints, and information provision were the variables influencing on negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> of family. Conclusion: Family members showed slightly negative <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> toward the physical restraints. This finding could be influenced by their limited knowledge of the need for the restraints. Educational programs or fac...|$|R

50|$|The {{process model}} also divides these emotion {{regulation}} strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> is fully generated.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, Professor Frank Perri {{has argued}} that police {{interviews}} with Christopher Porco were seriously flawed because police questioning procedures seemingly failed to account for Porco's probable psychopathy. Psychopaths have unusual <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> and feel no remorse for their misdeeds, so standard police interview tactics are useless, as in the Porco case, where police failed to obtain any valuable information during questioning. According to Perri, police should study the Porco case to more productively interview potentially psychopathic suspects by using a non-confrontational approach rather than appealing to emotions.|$|E

The automatic evaluation of <b>emotional</b> <b>response,</b> or affect, is a fascinating challenge with many applications, including human-computer interaction, media tagging and human affect prediction. Our approach in addressing this problem {{is based on the}} inferred activity of facial muscles over time, as captured by a depth camera recording an individual's facial activity. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we constructed a database of publicly available short video clips, which elicit a strong <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> in a consistent manner across different individuals. Each video was tagged by its characteristic <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> along 4 scales: Valence, Arousal, Likability and Rewatch (the desire to watch again). The second contribution is a two-step prediction method, based on learning, which was trained and tested using this database of tagged video clips. Our method was able to successfully predict the aforementioned 4 dimensional representation of affect, as well as to identify the period of strongest <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> in the viewing recordings, in {{a method that}} is blind to the video clip being watch, revealing a significantly high agreement between the recordings of independent viewers...|$|R
