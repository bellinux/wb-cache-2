40|$|The views {{expressed}} {{here are not}} necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas or the Federal Reserve System. Thanks to Jeremy Nalewick for research assistance and to Jeffrey Fuhrer for insightful {{comments on an earlier}} draft. I consider an economy in which a fraction of contracts is renegotiated each period. In the spirit of Fischer (1977) and in contrast to Taylor (1979, 1980), Calvo (1983), and Fuhrer and Moore (1992, 1995 a,b), contracts specify a price path rather thana fixed price level. The aggregate price adjustment rule derived from these assumptions is an expectations-augmented Phillips curve with a built in "speed " or "Lipsey Loop " effect. The rule is consistent with the natural rate hypothesis and implies that <b>disinflations</b> are unambiguously contractionary. When supplemented with a specification of aggregate demand, the model can be used to find the money-supply path required to achieve a given desired path of the aggregate price level. Alternatively, the model can be used to find the aggregate-price-Ievel path implied by a given monetary policy. Policy-induced recessions can be quite persistent even when contracts are renegotiated frequently. For realistic parameter values, the model generates a liquidity effect: <b>disinflations</b> are initially accompanied by a rising short-term interest rate and a declining money supply...|$|R
