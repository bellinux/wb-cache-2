5|$|Monk seals are <b>earless</b> <b>seals</b> of {{the tribe}} Monachini. They are the only <b>earless</b> <b>seals</b> found in {{tropical}} climates. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian monk seal, Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the Caribbean monk seal, Neomonachus tropicalis, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{split from}} other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene. Their {{evolutionary}} link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of †Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, †Puijila {{had a long}} tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. The lineages of Otariidae (eared seals) and Odobenidae (walrus) split almost 28 mya. Phocids (<b>earless</b> <b>seals)</b> {{are known to have}} existed for at least 15 mya, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae (monk seals) and Phocinae lineages 22 mya.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the <b>earless</b> <b>seals</b> and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E

25|$|<b>Earless</b> <b>seals</b> sleep bihemispherically {{like most}} mammals, under water, hanging {{at the water}} surface or on land. They hold their breath while {{sleeping}} under water, and wake up regularly to surface and breathe. They can also hang with their nostrils above water and in that position have REM sleep, {{but they do not}} have REM sleep underwater.|$|E
25|$|Limbless {{animals can}} also move using pedal locomotary waves, {{rippling}} {{the underside of}} the body. This is the main method used by molluscs such as slugs and snails, and also large flatworms, some other worms, and even <b>earless</b> <b>seals.</b> The waves may move in the opposite direction to motion, known as retrograde waves, or {{in the same direction as}} motion, known as direct waves. Earthworms move by retrograde waves alternatively swelling and contracting down the length of their body, the swollen sections being held in place using setae. Aquatic molluscs such as limpets, which are sometimes out of the water, tend to move using retrograde waves. However terrestrial molluscs such as slugs and snails tend to use direct waves. Lugworms and seals also use direct waves.|$|E
500|$|Monk seals are <b>earless</b> <b>seals</b> (true seals) of {{the tribe}} Monachini. The tribe was first {{conceived}} by Victor Blanchard Scheffer in his 1958 book Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses: A Review of the Pinnipedia. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), the Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi), and the Caribbean monk seal (Neomonachus tropicalis), which became extinct in the 20th century. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when comparison of the species' mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences led biologists to place the Caribbean and Hawaiian species in a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E
50|$|This <b>earless</b> <b>seal's</b> former range {{extended}} {{throughout the}} Northwest Atlantic Africa, Mediterranean and Black Sea, coastlines, including all offshore {{islands of the}} Mediterranean, and into the Atlantic and its islands: Canary, Madeira, Ilhas Desertas, Porto Santo... as far west as the Azores. Vagrants could be found {{as far south as}} Gambia and the Cape Verde islands, and as far north as continental Portugal and Atlantic France.|$|R
2500|$|The {{harp seal}} or saddleback seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) is {{a species of}} <b>earless</b> <b>seal</b> native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean {{and parts of the}} Arctic Ocean. It now belongs to the {{monotypic}} genus Pagophilus. Its scientific name means [...] "ice-lover from Greenland", and its synonym, Phoca groenlandica means [...] "Greenland seal". Originally in the genus Phoca with a number of other species, it has since been reclassified into its own genus Pagophilus.|$|R
50|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of this <b>earless</b> <b>seal</b> include square fore flippers and thick bristles on its muzzle. Adults are greyish-brown in colour, darker on the back; rarely with a few faint spots on the back or dark spots on the sides. Occasionally the face and neck are reddish brown. Bearded seal pups are born with a greyish-brown natal fur with scattered patches of white {{on the back and}} head. The bearded seal is unique in the subfamily Phocinae in having two pairs of teats, a feature it shares with monk seals.|$|R
500|$|Monk seals {{are part}} of the family Phocidae (<b>earless</b> <b>seals),</b> the members of which are {{characterized}} by their lack of external ears, the inability to rotate the hind flippers under the body, and shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt. Monk seals as a whole vary minutely in size, with all adults measuring on average [...] and [...] They exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are slightly larger than females, {{with the exception of the}} Hawaiian monk seal where females are larger. Its white belly, gray coat, and slender physique distinguish it from the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), another earless seal. Much like elephant seals, they shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds (...) (from Latin pinna [...] "fin" [...] and pes, pedis [...] "foot"), {{commonly}} known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the <b>earless</b> <b>seals,</b> or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|The {{sea otter}} is the {{heaviest}} (the giant otter is longer, but significantly slimmer) {{member of the}} family Mustelidae, a diverse group that includes the 13 otter species and terrestrial animals such as weasels, badgers, and minks. It is unique among the mustelids in not making [...] or burrows, in having no functional anal scent glands, and in being able to live its entire life without leaving the water. The only member of the genus Enhydra, the sea otter is so different from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the <b>earless</b> <b>seals.</b> Genetic analysis indicates the sea otter and its closest extant relatives, which include the African speckle-throated otter, European otter, African clawless otter and oriental small-clawed otter, shared an ancestor approximately 5 million years ago (Mya).|$|E
50|$|Biodiversity of the estuary and gulf of Saint Lawrence River {{consists}} of an aquatic mammal wildlife, of which most goes upriver through the estuary and the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park until the Île d'Orléans (French for Orleans Island), such as the blue whale, the beluga, the minke whale and the harp <b>seal</b> (<b>earless</b> <b>seal).</b> Among the Nordic marine animals, there are two particularly important to cite: the walrus and the narwhal.Inland waters are populated by small to large fresh water fish, such as the largemouth bass, the American pickerel, the walleye, the Acipenser oxyrinchus, the muskellunge, the Atlantic cod, the Arctic char, the brook trout, the Microgadus tomcod (tomcod), the Atlantic salmon, the rainbow trout, etc.|$|R
50|$|The Caspian seal (Pusa caspica) {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} members of the <b>earless</b> <b>seal</b> family and unique in that it is found exclusively in the brackish Caspian Sea. They are found not only along the shorelines, but also on the many rocky islands and floating blocks of ice that dot the Caspian Sea. In winter, and cooler parts of the spring and autumn season, these marine mammals populate the Northern Caspian. As the ice melts in the warmer season, they {{can be found on the}} mouths of the Volga and Ural Rivers, as well as the southern latitudes of the Caspian where cooler waters can be found due to greater depth.|$|R
50|$|One {{problem at}} Lake Baikal is the {{introduction}} of pollutants into the ecosystem. Pesticides such as DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane, as well as industrial waste, mainly from the Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill, {{are thought to have}} been the cause of several disease epidemics among Baikal seal populations. The chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the Baikal seal's immune system, making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague, which was the cause of a serious Baikal seal epidemic that resulted in the deaths of thousands of animals in 1997 and 1999. Baikal seal pups have higher levels of DDT and PCB than known in any other population of European or Arctic <b>earless</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Among others, {{seals and}} whales {{belong to the}} aquatic mammals. Seals are grouped in <b>earless</b> <b>seals</b> and eared seals, which have solved the problem of {{sleeping}} in water differently. Eared seals, like whales, show unihemispheric sleep. The sleeping half of the brain does not awaken when they surface to breathe. When one half of a seal's brain shows slow-wave sleep, the flippers and whiskers on its opposite side are immobile. While in the water, these seals have almost no REM sleep and may go {{a week or two}} without it. As soon as they move onto land they switch to bilateral REM sleep and NREM sleep comparable to land mammals, surprising researchers with their lack of [...] "recovery sleep" [...] after missing so much REM.|$|E

50|$|The Baikal seal, Lake Baikal seal or nerpa (Pusa sibirica), is {{a species}} of <b>earless</b> <b>seal</b> endemic to Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia. Like the Caspian seal, it {{is related to the}} Arctic ringed seal. The Baikal seal is one of the {{smallest}} true seals and the only exclusively freshwater pinniped species. A subpopulation of inland harbour seals living in the Hudson's Bay region of Quebec, Canada (lac de loups marins harbour seals), the Saimaa ringed seal (a ringed seal subspecies) and the Ladoga seal (a ringed seal subspecies) are found in fresh water, but these are part of species that also have marine populations. It remains a scientific mystery how the seals originally came to Lake Baikal, hundreds of kilometers from any ocean.|$|R
25|$|While it was {{excellently}} {{adapted to}} swimming and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an <b>earless</b> <b>seal,</b> Baptorniss lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|R
25|$|The {{ringed seal}} (Pusa hispida or Phoca hispida), {{also known as}} the jar seal and as netsik or nattiq by the Inuit, is an <b>earless</b> <b>seal</b> (family: Phocidae) inhabiting the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The ringed seal is a {{relatively}} small seal, rarely greater than 1.5 m in length, with a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light grey rings, hence its common name. It is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the Northern Hemisphere: ranging throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific, and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland, and include two freshwater subspecies in northern Europe. Ringed seals are one of the primary prey of polar bears and have long been a component of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic.|$|R
