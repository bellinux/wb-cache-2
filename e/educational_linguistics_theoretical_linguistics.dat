40|$|This {{innovative}} volume {{provides a}} comprehensive integrated {{account of the}} study of conceptual figures, demonstrating the ways in which figures and in particular, conflictual figures, encapsulate linguistic expression in the fullest sense and in turn, how insights gleaned from their study can contribute to the wider body of linguistic research. With a specific focus on metaphor and metonymy, the book offers a unified and systematic typology of linguistic figures, drawing on a number of different approaches, including both traditional and emerging frameworks within cognitive linguistics as well as syntactic theory, while also providing an exhaustive look at the unique features of a variety of conceptual figures, including metaphor, metonymy, oxymoron, and synecdoche. In its aim of reconciling historically opposed theoretical approaches to the study of conflictual figures while also incorporating a thorough account of its distinctive varieties, this volume will be essential reading for researchers and scholars in cognitive <b>linguistics,</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>linguistics,</b> philosophy of language, and literary studies...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: {{general and}} {{computational}} pragmatics Pragmatics is {{the branch of}} linguistics that studies the relations between linguistic phenomena and aspects of the context of language use. To understand these relations is of crucial importance {{in many areas of}} <b>theoretical,</b> computational, and applied <b>linguistics.</b> In <b>theoretical</b> <b>linguistics,</b> the analysis of such phenomena as anaphora, deixis, and tense requires taking properties into account of the context in which expressions exhibiting these phenomena can be used. Utterances which are context-dependent in such ways are called indexical. Bar-Hillel (1954) has argued that indexicality is pervasive in natural language, and speculated that more than 90 % of all declarative utterances are indexical. Indexical expressions encode information about aspects of context: about objects introduced earlier in the discourse, about objects that form part of the physical and perceptual context, or about the (relative) tim...|$|R

Research in <b>theoretical</b> <b>linguistics,</b> computational linguistics and mathematical linguistics has delineated the ways natural language can be represented and modeled. Studies in cognitive (neuro) science, on the other hand, have shown how language processing is implemented in human cognitive machinery.

40|$|In 1959, Lucien Tesnière {{wrote his}} main work Éléments de syntaxe structurale. While {{the impact on}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>{{linguistic}}s</b> was not very strong at first, 50 years later there exist a variety of linguistic theories based on Tesnière's work. In computational <b>linguistics,</b> as in <b>theoretical</b> <b>linguistics,</b> dependency grammar was not very influential at first. The last 10 – 15 years, however, have brought a noticeable change and dependency grammar has {{found its way into}} computational linguistics. Syntactically annotated corpora based on dependency representations are available for a variety of languages, as well as statistical parsers which give a syntactic analysis of running text describing the underlying dependency relations between word tokens in the text. This article gives an overview of relevant areas of computational linguistics which have been influenced by dependency grammar. It discusses {{the pros and cons of}} different types of syntactic representation used in natural language processing and their suitability as representations of meaning. Finally, an attempt is made to give an outlook on the future impact of dependency grammar on computational linguistics...|$|R

40|$|Many {{theories}} of grammar and styles of grammar specification have stemmed from mathematical logic, computer science, and computational linguistics, {{and have been}} used for describing natural languages. By a series of constructions, we relate categorial, attribute and logic grammars via (axiomatic) labelled deductive systems, and extend this relation to accommodate unification-based grammars and so-called Montague Grammar. The axioms of a labelled deductive system {{can also be used to}} constrain the proof search by automatically generating an LR parser from them; we describe the implementation of such a parser-generator. Furthermore, we show how a modification of the LR parsing algorithm, plus the (meta-level) information contained in the axioms, can be used to parse a grammar specification which is based on procedural rather than combinatorial properties of the language. 1 Introduction Many {{theories of}} grammar have been proposed in <b>theoretical</b> <b>linguistics,</b> computational linguistics, com [...] ...|$|R
