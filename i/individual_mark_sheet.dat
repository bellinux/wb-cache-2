40|$|The Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE) {{format is}} used during {{practical}} examinations {{as part of}} the physiotherapy undergraduate curriculum at the University of the Witwatersrand. Various factors influence inter-examiner reliability and investigating the inter-examiner reliability when using the OSPE can lead to improvement of the examination process. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish inter-examiner reliability when using the OSPE <b>mark</b> <b>sheet.</b> Methods: Twelve examiners participated in this study. Thirty-three second year PT students were examined at six stations and by two examiners at each station. The Spearman’s correlation test was used to establish inter-examiner reliability. Results: The general inter-examiner reliability of the OSPE <b>mark</b> <b>sheet</b> was high. There was a high correlation between examiners who had the same level of experience (r= 0. 79 to r= 0. 93; p< 0. 001). The background knowledge section of the OSPE <b>mark</b> <b>sheet</b> showed the greatest inter-examiner reliability (r= 0. 75 to r= 0. 91; p< 0. 001). Discussion: In general, a high inter-examiner reliability was found. Examiners with the same level of experience seemed to generally have better inter-examiner reliability when using the OSPE <b>mark</b> <b>sheet.</b> Furthermore, a well-described, operationalised list of micro-skills also improved inter-examiner reliability. Conclusion: The OSPE <b>mark</b> <b>sheet</b> aids inter-examiner reliability. The use of this method of examination should be encouraged...|$|R

5000|$|Marking in OSCEs {{is done by}} the examiner. Occasionally written stations, for example, {{writing a}} {{prescription}} chart, are used and these are marked like written examinations, again usually using a standardized <b>mark</b> <b>sheet.</b> One of the ways an OSCE is made objective is by having a detailed mark scheme and standard set of questions. For example, a station concerning the demonstration to a simulated patient on how to use a metered dose inhaler MDI would award points for specific actions which are performed safely and accurately. The examiner can often vary the marks depending on how well the candidate performed the step. At the end of the <b>mark</b> <b>sheet,</b> the examiner often has a small number of marks that they can use to weight the station depending on performance and if a simulated patient is used, then they are often asked to add marks depending on the candidates approach. At the end, the examiner is often asked to give a [...] "global score". This is usually used as a subjective score based on the candidates overall performance, not taking into account how many marks the candidate scored. The examiner is usually asked to rate the candidate as pass/borderline/fail or sometimes as excellent/good/pass/borderline/fail. This is then used to determine the <b>individual</b> pass <b>mark</b> for the station.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In today’s world {{security}} of data {{is an important}} issue. Nowadays the forgery of legal documents is increasing at an alarming rate. To solve this problem, we provide an innovative way to authenticate the legal document (<b>mark</b> <b>sheet).</b> In this paper, we provide a method where each legal document (<b>mark</b> <b>sheet)</b> will come with a QR code. Each QR code will contain the unique details of the document which will be encoded using AES algorithm. So, if anyone tries to change the data he cannot do it because the encryption key is not known to him. The data can be retrieved using unique key.

50|$|Most {{universities}} have clinical skills labs where {{students have the}} opportunity to practice clinical skills such as taking blood or mobilizing patients in a safe and controlled environment. It is often very helpful to practise in small groups with colleagues, setting a typical OSCE scenario and timing it with one person role playing a patient, one person doing the task and if possible, one person either observing and commenting on technique or even role playing the examiner using a sample <b>mark</b> <b>sheet.</b> Many OSCE textbooks have sample OSCE stations and <b>mark</b> <b>sheets</b> that can be helpful when studying in the manner. In doing this the candidate is able to get a feel of running to time and working under pressure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Supervisors {{are often}} {{involved}} {{in the assessment of}} projects they have supervised themselves. Previous research suggests that detailed <b>marking</b> <b>sheets</b> may alleviate leniency and halo effects. We set out to determine if, despite using such a marking schedule, leniency and halo effects were evident in the supervisors' marking of undergraduate short research projects (special study modules (SSM)). Methods Review of grades awarded by supervisors, second markers and control markers to the written reports of 4 th year medical students who had participated in an SSM during two full academic years (n = 399). Paired t-tests were used to compare mean marks, Pearson correlation to look at agreement between marks and multiple linear regression to test the prediction of one mark from several others adjusted for one another. Results There was a highly significant difference of approximately half a grade between supervisors and second markers with supervisors marking higher. (t = 3. 12, p Conclusions This study shows that with the use of structured <b>marking</b> <b>sheet</b> for assessment of undergraduate medical students, supervisors marks are not associated with a halo effect, but leniency does occur. As supervisor assessment is becoming more common in both under graduate and postgraduate teaching new ways to improve objectivity in marking and to address the leniency of supervisors should be sought. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{relationships}} between {{movements of the}} meadow brown butterfly (Maniola jurtina) and landscape features were examined at different scales in three hedgerow network landscapes of western France. Of the 4174 and 1474 <b>individuals</b> <b>marked</b> in the three landscapes in 1998 and 1999 respectively, a total of 1057 and 285 were recaptured at least once. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to model the number of butterflies moving between herbaceous patches within the landscape. The model predictors were related to (i) the distance separating the patches, (ii) {{the characteristics of the}} landscape between the patches and (iii) the characteristics of the departure and arrival patches, including the number of <b>individuals</b> <b>marked</b> in each patch. Site effects were tested by fitting separate models on each site and scale effects were tested by varying the extent of the windows in which landscape variables were extracted. The fits yielded models with R 2 values ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 64. Whatever the site, the distance between both patches and the number of <b>individuals</b> <b>marked</b> in the departure patch, exhibited significant and consistent effects on butterfly movements. Mean field size and direction of green network elements (hedges, field margins) were also relevant in some cases...|$|R
