5000|$|The opening {{ceremony}} of the 1984 Summer Olympics at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum boasted the single, biggest card stunt at the time. 85,000 spectators found colored cards {{in their seats}} (which had been preassigned by computer); {{and at one point}} the ceremony, just before the various national delegations marched in, all 85,000 spectators flashed their cards to form supposedly all the flags of the nations in attendance. [...] However, there is question today whether 140 flags were indeed flashed because only 87 sections at that time could actually accommodate only 87 <b>flag</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, {{while working}} in adult education, {{he was able to}} resume vexillology and {{contacted}} Whitney Smith, the foremost American flag expert and [...] "father" [...] of the international vexillological movement. In 1967 Smith held a meeting in London at which Crampton met others devoted to flags, including Ted Barraclough, then editor of the standard British reference book Flags of the World. The meeting was Crampton's launching pad. Active in the <b>Flag</b> <b>Section</b> of the Heraldry Society, he edited its newsletter from its introduction in 1969. In 1971 he formed the Flag Institute and became its director, with Barraclough as chairman. The newsletter became the Institute's journal Flagmaster. In the same year, at the Fourth International Congress of Vexillology in Turin, Italy, the Flag Institute joined the FIAV and successfully proposed that the 1973 Congress be held in London.|$|E

He was {{also a member of the}} <b>flag</b> <b>section</b> of the University of Texas Longhorn Band and played bassoon in the UT Wind Ensemble and Concert Band. He left the University in 1983 and went to work for the Internal Revenue Service's Austin Service Center with his wife, Brenda, whom he had married the same year. The two had a son, Nathan, in 1986. Lee and Brenda both worked at the IRS until 1993, when Lee joined Apogee Software's technical support department. He was promoted to the Music and Sound Director position in 1996. His wife, Brenda, is still employed with the IRS, working at the agency's office in Dallas.|$|E

In 1958, the Blue Devils added glockenspiels, becoming a drum and bell corps, while the girls became a separate a baton twirling troupe, the Majorettes.

25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red <b>flags</b> <b>section</b> for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{implemented}} an FPGA {{version of}} an algorithm used in the deduplication of backup storage data, to compare its performance to a software implementation of the algorithm. This algorithm <b>flags</b> <b>sections</b> of data with identifiers called "anchors". "Anchors" can be compared across versions of backup data, and if "anchors" are identical, sections of data are unchanged with high probability and might {{not have to be}} re-written to the backup disk. I also designed and implemented the environment by which this algorithm would communicate with a host computer. This environment can also easily be adapted for the acceleration of other shifting window algorithms. I tested the algorithm in simulation to verify its results as well as to estimate the speed at which the algorithm could process data. by Amy Ancilla Wibowo. Thesis (M. Eng.)
