5|$|Sasuke was {{conceived}} as a rival to the series' title character, Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's darker character development in later parts of the story, Kishimoto avoided making Sasuke an evil person. Sasuke's design challenged Kishimoto as <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> manga, but he has since grown to greatly enjoy drawing him. In the animated adaptations of the manga, Sasuke has been voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
5|$|Ferens also intervened {{on behalf}} of his {{constituency}} and its inhabitants. In April 1913 <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> attention of the Postmaster-General to the case of a post office sorting-clerk who was having difficulties claiming his pension. On 10 August 1916, after a fatal raid by a Zeppelin in the early of the previous morning, against which the city had been able to muster only a single searchlight and one gun, he asked that adequate defences be provided and brought to action where necessary.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1968–1969, Jens Juncker-Jensen went even further with an {{excellent}} exhibition Fotografiet som udtryksmiddel (Photography {{as a means of}} expression) for which <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> very best material from the few photographic books of the time, attracting not only professional and amateur photographers but also architects and television producers. It provided a basis for six TV programmes over the following months. There was, however, little real discussion of photography as an art form.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Small forward Jimmy McDonnell, from Jackson, New Jersey, {{joined the}} team on August 11, 2010. In {{his senior season}} at Jackson Memorial High School, McDonnell {{averaged}} 13.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.0 blocks per game as Jackson Memorial compiled a 16–8 record. McDonnell was selected for the first team all-Division in the A-Shore Conference, and was {{the most valuable player}} at the WOBM Holiday Classic. McDonnell was originally headed to Division II UMass Lowell, but after a strong performance at the West Virginia HoopGroup JamFest, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> attention of Owls coach Fran Dunphy. McDonnell redshirted the season to add bulk to his frame.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the pitching staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> ire of Phillies fans, who were tired of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested he should be traded to another team.|$|E
5|$|He next {{headed to}} Melbourne for the 2014 Australian Open, where <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> world No. 112, Go Soeda of Japan. Despite worries {{that he was}} not match-fit, Murray got off to a strong start, {{dispatching}} the Japanese number 2 in under 90 minutes, losing just 5 games in the process. He next went on to defeat Vincent Millot and Feliciano López respectively in straight sets. In the fourth round, Murray dropped his first set of the tournament on his way to beating Stephane Robert in four sets to set up a meeting with long-standing rival Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. Despite saving two match points to take the third set, he ultimately went out in four, ending his streak of four consecutive Australian Open semifinals. As a result of losing before the final, Murray fell to No. 6 in the world, falling out of the top 5 {{for the first time since}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> {{first issue}} (Sept. 1966) {{of a new}} Flash Gordon comic book series, {{published}} by King Features. Williamson's work received positive reader response, and returned to draw issues #4–5 (March and May 1967), {{as well as the}} cover of #3 (Jan. 1967). Williamson received a National Cartoonist Society Best Comic Book art award for his work on that title. In 1967, on the strength of a backup feature he had done in the Flash Gordon book, he took over another Alex Raymond creation, the long-running Secret Agent X-9 comic strip, collaborating with writer Goodwin. At the start of their tenure, the title was changed to Secret Agent Corrigan.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Captain G. H. Halliday's D Company moved southwards against Post 19. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> defenders' {{attention}} with a demonstration by one platoon {{in front of}} the post {{while the rest of the}} company moved around the post and attacked silently from the rear. This maneuver took the defenders by surprise and D Company captured the post—and 73 prisoners—at 0230. Halliday repeated this tactic against Post 14, which was taken at 0400 with 64 prisoners. Capturing the two posts cost one Australian killed and seven wounded. A third attempt against Post 17 failed: the previous attacks had alerted the post and D Company came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire. A furious battle raged until the post fell shortly before dawn. Another 103 Italians were captured at a cost of two Australians killed and nine wounded. Between casualties and men detached as prisoner escorts, D Company strength fell to 46 men, and Halliday elected to halt for the night.|$|E
5|$|The Chongqing model {{provided}} an alternate development paradigm that diverged from the policies preferred {{by those in}} the national leadership seen as favouring further reform such as Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. Bo's leadership in Chongqing dramatically raised his profile, both nationally and internationally. In 2010, he was named {{as one of the}} 'World's 100 Most Influential People in 2010' by Time. Observers noted that, in China's non-electoral political system, Bo's high-profile presence and bold political maneuvers essentially amounted to a public 'election campaign' for the top leadership. However, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> ire of some of the country's leaders; President Hu and Premier Wen were reluctant to acknowledge Bo publicly, ostensibly due to a discomfort over his leadership style.|$|E
5|$|Warhop {{was born}} in Hinton, West Virginia. He spent his early life working as a coal miner for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Warhop played for local semi-professional teams {{sponsored}} by the railway company. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> attention of several minor league teams, and in 1906, Warhop signed with the Class-D Freeport Pretzels of the Wisconsin–Illinois League in 1906 to start his professional career. His debut campaign included a no-hitter on Independence Day against the La Crosse Pinks. From 1906 to 1908, Warhop had an 82–20 win–lost record and 330 strikeouts, with a career high 30 wins in 1907. After pitching to a 29–7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909, people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability. As many as a dozen teams were interested in Warhop, and he signed a $1,000 contract ($ in today's dollars) with the Detroit Tigers. However, they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|This {{game was}} {{designed}} at Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R) division, while the programming was {{handled by the}} external company Intelligent Systems (known as Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena at the time). The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because the peripheral's Disk Card media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer's (and NES's) console's cartridges. Combined with the possibility to store the players' progress, the floppy disk format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa's debut as a video game designer, {{and he was the}} only staff member working on the game {{at the beginning of the}} project. Osawa (credited in the U.S. version as Inusawa) intended to make Light Myth: Palutena's Mirror an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems. After Nintendo's action-adventure Metroid had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena.|$|E
