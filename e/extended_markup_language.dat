40|$|A <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> {{serves as}} a medium of {{communication}} for storing and publishing textual, numeric {{and other forms of}} data seamlessly. XML, the eXtensible <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> has become the lingua franca in web publishing. It is also a widely accepted standard for databases and document storage. There are many domain-specific <b>markup</b> <b>languages</b> designed using special XML tag sets. Standardization bodies and research communities may extend these to include additional semantics of areas within and related to the domain. This paper outlines the issues to be considered when <b>extending</b> domain-specific <b>markup</b> <b>languages,</b> namely, the motivation for extension, the semantic considerations, the syntactic constraints and other relevant aspects. Illustrating examples are given from the domains of Medicine, Finance and Materials Science. Particular emphasis in these examples is on the extension of the Materials Science <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> MatML to include the semantics of one sub-area, namely, the Heat Treating of Materials. The focus of this paper however is not the design of one particular language but rather the generic issues involved in <b>extending</b> domainspecific <b>markup</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reconfigurable {{system is}} desired in {{measurement}} applcation for low-cost products and short time to market. In this paper, we propose a software architecture of dynamical reconfigrualbe virtual instrument, which {{is built on}} component based array. In our architecture, the measurement system software is viewed as an integration {{of a set of}} reusable components, which are modelled with a set of event-based extern interfaces, internal interfaces for modifing own properties, a data process logic for executing own behavioural specifications and a series of communication ports for data exchange with others. The behaviours of the measurement system software can be viewed as an integration of components and their interactions, which is based on <b>Extend</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XVIML). XVIML based dynamical interpreter and components based reassembled model are introduced to implement reassemble. The software can be easily reconfigured by changing reusable components and their interactions to adapt to the changing application requirements. Finally, a reconfigurable measurement platform based on above software architecture for testing engineering signal has been developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{automated}} {{extraction of}} semantic chemical {{data from the}} existing literature is demonstrated. For reasons of copyright, the work {{is focused on the}} patent literature, though the methods are expected to apply equally to other areas of the chemical literature. Hearst Patterns are applied to the patent literature in order to discover hyponymic relations describing chemical species. The acquired relations are manually validated to determine the precision of the determined hypernyms (85. 0 %) and of the asserted hyponymic relations (94. 3 %). It is demonstrated that the system acquires relations that are not present in the ChEBI ontology, suggesting that it could function as a valuable aid to the ChEBI curators. The relations discovered by this process are formalised using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to enable re-use. PatentEye - an automated system for the extraction of reactions from chemical patents and their conversion to Chemical <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (CML) - is presented. Chemical patents published by the European Patent Office over a ten-week period are used to demonstrate the capability of PatentEye - 4444 reactions are extracted with a precision of 78 % and recall of 64 % with regards to determining the identity and amount of reactants employed and an accuracy of 92 % with regards to product identification. NMR spectra are extracted from the text using OSCAR 3, which is developed to greatly increase recall. The resulting system is presented as a significant advancement towards the large-scale and automated extraction of high-quality reaction information. <b>Extended</b> Polymer <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (EPML), a CML dialect for the description of Markush structures as they are presented in the literature, is developed.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>eXtended</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XML) {{has emerged}} in the Internet world as a {{standard}} representation format, which can be useful to describe and transmit management information. However, XML formats alone do not give formal semantics to it. To solve this question, ontology languages based on the Resource Description Framework {{can be used to}} improve the expressiveness of the management information specifications. This paper presents an approach that uses an XML-based ontology language to define network and system management information. For this, the structures of the Web Ontology Language known as OWL are analyzed and compared to those used in management definitions, studying also the advantages that ontology languages can provide in this area...|$|E
