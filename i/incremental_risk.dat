BYOD involves an employee of an organisation using their own mobile devices to access their organisations network. Several <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> will arise {{as a result of}} adoption of a BYOD program by an organisation. The research aims to assist organisations to identify what <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> they could potentially encounter if they adopt a BYOD program and how they can use a framework like COBIT 5 {{in order to reduce the}} <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> to an acceptable level. By means of an extensive literature review the study revealed 50 <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> which arise as a result of the adoption of a BYOD program. COBIT 5 was identified as the most appropriate framework which could be used to map the <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> against. Possible safeguards were identified from the mapping process which would reduce the <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> to an acceptable level. It was identified that 13 of the 37 COBIT 5 processes were applicable for the study...|$|R

By contrast, a nondiversifier who is averse ro independent risk increases may nonetheless strictly prefer certain mean-preserving increases in risk.

25|$|<b>Incremental</b> health <b>risk</b> is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of <b>incremental</b> health <b>risk</b> is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small <b>incremental</b> health <b>risk</b> from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|R
50|$|IT asset {{management}} (also called IT inventory management) {{is an important}} part of an organization's strategy. It usually involves gathering detailed hardware and software inventory information which is then used to make decisions about hardware and software purchases and redistribution.

Nonetheless, no large epidemiological study in patients with CKD has been conducted to investigate the interaction and joint effect of hyperphosphatemia and higher ALP levels on mortality. We analyzed 11, 912 maintenance hemodialysis patients from January 2005 to December 2010. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of death were calculated for different categories of serum phosphorus and ALP using the Cox regression model.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} contemporary air dispersion {{modeling and}} health risk assessment methodologies applied to alumina refineries and to summa-rize recent results. Methods: Air dispersion models using emission source and meteorological data {{have been used}} to assess ground-level concentra-tions (GLCs) of refinery emissions. Short-term (1 -hour and 24 -hour average) GLCs and annual averageGLCs {{have been used to}} assess acute health, chronic health, and <b>incremental</b> carcinogenic <b>risks.</b> Results: The acute hazard index can exceed 1 close to refineries, but it is typically less than 1 at neighbor-ing residential locations. The chronic hazard index is typically substantially less than 1. The <b>incremental</b> carcinogenic <b>risk</b> is typically less than 10 − 6. Conclusions: The risks of acute health effects are adequately controlled, and the risks of chronic health effects and <b>incremental</b> carcinogenic <b>risks</b> are negligible around referenced alumina refineries. H ealth risk assessments (HRAs) based on air dispersion model-ing of alumina refinery emissions have proved useful to assess and communicate risks.

40|$|The recent <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> charge {{addition}} to the Basel (1996) market risk amend- ment requires banks to estimate, separately, the default and migration risk of their trading portfolios that are exposed to credit risk. The new regulation requires the total regulatory charges for trading books to be computed as {{the sum of the}} market risk capi- tal and the <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> charge for credit risk. In contrast to Basel II models for the banking book no model is prescribed and banks can use internal models for calculating the <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> charge. In the calculation of <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> charges a key compo- nent is the choice of the liquidity horizon for traded credits. In this paper we explore the e¤ect of the liquidity horizon on the <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> charge. Speci�cally we consider a sample of 28 bonds with di¤erent rating and liquidity horizons to evaluate the impact of the choice of the liquidity horizon for a certain rating class of credits. We �find that choosing the liquidity horizon for a particular credit there are two important effects that needs to be considered. Firstly, for bonds with short liquidity horizons there is a miti- gation effect of preventing the bond from further downgrades by trading it frequently. Secondly, there is the possibility of multiple defaults. Of these two effects the multiple default effect will generally be more pronounced for non investment grade credits as the probability of default is severe even for short liquidity periods. For medium investment grade credits these two effects will in general o¤set and the <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> charge will be approximately the same across liquidity horizons. For high quality investment grade credits the effect of the multiple defaults is low for short liquidity horizons as the frequent trading effectively prevents severe downgrades. ...|$|E

Also required in the model is the transition matrix with probabilities of migrating between different credit states, which is measured by historical data from Moody´s rating institute. Several sensitivity analyses and stress tests are then made by generating different scenarios and running them in the model and the results of these tests are compared to a base case.

METHODS: A retrospective database analysis of AHRQ’s Health Care Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample databases was conducted spanning from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2005.

5000|$|An {{application}} of micromorts is measuring {{the value that}} humans place on risk: for example, one can consider {{the amount of money}} one would have to pay a person to get him or her to accept a one-in-a-million chance of death (or conversely the amount that someone might be willing to pay to avoid a one-in-a-million chance of death). When put thus, people claim a high number but when inferred from their day-to-day actions (e.g., how much they {{are willing to pay for}} safety features on cars) a typical value is around $50 (in 2009). [...] However utility functions are often not linear, i.e. the more a person has already spent on their safety the less they are willing to spend to further increase their safety. Therefore, the $50 valuation should not be taken to mean that a human life (1 million micromorts) is valued at $50,000,000. Furthermore, the local linearity of any utility curve means that the micromort is useful for small <b>incremental</b> <b>risks</b> and rewards, not necessarily for large risks.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} define what <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> of very late stent {{thrombosis}} (VLST) in drug-eluting stents (DES) would outweigh the restenosis benefit. BackgroundAlthough there are robust data on the restenosis benefit of DES versus bare-metal stents (BMS), the <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> of stent thrombosis, a rare but serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is not known with certainty. MethodsWe developed a decision analytic Markov model comparing DES versus BMS strategies for a contemporary PCI population. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality data from published reports were used to derive the model probabilities. Over a range of <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> and duration of risk of VLST, we identified the net benefit of DES versus BMS in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). ResultsUnder an assumption of equal stent thrombosis rates beyond 1 year, the DES strategy was superior to BMS in terms of QALE (16. 262 vs. 16. 248 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], difference = 0. 014). Under the alternative assumption of an <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> difference of 0. 13 %/year, the net benefit was substantially reduced (difference = 0. 001 QALYs). The threshold excess risk of very late DES thrombosis compared with BMS, above which BMS would be the preferred strategy, was 0. 14 %/year (over 4 years of follow-up). This threshold increased as the population risk of restenosis increased and decreased as the vulnerable time window lengthened. ConclusionsA small absolute increase in DES thrombosis compared with BMS after 1 year (> 0. 14 %/year) would result in BMS being the preferred strategy for the overall PCI population. Larger clinical trials with longer follow-up are needed to estimate the risk of late stent thrombosis with greater certainty for existing and new DES...|$|E
40|$|Although {{survival}} after {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting (CABG) {{is the most serious}} outcome information, {{the quality of life in}} living patients is largely determined by the freedom from ischemic events. The return of angina, acute myocardial infarct and sudden death were studied in a large (n = 5880) population of patients undergoing CABG between 1971 and 1987. The freedom from angina pectoris was 95 %, 83 % and 63 % at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively, after surgery. Early return of angina was related to both procedure <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> factors (incomplete revascularization and non-use of the internal mammary (thoracic) artery (IMA) as a conduit) and patient <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> factors (aggressiveness of the atherosclerotic process and severity of preCABG symptoms). Late angina return was related to patient risk factors including coexisting factors (hyperlipidemia and hypertension), preCABG symptom severity and gender (female). The freedom from an acute fatal or non-fatal postCABG myocardial infarct was 99 %, 96 % and 85 % at 1, 5 and 10 years after surgery. The <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> factors for early infarction were related to incomplete revascularization, but late infarction was related to lipid levels, coexisting diseases (diabetes, positive family history) and non-use of IMA to LAD. The freedom from sudden death was 99. 8 %, 99 % and 97 % at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively, after surgery. The <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> factors were dominated by the severity of the left ventricular dysfunction. The freedom from any ischemic event (any of the previous three) was 93 %, 79 % and 54 % at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively, after surgery. The <b>incremental</b> <b>risk</b> factors included all those cited above for the specific components. Patient-specific predictions validate the influences of these risk factors. They demonstrate that unlike the profound influence of the use of the IMA on survival, there is little benefit of the use of the IMA on return of ischemic events over and above the effect of revascularization per se. The study demonstrates that most patients will experience return of ischemic symptoms within a period of 15 - 20 years after surgery, but that this is most likely to be return of angina and rarely sudden death. status: publishe...|$|E
