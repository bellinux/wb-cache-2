Without control over facial appearance, screening perspective, illumination circumstances, occlusions, background, expression, hairstyles, in the video quality is exaggerated and image contains noise pixels and Face data in different angle cannot be recognized.

In this paper we present a <b>dual</b> <b>course</b> of action, at first annotate a video with excellent pretense extraction using Fuzzy Local Information C-Means (FLICM) Clustering Algorithm. This approach is used to fuzzy local gray level quantify resemblance, aiming to assure noise insensitiveness and image detail preservation.

40|$|The title compound, C 15 H 16 N 2 O 5, {{belongs to}} the class of monastrol-type {{anti-cancer}} agents and was selected for crystal structure determination {{in order to determine}} the conformational details needed for subsequent structure&# 8211;activity relationship studies. The central tetrahydropyrimidine ring has a flat-envelope conformation. The 4 -phenyl group occupies a pseudo-axial position and is inclined at an angle of ca 90 &# 176; to the mean plane of the heterocyclic ring. Of the two methyl ester groups, one (in the 5 -position) is in a coplanar and the other (in the 6 -position) in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the heterocyclic plane. The coplanar 5 -ester group has its carbonyl bond oriented cis with respect to the pyrimidine C=C double bond. By comparison of the structural results for the present compound with those determined previously for its diethyl analogue, we have identified the molecular factors which control the <b>dual</b> <b>course</b> of the Biginelli reaction with salicylaldehyde. The crystal structure is dominated by two hydrogen bonds which link the molecules into chains of dimers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} future {{role of a}} more {{holistic}} and integrated approach {{to the design of}} architecture in landscape. Many of the design exploration and presentation techniques presently used by particular design professions do not lend themselves to an inherently collaborative design strategy.   Within contemporary digital environments, there are increasing opportunities to explore and evaluate design proposals which integrate both architectural and landscape aspects. The production of integrated design solutions exploring buildings and their surrounding context is now possible through the design development of shared 3 -D and 4 -D virtual environments, in which buildings no longer float in space.   The scope of landscape design has expanded through the application of techniques such as GIS allowing interpretations that include social, economic and environmental dimensions. In architecture, for example, object-oriented CAD environments now make it feasible to integrate conventional modelling techniques with analytical evaluations such as energy calculations and lighting simulations. These were all ambitions of architects and landscape designers in the 70 s when computer power restricted the successful implementation of these ideas. Instead, the commercial trend at that time moved towards isolated specialist design tools in particular areas. Prior to recent innovations in computing, the closely related disciplines of architecture and landscape have been separated through the unnecessary development, in our view, of their own symbolic representations, and the subsequent computer applications. This has led to an unnatural separation between what were once closely related disciplines.   Significant increases in the performance of computers are now making it possible to move on from symbolic representations towards more contextual and meaningful representations. For example, the application of realistic materials textures to CAD-generated building models can then be linked to energy calculations using the chosen materials. It is now possible for a tree to look like a tree, to have leaves and even to be botanicaly identifiable. The building and landscape can be rendered from a common database of digital samples taken from the real world. The complete model may be viewed in a more meaningful way either through stills or animation, or better still, through a total simulation of the lifecycle of the design proposal. The model may also be used to explore environmental/energy considerations and changes in the balance between the building and its context most immediately through the growth simulation of vegetation but also {{as part of a larger}} planning model.  The Internet has a key role to play in facilitating this emerging collaborative design process. Design professionals are now able via the net to work on a shared model and to explore and test designs through the development of VRML, JAVA, whiteboarding and video conferencing. The end product may potentially be something that can be more easily viewed by the client/user. The ideas presented in this paper form the basis for the development of a <b>dual</b> <b>course</b> in landscape and architecture. This will create new teaching opportunities for exploring the design of buildings and sites through the shared development of a common computer model...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of productivity in the P- 16 system of education, emphasizing the repetition of the {{senior year of high}} school with the first year of postsecondary education. This study analyzes this integration through <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses</b> in the context of both P- 12 and higher education reform in Kentucky. An analysis of these factors is critical in light of the deregulation of dual credit in Kentucky since 2000 and the increased enrollment of high school students in college courses both nationally and in Kentucky. <b>Dual</b> credit <b>courses</b> in Kentucky community and technical colleges are evaluated based on the learning productivity in transition from secondary to postsecondary education for students according to their gender, race, residence, socio-economic status, high school performance, and a student preparation for college. The design incorporates methods prevalent from the literature in research conducted on dual credit programs. Student performance in <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses</b> is the criterion variable, while high school performance and preparation for college are the primary predictor variables. Gender, race, residence, and socio-economic status are examined as demographic variables. The population for this research includes high school students taking <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses</b> in Kentucky community colleges and technical colleges. The sample extracted from the Kentucky Community and Technical College System database consists of high school students admitted with ACT placement scores in English and mathematics to Kentucky community and technical colleges in the Fall 2000, Spring 2001, Fall 2001, and Spring 2002 semesters (N = 3, 822). Chi-square was used to evaluate the change in student participation in <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses</b> by demographic variable. Multivariate multiple regression was used to predict the factors that influence performance in dual credit programs. The results indicated no significant changes in the proportion of students from each demographic variable taking <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses,</b> despite a significant increase in the overall numbers of students taking these courses from Fall 2000 to Fall 2001. The results of the regression analysis indicated that demographic variables such as gender, race, residence, and socio-economic status significantly predict, both at the multivariate and univariate level, student achievement in <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses.</b> The demographic variables of gender and residence were the most consistent predictors of the criterion variables, however, high school preparation, as measured by the ACT English subtest was the strongest predictor of student performance in <b>dual</b> credit <b>courses...</b>|$|R
