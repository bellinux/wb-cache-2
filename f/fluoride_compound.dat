The most common <b>fluoride</b> <b>compound</b> used in mouth rinse is neutral sodium fluoride. Fluoride mouth rinses range from 0.05% to 0.2% (225-1,000 ppm) in concentration.

Fluoride at these concentrations is not strong enough for people {{at high risk for}} tooth decay. Regular use of a daily (230 ppm) or weekly (900 ppm) fluoride mouth rinse under supervision results into a reduction of tooth decay in children’s permanent teeth. [...] After a fluoride mouthrinse treatment, the fluoride in the mouthrinse is retained in the saliva which helps prevent tooth decay.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{major reason}} for decline in dental caries across globe is because of {{widespread}} use of fluoride dentifrices. For a fluoride dentifrice {{to be effective in}} the control of dental caries, an adequate concentration of the fluoride must be soluble. Objective: To assess soluble fluoride and total fluoride content in selected commercial dentifrices in Davangere. Materials and Methods: The soluble fluoride and total fluoride content in six selected commercial dentifrices in Davangere were assessed and expressed as ppm of fluoride (F) (mgF/g). Total fluoride and soluble fluoride was determined using an ion-specific electrode. Descriptive statistics applied to assess the mean total fluoride and soluble fluoride. Results: The total fluoride and soluble fluoride concentrations were approximately near to 1, 000 ppm.

The aldehyde and the fluoride were determined to have the trans while the chloride to have the cis for the high energy form. From the potential surface scan and transition states optimization, the gauche to trans barrier was predicted to increase in the order: chloride> fluoride> aldehyde.

Using established methodology, the fluoride containing alloy was evaluated in the laboratory for fluoride release, enamel uptake and solubility, strength, hardness, flow, dimensional change, corrosion resistance, and marginal leakage. Clinically, 98 pairs of test and control restorations were placed and evaluated for marginal adaptation, surface characteristics, and recurrent caries. The results indicate that the fluoride containing alloy meets the ADA specifications for amalgam alloys, though the strength properties of the amalgam are reduced.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the influence of two different fluoride compounds and an in vitro pellicle on KOH-soluble fluoride formation - its retention and resistance to toothbrushing. Material and methods. Forty bovine incisors were randomly assigned to four groups (A-D). Of five samples prepared per tooth, one remained untreated and served as a baseline control. Groups A and B were pretreated with artificial saliva and groups C and D with human saliva. Groups A and C were treated with amine fluoride and groups B and D with sodium fluoride. After treatment, samples were brushed with 25, 50, and 75 brushing strokes. The amount of KOH-soluble fluoride formed on the enamel samples was measured at baseline, after application, and after 25, 50, and 75 brushing strokes. Fluoride uptake was calculated by unpaired t-tests and fluoride retention by paired t-tests. Results. No statistically significant differences in the KOH-soluble fluoride uptake of the groups that were pretreated (A vs B and C vs D) or treated equally (A vs C and B vs D) were observed. Retention of the KOH-soluble fluoride in the brushed samples was higher when the samples were pretreated with human saliva and treated with sodium fluoride than when the samples were pretreated with artificial saliva and treated with sodium fluoride.
