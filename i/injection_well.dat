The Ohio Department of Natural Resources explained their reasons for closing the Northstar 1 deep <b>injection</b> <b>well,</b> [...] "one of 177 operational Class II deep injection wells which primarily dispose {{of oil and gas}} fluid waste deep underground using high pressure.(Ohio: Disposal Wells) Since March 2011, the Youngstown area [...] "experienced 12 low-magnitude seismic events along a previously unknown fault line. These events ranged from 2.1- to 4.0-magnitude and were recorded by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ (ODNR) Ohio Seismic Network (OhioSeis).... The 2011 earthquakes are distinct from previous seismic activity in the region because of their proximity to a Class II deep <b>injection</b> <b>well,</b> known as the Northstar 1 well.

In this study, in order to postpone the shut-in time of producing wells, increase oil displacement, and enhance production efficiency, production and <b>injection</b> <b>wells</b> capabilities with respect to their position in the reservoir were studied by using the concept of streamline. In the oil reservoirs, increasing injection flow rate does not necessarily enhance oil displacement and recovery. Therefore, suitable injection rates according to <b>injection</b> and production <b>wells</b> position have to be optimized. Also, production wells flow rate can affect sweep efficiency optimization extremely and increase the efficiency of <b>injection</b> <b>wells.</b> In this study, according to the position of production and <b>injection</b> <b>wells</b> and water production rates resulting from <b>injection</b> <b>wells,</b> four scenarios with different injection and production rates were investigated. This optimization has led to a reduced water production and water injection. Also, it increased the production efficiency and reservoir life...|$|R

2500|$|This is a {{very new}} and {{experimental}} method that combines a vertical air <b>injection</b> <b>well</b> with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the [...] "toe" [...] of the horizontal well toward the [...] "heel", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and {{have the advantage of}} not requiring energy to create steam.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWells {{have been}} {{identified}} as posing a greater risk for leakage from CO 2 storage sites than geological features such as faults and fractures, particularly in mature sedimentary basins with high well density such as those onshore in North America. A commonly-held belief is that CO 2 <b>injection</b> <b>wells</b> will pose a lesser risk than wells drilled for other purposes because greater care would be taken in regard to their completion and operation. The existence of CO 2 and acid gas injection operations in Alberta, Canada, provided the opportunity to test this hypothesis. Currently in Alberta there are 31 wells used for CO 2 <b>injection</b> and 48 <b>wells</b> used for the disposal of produced acid gas (a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 S that is separated from sour gas to meet pipeline and market specifications). Only 22 wells were drilled specifically with the purpose of injecting CO 2 or acid gas; all others are previous wells that have been subsequently converted to <b>injection</b> <b>wells.</b> Well failures include: surface casing vent flow, casing failure, tubing failure, packer failure, and zonal isolation failure. The incidence of well failure is greater in the case of converted wells than in the case of wells drilled and completed for injection purposes. Most failures are not caused by injection; they are due to general causes encountered in the general well population. Failures due to injection are mostly tubing and packer failures, which are monitored by regulation and are easily detected and repaired. The incidence of well failure is greater for wells drilled prior to the advent of regulations in 1994 regarding drilling and completion of <b>injection</b> <b>wells.</b> While the incidence of failure in the CO 2 and acid gas <b>injection</b> <b>wells</b> in Alberta is comparable to that in the general well population, the analysis indicates that <b>injection</b> <b>wells</b> drilled for purpose and under a proper regulatory regime have a lesser incidence of failure than the general well population.

50|$|Yet {{another use}} for <b>injection</b> <b>wells</b> is in {{environmental}} remediation, for cleanup of either soil or groundwater contamination. <b>Injection</b> <b>wells</b> can insert clean water into an aquifer, thereby changing {{the direction and}} speed of groundwater flow, perhaps towards extraction wells downgradient, which could then more speedily and efficiently remove the contaminated groundwater. <b>Injection</b> <b>wells</b> {{can also be used}} in cleanup of soil contamination, for example by use of an ozonation system. Complex hydrocarbons and other contaminants trapped in soil and otherwise inaccessible can be broken down by ozone, a highly reactive gas, often with greater cost-effectiveness than could be had by digging out the affected area. Such systems are particularly useful in built-up urban environments where digging may be impractical due to overlying buildings.|$|R
