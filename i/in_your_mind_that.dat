2500|$|To Whom It May Concern: I {{have just}} taken my mother's life. I am very upset over having done it. However, I {{feel that if}} there is a heaven she is {{definitely}} there now [...] I am truly sorry [...] Let there be no doubt <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> I loved this woman with all my heart.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 April 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Ahmadinejad's {{economic}} policy {{and said the}} West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a [...] "crisis" [...] spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. The Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has crippled {{the world has been}} unprecedented in the past 60 years. [...] "This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true", he said. Khamenei emphasized that no one has the right to blame the Iranian government for Iran's economic problems. He also advised people and the government to be content and avoid waste in order to solve economic problems. [...] "I advise you to keep <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this great nation is never afraid of economic sanctions", he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you wouldn't do it, Philippa. You {{know that}} you wouldn't!" [...] Helen objected. [...] "You may play with the idea <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> but <b>that's</b> just as far as you'd ever get." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Joel’s multi-layered music sweeps you away. He paints {{rich and}} mysterious mental landscapes and magically creates awesome sculptural shapes <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind’s</b> eye <b>that</b> {{continually}} transform and mesmerize... This is like NOTHING you’ve ever heard!" [...] - Jeanne Beker, Fashion Television ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Twice we {{have come}} as far as that, Mr. Selingman," [...] he pointed out. [...] "England {{requires}} a little lesson. You have something <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> behind <b>that,</b> something which you are half inclined to say to me. Isn't that so? Why not go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Saint Paul! I {{see your}} meaning!" [...] cried Nigel. [...] "It is <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} passage under the earth {{from one to the}} other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is for you}} to find out," [...] Mark replied, with a smile. [...] "You {{must take}} us for simples, if it is <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> we will give all the {{information}} demanded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> some of {{the lobster}} backs might be drawn off while General Gage is pushing his {{outposts}} on the Neck. How {{can you say that}} such may not have been done this very morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After a silence, {{in which}} they were talking of themselves, he burst out: [...] "But I don't see how Paris could help 'preciating you. I'll bet you're one of the best artists they ever saw.... The way you made up a picture <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about <b>that</b> juggler!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> lad, <b>that</b> I {{went out}} simply on a whim? That I am so light-headed as {{to take chances}} in this Tory town {{for the purpose of}} showing that it could be done?" [...] he asked in a tone that was really one of reproof.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mr. Grey, [...] "you cannot {{get rid of}} the gnats of the world. They will {{buzz and}} sting and be a nuisance. Poor Jane suffers worse from this gnat than you or I. Put up with it; and {{understand}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> when he comes for another twenty pounds he must have it. You needn't tell him, but so it must be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you {{conceived}} the idea," [...] went on Wayne, dreamily, [...] "of an army for Bayswater and a flag for Notting Hill, {{there was no}} gleam, no suggestion <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> such things might be real and passionate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are timid as a {{girl who}} will not utter the love she burns to tell,' Otomie {{answered}} with a proud and bitter laugh. 'Well, I will speak it for you. It is <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> we must die to-night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a better}} remedy {{even than the}} blue-glass bottle," [...] she said; [...] "it cures you so soon when you are tired, or troubled <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> I have brought it away with me from Wurzburg, {{to use it for}} myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Fernlea {{read the}} letter through to the end; then, without a word, he turned it over and re-read it. [...] "Frankly, Roland," [...] he said, when he laid it down, [...] "is there no {{impression}} left <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> after reading <b>that</b> letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Five--nearly six weeks. You {{have been}} {{wandering}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> all <b>that</b> time, talking of many strange things, {{and we have}} called at three ports. I forget their names, but the last one was an island with a beautiful harbour. Now, in about twenty days, if all goes well, we should reach another island called Cyprus. But you must not talk so much, you must sleep. The Saracen called Hassan, who is a clever doctor, told me so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 97. Fix then, first <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> <b>that</b> {{the sin of}} malediction, whether Shimei's individual, or John Bull's national, is in the vulgar malignity, not in the vulgar diction, {{and then}} note further that the [...] "phemy" [...] or [...] "fame" [...] of the two words, blasphemy and euphemy, signifies broadly the bearing of false witness against one's {{neighbor}} in the one case, and of true witness {{for him in the}} other: so that while the peculiar province of the blasphemer is to throw firelight on the evil in good persons, the province of the euphuist (I must use the word inaccurately for want of a better) is to throw sunlight on the good in bad ones; such, for instance, as Bertram, Meg Merrilies, Rob Roy, Robin Hood, and the general run of Corsairs, Giaours, Turks, Jews, Infidels, and Heretics; nay, even sisters of Rahab, and daughters of Moab and Ammon; and at last the whole spiritual race of him to whom it was said, [...] "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{take care}} not to say such things to your uncle," [...] said Mrs. Davilow. [...] "He will be hurt at your despising what he has exerted himself about. But I dare say you have {{something}} else <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he might not disapprove, if you consulted him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The idea of your {{ultimate}} priesthood {{has been}} so fostered <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> you may well {{have come to believe}} that to be a priest is your own inherent desire. I would have you consider it well now that the time approaches for a step which is irrevocable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then tell me this," [...] she said, [...] "honestly. When {{you made}} my brother that offer, when you {{sent him to}} deal with this man Sinclair, can you tell me that you had not an idea <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he might be led on to do {{something}} rash?" ...|$|E
60|$|Besides this letter, which I {{think is}} {{sufficiently}} clear upon the subject, {{there is also}} another much more clear upon your Lordships' minutes, much more distinct and much more pointed, expressive of his being resolved to make such representations of every matter as the Governor-General may wish. Now {{a man who is}} master of the manner in which facts are represented, and whose subsequent conduct is to be justified by such representations, is not simply accountable for his conduct; he is accountable for culpably attempting to form, on false premises, the judgment of others upon that conduct. This species of delinquency must therefore be added to the rest; and I wish your Lordships to carry generally <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> <b>that</b> there is not one single syllable of representation made by any of those parties, except where truth may happen to break out {{in spite of all the}} means of concealment, which is not to be considered as the representation of Mr. Hastings himself in justification of his own conduct.|$|R
60|$|I must {{close my}} lecture without indulging myself yet, by {{addition}} of detail; requesting you, before we next meet, to fix these general outlines <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> so <b>that,</b> without disturbing their distinctness, I may trace in the sequel {{the relations of}} Italian Art to these political and religious powers; and determine with what force of passionate sympathy, or fidelity of resigned obedience, the Pisan artists, father and son, executed the indignation of Florence and fulfilled the piety of Orvieto.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} troubled {{in her face}} that seemed all the while to burn clearer. [...] "You do yourself injustice. I've such confidence <b>in</b> <b>your</b> fairness of <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> I should be greatly disappointed if I were to find it wanting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can speak}} to her to-morrow," [...] said Miss Halcombe, when the servant had left the room again. [...] "In the meantime, let me {{thoroughly}} understand the object {{to be gained by}} my interview with Anne Catherick. Is there no doubt <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the person who confined her in the Asylum was Sir Percival Glyde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say. My {{father has}} great powers. I {{do not know}} them all. It is {{possible}} that they were neither journeyings nor dreams. Mayhap he used you as the sorcerers {{in the old days}} used the magic glass, and after he had put his spell upon you, read <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> which passes elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Meet hostility with hostility, ride ruthlessly {{upon your}} own way, showing {{yourself}} confident {{of the decision}} in your favour that the Pope must ultimately give. For bear ever <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> you are King of Naples, not by virtue of your marriage with Giovanna, but in your own right, Giovanna being but the offspring of the usurping branch." ...|$|E
60|$|Settle it <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> young people, <b>that</b> {{the first}} and the last of all virtues and graces which God can give is Self-Control, as {{necessary}} for the saint and the sage lest they become fanatics and pedants, as for the young in the hey-day of youth and health.|$|R
6000|$|He says elsewhere, [...] "I could wish, {{that you}} had ever <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> this meditation, <b>that</b> a ready and obedient will, which is entirely devoted to God's service, is a more {{pleasing}} sacrifice to the Divine Majesty, than all the pomp and glitter of our noisy actions, without the interior disposition." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cherish your visions. Cherish your ideals. Cherish {{the music}} that stirs <b>in</b> <b>your</b> heart, the beauty <b>that</b> forms <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> the loveliness <b>that</b> drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all {{delightful}} conditions, all heavenly environment, of these, if you but remain true to them your world will at last be built." ...|$|R
6000|$|His curious tone caused Bella {{to glance}} at the curious smile with which he said it. It was gone as he glanced back. 'Pardon me, Miss Wilfer,' he proceeded, when their eyes met; 'you have used some hard words, for which I do not doubt you have a {{justification}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> I do not understand. Ungenerous and dishonourable. In what?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to {{what has}} happened, since our return from Switzerland, I own that I ought to have made my {{confession}} to you. Forgive me if I weakly hesitated. I was so fond of you; and I so distrusted the Puritanical convictions which your education had rooted <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> I put it off from day to day. Oh, my angel....! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} risk {{the success of}} all our plans," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "You will even {{sacrifice}} your country that this man may go safely. You are serious? It is <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> you are the Countess Marie of Reist, and he--the paid writer in an English newspaper. Forgive me that I speak of this. It is incredible." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{what can}} you say for yourselves, if having once had these thoughts, having once settled <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> the Gospel of God is right and you are wrong, if you persist in disobeying that gospel--if you agree one minute with the inner voice, which says, [...] "Do this and live, do this and be at peace with God and man, and your own conscience"--and then fall back the next moment into the same worldly, selfish, peevish, sense-bound, miserable life-in-death as ever? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "you {{ought to be}} in love with me, and miserable about it, but I am horribly afraid you aren't. I believe you have matrimonial schemes <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> I believe <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{affections}} are so well-trained that they mean to trot all along the broad way to St. George's, Hanover Square." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>In</b> {{reference}} to <b>your</b> Shakespeare queries, I {{am not so}} much enamoured {{of the first and}} third subjects as I am of the Ariosto enquiry, which should be highly interesting. But if you have so got the matter <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> as <b>that</b> its execution would be incomplete and unsatisfactory to you unless you write all the three papers, then by all means write the three, and I will most gladly take them. For some years I have had so much pleasure in reading you, that I can honestly warrant myself as what actors call [...] "a good audience." ...|$|R
