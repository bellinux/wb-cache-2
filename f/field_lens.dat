50|$|Binocular eyepieces usually {{consist of}} three or more lens {{elements}} in two or more groups. The lens furthest from the viewer's eye is called the <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> and that closest to the eye the eye lens. The most common configuration is that invented in 1849 by Carl Kellner. In this arrangement, the eye lens is a plano-concave/ double convex achromatic doublet (the flat part of the former facing the eye) and the <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> is a double-convex singlet. A reversed Kellner eyepiece was developed in 1975 and in it the <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> is a double concave/ double convex achromatic doublet and the eye lens is a double convex singlet. The reverse Kellner provides 50% more eye relief and works better with small focal ratios as well as having a slightly wider field.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-element orthographic {{eyepiece}} {{consists of}} a plano-convex singlet eye lens and a cemented convex-convex triplet <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> achromatic <b>field</b> <b>lens.</b> This gives the eyepiece a nearly perfect image quality and good eye relief, but a narrow apparent field of view — about 40°-45°. It was invented by Ernst Abbe in 1880. It is called [...] "orthoscopic" [...] or [...] "orthographic" [...] because of its low degree of distortion and is also sometimes called an [...] "ortho" [...] or [...] "Abbe".|$|E

50|$|An RKE {{eyepiece}} has an achromatic <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> {{and double}} convex eye lens, a reversed {{adaptation of the}} Kellner eyepiece. It was designed by Dr. David Rank for the Edmund Scientific Corporation, who marketed it throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. This design provides slightly wider field of view than classic Kellner design and makes its design similar to a widely spaced version of the König.|$|E

The layout proposed is novel, whilst the algorithm used has been adapted from previously published work [Roddier, F.; Roddier, C. Appl. Opt. 1991, 30, 1325 – 1327]. The design of the set-up incorporates two <b>field</b> <b>lenses</b> that, together with a beam separator, define the distance Δz between the two sampled planes. We present a feasibility study to use this particular combination of optical configuration and retrieval algorithm in the eye. We present calibration curves and results from three real eyes...|$|R
50|$|In some {{eyepiece}} types, such as Ramsden eyepieces (described in {{more detail}} below), the eyepiece behaves as a magnifier, and its focal plane is located outside of the eyepiece {{in front of the}} <b>field</b> <b>lens.</b> This plane is therefore accessible as a location for a graticule or micrometer crosswires. In the Huygenian eyepiece, the focal plane is located between the eye and field lenses, inside the eyepiece, and is hence not accessible.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, the atom-optic imaging {{systems are}} not {{competitive}} with electron microscopy and various types of near-field probe. The main problem in the optics of atomic beams for an imaging system is the focusing element. There is no material transparent to the beam of low-energy atoms.

50|$|Longer lenses magnify {{the subject}} more, {{apparently}} compressing distance and (when {{focused on the}} foreground) blurring the background because of their shallower depth of <b>field.</b> Wider <b>lenses</b> tend to magnify distance between objects while allowing greater depth of field.|$|R
5000|$|This Museo Galileo {{microscope}} is {{a compound}} microscope made of cardboard, leather and wood, and is inserted in an iron support with three curved legs. The outer tube {{is covered in}} green vellum decorated with gold tooling. There are three lenses (an objective lens, a <b>field</b> <b>lens,</b> and an eyepiece), all double-convex. The objective measures 11 mm in diameter and has a thickness of 3.5 mm. The glass is clear with few imperfections; the edge is ground {{and there are some}} fine chips. The <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> (diameter 30 mm, thickness 4.7 mm) is in a cell that pushes {{into the bottom of the}} inner tube. The glass is amber-green, with air bubbles, and has a ground edge that is chipped; the eyepiece, with an aperture of 24 mm, also has some bubbles; it is protected by a wooden cap that screws onto the mount. The instrument is attributed to Giuseppe Campani, an Italian optician and astronomer who lived in Rome during the latter half of the 17th century, known as an expert lens grinder and instrument maker. Compound microscopes such as this first appeared in Europe around 1620 including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} view, often {{abbreviated}} FOV, describes {{the area of}} a target (measured as an angle from the location of viewing) {{that can be seen}} when looking through an eyepiece. The field of view seen through an eyepiece varies, depending on the magnification achieved when connected to a particular telescope or microscope, and also on properties of the eyepiece itself. Eyepieces are differentiated by their field stop, which is the narrowest aperture that light entering the eyepiece must pass through to reach the <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> of the eyepiece.|$|E
50|$|A {{separation}} of exactly 1 focal length is also inadvisable since it renders the {{dust on the}} <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> disturbingly in focus. The two curved surfaces face inwards. The focal plane is thus located outside of the eyepiece and is hence accessible as a location where a graticule, or micrometer crosshairs may be placed. Because a {{separation of}} exactly one focal length {{would be required to}} correct transverse chromatic aberration, {{it is not possible to}} correct the Ramsden design completely for transverse chromatic aberration. The design is slightly better than Huygens but still not up to today’s standards.|$|E

40|$|A Fresnel lens {{is a thin}} lens {{constructed}} in {{a large number of}} segments such that light rays entering and exiting the lens do so at the same angles as a normal thick lens. The geometry of such a lens is shown in Figure 1, which is taken from a graphics section in the video that describes Fresnel lens construction. Thus Fresnel lenses can be made much thinner and lighter than standard lenses. The operation of Fresnel lenses is also illustrated in the video. Fresnel invented this type of lens for use in lighthouses. They are also used as the <b>field</b> <b>lenses</b> in overhead projectors and in optically programmed traffic signals, and diverging Fresnel lenses are used for wide-angle viewing on trucks and vans...|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} {{elements}} in a Nagler makes them seem complex, {{but the idea of}} the design is fairly simple: every Nagler has a negative doublet <b>field</b> <b>lens,</b> which increases magnification, followed by several positive groups. The positive groups, considered separate from the first negative group, combine to have long focal length, and form a positive lens. That allows the design {{to take advantage of the}} many good qualities of low power lenses. In effect, a Nagler is a superior version of a Barlow lens combined with a long focal length eyepiece. This design has been widely copied in other wide field or long eye relief eyepieces.|$|E
5000|$|Huygens eyepieces {{consist of}} two plano-convex lenses with the plane sides towards the eye {{separated}} by an air gap. The lenses {{are called the}} eye lens and the <b>field</b> <b>lens.</b> The focal plane is located between the two lenses. It was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the late 1660s {{and was the first}} compound (multi-lens) eyepiece. Huygens discovered that two air spaced lenses {{can be used to make}} an eyepiece with zero transverse chromatic aberration. If the lenses are made of glass of the same refractive index, to be used with a relaxed eye and a telescope with an infinitely distant objective then the separation is given by:where [...] and [...] are the focal lengths of the component lenses.|$|E
2500|$|Much like in cluster-scale weak lensing, {{detection}} of a galaxy-galaxy shear signal requires one {{to measure the}} shapes of background source galaxies, and then look for statistical shape correlations (specifically, source galaxy shapes should be aligned tangentially, relative to the lens center.) [...] In principle, this signal could be measured around any individual foreground lens. [...] In practice, however, due to the relatively low mass of <b>field</b> <b>lenses</b> and the inherent randomness in intrinsic shape of background sources (the [...] "shape noise"), the signal is impossible to measure on a galaxy by galaxy basis. [...] However, by combining the signals of many individual lens measurements together (a technique known as [...] "stacking"), the signal-to-noise ratio will improve, allowing one to determine a statistically significant signal, averaged over the entire lens set.|$|R

50|$|Media grammar {{literacy}} considers each medium {{as its own}} language. Thus, each medium possesses its own {{grammar and}} how production variables affect elements of content. Meyrowitz offers examples for a few media. Print media production variables include page size and format, color, and texture, typeface design, size, and color, {{and the use of}} spacing, punctuation, negative space, graphics, and more. Photography production variables include framing, depth of <b>field,</b> <b>lens</b> type, exposure, film vs. digital, contrast, post-production effects, and more. He then acknowledges that television and film will use many of those production variables found in print and photography, but then add their own. Thus, despite the existence of some shared production variables in many media, each medium possess its own unique combination of variables.|$|E
50|$|DOME {{lenses and}} {{standard}} lens {{are similar in}} some ways. They both depend {{on the type of}} display device, LCD, DLP, LCOS, DILA and the size chip or panel that is part of this device. The unique feature of the DOME lens is the actual shape of the glass, the projected image spill out from the top and all around circumference of the lens. The biggest advantage is how this type of lens maintains focus over the full 180 x 180 field of view. A single standard flat field or curved <b>field</b> <b>lens</b> would have major focus and distortion issue. Several lens developers offer DOME lenses with each designed to a specific projector class and display device. These lenses can cover a variety of pixel sizes and display resolutions.|$|E
50|$|The image {{fidelity}} is {{much improved}} over earlier {{results of the}} previous experimental lens stack. Imaging of sub-micrometre features has been greatly improved by using thinner silver and spacer layers, and by reducing the surface roughness of the lens stack. The ability of the silver lenses to image the gratings {{has been used as}} the ultimate resolution test, as there is a concrete limit for the ability of a conventional (far <b>field)</b> <b>lens</b> to image a periodic object - in this case the image is a diffraction grating. For normal-incidence illumination the minimum spatial period that can be resolved with wavelength λ through a medium with refractive index n is λ/n. Zero contrast would therefore be expected in any (conventional) far-field image below this limit, no matter how good the imaging resist might be.|$|E
40|$|Several large‐solid‐angle {{devices for}} collecting, at a common focus, {{multiply}} charged heavy ions from nuclear reactions have been studied.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{new types of}} ion‐optical systems having larger solid angles (i. e., collecting power) and flexibility than many existing designs. They use relatively simple axially symmetric elements, namely solenoids, axial magnetic dipoles, and radial electric <b>field</b> <b>lenses.</b> The systems can focus, with good optical properties, energetic ions {{in the range of}} tens of keV up to tens of MeV kinetic energy and are capable of operating in nondispersive, achromatic modes. The key elements for the latter are new types of defocusing magnetic and electrostatic correction lenses. The lens systems have applications in any existing devices used to collect and focus energetic ions (including electrons). Typical devices are: mass spectrometers, leak detectors and gas analyzers, ion sources, accelerators and ion implantation systems, nuclear particle spectrometers, electron microscopes, ion microprobes, and ion‐beam lenses for cancer therapy...|$|R
