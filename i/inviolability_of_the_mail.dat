The author aims to analyse chosen <b>inviolability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home and privacy interferences and their constitutional conformity, legal regulation and practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courts regarding given institutes. The author analyses, apart from mentioned institutes of criminal law, also selected provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech legal order, upon which <b>the</b> <b>inviolability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home interference arises.

40|$|The master's thesis {{focuses on}} a topic which lies on <b>the</b> {{intersection}} <b>of</b> civil law procedure and constitutional law. <b>The</b> chosen type <b>of</b> execution proceedings is looked at through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> constitutional law with specific focus on dwelling and <b>inviolability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home, which are interfered with by specific steps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution sale <b>of</b> movable property. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is to bring forth an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topic from an unusual perspective, and therein answer several research questions, especially to lay out specific (impermissible) interferences with <b>the</b> <b>inviolability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dwelling within execution proceedings with <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> highlighting <b>inviolability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home as a value embodied in <b>the</b> constitutional system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts and only <b>the</b> conjunction <b>of</b> these parts forms a unique whole. The first part focuses on execution sale of movable items. Firstly, it gives an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution proceedings and clarifies the purpose and goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court executors.
