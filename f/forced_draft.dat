25|$|Forced draught — A {{mechanical}} draft tower with {{a blower}} type fan at the intake. The fan forces {{air into the}} tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities. The low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> design {{is its ability to}} work with high static pressure. Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations. This fan/fin geometry is also known as blow-through.|$|E

25|$|The {{powerplant}} {{consisted of}} one large high-pressure central turbine for providing the motive {{power to a}} central propeller, {{and a pair of}} low-pressure turbines driving two outboard screws which were used for manoeuvre, and which were shut down when the vessel was under way. Steam was provided by six single-ended, <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> Scotch boilers delivering a pressure of 150 pounds. W. & A. Fletcher subcontracted the hull to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{absorbed by}} the {{circulating}} cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain {{the ability of the}} water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft, <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> or induced draft cooling towers (as seen in the adjacent image) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11to17°C (20to30°F)—expelling waste heat to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 MW unit is about 14.2 m³/s (500ft³/s or 225,000 US gal/min) at full load.|$|E

For comparison purposes, an olympic size pool holds approximately 660,000 U.S. gallons (2,500,000 L). As the British did in Malaya, the goal of the US was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and concealment and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters. The program was also a part of a general policy of <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> urbanization, which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S.-dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.|$|E

500|$|The keel for Tiger {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste on 5 October 1886. She was launched on 28 June 1887. Completion of the ship had been delayed by manufacturing problems from the domestic steel supplier, since the initial material sent {{did not meet the}} strength requirements. STT rejected it and requested better quality steel; this forced STT to inform the Marinesektion on 20 September 1887 {{that it would not be}} able to meet its delivery date. After fitting-out work was completed, Tiger was ready for sea trials by February 1888. While performing speed tests, she reached a speed of [...] with <b>forced</b> <b>draft</b> and [...] with normal power, earning STT its bonus. The ship then had her guns and torpedo equipment installed. She was commissioned into the fleet in late March. Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria, then ranked a Fregattenkapitän (frigate captain) served as the ship's first commander; her first duty was as the flotilla leader of a flotilla of torpedo boats, during the fleet maneuvers from 12 June to 24 July.|$|E
