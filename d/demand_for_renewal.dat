This study is intended to determine the validation of renewal through Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and through the estimation of pipeline burst in the future. Considering calculated benefit and cost, analysis period and social discount rate, the benefit/cost ratio is calculated {{and the result of}} B/C value is 1. 004. Since the ratio of benefit/cost is bigger than 1. 0, pipeline renewal with rehabilitation and double-piping is financially validated in this study...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{represents}} an exploratory {{study of the}} role of internal communication in sustaining cultural changes in medium enterprises. The paper aims 1) at analyzing and understanding the communication needs and the problems of introduction and institutionalization of a specialized service of internal communication in a medium enterprise; 2) at investigating the contribution of internal communication in cultural change dynamics. The paper presents the results of a study conducted in an Italian medium enterprise. Adopting an interpretive approach, the paper is based on a qualitative study which combines in-depth interviews conducted through a mix motivational and narrative interview guide and focused participant observation. The findings highlight that internal communication acts as a «bridge» and a relational platform for the symbolic negotiation of a new organizational culture. Internal communication provides organizational members with dialogue opportunities, which offer the chance to engage in a sensemaking process about change and to reconcile successful past routines with the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal.</b> Moreover, the findings underline the role of training programs in change management processes as an experimentation site where the leading champions of change can be gathered...|$|E
40|$|Background: Few medical {{teaching}} institutions provide {{faculty development}} in curriculum development to program directors of medical specialties (PD), despite the increased <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> of residency {{programs and the}} evaluation of outcomes. Aim: To describe and evaluate a training program in curriculum development for PD developed in 2008 and 2009. Material and Methods: Thirty PD attended an on campus course of fifteen hours. Evaluation was done using Kirkpatrick model through an end-of-course questionnaire, a retrospective pre/post self-assessment test of skills, the assessment of learning and the final projects developed by PD. Results: All PD finished the course and answered the questionnaire. In level 1 (Reaction), 100 % reported high satisfaction and would recommend it highly to others, with perceived mean achievement of course objectives of 81 %. In level 2 (Learning), all {{the differences between the}} retrospective pre and posttest were statistically significant (p < 0. 01), and achievement of learning was in average 82. 9 %. In level 3 (Behavior), 100 % felt they would apply what was learnt and 17 PD (57 %) sent projects. Conclusions: This model of faculty development was highly accepted by PD and had a positive evaluation based in high satisfaction, the improvement in pre/posttest assessment, the achievement of learning objectives and the development of projects...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{sustainability}} {{is here to}} stay and permeates all aspects of plan¬ning. We are developing technological systems and solutions for optimisation, reuse and recycling. Socially we work on the resilience of our communi¬ties and deal with demographic change. But what of culture? This narrative will focus on how we can (re) establish our cities, towns and landscapes as culturally sustainable. In the 20 th century we started to believe that everything old was bad. Old was dark, cramped and unhealthy. It needed to make way for highways and high-rise. Cars were the promise of a radiant future. Everybody had the right to live in spacious apartment-blocks or park-like suburbs enhanced by modern technology. Over time we have come to realise that this ideal future is not so easy to establish and comes at a high price. Cars dominate our streets, leaving no space for children to play or people to meet. The desire for new houses and city districts based on ‘modern’ principles of separating functions has consumed productive and pristine landscapes alike. Now as we begin to acknowledge these mistakes, we again tend to exaggerate our reaction. Planners and politicians now want to tear down all this ‘old modernist stuff’. And when old is bad anyway, why bother to have new develop¬ments built for the future, when instead we can build them as cheap disposables. In the Netherlands a new approach to deal with cultural values in our spatial environment has developed over the last 20 years. This densely populated country needs to constantly retrofit its cities and landscapes to allow for growth and {{to meet the challenges of}} sustainability. This has led to significant tensions within the population. The rising voice for the appreciation of cultural values needs to be reconciled with the economical <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal.</b> The concept of ‘preservation through development’ has led to a whole new world of projects and different approaches to planning. Since 1998 OKRA landscape architects has been one of the main forces advocating and develop¬ing this approach. This way of thinking and approaching redevelopment will be highlighted here through the case study of the Quality Guides for National Landscapes. Additional urban development projects will also be briefly outlined to further illustrate the approach. While these examples are culturally specific, their approach to planning and policy for sustainable and efficient city landscapes is widely applicable. Preservation through development is a means by which Australian cities and suburbs can re-establish a connection to place, and become more sustainable, culturally relevant urban and regional centres...|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, non-state actors, mostly Congolese civil society organizations, {{international}} organizations and United Nations agencies {{have been involved in}} implementing alternative mechanisms to land management at local level. Their actions meet a popular <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> institutional <b>renewal</b> to deal with the land crisis in the DRC. These mechanisms include the introduction and systematization of writing practices in customary access to land, land mediation, land socio-therapy and local land regulation (édits fonciers). Based on empirical research conducted in 2012 and 2013 in North and South Kivu, this paper describes these institutional innovations and discusses their impact and challenges in local land disputes (1). It then shows how, while trying to respond to the “inability” of the state to respond to the popular demand of institutional renewal, these innovations contribute to changes within the customary land management framework (2). Finally, the paper analyzes the legitimacy, effectiveness and sustainability of such innovations {{in the context of a}} “post-conflict” state (3) ...|$|R

40|$|Current trends {{show that}} as the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{infrastructure}} <b>renewal</b> and replacement has increased, Federal, state, and local government funding for infrastructure projects has decreased. It has become clear {{that the government will}} need to examine the potential of and implement other delivery methods in addition to design-bid-build. In order for the government to effectively use project delivery as a variable, the role of government in the capital planning process will need to be redefined. This thesis examines the capital planning process used by public owners, i. e. the government. The identification of ideal project planning and management principles led to a new framework for capital planning, referred to as the Project Configuration Process. The proposed Project Configuration Process is {{based on the premise that}} a public owner can identify a realistic need, identify the objectives for the project, identify the project constraints or drivers, and select the most appropriate delivery strategy that aligns the project objectives with the advantages of the delivery strategy. Two case studies are included to examine current project configuration practices. Th...|$|R
40|$|Teachers in Hong Kong {{have faced}} {{constant}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> practice <b>renewal</b> due to successive waves of educational {{reforms in the}} past decade. This paper describes the design of an assignment structure that promotes teacher reflection on important issues related to a major education reform in Hong Kong. This particular assignment structure includes three components - self-reflection, understanding alternative perspectives and situated analysis. Teachers are expected to complete these components in a sequence. The design addresses teachers' teaching experiences, engages them in learning alternative perspectives, and assists them to juxtapose self-reflection and alternative perspectives in analysing commonly encountered teaching situations. An evaluation of teachers' levels of reflection in these assignments showed that both high- and low-scored teachers improved their reflection. Based {{on the findings of}} an interview study, this paper reported a grounded model explaining how this innovative assignment structure promotes reflection. The model situated the reflective assignments within the local teaching context in Hong Kong and highlighted the importance of different forms of assistance and guidance in facilitating teachers' reflective engagement in completing these cognitively demanding assignments.

40|$|The general {{election}} of 2013 marked a ‘turning point’. Voting indecision {{was significantly higher}} than in the past while voting choices were made later, with the proportion of ‘late deciders’ and ‘last-minute voters’ growing as compared with 2008 and 2006. Voters’ willingness to change their votes was this time reflected in their actual choices. A more open attitude towards the political offerings was also apparent and this generated a degree of interest in the campaign that was greater {{than at any time in}} the previous 10 years. The configuration of parties among which voters were called upon to choose was very different as compared with previous elections. By describing and taking these features as its point of departure, this article explores the behaviour of voters during the course of the election campaign and analyses their decision-making processes from the perspective of when they made up their minds. The analysis then focuses on a new political entity, the Five-star Movement (MoVimento 5 Stelle), and on who voted for it. As one of the competitors it was successful in providing representation for the anti-political sentiments widespread among the Italian electorate. The Five-star Movement was also able to capitalise on the climate of voting indecision, spearheading the widespread <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> political <b>renewal.</b> It gained such electoral advantages from this that it became the most-voted party, posing a strong challenge to Italy’s bipolar party system...|$|R
