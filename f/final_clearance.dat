25|$|Although {{functioning}} as a hospital ship with Colonel Carroll and Lt. Fellmeth organizing the Filipino doctors and nurses into shifts the ship was not equipped as a hospital ship. Medical supplies had been hurriedly loaded. Patients were packed aboard with many on open decks {{and close to the}} ship's rails. The operating room was the ship's saloon. Of more concern, there was still, and never was, official Japanese government or military confirmation that the ship was recognized as a hospital ship and had been granted safe passage. Though <b>final</b> <b>clearance</b> had come from the International Red Cross in Geneva there was only official silence after the director of the Japanese Red Cross in Tokyo, Prince Shimadzu, had noted within Red Cross channels that the ship's status would be respected.|$|E
25|$|The {{match against}} Lipscomb of the Atlantic Sun Conference was a contest of {{defenses}} {{with the two}} squads managing to get off only three shots in the first half. The Cougars picked up the pace in the second half, but the Bisons' keeper made four of his six saves to hold the home team scoreless. SIUE's defense turned away everything sent at them, but made a bad habit of clearing the ball over the end line to set up Lipscomb corner kicks. The game was still scoreless with {{less than two minutes}} remaining in the second extra period when the Bisons set up for their eighth corner of the game. Cougar defenders turned away two Lipscomb headers, but the <b>final</b> <b>clearance</b> rebounded off a charging Bisons forward, falling into the net past a stunned Dal Santo.|$|E

During the war the battalion lost 202 men killed or died on active service, of which 56 were killed in action, 139 died while prisoners of war and seven in accidents or illness on active service. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, three Military Crosses, four Military Medals, one British Empire Medal and 21 Mentions in Despatches.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of testing to identify the effects of simulated aerodynamic flight loads on JT 9 D engine performance. The test results were also used to refine previous analytical studies on the impact of aerodynamic flight loads on performance losses. To accomplish these objectives, a JT 9 D- 7 AH engine was assembled with average production clearances and new seals as well as extensive instrumentation to monitor engine performance, case temperatures, and blade tip clearance changes. A special loading device was designed and constructed to permit application of known moments and shear forces to the engine by the use of cables placed around the flight inlet. The test was conducted in the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft X-Ray Test Facility to permit the use of X-ray techniques in conjunction with laser blade tip proximity probes to monitor important engine clearance changes. Upon completion of the test program, the test engine was disassembled, and the condition of gas path parts and <b>final</b> <b>clearances</b> were documented. The test results indicate that the engine lost 1. 1 percent in thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), as measured under sea level static conditions, due to increased operating clearances caused by simulated flight loads. This compares with 0. 9 percent predicted by the analytical model and previous study efforts...|$|R
