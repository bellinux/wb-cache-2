25|$|In 2006, {{after the}} {{controversial}} 2004 BCCI election scandal involving Sharad Pawar's defeat to {{election to the}} office of president of the board at the hands of Agashe, the bank business started having financial troubles. Many sources claimed Agashe's actions may have been deliberate. Some sources also claimed that Agashe's business supposedly failed as backlash for thwarting Pawar's ambitions for presidency. In September of that same year, the cooperative bank was put under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India. The board of directors for the bank was superseded soon after. In 2007, following the order of moratorium, the State Department of Cooperation appointed Mukund Ghaisas as administrator at the bank. Many of the bank's depositors held demonstrations at Agashe's Aundh residence and threatened criminal actions against the Agashe family, after which a speedy merger was promised by Agashe. Initial NPAs totaled Rs. 125 crore, 13% against the seven per cent maximum allowable under the RBI norms. After the non-performing assets of the bank grew to more than 43%, account holders and depositors held a day long token fast to protest against the misinformation provided in regards to the alleged duped loans. In 2008, the RBI gave the bank permission to pay <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits</b> made from January to June 2008; Agashe mortgaged personal property worth Rs. 200 crore in lieu of the recovery of the deposits worth Rs. 725 crore. Hotel Ranjeet, a hotel owned by Agashe was auctioned off for the same reasons. Cosmos Bank planned to acquire the bank after it hit this roadblock with the RBI and the subsequent announcement of the proposed merger with Cosmos led to large-scale panic withdrawals by Suvarna customers.|$|E

2500|$|Building societies, like mutual life insurers, arose {{as people}} clubbed {{together}} {{to address a}} common need interest; {{in the case of}} the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits.</b> Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause. The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable time and resources (which belonged the organisation) planning their effective capture—of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably insider dealing on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators). Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement).

6000|$|It is patent to {{the most}} casual {{observer}} that much more currency, or money, is required to transact the legitimate trade of the country during {{the fall and winter}} months, when the vast crops are being removed, than during the balance of the year. With our present system the amount in the country remains the same throughout the entire year, resulting in an accumulation of all the surplus capital of the country in a few centers when not employed in the moving of crops, tempted there by the offer of interest on call loans. Interest being paid, this surplus capital must earn this interest paid with a profit. Being subject to [...] "call," [...] it can not be loaned, only in part at best, to the merchant or manufacturer for a fixed term. Hence, no matter how much currency there might be in the country, it would be absorbed, prices keeping pace with the volume, and panics, stringency, and disasters would ever be recurring with the autumn. Elasticity in our monetary system, therefore, is the object to be attained first, and next to that, as far as possible, a prevention of the use of other people's money in stock and other species of speculation. To prevent the latter {{it seems to me that}} one great step would be taken by prohibiting the national banks from paying <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits,</b> by requiring them to hold their reserves in their own vaults, and by forcing them into resumption, though it would only be in legal-tender notes. For this purpose I would suggest the establishment of clearing houses for your consideration.|$|E

30|$|The control {{variables}} show some interesting results. SIZE presents negative and significant coefficients; consequently larger banks pay lower <b>interest</b> rates <b>on</b> <b>deposits</b> (in {{favor of the}} implicit “too-big-to-fail” policy). LOAN presents some positive and significant coefficients, that is, there is a demand effect determining <b>interest</b> rates <b>on</b> <b>deposits,</b> as proposed by Ben-David et al. (2013). EXPOSURE enters with positive signs and significance; therefore, a higher exposure to the interbank deposit market corresponds to a higher <b>interest</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>deposits.</b> CETES presents positive signs and significance, predictably, because of the natural relationship between IIRDE and CETES (see Fig.  1). The time dummies show some positive and significant coefficients, surprisingly, because IIRDE shows a negative trend {{during the period of}} analysis (see Fig.  2 in the appendix). Probably, CETES is catching up with this trend.|$|R
