500|$|In 1988, Namath and Madden, by {{then both}} {{television}} analysts, were interviewed for the 20th {{anniversary of the}} Heidi Game. According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the Heidi Game [...] "was kind of {{the start of the}} Raiders being a great team. One of the things we were doing was getting these fantastic come-from-behind things...We didn't even know about the Heidi thing until we read about it the next day." [...] Namath noted, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. We paid them back then", to which Madden chuckled, [...] "He's full of crap." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspiration for Marching Men came in {{part from}} the author's time as a laborer in Chicago between 1900 and 1906 (where he, like his protagonist, worked in a warehouse, went to night school, was robbed, and fell in love several times) and his service in the Spanish–American War which took place {{towards the end of the}} war and just after the {{armistice}} in 1898–99. Of the latter, Anderson wrote in his Memoirs about the time he had been marching and got a rock in his shoe. After separating from his fellow soldiers to remove it, he observed them and recalled [...] "I had become a giant.... I was, in myself, something huge, terrible and at the same time noble. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> I sat, for a long time, while the army passed, opening and closing my eyes". Combined with his later reading of works by Thomas Carlyle, Mark Twain, and possibly Jack London, Anderson had inspiration for Marching Men that was both experiential and literary.|$|E
500|$|For this record, Björk {{incorporated}} shelved songs {{she wrote}} in Manchester with 808 State's Graham Massey, which had preceded the recording sessions for Debut. These included [...] "Army of Me" [...] and [...] "The Modern Things", which had become live staples over the summer, and thus {{did not need to}} undergo extensive transformations at Compass Point. Massey stated: [...] "With [...] "Army of Me" [...] we wanted to try something that was quite hard and techno-y. I'm not sure how she wrote those lyrics so fast but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> song being almost instantaneous. [...] We kind of knocked that off in one day and then started on [...] "The Modern Things" [...] the same day and finished that the next". Although the album was supposed to be delivered the day after she returned from the Bahamas, Björk felt it was not yet complete and decided to continue its production back in London. She enlisted a new team of engineers and programmers, and spent the next months [...] "tweaking, rearranging, and sometimes completely rerecording her pre-existing tracks". Ultimately, it was the inclusion of more [...] "real" [...] instruments that [...] "resuscitated Post for Björk".|$|E

500|$|Israeli actress Ania Bukstein {{was also}} {{introduced}} in the series as the High Priestess Kinvara, who is brought to Meereen to spread propaganda about Daenerys Targaryen's supposed success at eliminating {{the problem with the}} Sons of the Harpy. In an interview with Bukstein she said, [...] "Yes, it's very exciting, but let's calm down. It's not like I'm the new Khaleesi. Game of Thrones came after a ton of hard work. I filmed a lot of audition tapes in front of a white wall at home. I've paid my dues for years." [...] Bukstein also stated that she had previously sent in an audition tape to the series when it was first casting its first season, saying, [...] "A few years ago, when they had only begun to cast the first season of Game of Thrones, I sent an audition tape. I didn't really know for which role, and I mainly didn't know—and neither did the world—what a hit the series was about to become. But <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> even then, the scenes that I got excited me, and I completely went with the style." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1932, Chuck Kocsis (the first golfer {{inducted}} into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor), enrolled at the university. When a promised alumni pledge to pay his expenses fell through, Trueblood agreed to make a loan (at five percent interest) so Kocsis could pay his tuition. The Wolverines with Kocsis won the NCAA championship twice. Kocsis recalled that the team often traveled to tournaments in Trueblood's car. [...] "Professor Trueblood had a seven-passenger Buick," [...] Kocsis said. [...] "He designated me as the chauffeur. So {{if we had a}} golf match, we'd all get into the car and go to Chicago, or go to Ohio, wherever we were going to play." [...] Another teammate recalled the trips in Trueblood's car: [...] "It wasn't a very big Buick, as I recall. [...] We rode with six guys. Chuck used to do most of the driving. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> trip down to Washington (for the 1935 national championship at Congressional, which Michigan won). We started in the morning and drove all the way down there. Professor Trueblood was a big guy, too." [...] Trueblood took the team on a side trip to Mount Vernon, where one of the players accidentally bumped the shifter into gear and hit the accelerator as he exited Trueblood's car. The car lurched forward; the open door hit something and was torn off its hinges.|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E

500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E
500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
