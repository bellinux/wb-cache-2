50|$|Diffusion bonding is {{primarily}} {{used to create}} intricate forms for the electronics, aerospace, and nuclear industries. Since this form of bonding takes {{a considerable amount of}} time compared to other joining techniques such as explosion welding, parts are made in small quantities, and often fabrication is mostly automated. However, due to different requirements, some of the time interval could be accomplished in few minutes. In an attempt to reduce <b>fastener</b> <b>count,</b> labor costs, and part count, diffusion bonding, in conjunction with superplastic forming, is also used when creating complex sheet metal forms. Multiple sheets are stacked atop one another and bonded in specific sections. The stack is then placed into a mold and gas pressure expands the sheets to fill the mold. This is often done using titanium or aluminum alloys for parts needed in the aerospace industry.|$|E
40|$|The {{composite}} fin design {{consists of}} two one-piece cocured covers, two one-piece cocured spars and eleven ribs. The lower ribs are truss ribs with graphite/epoxy caps and aluminum truss members. The upper three ribs are a sandwich design with graphite/epoxy face sheets and a syntactic epoxy core. The design achieves a 27 % weight saving compared to the metal box. The <b>fastener</b> <b>count</b> has been reduced from over 40, 000 to less than 7000. The structural integrity of the composite fin was verified by analysis and test. The static, fail-safe and flutter analyses were completed. An extensive test program has established the material behavior under a range of conditions and critical subcomponents were tested to verify the structural concepts...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are widely appreciated by the engineers for aerospace applications {{because of their}} property tailorability, high specific strength, high specific stiffness, less weight and many other advantages. Various technologies are used worldwide for fabrication of these composite structures. One of such {{state of the art}} technologies is co-curing, where the primary structure is co-cured along with the secondary structure by eliminating the fasteners and allowing many other benefits of co-curing. The integral structure realized through co-curing approach will result in cost benefits by reducing the part <b>count,</b> <b>fasteners</b> and assembly time. Such type of fabrication is adopted in transport aircraft wing and empennage structures where the substructure members like spars, ribs etc are co-cured with the skin forming co-cured joints. When such joints are present in wing structures they are subjected to direct or in-direct out-of-plane loads caused by pressure generated due to the presence of fuel. The behavior and the strength of these joints under out-of- plane loads are of concern and has been the topic of many analytical and experimental studies. However, only limited information is available in the open literature. For the present study a typical transport aircraft wing, which is made of composites and fabricated using co-curing technology, is considered. The co-cured wing structure with internal fuel pressure imparting out-of-plane loads on joints are addressed in this paper. The joint strength assessment through feature level test by introducing the same level of defect concentration on such joints would be time consuming and expensive. On the other hand Finite Element (FE) analysis using suitable commercial software with appropriate model of the joint would provide a substantial understanding on the strength of the joint. In the present paper attempts are made to understand the structural behavior of typical co-cured composite joints subjected to pull-off load, in presence and absence of a typical manufacturing defect. The authors demonstrate here the approach to predict the failure strength of co-cured joints under contemplation analytically using a polynomial invariant based three dimensional failure theory. The paper explains the methodology established for predicting failure strength under pull-off load which is a first step towards certification of co-cured joints with and without manufacturing defects. ...|$|R
