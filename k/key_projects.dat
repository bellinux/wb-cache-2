5|$|As the 1950s began, {{demand on}} the Colorado River – which forms {{the border of}} California and Arizona and {{provided}} most of Southern California's water – was moving toward unsustainable levels. The Bureau of Reclamation restarted its surveys of the Trinity River basin {{as part of a}} larger proposal to move water from northern to southern parts of the state, and compensate for the shortages on the Colorado. The United Western Investigation, in 1951, proposed the damming of nearly every river in the North Coast region of California, chiefly the Trinity, Klamath and Eel. The Ah Pah Dam would have flooded the canyons of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to form the largest reservoir in California. These grandiose plans culminated in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan of 1964, which sought to comprehensively link the water systems of California and the rest of the Colorado River Basin. One of the <b>key</b> <b>projects</b> was an aqueduct to transport North Coast water to the Imperial Valley, reducing its reliance on water from the Colorado River. However, with the exception of the upper Trinity River project, none of these dam and diversion projects were ever realized.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss <b>key</b> <b>{{projects}}.</b> These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, {{which would be}} explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) {{a study of the}} nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale.|$|E

25|$|After Mao died on September 9, 1976, his rival, Deng Xiaoping, denounced {{during the}} Cultural Revolution as reactionary and {{therefore}} forced {{to retire from}} all his offices, slowly re-emerged as China's new leader in 1978. At first, new development was slowed. Then, several <b>key</b> <b>projects</b> deemed unnecessary were simply cancelled—the Fanji ABM system, the Xianfeng Anti-Missile Super Gun, the ICBM Early Warning Network 7010 Tracking Radar and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program. Nevertheless, some development did proceed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Key</b> <b>projects</b> {{include the}} TAUVEX {{telescope}}, the Tel Aviv University Ultra Violet Experiment, a UV telescope for astronomical observations which {{was developed in}} the 1990s to be accommodated on an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) geo-synchronous satellite GSAT-4, for joint operation and use by Indian and Israeli scientists; the VENUS microsatellite, developed in collaboration with the French space agency, CNES, which will use an Israeli-developed space camera, electric space engine and algorithms; and MEIDEX (Mediterranean – Israel Dust Experiment), in collaboration with NASA.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} infrastructure, the city aims {{to build up}} a network of {{distinctive}} bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the <b>key</b> <b>projects</b> of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.|$|E

On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009 the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease of use features and performance enhancements, rather than a large reworking of Windows.|$|E

500|$|Treloar {{experienced}} difficulties {{managing the}} Memorial and its {{staff in the}} years after World War II. While the AWM had few difficulties recruiting staff, it struggled to retain them due to housing shortages in Canberra {{and the way in which}} the Memorial was run. Treloar's working style contributed to these problems; although he was personally friendly and took an interest in the wellbeing of his employees, he did not delegate tasks and it was difficult for AWM staff to meet with him in person to discuss their responsibilities. This made it difficult for staff to complete urgent tasks, and contributed to delays in <b>key</b> <b>projects</b> such as the construction of the Memorial's Hall of Memory. Tom Hungerford, who worked for the AWM between 1948 and 1949, wrote in his memoirs that Treloar was [...] "most dedicated, most incredibly hard-working, most unfailingly kind and most ineffectual". Treloar increasingly obsessed over relatively minor details and gained a reputation for indecisiveness.|$|E
