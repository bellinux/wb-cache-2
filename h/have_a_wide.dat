5|$|Grasshoppers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{range of}} predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E
5|$|Hawksbill {{sea turtles}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range, found {{predominantly}} in tropical reefs of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Of all the sea turtle species, E. imbricata {{is the one}} most associated with warm tropical waters. Two major subpopulations are known, in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.|$|E
5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic {{is to say}} that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{range of}} vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, {{most of which are}} used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of body plans. Coastal species {{need to be}} tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile {{that it is very}} difficult to capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|LARP events <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once {{and those that are}} designed to be repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E

5|$|Like other rails, the Crex species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call {{consisting of a}} series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> variety of reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E

5|$|Terns <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{repertoire}} of vocalisations. For example, the common tern has a distinctive alarm, kee-yah, also {{used as a}} warning to intruders, and a shorter kyar, given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of monoclonal antibodies is a naming {{scheme for}} assigning generic, or nonproprietary, names to monoclonal antibodies. An antibody is a protein that {{is produced in}} B cells and used by the immune system of humans and other vertebrate animals to identify a specific foreign object like a bacterium or a virus. Monoclonal antibodies are those that were produced in identical cells, often artificially, and so share the same target object. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of applications including medical uses.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability {{and the low}} density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors. Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{newspapers}} and periodicals are published in Hindi, English, and Urdu. The Pioneer was founded in Allahabad in 1865 by George Allen. Amar Ujala, Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran, and Hindustan Dainik <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> circulation, with local editions published from several important cities. Major English language newspapers which are published and sold in large numbers are The Telegraph, The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Hindu, The Statesman, The Indian Express, and Asian Age. Some prominent financial dailies like The Economic Times, Financial Express, Business Line, and Business Standard are widely circulated. Vernacular newspapers {{such as those in}} Hindi, Nepali, Gujarati, Odia, Urdu, and Punjabi are also read by a select readership.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E

5|$|Being common, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> {{range of}} local names. The older genus name of Buchanga {{was derived from}} the Hindi name of Bhujanga. Other local names include Thampal in Pakistan, Gohalo/Kolaho in Baluchistan, Kalkalachi in Sindhi, Kotwal (=policeman) in Hindi; Finga in Bengali; Phenshu in Assamese; Cheiroi in Manipuri; Kosita/ Kalo koshi in Gujarati; Ghosia in Marathi; Kajalapati in Oriya; Kari kuruvi (=charcoal bird), Erettai valan (=two tail) in Tamil; Passala poli gadu in Telugu; Kaaka tampuratti (=queen of crows) in Malayalam; Kari bhujanga in Kannada and Kalu Kawuda in Sinhalese. A superstition in central India is that cattle would lose their horn if a newly fledged bird alighted on it. It is held in reverence in parts of Punjab in the belief that it brought water to Husayn ibn Ali, revered by Shī‘a Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, and they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> range of orbital periods, ranging from {{several years to}} potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
