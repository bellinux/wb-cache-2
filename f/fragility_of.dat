5|$|Similarly he is irreligious, {{his work}} making him {{aware of the}} <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> life and consciousness's {{reliance}} on the functioning brain. His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to the <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> the paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E

40|$|The linear {{viscoelastic}} {{response of}} polymers from a nematogenic azo- benzene methacrylate and its copolymers with nonmesogenic methyl methacrylate was studied. These samples showed thermorheological simplicity {{in the whole}} investigated temperature range, even across the nematic-isotropic transition. The temperature dependence of the zero-shear viscosity confirmed a thermorheo- logically simple behavior, which allowed interpretation of h(T) {{in the framework of}} free-volume theory. The way the relaxation mechanisms tended to their asymptotic behavior was described in terms <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> parameters, and a comparison <b>of</b> <b>fragilities</b> <b>of</b> the samples was carried out. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> and temperature dependence of viscosity provided better understanding of the way the architecture of these nematic polymers influences free-volume quantities and determines relaxation mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Tsubasa {{explores the}} <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> human {{relationships}} through Sakura losing {{all of her}} memories involving her love interest, Syaoran. Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if people have the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical study on the influence of structural passive supplemental damping systems on structural and nonstructural seismic <b>fragilities</b> <b>of</b> a critical facility. Hysteretic and viscous damping systems are used to retrofit a 4 -story steel framed prototype building assumed to be part of an acute care facility which contains different types of secondary nonstructural systems attached at various levels of the building. The recently calibrated Specific Barrier Model (SBM) is used to simulate four different ensembles of synthetic strong ground motions for a hypothetical site located on the west-coast of the United States. Each ensemble is representative of a different seismic hazard level at the site. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed to generate fragility curves for the structural system and nonstructural components based on various performance objectives. The performance of each passive supplemental damping system in reducing the seismic <b>fragilities</b> <b>of</b> both structural and nonstructural components is evaluated...|$|R

5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, the Dutch {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> the Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to the <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E

40|$|The {{necessity}} of performing a detailed seismic <b>fragility</b> analysis <b>of</b> {{nuclear power plant}} components is well established in the nuclear industry. This paper focuses on the seismic <b>fragility</b> analysis <b>of</b> the primary containment structure of a typical Indian 700 MWe PHWR. The primary emphases <b>of</b> the <b>fragility</b> analysis adopted here are the detailed nonlinear modelling along with time-history analyses and the consideration of displacement-based failure limits. Three IDA-based methods and the conventional method using scaling/safety factors are used for fragility analysis and their results are compared. Among these, a new regression-based method proposed in this work provides better results than the existing methods. A modified version of this new method for estimating fragilities for multiple limit states simultaneously also provides similar results while reducing the level of statistical computation. The conventional method <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> analysis fails to capture the (aleatory) randomness properly. In addition, compared to the peak ground acceleration, the fundamental mode spectral acceleration is {{found to have a}} better correlation with the damage measure for this structure, and is recommended for independent <b>fragility</b> analysis <b>of</b> such structures.
