5000|$|At {{the end of}} each episode, two {{judges and}} host Andrew Younghusband inspect the {{contestant}}s' worksites, and after each contestant is interviewed, deliberate on which contestant had improved the most and which contestant was named the worst. The contestant named the most improved is given the [...] "golden hard hat" [...] (a tool belt was given in the first two seasons), and is rewarded with the privilege of leading the next group challenge. The contestant named the worst (who may also be the most improved contestant) must [...] "hang their head in shame" [...] and nail their portrait to a [...] "wall of shame", and is treated to a private [...] "homework challenge" [...] with Andrew. The <b>experts</b> <b>reserve</b> the right to not name the most improved handyman or to name more than one contestant as the worst, though the former has never occurred and the latter only once. On rare occasions nominators may also be awarded the most improved or the worst for helping or hindering their nominees. On one occasion, the contestant and their nominator pair was collectively the most improved and worst.|$|E

In contrast, {{in this paper we}} argue that the approaches and theories from data visualization can form a rich contextual resource for teaching creative design principles to students. A conceptual data mapping model is proposed that describes a continuum between “traditional” data visualization applications and more artistically inclined works of “visualization art”. This model is useful to clarify conceptual relationships between different visualization design approaches, ranging from traditional data representation applications over to ambient displays to visualization art experiences. This exchange of insights from related scientific and artistic fields forms the foundation for potential collaboration initiatives in research or educational contexts. Subsequently, this aesthetic data visualization model is explained and illustrated by various student works accomplished in several creative design visualization course units...|$|R

50|$|Yoko Gake (横掛) {{is one of}} the {{original}} forty throws of judo as developed by Jigoro Kano. It belongs to the fifth group, Gokyo, of the traditional throwing list, Gokyo (no waza), of Kodokan Judo. It is also part of the current 67 throws of Kodokan Judo. It is classified as a side sacrifice technique, Yoko-sutemi. Considered one of the techniques most dangerous for the Uke, its use in competition is infrequent; contributing to the risk is that Uke does not have sufficient space to dissipate the impact of the fall adequately. Another contributing factor is the necessity for Uke to compensate in order to achieve proper rotation in executing the breakfall; if the Uke does not succeed in meeting these criteria, the force of the impact can be severe, {{even to the point of}} possible spinal injury. For these reasons, the technique is generally <b>reserved</b> <b>expert</b> Judoka.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} each episode, {{starting}} with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with a panel of four experts and Andrew for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the judges and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The <b>experts</b> also <b>reserve</b> the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving, or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned, and they are given a ride home. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's licence be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 and Canada's Worst Driver Ever.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{studies the}} subject of {{exploiting}} GIS technology to support regional e-undertakings. The paper has been drawn up {{on the basis of}} a research conducted by team of the authors from the district of Częstochowa. The research resulted in elaboration of the concept of Regional Business Spatial Community (RBSC). The authors propose the establishment of e-community using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) accessible via the Cloud Computing infrastructure enhanced with online community software. The research reveal that the most predestinated unit for the role of a coordinator of the proposed undertaking is the Office of the City of Częstochowa having adequate legal standing, experience and authority coupled with the proper GIS software. The supportive role of domain <b>experts</b> has been <b>reserved</b> to the scientists from the Częstochowa University of Technology. There are also other organizations that should take part in the project – the companies supplying utilities for the City of Częstochowa. The aim of the project is an elaboration of comprehensive software platform facilitating the public utility infrastructure investments in the city. The project encompasses choosing and preparing the proper ICT tools for RBSC, elaboration of the procedures of needed investments and indicating rules of sharing the GIS software and spatial information among the stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|The article reveals {{main reasons}} for {{developing}} tendencies to the using of new types of energy, which are limited supply of traditional fuels and environmental problems associated with its processing. It is shown that new forms of energy {{plays an important role}} in the energy supply of many countries of the world, and in the future they can become the main sources of energy to meet the growing needs of the global economy. We reveal main reasons of the increasing interest in renewable energy, and we show the obvious prospects of their use, due to two factors. First, according to <b>experts,</b> the global <b>reserves</b> of traditional fuels are limited, and secondly, this was evidenced by the investments of leading countries in this promising industry. The article lists reasons for the need for the use of renewable energy sources in Russia. Increased consumption of natural resources has become a real threat to the security of the life of human society. The basis of solving modern social and environmental problems is a transition to a regulated process of safe use of natural energy potential to meet the vital needs of people not only in the coming decades, but in the long run. It is concluded, that the determining condition for the development of the human civilization at present and in the future would be the level of natural resources which ensures the needs of the population without making harm to the environmen...|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{implementation}} of the norms enacted and promulgated on April 30, 2001 by Pope John Paul II, on May 18, 2001 Ratzinger sent a letter to every bishop in the Catholic Church. This letter reminded them of the strict penalties facing those who revealed confidential details concerning enquiries into allegations against priests of certain grave ecclesiastical crimes, including sexual abuse, which were reserved to the jurisdiction of the Congregation. The letter extended the prescription or statute of limitations for these crimes to ten years. However, when the crime is sexual abuse of a minor, the [...] "prescription begins to run from the day on that which the minor completes the eighteenth year of age." [...] Lawyers acting for two alleged victims of abuse in Texas claim that by sending the letter the cardinal conspired to obstruct justice. The Catholic News Service reported that [...] "the letter said the new norms reflected the CDF's traditional [...] "exclusive competence" [...] regarding delicta gravioraLatin for [...] "graver offenses". According to canon law <b>experts</b> in Rome, <b>reserving</b> cases of clerical sexual abuse of minors to the CDF is something new. In past eras, some serious crimes by priests against sexual morality, including pedophilia, were handled by that congregation or its predecessor, the Holy Office, but this has not been true in recent years." [...] The promulgation of the norms by Pope John Paul II and the subsequent letter by the then Prefect of the CDF were published in 2001 in Acta Apostolicae Sedis which is the Holy See's official gazette, in accordance with the 1983 Code of Canon Law, and is disseminated monthly to thousands of libraries and offices around the world.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} milling cutters is intimately {{bound up with}} that of milling machines. Milling evolved from rotary filing, {{so there is a}} {{continuum}} of development between the earliest milling cutters known, such as that of Jacques de Vaucanson from about the 1760s or 1770s, through the cutters of the milling pioneers of the 1810s through 1850s (Whitney, North, Johnson, Nasmyth, and others), to the cutters developed by Joseph R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe in the 1860s, which were regarded as a break from the past for their large step forward in tooth coarseness and for the geometry that could take successive sharpenings without losing the clearance (rake, side rake, and so on). De Vries (1910) reported, [...] "This revolution in the science of milling cutters took place in the States about the year 1870, and became generally known in Europe during the Exhibition in Vienna in 1873. However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European <b>experts</b> were very <b>reserved</b> in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the coarse pitched cutter had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When, however, the Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the coarse pitched milling cutter which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides".|$|R
