5|$|Reconstruction of the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of Vithoba worship {{has been}} much debated. In particular, several {{alternative}} theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, {{as well as the}} point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} third edition, Darwin prefaced the {{introduction}} with a sketch of the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of evangelicalism in the English speaking churches in South Africa on recent cultural <b>historical</b> <b>developments</b> This {{article focuses on}} the strong {{influence of}} a theological and ecclesiastical phenomen like evangelicalism within the English speaking churches in South Africa {{and its effects on}} cultural <b>historical</b> <b>developments</b> in contemporary South Africa. It is argued that this influence has been greatly underestimated. After a overview of <b>historical</b> <b>developments</b> in these churches the focus is sharper on a discussion of developments within South African society since 1985...|$|R

5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages. The {{delimitation}} of the Mongolian language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{paleontology}} traces {{the history of}} the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> has been closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{argues that}} {{mainstream}} economics and mainstream philosophy of natural science had {{much in common}} during the period 1945 - 1965. It examines seven common features of the two fields and suggests a number of <b>historical</b> <b>developments</b> that might help explain these similarities. The <b>historical</b> <b>developments</b> include: the Vienna Circle connection, the Samuelson-Harvard-Foundations connection, and the Cold War operations research connection...|$|R
5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} {{of water to}} transport products and raw materials, and as a resource used {{in the manufacture of}} paper, was essential to the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of paper mills in the area. Bradbourne stream, which meanders through the parish in a south-east to north-west direction, rises in East Malling, crosses under the A20 road and M20 motorway, and joins the river Medway near the Aylesford Newsprint site. Historically the {{availability of}} running water was essential to the early settlements that grew up in Kent, and to the establishment of industries in the area; such as providing power to drive the mills which ground grain.|$|E
5|$|The {{sometimes}} utopian {{concept of}} the new town, aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was {{an important part of}} Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century. In addition to the new towns of Edinburgh and Glasgow, these included the complete rebuilding of Inverary for John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll by John Adam and Robert Mylne, between 1772 and 1800. Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a gridiron plan. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a self-contained community, combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of urban planning.|$|E

5|$|Ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the <b>historical</b> <b>development</b> of a species {{in relation to their}} functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
