40|$|Rail defects are {{currently}} managed mainly by ultrasonic rail defect detection. Detecting and managing transverse cracks caused in rail heads {{is particularly important}} because they may affect transport. In general, a transverse crack branches off from a horizontal crack called a squat as shown in Fig. 1 and develops toward {{the bottom of the}} rail. In on-site ultrasonic defect detection, transverse cracks are sometimes difficult to detect because of damage on or under the rail surface (head checks or horizontal cracks) or rail head deformation due to wear. There was also a need for longitudinal continuous detection. In light of those, we have developed a rail defect detection device that detects defects from the upper <b>fishing</b> <b>surface</b> of the rail head (hereinafter, “underside of the rail head”) using phased array technology...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe lens {{influences}} retinal {{growth and}} differentiation during vertebrate eye development but the mechanisms are not understood. The {{role of the}} lens in retinal growth and development was studied in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, which has eyed surface-dwelling (<b>surface</b> <b>fish)</b> and blind cave-dwelling (cavefish) forms. A lens and laminated retina initially develop in cavefish embryos, but the lens dies by apoptosis. The cavefish retina is subsequently disorganized, apoptotic cells appear, the photoreceptor layer degenerates, and retinal growth is arrested. We show here by PCNA, BrdU, and TUNEL labeling that cell proliferation continues in the adult cavefish retina but the newly born cells are removed by apoptosis. <b>Surface</b> <b>fish</b> to cavefish lens transplantation, which restores retinal growth and rod cell differentiation, abolished apoptosis in the retina {{but not in the}} RPE. <b>Surface</b> <b>fish</b> lens deletion did not cause apoptosis in the <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> retina or affect RPE differentiation. Neither lens transplantation in cavefish nor lens deletion in <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> affected retinal cell proliferation. We conclude that the lens acts in concert with another optic component, possibly the RPE, to promote retinal cell survival. Accordingly, deficiency in both optic structures may lead to eye degeneration in cavefish...|$|R

For instance, evolution of development (evo-devo) answers questions concerning the emergence of unique organismal phenotypes resulting from changes in evolutionary and developmental forces. I am interested in studying these forces on a microevolutionary scale. To accomplish this, I use the teleost fish Astyanax mexicanus. This species, indigenous to Mexico, is comprised of two forms: a surface stream dwelling form (<b>surface</b> <b>fish)</b> and a cave dwelling form (cavefish). Cavefish, which are the evolutionary descendent of <b>surface</b> <b>fish,</b> have evolved a number of constructive and regressive features {{as a result of}} being exposed to the subterranean environment, including loss of functional eyes and melanin pigment. Thus, Astyanax is ideal for comparative studies on a microevolutionary scale. I am interested in studying changes in eye development between <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> and cavefish, and how this may relate to the evolution of the two forms. I initially utilized a comparative approach, using candidate gene, cell proliferation, and cell death studies. I extended these studies to include differential gene expression analyses as a means to better understand differences between <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> and cavefish development. To further this understanding, I ultimately performed <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> to cavefish lens transplants and <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> lens deletions to study the effect of the lens on eye development.

40|$|The characid {{fish species}} Astyanax mexicanus offers a classic {{comparative}} {{model for the}} evolution of sensory systems. Populations of this species evolved in caves and became blind while others remained in streams (i. e. <b>surface</b> <b>fish)</b> and retained a functional visual system. The flow-sensitive lateral line receptors, called superficial neuromasts, are more numerous in cavefish than in <b>surface</b> <b>fish,</b> but it is unclear whether individual neuromasts differ in sensitivity between these populations. The aims of this study were to determine whether the neuromasts in cavefish impart enhanced sensitivity relative to <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> and to test whether this aids their ability to sense flow in the absence of visual input. Sensitivity was assessed by modeling the mechanics and hydrodynamics of a flow stimulus. This model required that we measure the dimensions of the transparent cupula of a neuromast, which was visualized with fluorescent microspheres. We found that neuromasts within the eye orbit and in the suborbital region were larger and consequently about twice as sensitive in small adult cavefish as in <b>surface</b> <b>fish.</b> Behavioral experiments found that these cavefish, but not <b>surface</b> <b>fish,</b> were attracted to a 35 Hz flow stimulus. These results support the hypothesis that the large superficial neuromasts of small cavefish aid in flow sensing.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between growth rate and environmental space is an unresolved issue in teleosts. While {{it is known}} from aquaculture studies that stocking density has a negative relationship to growth, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated, primarily because {{the growth rate of}} populations rather than individual fish were the subject of all previous studies. Here we investigate this problem in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, which consists of a sighted surface-dwelling form (<b>surface</b> <b>fish)</b> and several blind cave-dwelling (cavefish) forms. <b>Surface</b> <b>fish</b> and cavefish are distinguished by living in spatially contrasting environments and therefore are excellent models to study the effects of environmental size on growth. Multiple controlled growth experiments with individual fish raised in confined or unconfined spaces showed that environmental size has a major impact on growth rate in <b>surface</b> <b>fish,</b> a trait we have termed space dependent growth (SDG). In contrast, SDG has regressed to different degrees in the Pachón and Tinaja populations of cavefish. Mating experiments between surface and Pachón cavefish show that SDG is inherited as a dominant trait and is controlled by multiple genetic factors. Despite its regression in blind cavefish, SDG is not affected when sighted <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> are raised in darkness, indicating that vision is not required to perceive and react to environmental space.

Swimming changes in zebrafish were detected at a concentration as low as 1 % of the LC 50 - 24 h within five hours. Hyperactivity was the first response, followed by a second response of <b>fish</b> <b>surfacing.</b> The change patterns of swimming speed in zebrafish were similar in all exposure groups, but the degree increased with increasing concentrations.

All plaice readily responded to infrasound down to 0. 1 Hz, which was the lowest frequency tested, with threshold values of approximately 4 xlO~ 5 ms~ 2 rms. This sensitivity is comparable to infrasound thresholds found in other fish species and it agrees with the acceler-ation thresholds for plaice in the frequency range 30 - 100 Hz. The water movements relative to the <b>fish</b> <b>surface</b> produced during stimulation were below lateral-line thresholds.

40|$|Albinism, {{the loss}} of melanin pigmentation, has evolved in a diverse variety of cave animals but the {{responsible}} evolutionary mechanisms are unknown. In Astyanax mexicanus, which has a pigmented surface dwelling form (<b>surface</b> <b>fish)</b> and several albino cave-dwelling forms (cavefish), albinism is caused by loss of function mutations in the oca 2 gene, which operates during {{the first step of}} the melanin synthesis pathway. In addition to albinism, cavefish have evolved differences in behavior, including feeding and sleep, which are {{under the control of the}} catecholamine system. The catecholamine and melanin synthesis pathways diverge after beginning with the same substrate, L-tyrosine. Here we describe a novel relationship between the catecholamine and melanin synthesis pathways in Astyanax. Our results show significant increases in L-tyrosine, dopamine, and norepinephrine in pre-feeding larvae and adult brains of Pachón cavefish relative to <b>surface</b> <b>fish.</b> In addition, norepinephrine is elevated in cavefish adult kidneys, which contain the teleost homologs of catecholamine synthesizing adrenal cells. We further show that the oca 2 gene is expressed during <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> development but is downregulated in cavefish embryos. A key finding is that knockdown of oca 2 expression in <b>surface</b> <b>fish</b> embryos delays the development of pigmented melanophores and simultaneously increases L-tyrosine and dopamine.

An Alternative hypothesis that the lung is an accessory respiratory organ during active periods, was suggested by current work which showed that Neoceratodus is more active nocturnally and surfaces to take air more often at night. Respirometry studies on juvenile fish confirmed this, for the oxygen consumption of forcibly actuve <b>fish</b> prevented from <b>surfacing</b> while in the respirometer, was consistently lower than that of <b>fish</b> allowed to <b>surface.</b> At 25 degrees C, active <b>fish</b> allowed to <b>surface</b> had an oxygen consumption of 0. 07 ml g- 1 hr- 1, derived from branchial respiration at a rate of 67 beats/min supplemented by use of the lung.

This correlation of oxygen consumption with branchial pumping emphasizes the limit placed on the fish by its gills, whereas the higher oxygen consumption exhibited by active <b>fish</b> allowed to <b>surface</b> indicates the value of the lung as an accessory respiratory organ, allowing more vigorous reaction to a stimulus than would be possible with gills only...|$|R
