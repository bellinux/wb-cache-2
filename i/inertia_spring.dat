40|$|Abstract This paper {{concerns}} {{the question of}} applicability of adaptive control strategies in real environments. Because of unrobustness to unmodeled dynamics especially dead time model reference adaptive control with all its positive features can not be implemented in industry. But it can be shown that an additional gain-controller within the MRAC-concept leads to a robust adaptive controller applicable to real systems. In this context, the paper gives a possibility of closing the gap between theory and praxis in the eld of adaptive control. As a case study, a two-mass exible servo system with unknown <b>inertia,</b> <b>spring</b> and damping constants is investigated while {{the dynamics of the}} power converter, speed-sensor and further unknown and time-varying dead-times can be neglected. The goal is a perfect dynamic tracking of the load-mass speed with a smooth control output...|$|E
40|$|A {{model system}} is {{described}} by parameters for shafts, planetary gear trains and nodes. Moments of <b>inertia,</b> <b>spring</b> stiffnesses and damping coefficients are assigned to the shafts; gear ratios and efficiencies are assigned to plaqetary gear trains. The equivalence of angular velocities and torques is demonstrated for shafts (vibration model), {{as well as for}} planetary gear trains and nodes (configuration of the system). This brings about a new view on the concept of degrees of freedom. The close relationship between gear ratios and torque ratios yields identical functions for these ratios when applied to the input and output shafts of a system, The full use of this relationship requires strict conventions of signs and an extension of the interpretation of values. The introduction of a new concept, named responsivity, expresses the relationships between torques and between powers of arbitrary shafts. With suitable equations, it becomes possible to investigate torque and power distributions exhaustively.

Consideration of cylinder pressure gives corrected stresses and also it gives scope for reduction in moving masses in valvetrain. Reduction in moving mass and valve spring stiffness has significant impact in valvetrain kinematics & dynamics. These parameters are analysed in detail in this work. Initially, kinematic and dynamic analysis on the benchmark three cylinder naturally aspirated engine valve train is performed. The impacts of in cylinder pressure (P-Ɵ) on kinematic parameters are analysed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simplistic passive dynamic model that {{is able to}} create realistic quadrupedal walking, tölting, and trotting motions. The model is inspired by the bipedal SLIP model and consists of a distributed mass on four massless legs. Each of the legs is either in ground contact, retracted for swing, or is ready for touch down with a predefined angle of attack. Different gaits, that is, periodic motions differing in interlimb coordination patterns, are generated by choosing different initial model states. Contact patterns and ground reaction forces (GRFs) evolve solely from these initial con-ditions. By identifying appropriate system parameters in an optimization framework, the model is able to closely match experimentally recorded vertical GRFs of walking and trot-ting of Warmblood horses, and of tölting of Icelandic horses. In a detailed study, we investigated {{the sensitivity of the}} ob-tained solutions with respect to all states and parameters, and quantified the improvement in fitting ground reaction force by including an additional head and neck segment. Our work suggests that quadrupedal gaits are merely different dynamic modes of the same structural system and that we can inter-pret different gaits as different nonlinear elastic oscillations that propel an animal forward.

50|$|An {{increasing}} mechanical {{advancement of}} the timing takes place with increasing engine speed. This is possible by using the law of <b>inertia.</b> Weights and <b>springs</b> inside the distributor rotate and affect the timing advance according to engine speed by altering the angular position of the timing sensor shaft {{with respect to the}} actual engine position. This type of timing advance is also referred to as centrifugal timing advance. The amount of mechanical advance is dependent solely on the speed at which the distributor is rotating. In a 2-stroke engine, this is the same as engine RPM. In a 4-stroke engine, this is half the engine RPM. The relationship between advance in degrees and distributor RPM can be drawn as a simple 2-dimensional graph.|$|R
40|$|When {{performing}} modal {{analyses of}} active flexible multibody systems, both controller effects and flexible body dynamics {{should be included}} in a multidisciplinary system model. Control system software, such as MATLAB and Simulink, usually supports both controller design and control system simulation, in which the mechanical system can be modeled with rigid bodies, lumped masses, <b>inertias,</b> <b>springs,</b> dampers or analytical equations. This will cause the flexible body dynamics to be predicted by very simplified models. In active flexible multibody dynamics software systems, such as FEDEM, feedback type controllers will typically calculate loads applied to the mechanical model based on feedback measurements of the system. This approach works well in a time domain analysis when the controller drives the mechanical model with applied loads based on the given controller algorithms. However, a major problem occurs in modal analyses of the closed-loop system. In a free vibration analysis, all loads are set to zero, which decouples the controller and mechanical model. As a result, the mechanical model becomes singular in all controlled degrees of freedom. A common approach by mechanical engineers when performing modal analyses of active flexible multibody systems is to introduce additional boundary conditions for the system degrees of freedom affected by controllers. This causes the flexibility in the different joints of the mechanism to be omitted since the joints are made rigid at relevant positions. Another common, though inaccurate, solution to this problem is to represent the controller effects by virtual <b>springs,</b> dampers and <b>inertias</b> in the mechanical model. Nonetheless, this approach is only applicable for simple control systems in which the mechanical engineer knows how to transform the controller into an equivalent mechanical model. Additionally, when designing and optimizing active flexible multibody systems, the engineer also has to update two system models simultaneously: one for the modal analysis and one for the time domain dynamic simulation. This thesis presents a method for performing modal analyses of active flexible multibody systems in a finite element environment based on the generalized eigenvalue problem. The mechanical equivalent properties of position, velocity or acceleration feedback proportionalintegral- derivative (PID) controllers are derived, and it is shown how these properties can be included into a system model appropriate for modal analysis. Controllers containing noncollocated sensors and actuators are also covered. Since the controller parameters may not be explicitly defined for the engineer working in a finite element environment, a method for deriving the controller gains for PID controllers using perturbations is also presented. Two versions of the modal analysis method are presented: one simplified n -dimensional undamped version and one complete 3 n first-order version which include all system properties. The derived theory is verified throughout this work through examples. The presented method is of relevance to mechatronic products involving vibrational issues in disciplines such as robotics, aerospace and aviation, military, etc. </p...|$|R
40|$|Parametric {{identification}} of a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) nonlinear Duffing oscillator is carried out using a harmonic balance (HB) method. The parameters of the system are obtained using a harmonic input, for the case of periodic response. Problems of matrix inversion, due to poor conditioning are sometimes encountered in the computation. This may occur due to large differences in the relative values of <b>inertia,</b> damping and <b>spring</b> forces or dependence of these parameters on one another. The inversion problem may also occur due to a poor choice of the excitation signal frequency and amplitude. However there is limited choice of adjustable input parameters in this case. In this work, an extended HB method, which uses a combination of two harmonic inputs, is suggested to overcome the above problem. Keywords:...|$|R

40|$|Vehicles {{are complex}} {{mechanical}} systems with strong nonlinear characteristics and which can present some uncertainties {{due to their}} dynamic parameters such as masses, <b>inertias,</b> suspension <b>springs,</b> tires side slip coefficients, etc. A vehicle is composed of many parts, namely the unsprung mass, the sprung mass, the suspension which makes the link between these two masses and therefore ensures passenger comfort, and also the pneumatic which absorbs the energy coming from the road and ensures contact between the vehicle and the road. In addition to its complexity {{and the presence of}} many nonlinearities and uncertainties, the presence of some external perturbations, such as the wind and the road inputs with its own characteristics (radius of curvature, longitudinal and lateral slop, road profile and skid resistance) can cause risks not only to the vehicle but also to passengers and other road users. Many methods have been developed {{in order to understand the}} behavior of a vehicle, control it and assist the driver in order to avoid possible lane departures, rollover or jackknifing risks, to ensure a better passenger comfort by means of a suspension control and/or to estimate a safety speed and trajectory.

5000|$|The Sterling {{employs a}} degree {{of what is known}} as Advanced Primer Ignition, in that the {{cartridge}} is fired while the bolt is still moving forward, {{a fraction of a second}} before the round is fully chambered. The firing of the round thus not only sends the bullet flying down the barrel but simultaneously resists the forwards movement of the bolt. By this means it is possible to employ a lighter bolt than if the cartridge was fired after the bolt had already stopped, as in Simple Blowback, since the energy of the expanding gases would then only have to overcome the bolt's static <b>inertia</b> ( [...] plus <b>spring</b> resistance [...] ) to push it backwards again and cycle the weapon; whereas in this arrangement it fights its forwards momentum as well, and thus some of it is used up. The lighter bolt makes not only for a lighter gun, but a more controllable one since there is less mass moving to and fro within it as it fires.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of two different}} models {{of a pair of}} antagonistic muscles for horizontal shoulder abduction and adduction is presented. The proposed models are based on the so called Hill-model: a mechanical framework (<b>inertia,</b> dampers and <b>springs)</b> is used for their development. The models consider as inputs the estimates of the activation states of the muscles based on digital filtering of the evoked electromyogram (eEMG). Model outputs are angular velocity and position. Both models show good results in terms of performance, but they are different in terms of number of parameters that need to be identified and in terms of physical interpretation. One of the models, in fact, describes the muscle as a spring that generates torque by changing its stiffness parameter depending on its activation level. In order to enable adaptive modelbased feed-forward and feedback control strategies for angular position/velocity control, an online-identification method based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is introduced for one of the two models.

40|$|The {{effect of}} tool joints on {{the passage of}} plane {{longitudinal}} and torsional waves along a drill pipe was studied.

The results showed that tool joints had negligible effect for exciting frequencies of the same order as common rotary speeds and the drill pipe could be taken as a uniform pipe with negligible error. Equivalent systems of rigid <b>inertias</b> and massless <b>springs</b> were developed for a drill string with a uniform drill pipe and one drill collar section, for fixed-fixed or fixed-free end boundary conditions. Undamped responses of the equivalent systems were found for arbitrary periodic forces applied to any point of the drill string. Approximate responses were derived for small damping.

40|$|By {{means of}} {{numerical}} simulations {{the effects of}} the loading system on the contact dynamics of an EHL contact during start up have been studied. The work was initiated by experimental results obtained for the start up situation on a ball on disk apparatus in which strong film thickness oscillations were observed. In this paper it is shown how much, under operational conditions as they appear in a ball on disc rig, inertia, and stiffness related to the configuration of the loading system can influence the film thickness and mutual approach. For this purpose a model was used in which the usual force balance equation has been replaced by an equation of motion for the loading system in which an <b>inertia</b> and <b>spring</b> effect appear. It was shown that for large accelerations, the loading system does induce oscillations in the film thickness, and predictive formulas for the oscillation frequency derived from a dry contact analysis are shown to be accurate. The nature of the oscillations is explained in relation to the general aspects of time dependent solutions to EHL problems. However, the predicted oscillation amplitudes are small compared to what is seen in the experiments and although some of the phenomena shown in the solutions presented here also appear in the experimental results the experimentally observed oscillatory behavior appears to be of a different nature. As the model used here has given good predictions of the dynamic behavior of single contacts in ball on disc experiments in earlier studies it is concluded that {{it is unlikely that the}} oscillatory behavior observed in the experiments is only due to the dynamics of the loading system and other effects must play a role...|$|R

The circling technique prior to performing double layout somersault dismounts from the asymmetric bars in Women’s Artistic Gymnastics appears {{to be similar to}} the “traditional” technique used by some male gymnasts on the high bar. It was speculated that as a result the female gymnasts would have margins for error similar to those of male gymnasts who use the traditional technique. However, it is unclear how the technique of the female gymnasts is affected by the need to avoid the lower bar. A four segment planar simulation model of the gymnast and upper bar was used to determine the margins for error when releasing the bar for nine double layout somersault dismounts at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The elastic properties of the gymnast and bar were modelled using damped linear springs.

40|$|In the {{existing}} reports regarding free and forced vibrations of the beams, {{most of them}} studied a uniform beam carrying various concentrated elements using Bernoulli-Euler Beam Theory (BET) but without axial force. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to utilize the numerical assembly technique to determine the exact frequency-response amplitudes of the axially-loaded Timoshenko multi-span beam carrying a number of various concentrated elements (including point masses, rotary <b>inertias,</b> linear <b>springs</b> and rotational springs) and subjected to a harmonic concentrated force and the exact natural frequencies and mode shapes of the beam for the free vibration analysis. The model allows analyzing the influence of the shear and axial force and harmonic concentrated force effects and intermediate concentrated elements on the dynamic behavior of the beams by using Timoshenko Beam Theory (TBT). At first, the coefficient matrices for the intermediate concentrated elements, an intermediate pinned support, applied harmonic force, left-end support and right-end support of Timoshenko beam are derived. After the derivation of the coefficient matrices, the numerical assembly technique is used to establish the overall coefficient matrix for the whole vibrating system. Finally, solving the equations associated with the last overall coefficient matrix one determines the exact dynamic response amplitudes of the forced vibrating system corresponding to each specified exciting frequency of the harmonic force. Equating the determinant of the overall coefficient matrix to zero one determines the natural frequencies of the free vibrating system (the case of zero harmonic force) and substituting the corresponding values of integration constants into the related eigenfunctions one determines the associated mode shapes. The calculated vibration amplitudes of the forced vibrating systems and the natural frequencies of the free vibrating systems are given in tables for different values of the axial force. The dynamic response amplitudes and the mode shapes are presented in graphs. The effects of axial force and harmonic concentrated force on the vibration analysis of Timoshenko multi-span beam are also investigated...|$|R

Specifically, in the previously cited work, the properties of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum as experienced in a Rindler constant acceleration frame were investigated, and the existence of an energy-momentum flux was discovered which, for convenience, we call the Rindler flux (RF). The RF, and its relative, Unruh-Davies radiation, both stem from event-horizon effects in accelerating reference frames. The force of radiation pressure produced by the RF proves to be proportional to the acceleration of the reference frame, which leads to the hypothesis that at least part of the inertia of an object should be due to the individual and collective interaction of its quarks and electrons with the RF. We call this the quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis. We demonstrate that this approach to inertia is consistent with general relativity (GR) and that it answers a fundamental question left open within GR, viz. is there a physical mechanism that generates the reaction force known as weight when a specific non-geodesic motion is imposed on an object?
