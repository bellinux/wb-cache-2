2500|$|In 1981, Goldstein wrote a letter, {{published}} in The New York Times, {{which said that}} Israel [...] "must act decisively to remove the Arab minority from within its borders", which [...] "could be accomplished by initially offering encouragement and incentives to Arabs to leave of their own accord". The harsh reality is: if Israel is to avert facing the kinds of problems found in Northern Ireland today, it must act decisively to remove the Arab minority from within its borders. This could be accomplished by initially offering encouragement and incentives to Arabs to leave of their own accord, just as the Jewish population of many Arab countries has been persuaded to leave, one way or another. Before instinctively defending democracy as inviolate, Israelis should consider whether {{the prospect of an}} Arab majority electing 61 Arab Knesset members is acceptable to them. <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> soon have to choose between a Jewish state and a democratic one.

Four years before the massacre, an agent of Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, who had infiltrated Kach, passed a warning to his superiors about the danger posed by Goldstein.
