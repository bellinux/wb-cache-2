5|$|Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut (April 28, 1940 – July 24, 1998), was {{the first}} African American to lie in honor at the Capitol. Chestnut is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His funeral {{included}} a speech by President Bill Clinton and a <b>fly-over</b> by military jets in a missing man formation. A United States Post Office located in Fort Washington, Maryland has been renamed in their honor.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} <b>fly-over</b> reserved for his death and asked that the <b>fly-over</b> be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E
5|$|When the New Jersey Department of Transportation started {{construction}} on upgrading the bypass, the <b>fly-over</b> ramp and on-ramp {{to and from}} Route172 were torn down for {{construction of a new}} interchange along a new local/express format. The overpass was closed on October 12, 2007 to begin the construction. The bridge was built by 1955 and was replaced in 2008. On January 2, 2009, the new exit ramp for Route18 to Route172 was reopened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September 2003, three Israeli Air Force F-15 Eagles {{performed}} a <b>fly-over</b> of Auschwitz-Birkenau during a {{ceremony at the}} camp below. The flight was led by Major-General Amir Eshel, the son of Holocaust survivors. On 27 January 2015, some 300 Auschwitz survivors and other guests gathered under a giant tent {{at the entrance to}} Auschwitz II Birkenau to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation. Attendees included president of the World Jewish Congress Ronald Lauder, film director Steven Spielberg, and world leaders such as Polish president Bronisław Komorowski and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. As the number of remaining survivors decreases each year, the attendance at the event is unlikely to be surpassed at future major anniversaries.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber <b>fly-over,</b> the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key {{objective}} of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a <b>fly-over</b> to connect {{the southern end of the}} new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with installation of three new rail-specified, rubber-tired gantry cranes ExpressRail Newark is being expanded {{from two to}} four, doubling the rail track to 10,000 feet, and adding a new <b>fly-over</b> bridge. Work {{is expected to be}} completed in 2015.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1917, {{the last}} new station was opened at 151st Street on Eighth Ave, where the {{structure}} was expanded to 4 tracks and an express <b>fly-over</b> was installed to optimize traffic to the Bronx and 155th Street terminal operations.|$|E
25|$|Madison was host to Rhythm and Booms, {{a massive}} {{fireworks}} celebration coordinated to music. It {{began with a}} <b>fly-over</b> by F-16s from the local Wisconsin Air National Guard. This celebration was the largest fireworks display in the Midwest in length, number of shells fired, {{and the size of}} its annual budget. Effective 2015, the event location was changed to downtown and renamed Shake The Lake.|$|E
25|$|The first metro proposal, from 2009, {{called for}} the line to be built as {{a branch of the}} Kolsås Line from Ullernåsen. Except for a short portion at the {{southern}} end, the entire line was proposed in a tunnel. After Ullernåsen the line would have only three stations, Lysaker, Telenor Arena and Fornebu Senter. However, additional stations were considered. Eight hourly services were proposed, which could or could not continue from Majorstuen through the Common Tunnel. Further plans called for an upgrade to allow a <b>fly-over</b> at Makrellbekken, on the Røa Line.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} Inauguration Day, Ronald Reagan, himself a {{longtime}} California resident and former Governor {{of the state}} from 1967–75, became the first president {{to participate in a}} Super Bowl coin toss ceremony. However, he did it from the White House via satellite. Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Hugh McElhenny, a former 49er, was on the field during the ceremony. The U.S. Air Force provided four T-37 aircraft from nearby Mather Air Force Base (Sacramento, CA) and its 455th Flying Training Squadron for the <b>fly-over.</b> At $255 per hour of flying time for each aircraft, this T-37 flyover ranks as the most economical in the history of Super Bowls. In addition, all the pilots were young officers symbolizing California as the land of opportunity and youth.|$|E
25|$|The {{air show}} began {{as part of}} the annual Portland Rose Festival in 1988. Early names of the event {{included}} the Maxwell House Rose Festival Airshow and the U.S. Bank Rose Festival Airshow, and the event was held in June or July. The 1989 event, held in June, drew 296,000 spectators. In 1991, during a performance an aircraft wing walker had to be lowered into a speeding truck on the runway as the plane flew just above the ground after the performer had become entangled. The 1992 show included both the Blue Angels and a flight team from Russia flying SU-27s. This show marked the first time in post Cold War history that a former Soviet flight team performed in the U.S. The show had a three-day total of 122,000 visitors. The 1993 show was the first show that had rain during the event, and had a <b>fly-over</b> by an F-117A stealth fighter.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} service and celebration of life honoring Bob Hoover {{was held on}} November 18, 2016, hosted by aerobatic legend Sean D. Tucker and world renowned pilot Clay Lacy at the Van Nuys Airport. Nearly 1,500 family and friends attended the memorial, with speakers such as Hollywood icon Harrison Ford, film producer David Ellison, Jonna Doolittle (granddaughter of Jimmy Doolittle) and many others. The event culminated with the United States Air Force Honor Guard presenting the American Flag to the family - which coincided with a three element <b>fly-over.</b> The lead element featured a Rockwell Sabreliner similar to that which Hoover flew during airshows, along with two F-16s from the USAF Thunderbirds and a CT-114 from the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. The second element featured the USAF Heritage Flight with an F-22 Raptor and two F-86 Sabres, and {{the third and final}} installment featured a four-ship World War II warbird flight, with the P-51 Ole' Yeller pulling up in the missing man formation on the final note of Taps.|$|E
25|$|The N7 leads {{directly}} into the M7 motorway at the Maudlin's Interchange near Naas (junction 9 on the N7-M7 corridor), and proceeds southwestwards, bypassing Naas, Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, Ballybrittas, Portlaoise, Mountrath, Borris-in-Ossory, Roscrea, Moneygall, Toomevara, Nenagh and Annacotty. As of December 2010, the M7 is approximately 186km in length and ends at the Rosbrien interchange (junction 30) outside Limerick. Here, the road connects to the Limerick Southern Ring Road - Phase 2 and continues as the N18. At junction 30 {{there is also a}} slip-road to the M20 Limerick - Cork/Kerry road. Along this section of the M7 there is a <b>fly-over</b> for the N24 Limerick to Waterford road at junction 29. Southwest of Portlaoise it forms an interchange with the M8 Dublin-Cork motorway at junction 19 and at junction 11 there is an interchange with the M9 Dublin - Waterford motorway. There are plans to widen the Naas bypass to 3 lanes in each direction from Junction 9 to Junction 11. Also included in the plans is to construct a new interchange between Junctions 9 and 10 at Osberstown to connect with Sallins and Millennium Park in Naas.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} (between 11:00 and 11:15am), Alpha, Bravo {{and the six}} RMP's were within [...] of each other, but unable to {{communicate}} or group together; Alpha and Bravo Companies were completely unaware that the RMPs were even in the town and vice-versa, {{even though they had}} all gone through the same Ops Room that morning. An Army Air Corps (AAC) Gazelle helicopter was dispatched to act as a re-broadcast unit between Alpha, Bravo and the Ops Room. Critically, it had also been given orders for a <b>fly-over</b> of the police station to determine if the six RMPs were still there. At 11:05am, a Chinook with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was deployed from Abu Naji to go into Majar al-Kabir and support Bravo Company.|$|E
2500|$|The {{start of}} the game was delayed by lengthy pre-game ceremonies {{featuring}} the French Blue Devils, performances by the U. of M. army and navy bands and the M.A.C. bands, parades by the Students' Army Training Corps and Naval Units, and a <b>fly-over</b> by former Michigan football captain Pat Smith in his aeroplane. [...] Because of the delay, the game was concluded in darkness. The Aggies {{took advantage of the}} darkness late in the game by unleashing a passing attack. The Aggies scored late in the game, [...] "as the darkness already had begun to enshroud the playing field," [...] on a pass from Archer to Schwei. The Detroit Free Press reported: [...] "But for the review of the service corps and the ceremonies attending there hardly would have been an Aggie score." ...|$|E

Michigan scored two touchdowns in the second quarter on a short run by Abe Cohn and a fumble recovery and return by Angus Goetz. Quarterback Mike Knode scored Michigan's final touchdown in the third quarter on a 30-yard run after faking a pass.

2500|$|KTVU {{had used}} the [...] "KTVU News Theme" [...] by Michael Randall as the primary theme music for its newscasts from 1987 (debuting {{alongside}} a custom title sequence for the 10:00p.m. newscast that was updated in 1994 and used until 2001, featuring a CGI <b>fly-over</b> of the Bay Area showcasing the program's title logo gliding across {{the waters of the}} San Francisco Bay) until the package was replaced on June 23, 2010 by a new 615 Music-composed theme called [...] "Icon News". In the 2000s, Channel 2 became the last news-producing English language station in the Bay Area to begin utilizing a helicopter for news gathering, with the introduction of News Chopper 2 (now known as SkyFox as part of the rebranding by Fox after its acquisition). On October 10, 2006, KTVU became the first television station in the Bay Area (and the third Cox-owned station, after Atlanta flagship WSB-TV and WFTV in Orlando) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; with the upgrade, the station debuted a new state-of-the-art studio designed for HD newscast production, which replaced the previous set that had been in use since 1986 (with refreshes in 1993, 1999 and 2004); video from remote and field equipment was initially broadcast in 480p standard definition following the transition; high definition cameras are now utilized for field reports.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent protests {{have not}} had as {{significant}} an impact but did result in panic buying in 2005 and again in 2007. The 2007 fuel protests were put together by {{several members of the}} old [...] "TransAction group" [...] from the South of England, reforming as [...] "TransAction 2007". The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 trucks descending on Central London with the police closing off the A40 <b>fly-over</b> for use as a truck park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at Marble Arch. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many truck owner operators and farmers would have supported the Conservative Party. The Conservative leader David Cameron gave them his support and promised a “fair fuel stabiliser”, a proposal to limit the price of petrol {{that was part of the}} Conservative manifesto for the 2010 UK general election and was announced to be implemented following the budget of March 2011. The “fair fuel stabiliser” which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the oil price rises but the tax will be capped at the level of inflation at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation. Quote from [...] "Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates" [...] section 3.44: [...] "When oil prices are high, as now, fuel duty will increase by the retail prices index (RPI). However, if the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government will increase fuel duty by RPI plus 1 penny per litre. The Government believes that a trigger price of $75 per barrel would be appropriate, and will set a final trigger price and mechanism after seeking the views of oil and gas companies and motoring groups".|$|E
