All these applications require the servers of the Data Center to exchange huge amounts of data between them. In order to withstand such high throughput the Data Center Network must provide ultra-large capacity. Moreover, low latencies are also mandatory, especially when a tight synchronization between servers is required. Several forecasts predict a threefold increase in the global Data Center traffic between the years 2012 and 2017. Furthermore, a 76 % of such traffic is expected to be produced inside Data Centers. Unfortunately, current multi-tier hierarchical tree-based Data Center Network architectures which rely on Ethernet or Inifiniband are neither flexible nor scalable enough to meet the expected growth previsions. Such limitations have mandated a renewed investigation into the introduction of ultra-highbandwidth and low-latency optical technologies in Data Center Networks. Several architectures for Data Center Networks have been proposed but none of them provides a high degree of scalability at a reasonable cost.

Optical interconnects are energy efficient and support massive bandwidths. The performance of {{optical interconnect}}s {{is directly related to}} the type of <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques used. <b>Optical</b> <b>switches</b> may be categorized into slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> The <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques are <b>Optical</b> Circuit <b>Switching</b> (OCS), <b>Optical</b> Packet <b>Switching</b> (OPS) and <b>Optical</b> Burst <b>Switching</b> (OBS). This thesis presents three novel optical interconnection schemes which are based on <b>optical</b> burst <b>switching.</b> These schemes are called Hybrid <b>Optical</b> <b>Switch</b> Architecture (HOSA), HOSA with Traffic Demand Scheduling (TDS) and Fast <b>Optical</b> <b>Switch</b> Architecture (FOSA). The first two schemes are based on a hybrid design that utilizes fast and slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> while the third scheme is based on using only fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> The proposed schemes consider OBS with a two-way reservation protocol that ensures zero burst loss. In the two-way reservation protocol, the connection is established for each burst before transmission. To evaluate the performance of these schemes, network-level simulation is used. The proposed architectures consider a single stage core topology that can be easily scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network reconfiguration. The proposed schemes feature separate data and control planes. The control plane comprises a centralized controller while the data plane contains an array of <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> A scalability analysis of the proposed topology is presented and shows that this topology is scalable to hundreds of thousands of servers. This thesis also presents a trade-off between cost and power consumption of the proposed designs by comparing them with conventional interconnects using analytical modelling. In HOSA, the key idea is to route high volume traffic through a fast <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> during the reconfiguration of a slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch.</b> The traffic is moved to the slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> once it is reconfigured. The aggregated traffic should be large enough so that it can bypass the slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> during its reconfiguration phase. This technique hides the reconfiguration time of slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> but the latency introduced due to burst aggregation is still high. In HOSA with TDS, small bursts are considered to reduce the latency of burst aggregation. The controller in HOSA with TDS technique maintains a traffic demand matrix which updates traffic demand on periodic intervals and assigns slow paths for the high traffic volume. A resource allocation algorithm is proposed that allocates paths of fast and slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> efficiently. In HOSA with TDS, the control plane can only support applications that have high traffic stability. So for dynamically changing communication patterns, this thesis presents a new design called FOSA. The FOSA is based on only fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and it also uses OBS with the two-way reservation i. e. there is no additional burden on the control plane for maintaining traffic demands as was done in HOSA with TDS. The proposed technique shows considerable improvement in terms of throughput and packet loss ratio as compared to the traditional methods of OBS while performance comparable in terms of delay with the traditional methods of OBS is also achieved. The proposed technique also demonstrates performance comparable to that of electrical data centre networks. The performance of TCP over traditional OBS network is degraded by the bursts losses due to contention even at a low traffic load. In FOSA, the performance of the TCP is evaluated. Since in the proposed scheme, the burst loss is zero due to two way reservation, the results show significant improvement of TCP performance in terms of throughput, time and packets loss as compared to the traditional methods of OBS and the conventional electronic packet switching data centre networks for all types of workloads...|$|R
