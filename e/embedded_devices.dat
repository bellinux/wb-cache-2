40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new communication protocol named XMC {{which is designed}} for the transmission of messages between an <b>embedded</b> <b>device</b> and a remote system. A new markup language called XMDD has also been developed and is {{used to describe the}} functional profile of the <b>embedded</b> <b>device.</b> The main advantage of the XMC communication protocol is its flexibility and independence from the device type. It is suitable for communication with devices that have a curtailed amount of working memory (a few kB) and limited computing power, i. e. 8 -bit or 16 -bit microcontrollers. Messaging between the <b>embedded</b> <b>device</b> and the remote systems is done without any interference with the basic source code of the <b>embedded</b> <b>device,</b> thus allowing access to all functionalities and features of the connectable <b>embedded</b> <b>device</b> and is based on the functionality dictionary and built-in features of an <b>embedded</b> <b>device.</b> It also maintains a low production price for the <b>embedded</b> <b>device</b> and from the programming point of view provides a transparent and flexible upgrade of the hardware and software without any redundancy input...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The modern <b>embedded</b> {{multimedia}} electronic <b>devices</b> rely on dynamically-allocated data {{structures to}} store and process their data, as a result, the demand of its memory capacity and dynamic are increasing unceasingly. In {{order to better}} solve the memory application optimization in <b>embedded</b> <b>device,</b> this paper represents multimedia application’s dynamic data structures optimization flow and improved or modified NSGA-II multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MNSGA-II), and uses three objective functions: <b>embedded</b> <b>device’s</b> memory accesses, memory use and energy consumption. The MNSGA-II algorithm adopts repeat crowded distance sorting tactics to improve NSGA-II based on keeping {{the advantage of the}} original NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization problem. The experiment results show that MNSGA-II has better performance of the convergence and the diversity of solutions than original NSGA-II, and the optimal dynamic data structure implementation is successful by performing our method for one real <b>embedded</b> multimedia <b>device’s</b> memory application...|$|R
