50|$|Gahal {{joined the}} {{government}} {{on the first day}} of the Six-Day War, with both Begin and the Liberal's Yosef Sapir becoming a Minister without Portfolio; Ben-Gurion's Rafi also joined, with Moshe Dayan becoming Defense Minister. The national unity government was Begin's own brainchild. This had a significant positive effect on his image. Critics agree that it was a major turning point in Herut's road to power, since it granted it the legitimacy it had been denied up until then. The national unity government was more than an <b>emergency</b> <b>solution</b> in a time of existential danger; it reflected a relaxation of ideological tension, which enabled the government to outlive the emergency. Moreover, Begin and Ben-Gurion were reconciled. Ben-Gurion needed him in his bitter rivalry with Eshkol and Begin surprised his adversary by proposing to Eshkol that he should step aside in favor of Ben-Gurion as the leader of an emergency government. The proposition was turned down, but Ben-Gurion, who recently had compared Begin to Hitler now praised his responsibility and patriotism.|$|E

However, a high degree of autonomy is granted to local schools when it comes to organizing and preparing for the reform.

40|$|Swedish {{child-care}} institutions - day nurseries, kindergartens - did {{not until}} the 1930 s become a concern of the Government. In 1943 the Swedish Riksdag {{for the first time}} passed a bill that gave child-care institutions a Government subsidy. This thesis deals with the Government's and the parliamentary commissions' attitudes to child-care institutions. Which type of institution ought to receive a subsidy? And for what reasons? The main argument for child-care institutions has always been that they could stimulate a sound development, for the child's own good and for society's. From the 1930 s and into the 1950 s most participants in the child-care debate stated that the kindergarten or part-time institutions for the pre-school child from the age of three and upwards was the preferable type. Day nurseries for children, even infants, of families were both parents had to work might be necessary but were to be seen as an <b>emergency</b> <b>solution.</b> From the mid- 60 s the attitu-de changed. Step by step full-time day nurseries became the institutions that were given priority by the Government. This change in attitude presupposes that the notion of the child changed as well. But it did not change in a vacuum. Borrowing an explanatory model from sociologist Johan Asplund, the thesis treats the child as a "figure of thought", placed between a super-structural discourse on child-care and society's basic, material conditions. Important changes at the level of discourse have been the attitude to modern, industrial society, e. g. the necessity of learning to live and work in a society which is complex, highly specialized and in constant change, and the debate on women's emancipation. At the level of material conditions, the most conspicious change is that more and more women have entered the labour market. The changing notion of the child can be understood as the effect of an influence from discourse and base on the "figure of thought". At the same time, the "figure of thought" in-fluenced the discourse. Thus, a child-care system for the benefit of child and woman and labour market could be established, and harmony could be created, at least in the discourse...|$|E

Due to their strong technical requirements, gas and hydro power plants are the almost exclusive provider of FCR. Since gas power plants are becoming less profitable in Europe, a lot of efforts are deployed into FCR diversification. This paper assesses the potential for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to deliver FCR combined with a slow-moving thermal power plant and other <b>emergency</b> <b>solutions</b> such as load shedding and dissipating resistances. A proportional-integral energy management control loop is used whose parameters are tuned by an economic evaluation. We show that economic opportunity already exists today. Some limitations are discussed due to simplifying assumptions. The best solution consists of a 1 MW/ 1. 4 MWh battery and a 0. 09 MW power plant per MW of provided FCR reducing by 90 % the reservation on power plants.

Identifying the types of pollutants is necessary after detecting the presence of pollutants to provide warning information about pollutant characteristics and <b>emergency</b> <b>solutions.</b> Thus, a real-time contaminant classification methodology, which uses the multi-classification support vector machine (SVM), is proposed in this study to obtain the probability for contaminants belonging to a category. The SVM-based model selected samples with indistinct feature, which were mostly low-concentration samples as the support vectors, thereby reducing {{the influence of the}} concentration of contaminants in the building process of a pattern library. The new sample points were classified into corresponding regions after constructing the classification boundaries with the support vector. Experimental results show that the multi-classification SVM-based approach is less affected by the concentration of contaminants when establishing a pattern library compared with the cosine distance classification method. Moreover, the proposed approach avoids making a single decision when classification features are unclear in the initial phase of injecting contaminants...|$|R

The operational model involves end-users who are on call as first responders, providers of critical information, and a coordinating authority. Extraordinary access to information is allowed to occur only during emergencies, and only in a confined emergency partition, which is unavailable before the emergency and can be completely purged after the emergency. As all information remains within its assigned partition, after the emergency the system can meaningfully enforce its pre-emergency access control policy.

In this paper, the geographical distribution of the species based on published sampling data focused on large branchiopods and temporary pools in Andalusia and the entire Iberian Peninsula is assessed. The current situation is summarized based on the threats to their survival, which are mainly related to habitat alteration. In the Iberian Peninsula, at least 1, 648 bodies of water (about 720 in Andalusia) have been explored. Prevalence data suggest that L. baetica is a rare species (localities with presence / sample locations = 6. 07. 10 - 4).
