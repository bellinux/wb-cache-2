25|$|In the 1970s, Thomas Gold {{proposed}} {{the theory that}} life first developed not {{on the surface of}} the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface.

Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis for}} the modern {{understanding}} of orbits was first formulated by Johannes Kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion. First, {{he found that the}} orbits of the planets <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> are elliptical, not circular (or epicyclic), as had previously been believed, and that the Sun is not located {{at the center of the}} orbits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously been thought, but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planets, the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter, 5.23/11.862, is practically equal to that for Venus, 0.7233/0.6152, in accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} Mormon writers (such as W.

The hypothesis is also based on a passage from the Book of Abraham stating that in the Garden of Eden, time was measured [...] "after the Lord's time, which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed to Adam his reckoning". According to the hypothesis, the reason that Earth time was measured in Kolob time was because the Earth was physically located near Kolob. As a corollary, some Mormon writers argue that at the end times, the Earth will be plucked from the solar system and returned to its original orbit near Kolob.|$|E
40|$|Context. The <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> {{was most}} likely born in a star cluster {{containing}} at least 1000 stars. It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced various properties of the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> like its chemical composition, size and the orbital parameters {{of some of its}} constituting bodies. Aims. In the Milky Way, clusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types- starburst clusters and leaky clusters- each following a unique temporal development in the mass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in the range relevant to <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> formation for starburst or leaky cluster environments as a function of cluster age. Methods. N-body methods are used to investigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions between cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Results. Using the now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is demonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first 5 Myr are so high (initially> 105 Mpc− 3) that hardly any discs with <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> building potential would survive this phase. This makes a starburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> Instead it is highly probable that the <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> formed in a leaky cluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an encounter determining the characteristic properties existing <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> most likely happened very early on (< 2 Myr) in its formation history and that after 5 Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an encounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the bound remnant.
