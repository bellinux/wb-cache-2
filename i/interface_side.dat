50|$|A {{networked}} server {{making use}} of industry standard communications networking to the SCADA host may provide performance approaching that of an embedded ICCP application. On the application <b>interface</b> <b>side</b> the ICCP is not restricted to the SCADA environment but is open to other systems such as a separate data historian or other databases. Security may be easier to manage with the ICCP server segregated from the operational real time systems. The gateway processor approach {{is similar to the}} networked server except it is intended for legacy systems with minimal communications networking capability and so has the lowest performance. In the most minimal situation the ICCP gateway may communicate with the SCADA host via a serial port in a similar manner to the SCADA RTUs.|$|E
50|$|The HyperBrowser {{allows a}} range of genomic {{investigations}} (for example, including regulation of gene expression, disease association or epigenetic modifications of the genome). The primary focus {{of the system is}} on statistical inference on relations between genomic tracks, though simpler descriptive statistics and analysis of individual tracks is also supported. An example of analysis is to investigate the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression, using ChIP-based tracks of histone modifications versus tracks of genes marked with expression values from a microarray experiment. The web server includes a sizable collection of annotation tracks, and also supports user-uploaded tracks. The Genomic HyperBrowser runs as a stand-alone system, but is tightly integrated with the Galaxy scientific workflow platform for handling of genomic data, especially at the user <b>interface</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

We might hope that improvements in interface design would tend to reduce these side effects. Unfortunately, history reveals just the opposite: The incidence and severity of motion sickness (for example) is positively related to the progressive sophistication of display technology and systems. In this presentation, I enquire about the future of interface technologies in relation to side effects. I review the types of side effects that occur and what is known about the causes of <b>interface</b> <b>side</b> effects.

30|$|Ideally, {{there should}} be at least 15 -mm {{distance}} between the primary pathology and the origin of major branch vessel, such as the left subclavian artery. Involvement of the major branch vessel may preclude the use of endovascular stent or require pre-procedural “de-branching”, e.g. with a left carotid to subclavian bypass graft and coil occlusion of the native left subclavian artery ostium (Fig.  21). If the stent has to be placed through branch vessels, fenestrated grafts with openings in the graft fabric to accommodate the ostia of branch vessels may be used. These orifices can then be fixed by implanting bare or covered stents across the graft/ostial <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Side</b> or bypass grafts can also be used. Covered grafts can be used over the origin of the left subclavian arteries if patency of both the vertebral arteries is demonstrated. Hence precise analysis of the branches and angle of the branches with respect to each other is critical.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Resistive {{switching}} {{characteristics are}} investigated for Al/TiOx/Al devices, {{particularly for the}} structural effects in crossbar and via-hole-type devices. The via-hole structure shows more reliable switching characteristics than the crossbar structure, owing to the elimination of possible edge effects. The asymmetric switching behavior is analyzed with top Al/TiOx and bottom Al/TiOx interfaces. A trap-controlled space-charge-limited-current model is proposed as a possible switching mech-anism, and it is verified that switching mainly occurs on the top electrode/TiOx <b>interface</b> <b>side.</b> Index Terms—Crossbar structure, resistance random access memory (RRAM), resistive switching, space-charge-limited con-duction, via-hole structure, metal–insulator–metal (MIM).

40|$|An oxide {{heterostructure}} made of manganite bilayers and ferroelectric perovskites {{is predicted}} {{to lead to the}} full control of magnetism when switching the ferroelectric polarizations.

This charge disproportionation can be enhanced or suppressed by the ferroelectric polarization. Quantum model and density functional theory calculations reach the same conclusion: a ferromagnetic-ferrimagnetic phase transition with maximal change $> 90 %$ of the total magnetization can be achieved by switching the polarization's direction. This function is robust and provides full control of the magnetization's magnitude, not only its direction, via electrical methods. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} spatial {{information}} sharing and harmonisation has {{become of the}} uttermost importance in the European context, with the European Community strongly engaged not only in political and economic changes and integration, {{but more and more}} tackling technical and scientific problems. In the field of geospatial information, the need for harmonised and interoperable data is now a key topic both for users and producers of geodata. This has brought the initiatives related to the INSPIRE Directive, recently entered into force and soon to be receipted by national legislative frameworks, and to the GMES programme, now entered into its operational phase, both of them oriented to enable cross-border and cross-sector usage of geoinformation, aiming at the realization of the future European Spatial Data Infrastructure (ESDI). The HUMBOLDT project, started in October 2006, is supported by the European Community through the 6 th Framework Programme and has the aim of bring together a variety of scientific, technical, economic and policy driven points of view with the aim of implementing a Framework for harmonisation of data and services in geoinformation domain. The two-pronged approach of HUMBOLDT comprises a technical side of framework development and an application side of scenario testing and validation, through an iterative refinement of the harmonisation solutions provided within the project. The Architecture of the HUMBOLDT Framework has been based on an approach which comprises as the fundamental part a Mediator Proxy able to support standard <b>interfaces,</b> <b>side</b> by <b>side</b> with specialized <b>interfaces</b> and also supporting the description of transformation rules from the viewpoint of the conceptual schema level.

XIRQL The query language XIRQL [1] extends the XPath part of the query language XQuery (proposed standard of the W 3 C) by the following features: Weighting and ranking: While XQuery supports Boolean retrieval only, XIRQL allows for weighting document terms as well as query terms. Thus, retrieval results are presented to users as a ranking. Relevance-oriented search: Traditional IR queries specify only the requested content, but pose no restrictions on the structure of the result. In the ca...|$|E
40|$|An {{interface}} between an oxide and an electrolyte {{gives rise to}} various processes as exemplified by electrostatic charge accumulation/depletion and electrochemical reactions such as intercalation/decalation under electric field. Here we directly compare typical device operations of those in electric double layer transistor geometry by adopting A-site vacant perovskite WO_ 3 epitaxial thin films as a channel material and two different electrolytes as gating agent. In situ measurements of x-ray diffraction and channel resistance performed during the gating revealed that in both the cases WO_ 3 thin film reaches a new metallic state through multiple phase transitions, accompanied by the change in out-of-plane lattice constant. Electrons are electrostatically accumulated from the <b>interface</b> <b>side</b> with an ionic liquid, while alkaline metal ions are more uniformly intercalated into the film with a polymer electrolyte. We systematically demonstrate this difference in the electrostatic and electrochemical processes, by comparing doped carrier density, lattice deformation behavior, and time constant of the phase transitions.

40|$|The {{nucleation}} {{and growth}} of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) polycrystalline diamond films were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Pronounced tip effects were observed for early-stage diamond nucleation attributed to tip convolution in the AFM images. AFM images of the films cross-section and interface however were not affected by tip convolution, and the images indicate that the surface of the silicon substrate is initially covered by small grained polycrystalline-like film and the formation of this precursor film is followed by nucleation of the diamond film on top of this layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscoy (XPS) spectra indicates that some silicon carbide is present in the precursor layer...|$|E
