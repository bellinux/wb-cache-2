40|$|The {{goal was}} to make {{available}} a <b>delayed-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> of mesalazine to be dispersed in water to facilitate swallowing in adults and children. Mesalazine microparticles containing carnauba wax were prepared by spray-congealing technique. A second step of spray-congealing of carnauba microparticles dispersed in liquefied stearic acid gave rise to mesalazine lipid microcapsules in which several carnauba microparticles remained embedded as cores in a reservoir structure. In order to favor their water dispersion, the lipid microcapsules were dry coated by tumbling them with different ratios of mannitol/lecithin microparticles prepared by spray-drying.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the claimed acid-resistant {{properties}} and other performance indicators for AR Caps (Capsule 5 from CapsCanada) and DRcaps (Capsule 6 from Capsugel) and compare them with the immediate release hydroxypropyl methylcellulose “HPMC ” capsules (K-CAPS from CapsCanada). Methods: Shell weight variability, reaction to different relative humidity conditions, empty shells response to stress under the absence of moisture, powder leaking, disintegration and dissolution properties were assessed. Results: Shell weight variability was highest among Capsule 4. At 45 % RH and 23 oC different types of capsules had similar loss on drying (LOD range: 5. 23 % – 6. 68 %). In the absence of moisture and following the application of a stress, empty Capsule 4 shells performed the best with the highest percentage of intactness of capsules (80 %) followed by Capsule 6 (50 %) and then Capsule 5 (20 %). Both disintegration and dissolution test results for Capsule 4 deemed satisfactory for conventional release purposes, but Capsule 5 and 6 do not comply with the USP requirement for <b>delayed-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> None of the tested capsules have the ability to protect hygroscopic encapsulated material from humid conditions as generally claimed. Conclusion: While HPMC capsule made for conventional release properties may be fit for that purpose, the new generation of capsules designed to protect the ingredient from the acid environment of stomach have not performed in such a manner as to comply with the USP requirements for disintegration and dissolution of <b>delayed-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>form...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{described}} agglomeration of drug microparticles {{blended with}} excipient microparticles {{is a technique}} for the size enlargement of micronized products that could be damaged by granulation or compaction techniques. These agglomerates {{can be used as}} oral prompt or <b>delayed-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> administered as they are or dispersed in a liquid. The composition and quantity of the excipient microparticles resulted to be the crucial factors for the agglomerate quality. Therefore, adjusting the content of surface-active agent between 8 - 20 % of the excipient microparticles, it is possible to agglomerate microparticles of drugs that could not be agglomerated per se. Increasing the surfactant concentration in the spray-dried excipient microparticles or increasing the fraction of these excipient microparticles in the blend, the agglomeration was improved. The spray drying technique concentrates the surface-active agent on the microparticle surface. By tumbling, the surface-active agent present on microparticles excipient surface was spread to fill the inter-particle interstices of drug particles giving rise to more resistant agglomerates. This phenomenon occured also by vibration; the production in thi case was quicker...|$|R
40|$|Soft agglomerates {{containing}} pantoprazole gastro-resistant microparticles {{were prepared}} for an oral <b>delayed-release</b> solid <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> A new technique was used to agglomerate the microparticles: enteric microparticles of pantoprazole, non-agglomerating per se, were blended with mannitol/lecithin spray-dried microparticles, i. e., excipient microparticles. The blend was agglomerated by tumbling or sieve vibration. In order to elucidate the agglomerate formation, the effect of {{factors such as the}} amount of lecithin in the excipient microparticles, the ratio between pantoprazole and excipient microparticles and the agglomeration method were investigated by factorial design. Twelve batches of agglomerates presenting differing yield, drug loading, morphology, mechanical and release properties were prepared.

The advanced {{drug delivery}} systems bring higher compliance and convenience to patients. And more importantly, they improve drug efficacy and reduce side effects. Modified-release or delayed-release drug delivery systems are two major designs of the controlled release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> The modified-release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> provide slow and continuous drug delivery, while the <b>delayed-release</b> <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> control the drug delivery to specific sites. These <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> {{can be made by}} different strategies. This work presents the use of plant-derived materials taking advantages of their natural properties to make a controlled release capsule or <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> Corn zein is a hydrophobic protein having unique solubility and other properties which are favorable for developing a delayed-release capsule. Pure zein capsule can be very brittle and this hinders its use in pharmaceutical industry. In this project, the mechanical strength of the zein capsule was improved by plasticization. The effects of three types of plasticizers, i. e. oleic acid, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerol, on the mechanical behavior, water vapor permeability (WVP), and structural morphology of the zein films were investigated. The supramolecular structures of the plasticized films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Changes in the secondary structure of the films were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy equipped with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR). Chemical interactions between the plasticizers and zein molecules were examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Water solubility and disintegration tests were also carried out for the zein capsules made. After characterization by the above tests, oleic acid-plasticized zein capsules were selected with satisfactory mechanical strength and good resistance to disintegration in liquid media. Dissolution studies of the capsules were performed showing that zein capsules have certain resistance to gastric digestion. Another plant-based material was also used in this project, which was pectin. Pectin is well-known for its indigestibility in the stomach and small intestine, and being degradable in the colon. However, its swelling property causes premature release making controlled delivery infeasible. Zein and pectin have very different behavior in their physical properties and digestibility. Combining zein and pectin has a potential in <b>forming</b> colon-specific delivery <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> We proposed that zein and pectin formed complex by hydrogen bonding as observed from FTIR-ATR. Characteristic structures of the zein-pectin <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> were presented in the SEM images. From the swelling test, the swelling behavior of pectin was suppressed by zein in the zein-pectin interacted complex. Protection of zein against protease digestion by pectin was shown to be effective from the in vitro performance of drug release. These indicate that combination of zein and pectin may be a promising controlled drug delivery system. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical TechnologyM.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce {{production}} costs, a simple, direct compression delayed release formulation consisting of pantoprazole was investigated. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor belongs to group of benzimidazole. It is very efficient for the treatment of gastric and duodenum ulcers. Even in solid state pantoprazole is sensitive to heat, humidity, light and especially to substances containing an acidic group. For such types of drugs, enteric coating added to the formulation tends to avoid the stomach's acidic exposure, delivering them instead to a basic pH environment where they do not degrade, and give their desired action. Subcoating is desirable to protect the enteric coating. Opadry and Acryl-EZE systems have been utilized for subcoating and enteric coating respectively. Delayed-release tablets with good physical, mechanical and technological properties were obtained with use of different combinations of diluents, binders, superdisintegrants and lubricants. A comparative kinetic study of the present tablets and commercial tablets was established. The value for the similarity factor (f 2 = 71. 6) suggested that the dissolution profile of the present two <b>delayed-release</b> oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are similar.

40|$|Among all <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> tablet is {{the most}} popular <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> {{existing}} today because of its convenience of self administration, compactness and easy manufacturing; sometimes immediate onset of action is required than conventional therapy in many cases. So that to overcome these drawbacks, immediate release <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> has emerged as alternative oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Immediate drug release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> disintegrate rapidly after administration with enhanced rate of dissolution. The basic approach used in development tablets is the use of superdisintegrants like Cross linked Polyvinylpyrrolidone or crospovidone (Polyplasdone), Sodium starch glycolate (Primogel, Explotab), carboxymethylcellulose (Croscarmellose) etc. These superdisintegrants provide instantaneous disintegration of tablet after administration in stomach. In this field immediate release liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and parenteral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> have also been introduced for treating patients. In liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> can be suspensions with typical dispersion agents like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, AOT (dioctylsulfosuccinate) etc. The development of immediate release therapy also provides an opportunity for a line extension in the marketplace, a wide range of drugs e. g., neuroleptics, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, antihistamines and other drugs can be considered candidates for this <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> As a drug entity nears the end of its patent life, it is common for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop a given drug entity in a new and improved <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> A new <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> allows a manufacturer to extend market exclusivity, while offering its patient population a more convenient <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> or dosing regimen.

Hydralazine hydrochloride, isoniazid and phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride were adversely affected due to interactions with excipients in the formulation, while the effect of the preservative in lowering the pH in a levothyroxine sodium mixture resulted in decreased stability. Interestingly, the instability in these formulations is primarily due to interactions between the drug substance and the excipients rather than degradation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient by standard routes such as oxidation, hydrolysis, photolysis or thermolysis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pharmaceutical {{industry}} {{is no longer}} allowed to develop new medicines for use in adults only, as the 2007 Paediatric Regulation requires children to be considered also. The plans for such paediatric development called Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs) are subject to agreement by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the key characteristics of oral paediatric medicines in the PIPs and the changes implemented as a result of the EMA/PDCO review. METHODS: All PIPs agreed by 31 December 2011 were identified through a proprietary EMA-database. PIPs were included if they contained an agreed proposal to develop an oral medicine for children 0 to 11 years. Information on the therapeutic area (EMA classification system); target age range (as defined by industry) and pharmaceutical characteristics (active substance, <b>dosage</b> <b>form(s)</b> as listed in the PIP, strength of each <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> excipients in each strength of each <b>dosage</b> <b>form)</b> was extracted from the EMA website or the EMA/PDCO assessment reports. RESULTS: A hundred and fifty PIPs were included corresponding to 16 therapeutic areas and 220 oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> in 431 strengths/compositions. Eighty-two PIPs (37 %) included tablets, 44 (20 %) liquids and 35 (16 %) <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> with a specific composition/strength that were stored as a solid but swallowed as a liquid e. g. dispersible tablets. The EMA/PDCO review resulted in an increase of 13 (207 to 220) oral paediatric <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and 44 (387 to 431) <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> with a specific composition/strength. For many PIPs, the target age range was widened and the excipient composition and usability aspects modified. CONCLUSION: The EMA/PDCO review realized an increase in the number of requirements for the development of oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and a larger increase in the number of <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> with a specific composition/strength, both targeting younger children. Changes to their pharmaceutical design were less profound...|$|R
40|$|Mucoadhesive drug {{delivery}} systems {{interact with the}} mucus layer covering the mucosal epithelial surface, and mucin molecules and increase the residence time of the <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> {{at the site of}} absorption. The drugs which have local action or those which have maximum absorption in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) require increased duration of stay in GIT. Thus, mucoadhesive <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are advantageous in increasing the drug plasma concentrations and also therapeutic activity. In this regard, this review covers the areas of mechanisms and theories of mucoadhesion, factors influencing the mucoadhesive devices and also various mucoadhesive <b>dosage</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the pharmaceutical industry have led to an enormous increase in the variety of <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> available to the formulator. The stability of active compounds {{as well as the}} target site of the active material will govern the selection of the <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> which is used in a given case. The design of pharmaceutical <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> requires not only a detailed knowledge of basic physical and chemical principles and states of aggregation, but also an understanding of the anomalies, transitions and interactions between different states of matter...|$|R
40|$|Effective gastroretentive drug {{delivery}} systems (GRDDS) {{depend upon the}} {{factors such as the}} gastric emptying process, gastrointestinal transit time of the <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> drug release from the <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> and the site of drug absorption. Rapid GI transit leads to incomplete drug release from the <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> in the absorption zone. This {{led to the development of}} GRDDS. Several approaches cited in the literature (1 – 4) include muco-adhesion, swelling or expansion, modified shape systems, floatation, gastric emptying delaying devices (5) or simultaneous administration of gastric emptying delaying drugs...|$|R
