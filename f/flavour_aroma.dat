50|$|Tahri (also tehri, tehari or tayari) is {{a yellow}} rice dish in Awadhi cuisine. The spices {{are added to}} plain cooked rice which gives it spicy taste and yellow color.

It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawab rulers in South Asia. Tehri became more popular during the Second World War when the meat prices increased substantially and potato became the popular substitute in biryani. It is prepared by adding the potatoes to the rice as opposed to the case of traditional Biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, Tehari is sold as street food.|$|E

40|$|Fermented {{cocoa bean}} {{is the main}} {{ingredient}} of chocolate products because through fermentation the required flavour and aromas can be obtained. The proper fermentation methods applied is a must in order to produced chocolate with high quality because the specific aromas compound cannot be obtained from incomplete fermentation of the beans. Fermentation is carried out by microorganisms that dominating the fermentation inoculum. The microorganism {{that have been found}} to be important in order to reached cocoa fermentation succession are yeast, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria as their activities will affect the physical and chemical properties of the fermented cocoa bean. Chemical that have been synthesized by those microorganisms will affect the taste and colour of the cocoa bean. By regulating the fermentation culture and pod storage practice, high fermented cocoa bean quality can be produced. By using starter cultures from specific species of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria with an accurate percentage of inoculum, the result for cocoa fermentation can be increase in term of <b>flavour,</b> <b>aroma</b> or colour. Pod storage that have been suggested to be applied by cocoa bean produced in Malaysia which is 21 days can be practiced as it is proved that pod storage an affect the properties of cocoa bean.

Here we use next-generation sequencing approaches to examine and quantify the roles of native forests, vineyard soil, bark, and fruit habitats as sources of fungal diversity in ferments.

Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, <b>flavour</b> and <b>aroma.</b> Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil.

40|$|Roasting {{of cocoa}} beans is a {{critical}} stage for development of its desirable <b>flavour,</b> <b>aroma</b> and colour. Prior to roasting, cocoa bean may taste astringent, bitter, acidy, musty, unclean, nutty or even chocolate-like, depends on the bean sources and their preparations. After roasting, the bean possesses a typical intense cocoa flavour. The Maillard or non-enzymatic browning reactions {{is a very important}} process for the development of cocoa flavor, which occurs primarily during the roasting process and it has generally been agreed that the main flavor components, pyrazines formation is associated within this reaction involving amino acids and reducing sugars. The effect of cocoa nib roasting conditions on sensory properties and colour of cocoa beans were investigated in this study. Roasting conditions in terms of temperature ranged from 110 to 160 OC and time ranged from 15 to 40 min were optimized by using Response Surface Methodology based on the cocoa sensory characteristics including chocolate aroma, acidity, astringency, burnt taste and overall acceptability. The analyses used 9 - point hedonic scale with twelve trained panelist. The changes in colour due to the roasting condition were also monitored using chromameter. Result of this study showed that sensory quality of cocoa liquor increased with the increase in roasting time and temperature up to 160 OC and up to 40 min, respectively. Based on the Response Surface Methodology, the optimised operating condition for the roaster was at temperature of 127 OC and time of 25 min. The proposed roasting conditions were able to produce superior quality cocoa beans that will be very useful for cocoa manufactures.

40|$|Tomato fruit {{quality is}} a complex trait {{involving}} a number of components, including appearance, <b>flavour,</b> <b>aroma</b> and texture. There is a large range of genetic diversity in tomato for fruit quality components. Although a few major mutations may have a huge effect on fruit quality (notably the rin mutation), most of the components have a quantitative inheritance. Several Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping experiments have been performed, mostly on interspecific progeny. Many loci and QTL have thus been detected, revealing some QTL cluster regions. Tomato is a model plant for fruit development and composition, and knowledge about its physiology is rapidly increasing.
