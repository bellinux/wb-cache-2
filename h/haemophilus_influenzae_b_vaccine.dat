40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of cutaneous neoplasms at immunization sites following vaccination is uncommon, and only few {{have been reported}} in the literature worldwide. We report an unusual case of an ulcerated giant dermatofibroma that developed as a chronic nonhealing plaque in the immunization scar of a young boy after vaccination. Case Report: A 13 -month-old Chinese boy presented with an unusual skin reaction on the vaccination site at the right anterolateral thigh following a routine intramuscular injection of ‘ 5 -in- 1 ’ (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> <b>B)</b> <b>vaccine</b> at 4 months of age. The immunization site developed a slightly raised papule with a central punctum that progressively grew in size, ulcerated and showed occasional bleeding over a span of 9 months. On follow-up, the lesion showed a chronic granulomatous reaction with surrounding induration and a central scarring. The right inguinal lymph node was palpable. Ultrasound of the lesion showed only nonspecific focal skin thickening. An incisional skin biopsy with careful histopathological evaluation revealed microscopic features consistent with an ulcerated giant dermatofibroma. Conclusion: Neoplastic development in immunization scars following vaccination is a rare occurrence and, hence, makes this case a diagnostic challenge. A high index of suspicion is crucial in atypical presentations of a common skin lesion, as typified by this case. Careful history taking and clinicopathological correlation of clinical findings with gross and microscopic findings along with targeted immunohistological staining is often essential to aid early diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|AIM—The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the immunogenicity of an early, extra dose of enhanced inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) administered simultaneously with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) to preterm infants shortly after birth.  METHODS—Three groups were studied. Fifty preterm infants received IPV intramuscularly within 24 hours of birth, in addition to routine recommended childhood immunisations. Fifty two preterm infants and 35 full term infants received routine immunisations only (routine vaccination timing: HBV at birth, 1 and 6 months of age; IPV at 2 and 4 months; oral polio vaccine (OPV) at 4 and 6 months; diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) at 2, 4, and 6 months; and <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine</b> at 2 and 4 months). Blood samples were taken at birth, 3 and 7 months of age from all infants, and at 1 month of age from preterm infants only.  RESULTS—At birth, a lower percentage of both study and control preterm infants had antipoliovirus type 3 titres ⩾ 1 : 8 than full term infants. At 1 and 3 months of age significantly more early IPV infants had antipoliovirus type 3 titres ⩾ 1 : 8 than routinely vaccinated preterm infants (p < 0. 05). At 7 months of age {{there were no significant differences}} in percentage of antipoliovirus titres ⩾ 1 : 8 or geometric mean times (GMTs) between the early IPV group and the routinely vaccinated preterm group. At 3 and 7 months of age, the percentage of positive antihepatitis B titres (⩾ 1 : 10) and the GMT of the early IPV preterm group did not differ significantly from those of preterm controls. There was no significant difference in percentage of positive antihepatitis B titres between the early IPV group and full term controls at any time. GMTs for hepatitis B antibodies were significantly lower in the early IPV preterm group than in full term controls at 3 and 7 months of age.  CONCLUSIONS—Administration of an additional dose of IPV simultaneously with routine HBV to preterm infants shortly after birth provides early protection from poliovirus and hepatitis B infection, and does not interfere with poliovirus antibody production at the age of 7 months. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: People {{affected}} with {{sickle cell}} disease {{are at high risk}} of infection from <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b.</b> Before the implementation of <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate vaccination in high-income countries, this was responsible for a high mortality rate in children under five years of age. In African countries, where coverage of this vaccination is still extremely low, <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> {{remains one of the most}} common cause of bacteraemias in children with {{sickle cell disease}}. The increased uptake of this conjugate vaccination may substantially improve the survival of children with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine whether <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate <b>vaccines</b> reduce mortality and morbidity in children and adults with sickle cell disease. The secondary objectives were to assess the following in children and adults with sickle cell disease: the immunogenicity of <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate vaccines; the safety of these vaccines; and any variation in effect according to type of vaccine, mode of administration (separately or in combination with other vaccines), number of doses, and age at first dose. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group 2 ̆ 7 s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies to identify unpublished trials. Date of last search: 23 November 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate <b>vaccines</b> with placebo or no treatment, or comparing different types of <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate <b>vaccines</b> in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate <b>vaccines</b> in people with sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: There is an absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials relating to the subject of this review. AUTHORS 2 ̆ 7 CONCLUSIONS: There has been a dramatic decrease in the incidence of invasive <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> infections observed in the post-vaccination era in people with sickle cell disease living in high-income countries. Therefore, despite the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials, it is expected that <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate <b>vaccines</b> may be useful in children affected with sickle cell disease, especially in African countries where there is a high prevalence of the disease. The implementation of childhood immunisation schedules, including universal <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> conjugate vaccination, may substantially improve the survival of children with sickle cell disease living in low-income countries. We currently lack data to evaluate the potential effect of <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> vaccination among unvaccinated adults with sickle cell disease.

40|$|SLE. 7 18 – 20 These {{patients}} develop acquired hypocomplementaemia due to immune com-plex {{activation of}} the classical pathway leading to consumption of C 3 and C 4, resulting in defective opsonisation and chemotaxis, 21 or the terminal membrane attack complex forma-tion 22 and increased risk of infection. The persistent consumption of C 3 may also affect the ability to activate the alternative pathway; the very low C 2 and C 4 levels prevent the complement activation via the MBL pathway. Our patient’s C 4 level has not returned to normal, raising the question of abnormal C 4 alleles. C 4 B deficiency {{has been linked to}} meningococcal disease, but as for MBL defi-ciency, this typically presents in childhood. 23 Our patient had acquired classical comple-ment pathway deficiency as seen in active SLE; simultaneously she had MBL deficiency, which acted as a contributing factor to her increased susceptibility to meningococcal infection. Management of complement deficiency con-sists primarily of preventive measures includ-ing immunisation with polysaccharide and available conjugated meningococcal, pneumo-coccal and <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> <b>b</b> <b>vaccines.</b> In addition, the patient should be educated to early recognise signs and symptoms of menin-gitis. Conclusion A high index of suspicion for an underlying complement deficiency should arise when a patient presents with recurrent meningococcal disease or a disease caused by uncommon serogroups, particularly Y, W 135, and X.

40|$|Vaccination has {{provided}} major {{benefits to the}} health of indigenous children in the face of continuing poorer socioe-conomic conditions but several issues have been identified for improvement.

Improved identification of indigenous clients by immunisation providers and the expansion of the childhood register are required. The progressive removal of early-acting <b>Haemophilus</b> <b>influenzae</b> type <b>b</b> <b>vaccines</b> from schedules for indigenous children because of an international shortage raises the risk of disease re-emergence and highlights the need for vigilant surveillance including carriage.
