5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for <b>gourd)</b> is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in the <b>gourd</b> family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known}} as cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as squash, pumpkin, or <b>gourd</b> depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of <b>gourd,</b> also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E

Larger <b>gourds</b> were used as cooking vessels.Eastern Woodland Natives hung bottle <b>gourds</b> on poles in their cornfields to serve as habitats for insect-eating birds (a form of biological pest-control, which the Native Americans developed). Native Americans in Northern Peru also used bottle <b>gourds</b> as floats for fishing nets.|$|R

Fairburn {{before moving on}} to Rotorua in 1950 where he began a series of {{photographic}} studies of mudpools and silica formations around Rotorua and Taupo. He returned to Auckland in 1952 and shifted his artistic focus to Maori designs in Moko (facial tattooing), carved <b>gourds,</b> and kowhaiwhai (rafters of meeting houses). He began to grow and carve his own <b>gourds</b> in 1956-57. He moved to the East Coast in 1961 to study traditional carving techniques with the Maori carver Pine Taiapa and was encouraged to publish an article on growing <b>gourds</b> in the Maori magazine Te Ao Hou in 1962 to accompany an article on carved <b>gourds.</b> In 1963 his <b>gourds</b> were the only artwork by a Pakeha (non-Maori) featured in an exhibition of Maori art held at Turangawaewae marae, Ngaruawahia. Most of Schoon's <b>gourds</b> were sold to tourists and only a few remain in New Zealand today.|$|R
50|$|The most {{traditional}} lacquered objects in Mexico {{are made from}} <b>gourds</b> that grow on vines (genus Lagenaria) or on trees (genus Crescentia) and are called by various indigenous names. Bottle-like <b>gourds</b> are generally cut so that the narrower top end serves as a lid. These containers are called sewing boxes or powder containers, but they are generally used to store knickknacks. Rounder <b>gourds</b> are cut to make cups or bowls.|$|R

5|$|Hyderabadi cuisine {{comprises}} a broad {{repertoire of}} rice, wheat and meat dishes and the skilled use of various spices. Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem, with their blend of Mughlai and Arab cuisines, carry the national Geographical Indications tag. Hyderabadi cuisine is influenced {{to some extent}} by French, but more by Arabic, Turkish, Iranian and native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines. Popular native dishes include nihari, chakna, baghara baingan and the desserts qubani ka meetha, double ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer (a sweet porridge made with sweet <b>gourd).</b>|$|E
5|$|Slaveowners {{and state}} governments tried to prevent slaves from making or playing musical {{instruments}} because {{of the use of}} drums to signal the Stono Rebellion in 1739. Blassingame, however, points out that in spite of restrictions, slaves were able to build a strong musical tradition drawing on their African heritage. Music, songs, and dances were similar to those performed or played in Africa. Instruments reproduced by slaves include drums, three-stringed banjos, <b>gourd</b> rattles, and mandolins.|$|E
50|$|The ipu <b>gourds</b> {{were more}} often left undecorated, {{although}} the koko (carrying nets) for the <b>gourds</b> were often highly ornamental. Some styles of carrying nets were even reserved only for royalty and the punishment for a commoner using these special ipu was death.|$|R

Struck <b>gourds,</b> placed on a cloth and struck with sticks, {{are a part of}} women's music, as well as the bòòríí cult dances. Sometimes, {{especially}} in the north, <b>gourds</b> are placed upside-down in water, with the pitch adjusted by the amount of air underneath it. In the south-west, a number of tuned <b>gourds</b> are played while floating in a trough.|$|R
5|$|The food offerings {{made to the}} {{ancestors}} are usually cooked in silver or copper vessels and typically placed on a banana leaf or cups made of dried leaves. The food must include Kheer (a type of sweet rice and milk), lapsi (a sweet porridge made of wheat grains), rice, dal (lentils), the vegetable of spring bean (guar) and a yellow <b>gourd</b> (pumpkin).|$|E
5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a <b>gourd</b> dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} xerophytes, arid zone {{perennials}} with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo <b>gourd</b> (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E

5|$|Within C.pepo, the pumpkins, the scallops, and {{possibly}} the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of C.pepo have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C.pepo, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental <b>gourd,</b> and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.|$|E
5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and <b>gourd</b> is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle <b>gourd,</b> bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{species of}} the genus Cucurbita {{were present in the}} Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is {{southern}} Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back only to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to Bryonia, dates to the Paleocene. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. C.moschata can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid. The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene nad1 show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include C.digitata (calabazilla), and C.foetidissima (buffalo <b>gourd),</b> C.palmata (coyote melon), and C.pepo. Some species, such as C.digitata and C.ficifolia, are referred to as gourds. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Gourd</b> Dance is a Kiowa dance ceremony. It is {{believed}} that the dance originated with the Kiowa. First it is a man's dance. It is often danced by Warriors/Veterans, although the <b>Gourd</b> Dance has its own unique history. <b>Gourd</b> Dancing may precede the pow-wow {{or it can be}} a separate event, not directly connected with a pow-wow. The <b>Gourd</b> Dance was not only held to honor a warrior, or honor their enemy who they defeated. It honors all Warriors & Veterans. The final song is the Buffalo song.|$|E
25|$|At pow wows {{where there}} is a large Southern Plains {{community}} in the area, the <b>Gourd</b> Dance is often included {{before the start of the}} pow wow sessions. The <b>gourd</b> dance originated with the Kiowa tribe, whence it spread, and is a society dance for veterans and their families. Unlike other dances, the <b>gourd</b> dance is normally performed with the drum in the center of the dance arena, not on the side.|$|E

25|$|The chant (mele) is {{typically}} {{accompanied by an}} ipu heke (a double <b>gourd)</b> and/or pahu (sharkskin covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ipu (single <b>gourd),</b> iliili (waterworn lava stone castanets),uliuli (feathered <b>gourd</b> rattles), pu`li (split bamboo sticks) or kalaau (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called kahiko, while the modern version is auana. There are also religious chants called oli; when accompanied by dancing and drums, it is called mele hula pahu.|$|E
25|$|By 10,000 BCE {{the bottle}} <b>gourd</b> (Lagenaria siceraria) plant, {{used as a}} {{container}} {{before the advent of}} ceramic technology, appears to have been domesticated.
