25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{provides a}} more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a tosylate or triflate). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a <b>dehydrohalogenation.</b> For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see Zaitsev's rule). Two common methods of elimination reactions are <b>dehydrohalogenation</b> of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols.

25|$|Specialty alkynes are {{prepared}} by <b>dehydrohalogenation</b> of vicinal alkyl dihalides or vinyl halides. Metal acetylides can be coupled with primary alkyl halides.

5000|$|In general, the {{reaction}} of haloalkane with potassium hydroxide can compete with an SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction by OH− [...] a strong, unhindered nucleophile.

50|$|Traditionally, alkyl halides are {{substrates}} {{for this}} <b>dehydrohalogenations.</b> The alkyl halide {{must be able}} to form an alkene, thus methyl and benzy halides are not suitable substrates.

2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{is useful for}} preparation of several types of RLi compounds, particularly aryllithium and some vinyllithium reagents. The utility of this method is significantly limited, however, by the presence in the reaction mixture of n-BuBr or n-BuI, which can react with the RLi reagent formed, and by competing <b>dehydrohalogenation</b> reactions, in which n-BuLi serves as a base: ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{numerous}} attempts, cyclobutadiene {{was first}} synthesized in 1965 {{by a team}} led by Rowland Pettit of the University of Texas, although they could not isolate it. Cyclobutadiene can be generated through degradation from a cyclobutadiene metal compound, for example cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl with ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate. This cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl complex was prepared from 2 (...) 9 and cis-dichlorocyclobutene in a double <b>dehydrohalogenation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{creating}} a molecule with the halogen substituted with something else, one can completely eliminate both the halogen and a nearby hydrogen, thus forming an alkene by <b>dehydrohalogenation.</b> For example, with bromoethane and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in ethanol, the hydroxide ion HO− abstracts a hydrogen atom. [...] Bromide ion is then lost, resulting in ethylene, H2O and NaBr. Thus, haloalkanes {{can be converted}} to alkenes. [...] Similarly, dihaloalkanes {{can be converted to}} alkynes.|$|E

50|$|In the laboratory, more {{directed}} and more delicate processes are employed such as <b>dehydrohalogenations</b> and condensations. Myriad {{methods have been}} developed, such as the Whiting reaction. Families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the oligomerization and dimerization of conjugated dienes.

40|$|We have {{exploited}} {{a typically}} undesired elementary step in cross-coupling reactions, β-hydride elimination, to accomplish palladium-catalyzed <b>dehydrohalogenations</b> of alkyl bromides to form terminal olefins. We have applied this method, which proceeds in excellent yield {{at room temperature}} {{in the presence of}} a variety of functional groups, to a formal total synthesis of (R) -mevalonolactone. Our mechanistic studies have established that the rate-determining step can vary with the structure of the alkyl bromide and, most significantly, that L 2 PdHBr (L = phosphine), an intermediate that is often invoked in palladium-catalyzed processes such as the Heck reaction, is not an intermediate in the active catalytic cycle.

2500|$|These side {{reaction}} are significantly less important for RI than for RBr, since the iodine-lithium exchange is several {{orders of magnitude}} faster than the bromine-lithium exchange. [...] For these reasons, aryl, vinyl and primary alkyl iodides are the preferred substrates, and t-BuLi rather than n-BuLi is usually used, since the formed t-BuI is immediately destroyed by the t-BuLi in a <b>dehydrohalogenation</b> reaction (thus requiring 2 equiv of t-BuLi). [...] Alternatively, vinyl lithium reagents can be generated by direct reaction of the vinyl halide (e.g. cyclohexenyl chloride) with lithium or by tin-lithium exchange (see next section).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{is devoted}} to the {{preparation}} of unsubstituted 1 - and 2 -phosphabutadienes. 2 -Phosphadiene 3 a is formed by HCl-elimination of the (chloromethyl) vinylphosphine 8 and 1 -phosphadienes 1 by 1, 4 -dehydrochlorination of the corresponding (chloroallyl) phosphine 13 a (1 a) and by FVT of diallylphosphines 15 a,b via a retro-ene reaction (1 a,b). All the <b>dehydrohalogenations</b> occurred either in solution at low temperature with a Lewis base or in the gas phase (VGSR). Whichever the method used, only the opened structures 1 a,b and 3 a have been observed both in solution {{as well as in the}} gas-phase. 2 -Phosphabutadiene 3 a has been unambiguously characterized in solution by 1 H and 31 P NMR. Adducts of 1 a and 3 a were isolated when 2 -propanethiol was introduced either with the Lewis base and chlorophosphine precursors 8 and 13 a or with the condensed products from the VGSR and FVT apparatus (vacuum gas-phase dehydrochlorination of 8 and 13 a and thermolysis of the diallylphosphine 15 a). Other structural evidence for 1 a,b and 3 a has been given by coupling the VGSR or FVT apparatus with the IR, MS, and PE spectrometers. In particular, the PE spectra of the opened chains 1 a and 3 a have been qualitatively estimated (Koopman's approximation and direct calculation (CIPSI)). These results are consistent with the experimental IP values [9. 28 eV (πCP - πCP), 9. 96 eV (nP), 11. 14 eV (πCP + πCP) for 3 a, 9. 00 eV (πCP - πCP), 10. 13 eV (nP), 11. 47 eV (πCP + πCP) for 1 a].
