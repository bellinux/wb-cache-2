40|$|In this study, we have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the caloric content of a physiological test meal on the gastric emptying kinetics of solids and liquids. 22 healthy male volunteers were studied in two groups matched for age. After an overnight fast, each volunteer underwent the same test procedure; in the first group (G I), 10 volunteers received a meal consisting of bread, 111 In-DTPA water and 1 scrambled egg labeled with 99 mTc-labelled sulphur colloid; in the second group (G II) 12 volunteers were given the same meal but with 2 labeled eggs in order to increase the caloric content of the solid phase meal. Simultaneous anterior and posterior images were recorded using a dual-headed gamma camera. Solid and liquid geometric mean data were analyzed to determine the lag phase, the emptying rate and the half-emptying time for both solids and liquids. Solid and liquid gastric half-emptying times were significantly prolonged in G II compared to G I volunteers. For the solid phased, the delay was accounted for by a longer lag phase and a decrease <b>in</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>emptying</b> rate. The emptying rate of the liquid phase was significantly decreased in G II compared to G I. Within each group, no statistically significant difference was observed between solid and liquid emptying rates. We conclude that the caloric content of the solid portion of a meal not only alters the emptying of the solid phase but also affects the emptying of the liquid component of the meal. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|At <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>empty</b> ribosomes freely transit {{between the}} rotated and un-rotated states. In {{translation}} elongation, the binding of two translation elongation factors {{to the same}} general region of the ribosome stabilizes them {{in one of the}} two extremes of intersubunit rotation; rotated or unrotated. These stabilized states are resolved by expenditure energy in the form of GTP hydrolysis. Here, mutants of the early assembling integral ribosomal protein uL 2 (universal L 2) are used to test the generality of this hypothesis. A prior study employing mutants of a late assembling peripheral ribosomal protein suggested that ribosome rotational status determines its affinity for elongation factors, and hence translational fidelity and gene expression. rRNA structure probing analyses reveal that mutations in the uL 2 B 7 b bridge region shift the equilibrium towards the rotated state, propagating rRNA structural changes to all of the functional centers of ribosome. Shift <b>in</b> structural <b>equilibrium</b> affects the biochemical properties of ribosomes: rotated ribosomes favor binding of the eEF 2 translocase and disfavor that of the elongation ternary complex. This manifests as specific translational fidelity defects, impacting the expression of genes involved in telomere maintenance. A model i...|$|R

40|$|The {{photoreaction}} of bacteriorhodopsin was {{studied in}} moderately dehydrated films (relative humidities between 100 and 65 %). Time-resolved difference spectra from a gated optical multichannel analyzer, between 100 ns and 100 ms after photoexcitation, were decomposed into sums of difference spectra of the intermediates K, L, M, N, and O, and the kinetics obtained were fitted to various alternative schemes. The data confirm {{the model of}} a single reaction sequence with reversible reactions we proposed recently for purple membrane suspensions (Váró, G., and J. K. Lanyi.

In 1974, L. Montejano [2] solved it as follows. Theorem. If a body D ⊂ R 3 rests <b>in</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>in</b> every direction, then its convex hull C(D) must be a sphere.

In this note, we give a simple proof of the 2 -dimensional case of the above theorem. The reader can prove the 3 -dimensional case in the same way. Let D ⊂ R 2 be a connected closed region. Then, by the definition, the centroid G of D is an interior point of the convex hull C(D) of D. For every unit vector u⃗, there is a line l orthogonal to u ⃗ such that l ∩ D, ∅ and PQ · u ⃗ 5 0 for every P ∈ l, Q ∈ D. (1) Figure 1 shows the situation.
