5000|$|The BMW K1300R is a naked {{motorcycle}} made by BMW from 2008 to 2015. When launched, it {{replaced the}} K1200R as BMW's flagship urban motorcycle. BMW says the K1300R produces [...] @ 9,250 rpm and 140 Nm torque @ 8,250 rpm from its [...] inline-four engine. The engine was subtly modified by British company Ricardo plc.It has an <b>exhaust</b> <b>butterfly</b> flap to boost torque and improve exhaust note. The K1300R features BMW's optional ESA-II electronic suspension adjustment. The bike {{also has a}} conventional indicator switch {{instead of the usual}} BMW three button configuration.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the design and}} development of the Moderate and Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion burner using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The CFD commercial package was used to simulate preliminary designs for the burner before the final design was sent to workshop for the fabrication. The burner is required to be a non-premixed and open burner. To capture and use the exhaust gas, the burner was enclosed within a large circular shaped wall with an opening at the top. An external EGR pipe was used to transport the exhaust gas which was mixed with the fresh oxidant. To control the EGR and <b>exhaust</b> flow, <b>butterfly</b> valves were installed at the top opening as a damper to close the exhaust gas flow at the certain ratio for EGR and exhaust out to atmosphere. High temperature fused silica glass windows were installed to view and capture images of the flame and analyse the flame propagation. The burner simulation shows that MILD combustion was achieved for the oxygen mole fraction between 3 - 13 %. The final design of the burner was fabricated and ready for the experimental validation. ...|$|R
