5|$|Although {{commercial}} {{areas are}} growing rapidly, agriculture remains {{a foundation of}} the economy in the rural areas of the southern part of El Hatillo. The business sector remains mostly underdeveloped, causing heavy employee movement <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the municipality – a problem that has made the transportation infrastructure of El Hatillo very congested.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} {{shipping}} channel <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Port of New York and New Jersey, making it {{the only means of}} accessing an important commercial port. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E

The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the actual}} and outer {{structures}} {{that make up}} and surround the United Nations Headquarters are the inner groups that play a role as well. The Security Council containing 5 permanent and 10 temporary {{for a total of}} 15 members, ensures the stabilization of peace and security whether in terms of threats or simple adjustments. A heavier focus on actual activities like debating in policymaking, and reflecting <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the environment, is conducted by the Economic and Social Council.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents move <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to {{the high cost of}} maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS {{knew what was going}} on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

A crisis headquarters was set up to coordinate the defence {{of the city and the}} manufacture of weapons in industrial plants which had been modified for their production.|$|E
5|$|Detectives traced three {{distinct}} polonium trails <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> London, at three different dates, {{which according to}} the investigation suggests Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun made two failed attempts to administer polonium to Litvinenko before the final and successful one. The first attempt took place on 16 October 2006, when radioactive traces were found in all places visited by the FSB operatives before and after their meeting with Litvinenko. They administered the poison to his tea, {{but he did not}} drink it.|$|E

5|$|Following {{cooperation}} between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation, homeless people, street children and beggars are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and Homeless People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre. The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and street children, {{as well as a}} flophouse. As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E
