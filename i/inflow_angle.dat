Second, one can go further and consider the pressure drop induced in wake rotation.

40|$|A single {{rotation}} model propeller (SR- 7 A) {{was tested}} at simulated takeoff/approach conditions (Mach 0. 2), in the NASA Lewis 9 - by 15 -Ft Anechoic Wind Tunnel. Both unsteady blade surface pressures and noise measurements {{were made for}} a tractor configuration with propeller/straight wing and propeller alone configurations. The angle between the wing chord and propeller axis (droop angle) was varied along with the wing angle of attack {{to determine the effects}} on noise and unsteady loading. A method was developed that uses unsteady blade pressure measurements to provide a quantitative indication of propeller inflow conditions, at least for a uniform (across the propeller disk) <b>inflow</b> <b>angle.</b> The wing installation caused a nearly uniform upwash at the propeller inlet as evidenced by the domination of the pressure spectra by the first shaft order. This <b>inflow</b> <b>angle</b> increased at a rate of almost 150 percent of that of the wing angle-of-attack for a propeller-wing spacing of 0. 54 wing chords at a constant droop angle.

Large changes in the unsteady pressure responses on the suction surface of the blade were observed as the advance ratio was varied.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} airflow over a rugged mountain to find suitable locations for wind turbines. The investigation considers turbulent intensity and <b>inflow</b> <b>angle</b> in addition to wind speed. The area of interest is the mountain around the upper reservoir of Lamtakong Jolabha Vadhana Hydro Power Plant, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. The Lamtakong Wind Turbine Power System is located near the reservoir. Due to the ruggedness of the site, according to the angle of slopes, the existing turbines may be experiencing airflow with high turbulent intensity and non-zero <b>inflow</b> <b>angle.</b> This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) to simulate airflow. CFD {{is used in the}} final analysis to quantify turbulent intensity and <b>inflow</b> <b>angle.</b> The turbulence model is used, while the roughness height and roughness constant are tuned according to the ground cover. Detailed examinations of cases show that the highest wind speeds do not always occur at the mountain’s peaks. High turbulent intensity leads to the exclusion of locations on the lee side of the mountain, where it reaches 18 %. The inflow angles are high on the upwind side of the mountain and can go up to 20 degrees. It is found that the slopes affect the inflow angles but they do not dictate the inflow angles. Finally, the results of the highest peak suggest that most suitable turbine spot is approximately 60 m downwind from the point of highest wind speed. The power density reduces from 515. 3 W/m 2 to 502. 6 W/m 2 at 60 m hub-height. Thus, to achieve a zero <b>inflow</b> <b>angle,</b> turbines may have a power output reduction but they will experience lower turbulence and uneven loading...|$|E

The {{results indicate that the}} blade response is nearly sinusoidal at low inflow angles (1. 6 and - 0. 4 deg) and significant deviations from sinusoidal behavior occur at an <b>inflow</b> <b>angle</b> of 4. 6 deg due to the presence of strong shocks on both suction and pressure surfaces of the blade. The detailed flow in the blade passages shows that a shock formed on the suction surface during the highly loaded portion of the revolution extends across the passage to the pressure surface.

We varied the parent blood vessel and aneurysm sac a 1 ’s geometrical characteristics to analyze their hemodynamic influence on aneurysm a 2.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the derivation of a frequency domain theory and working equations for radiation of propeller harmonic {{noise in the}} presence of angular inflow. In applying the acoustic analogy, integration over the tangential coordinate of the source region is performed numerically, permitting the equations to be solved without approximation for any degree of angular inflow. <b>Inflow</b> <b>angle</b> is specified in terms of yaw, pitch, and roll angles of the aircraft. Since these can be arbitrarily large, the analysis applies with equal accuracy to propellers and helicopter rotors. For thickness and loading, the derivation is given in complete detail with working equations for near and far field. However, the quadrupole derivation has been carried only far enough to show feasibility of the numerical approach. Explicit formulas are presented for computation of source elements, evaluation of Green's functions, and location of observer points in various visual and retarded coordinate systems. The resulting computer program, called WOBBLE has been written in FORTRAN and follows the notation of this report very closely. The new theory is explored to establish the effects of varying <b>inflow</b> <b>angle</b> on axial and circumferential directivity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that recanalization rates are lower in stent-assisted coil embolization than in coiling alone in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare the hemodynamic effect of stent struts and straightening of vessels by stent placement on reducing flow velocity in sidewall aneurysms, with the goal of reducing recanalization rates. METHODS: We evaluated 16 sidewall aneurysms treated with Enterprise stents. We performed computational fluid dynamics simulations using patient-specific geometries before and after treatment, with or without stent struts. RESULTS: Stent placement straightened vessels by a mean (±standard deviation) of 12. 9 ° ± 13. 1 ° 6 months after treatment. Placement of stent struts in the initial vessel geometries reduced flow velocity in aneurysms by 23. 1 % ± 6. 3 %. Straightening of vessels without stent struts reduced flow velocity by 9. 6 % ± 12. 6 %. Stent struts had significantly stronger effects on reducing flow velocity than straightening (P =  0. 004, Wilcoxon test). Deviation of the effects was larger by straightening than by stent struts (P =  0. 01, F-test). The combination of stent struts and straightening reduced flow velocity by 32. 6 % ± 12. 2 %. There was a trend that larger <b>inflow</b> <b>angles</b> produced a larger reduction in flow velocity by straightening of vessels (P =  0. 16). CONCLUSION: In sidewall aneurysms, stent struts have stronger effects (approximately 2 times) on reduction in flow velocity than straightening of vessels. Hemodynamic effects by straightening vary in each case and can be predicted by <b>inflow</b> <b>angles</b> of pre-operative vessel geometry. These results may be useful to design a treatment strategy for reducing recanalization rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{is to improve the}} accuracy of Actuator Line Modeling (ALM) in predicting the unsteady aerodynamic loadings on turbine blades and turbine wake by assessing different methods used to determine the relative velocity between the rotating blades and wind. ALM is incorporated into a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) solver in OpenFOAM (Open Field Operations and Manipulations). The aerodynamic loadings are validated by experiment results from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Turbine wakes are validated by predictions of large eddy simulation using exact 3 D blade geometries from a two-blade NREL Phase VI turbine. Three different relative velocity calculation methods are presented: iterative process in Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, local velocity sampling, and Lagrange-Euler Interpolation (LEI). Loadings and wakes obtained from these three methods are compared. It is discovered that LEI functions better than the conventional BEM with iterative process in both loading and wake prediction. Then LES-ALM with LEI is performed on a small wind farm deploying five NREL Phase VI turbines in full wake setting. The power outputs and force coefficients of downstream turbines are evaluated. The LES-ALM with LEI is also performed on a small wind farm deploying 25 NREL Phase VI turbines with different inflow angles (from full wake setting to partial wake setting). The power outputs and force coefficients of each turbine are evaluated under different inflow angles (the angle the rotor has to turn to make the rotor plane face the incoming wind) (0, 5, 15, 30 and 45 degree). The power coefficient distributions and thrust coefficient distributions of the wind farm under each <b>inflow</b> <b>angle</b> are compared.
