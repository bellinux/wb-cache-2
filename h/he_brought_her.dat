25|$|Some time later, Powers courted Dorothy Pressler Lemke from Northborough, Massachusetts, who {{was also}} looking for love through lonely hearts ads. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> to Iowa to marry her and persuaded her to {{withdraw}} $4000 from her bank account. Lemke did not notice that instead of sending her trunks to Iowa, where Powers claimed to be living, he sent them to the address of Cornelius O. Pierson of Fairmont, West Virginia. Asta Eicher, her children, and Dorothy Lemke had disappeared with no explanation.|$|E

25|$|Deslys {{had many}} admirers among royalty, most notably King Manuel II of Portugal, and her origins became {{the subject of}} dispute. A private detective claimed her true name was Hadiwga Nawrati, or Hedvika Navrátilová, and that she was a Czech peasant girl, born in the village of Horní Moštěnice, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The {{investigator}} reported that Deslys had denied her alleged mother's claim to kinship when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> to see the dancer, paying her a large amount of money to leave. Deslys replied the story was ridiculous and that she was French, not Czech.|$|E

25|$|In September 1821, Herbert {{commissioned}} HMS Icarus for the Jamaica {{station in}} the West Indies, where he transferred to HMS Carnation, and was posted to HMS Tamar on 25 November. In that ship, he destroyed three piratical vessels on the coasts of Cuba and Yucatán. He served in the Tamar until <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> back home, and she was paid off in August 1823. In 1829, he was High Sheriff for County Kerry. He had no further military service until 10 November 1837, when he was appointed to HMS Calliope and sent to Brazil. Until the arrival of Commodore Thomas Ball Sulivan, Herbert conducted the duties of Senior Officer. Herbert was directed to assume command of the naval force in the Río de la Plata to protect British interests at Buenos Aires during a blockade by a French squadron, and at Monte Video. While carrying out his duties, he was twice officially assured of the approbation of the Admiralty. In January 1840, he went round Cape Horn, and joined Rear-Admiral Charles Ross at Valparaiso, where he began his expedition to China.|$|E
500|$|After Germany's defeat, Salinger {{signed up}} for a six-month period of [...] "Denazification" [...] duty in Germany for the Counterintelligence Corps. He lived in Weissenburg and, soon after, married Sylvia Welter. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> to the United States in April 1946, but the {{marriage}} fell apart after eight months and Sylvia returned to Germany. In 1972, Salinger's daughter Margaret was with him when he received a letter from Sylvia. He looked at the envelope, and without reading it, tore it apart. It {{was the first time he}} had heard from her since the breakup, but as Margaret put it, [...] "when he was finished with a person, he was through with them." ...|$|E

A hand covers her mouth. Someone gets between her legs. Someone else kneels on her hair. And for the next three hours she's brutally raped and beaten, with Drew and another upperclassman supposedly shouting out instructions to the pledges, referring to Jackie as 'it'." [...] According to Goldberg, [...] "It is an account of a sober, well-planned gang rape by seven fraternity pledges at the direction of two members." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1797, Wollstonecraft fell in {{love with}} and married the philosopher William Godwin (she had become {{pregnant}} with his child). Godwin grew to love Fanny during his affair with Wollstonecraft; <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> back a mug from Josiah Wedgwood's pottery factory with an [...] "F" [...] on it that delighted both mother and daughter. Wollstonecraft died in September of the same year, from complications giving birth to Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, who survived. Three-year-old Fanny, who had been scarred from smallpox, was unofficially adopted by her stepfather and given the name of Godwin. [...] Her copy of Wollstonecraft's only completed children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), has the initials [...] "F. G." [...] written in large print in it. According to the dominant interpretation of Godwin's diary, it was not until Fanny turned twelve that she was informed in an important conversation with Godwin that he was not her natural father. In the only biography of Fanny, Janet Todd disputes this reading, arguing instead that the conversation was about Fanny's future. She finds it unlikely that Fanny would have been unaware of her origins in the open and liberal Godwin household.|$|E

2500|$|A rare {{occurrence}} {{in which a}} woman was persuaded to board a pirate ship comes from the story of Captain Eric Cobham and a prostitute named Maria. [...] Even though the ship's articles stated boys and women were not permitted on the ship, Cobham faced no repercussions from the crew when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> aboard. [...] While on the ship, Maria proved that she was [...] "as callous as the worst of them". [...] Maria's actions made Cobham [...] "more nervous than ever," [...] so much so that she effectively scared him from pirating.|$|E

Venerable joined her and after a chase that left Cyane far behind, {{captured}} Alcmène after losing two men dead and four wounded, while the French lost 32 dead and 50 wounded. Alcmène had a complement of 319 men {{under the command of}} Captain Ducrest de Villeneuve, who was wounded when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> alongside Venerable and attempted a boarding.|$|E
2500|$|Italian {{is similar}} to French, with phrases such as il mio/tuo/suo libro not {{implying}} anything about the owner's gender or the owner's name's grammatical gender. In the third person, if the [...] "owner's" [...] sex or category (person vs thing) is an issue, it is solved by expressing di lui, di lei for persons or superior animals or di esso for things or inferior animals. Lui portò su le valigie di lei (<b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> luggage upstairs). This rarely happens, though, because it is considered inelegant and the owner's gender can often be inferred from the context, which is anyhow much more important in an Italian environment than in an English-speaking one.|$|E
60|$|Will {{was divided}} between the {{inclination}} to fall at the Saint's feet and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he was adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he repented that <b>he</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

He kept striking her until he beat her to death. He established an alibi by going back out for some drinks, being sure to converse with others, before returning to retrieve Bennett's body and belongings to dispose of them. He was back on the road the next day. The body was found a few days later, but there were no suspects and no leads.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her time}} at Hiller's school, Schröter became {{good friends with}} Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and {{when he moved to}} Weimar in 1775 <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> along as a court singer for Duchess Anna Amalia. She first {{performed}} in the court on 23 November 1776. However, while she was employed as a singer, Corona became [...] involved with the amateur court theatre, performing in at least eighteen productions, many of which were written by Goethe himself. Corona and Goethe collaborated on many of his most popular plays. On a few occasions, he starred opposite her, as in the performance of his play Iphigenie auf Tauris in 1779. Goethe's singspiel Die Fischerin was especially important to Schröter. She not only starred in the leading role of Dortchen, but composed incidental music for the play, including the famous opening song Der Erlkönig, which {{is quite different from the}} version composed by Franz Schubert over 30 years later - unsurprisingly, Schröter's version is closer to the early Classical era lied tradition in the style of Zelter than to the Romantic version of Schubert. Corona also starred in Goethe's drama Proserpina in which she drew crowds for this [...] "virtuosic solo work." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows it is {{revealed}} that the Grey Lady is Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, making her the only house ghost known {{to be related to}} one of the Hogwarts founders. She informs Harry that she stole the Diadem of Ravenclaw from her mother, in an attempt to become smarter than her, and then went into hiding in Albania. It was a dying Rowena Ravenclaw's wish to see her daughter again and so she sent for the Bloody Baron to look for her, knowing that he would not rest until <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>her</b> back, partly because {{he was in love with}} her. However, she refused to come with him and, in a moment of blind rage, he killed her with a single stab wound to the chest. Overcome with remorse, the Bloody Baron killed himself using the same weapon in turn and wears chains as penitence, [...] "as he should", the Grey Lady says. The diadem remained in the hollow of a tree in an Albanian forest until Tom Riddle managed to charm the story out of her ghost, the Grey Lady. Riddle, who had been seeking out historically significant objects to make into Horcruxes, later retrieved the diadem from Albania and hid it in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts while visiting the castle years later.|$|E
