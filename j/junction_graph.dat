40|$|A novel {{approach}} to junction detection using an explicit line finder model and contextual rules is presented. Contextual rules expressing properties of 3 D-edges (surface orientation discontinuities) {{limit the number}} of line intersections interpreted as junctions. Probabilistic relaxation labelling scheme is used to combine the a priori world knowledge represented by contextual rules and the information contained in observed lines. Junctions corresponding to a vertex (V-junctions) and an occlusion (T-junctions) of a 3 D object are detected and stored in a <b>junction</b> <b>graph.</b> The information in the <b>junction</b> <b>graph</b> is used to extract higher level features. Results of the most promising method, the polyhedral object face recovery, are briefly discussed. The performance of the junction detection process is demonstrated on images from indoor, outdoor, and industrial environments. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} local {{consistency}} plays {{a central role}} in constraint satisfaction and has been extended to handle general constraint-based inference (CBI) problems. We propose a family of novel generalized local consistency concepts for the <b>junction</b> <b>graph</b> representation of CBI problems. These concepts are based on a general condition that depends only on the existence and property of the multiplicative absorbing element and does not depend on the other semiring properties of CBI problems. We present several local consistency enforcing algorithms and their approximation variants. Theoretical complexity analyses and empirical experimental results for the application of these algorithms to both MaxCSP and probability inference are given. We also discuss the relationship between these local consistency concepts and message passing schemes such as junction tree algorithms and loopy message propagation. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of turbo codes, {{there has been a}} lot of interest in iterative decoding schemes. It is also known that the turbo decoding algorithm and several other previously known iterative algorithms are instances of Pearl's belief propagation algorithm applied to a graph with cycles, while the algorithm is known to work only for graphs without cycles. We describe a marginalization algorithm which works on junction trees, which is based on some newer developments in Bayesian networks. This is sufficiently general that Pearl's belief propagation and decoding on Tanner graphs may be regarded as special cases. An attempt to compute the discrete Fourier transform as a marginalization problem in this framework gives the fast Fourier transform algorithm, thus showing that this framework has applications apart from probabilistic computations. <b>Junction</b> <b>graphs</b> with cycles lead to an iterative algorithm. The case of <b>junction</b> <b>graphs</b> with a single cycle is analyzed, with specific results in the case of the sum-product algorithm. We also have some experimental results for small turbo code-like <b>junction</b> <b>graphs.</b> On a different topic, we consider the typical set decoder, which can be used to obtain bounds on the noise threshold for asymptotically error free decoding, for given code ensembles. Some choices of the typical set for AWGN channel are considered and the resulting bounds on the threshold obtained. ...|$|R

Assuming the decision maker behaves according to the EU model, we investigate the elicitation of generalized additively decomposable utility functions on a product set (GAI-decomposable utilities).

The latter is used to represent and manage independences between attributes, as <b>junction</b> <b>graphs</b> model independences between random variables in Bayesian networks.

40|$|The {{marginal}} maximum {{a posteriori probability}} (MAP) estimation problem, which calculates {{the mode}} of the marginal posterior distribution of a subset of variables with the remaining variables marginalized, is an important inference problem in many models, such as those with hidden variables or uncertain parameters. Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP (maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem, {{making it possible to}} easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of "mixed-product" message passing algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product and a novel "argmax-product" message updates. We also derive a class of convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization problems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give globally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the optimal objectives. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform the existing approaches, including a state-of-the-art algorithm based on local search methods.

40|$|Many vision {{tasks are}} posed as either graph {{partitioning}} (coloring) or graph matching (correspondence) problems. The former include segmentation and grouping, {{and the latter}} include wide baseline stereo, large motion, object tracking and recognition. In this paper, we present an integrated solution for both graph matching and graph partition using an effective sampling algorithm in a Bayesian framework. Given two images for matching, we extract two graphs using a primal sketch algorithm [4]. The graph nodes are linelets and primitives (<b>junctions).</b> Both <b>graphs</b> are automatically partitioned into {{an unknown number of}} K + 1 layers of subgraphs so that K pairs of subgraphs are matched and the remaining layer contains unmatched backgrounds. Each matched pair represent a ”moving object” with a TPS (Thin-Plate-Spline) transform to account for its deformations and a set of graph operators to edit the pair of subgraphs to achieve perfect structural match. The matching energy between two subgraphs includes geometric deformations, appearance dissimilarities, and the cost of graph editing operators. We demonstrate its application on two tasks: (i) large motion with occlusion, and (ii) automatic detection and recognition of common objects in a pair of images. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Faulty {{behavior}} of complex industrial systems is usually detected by deviations from expected values of performance parameters- regarding the installation utilities. When isolation is performed by human diagnosticians they use shallow knowledge- on faulty cases, and deep knowledge- on laws governing the installation running, both imprecise in variable values {{and in their}} relations. The paper presents a fuzzy-neuro architecture for a computational model, handling the imprecison of human-like thinking on faults and {{behavior of}} conductive flow systems in industry. The primary effects isolation from the secondary ones proceeds in a modular fashion, based on transport anomalies detected from flow power disturbance in specific (bond <b>graph)</b> <b>junctions</b> of interconnected components. The fuzzy representation of data form sensors and the links representation between manifestations, faults and symptoms are best processed by productive neural networks- trained from patterns of expert shallow and deep knowledge pieces. The modular structure of the diagnosis system reflects the functional modular structure of the target system, and so a simpler faults-effects mapping results and it is better solved the abductive problem of isolating faults in complex conductive flow systems...|$|R

The appearance of the hidden spectrum for low energies always implies that the critical density is finite for all the models under consideration. We also show that, even when the critical density is finite, if the adjacency operator of the graph is recurrent, it is impossible to exhibit temperature states which are locally normal (i. e. states for which the local particle density is finite) describing the condensation at all. A similar situation seems to occur in the transient cases for which it is impossible to exhibit locally normal states omega describing the Bose-Einstein Condensation with mean particle density rho(omega) strictly greater than the critical density rho(c). Indeed, it is shown that the transient cases admit locally normal states exhibiting Bose-Einstein Condensation phenomena.

40|$|URL] audienceIn this {{contribution}} {{we provide}} a detailed comparative characterisation of publicly available brain networks. The latter include structural areal connectivity graphs from the cat cortex, macaque and macaque visual cortex, {{as well as}} cellular networks of C. elegans and corresponding subnetworks formed by chemical synapses and gap <b>junctions</b> only. <b>Graph</b> theoretical tools applied include node degree and correlation, edge distance, clustering and cycle, entropy, hierarchical, centrality, spectral and complexity measures, {{as well as the}} study of subgraphs and fractal properties. Moreover, extensions of these measures incorporating weight and spatial information are proposed and applied to graphs where such data were available. Our analysis shows that, first, in agreement with numerous previous studies, all investigated systems exhibit small-world properties (i. e. small average geodesic distance and high clustering coefficient) when relational graphs are considered. Second, for many other measures, marked differences (e. g. for efficiency and vulnerability) between the investigated networks were found, thus revealing a rich universe of structural qualities. We argue that the latter forces a re-evaluation of the question about structural prerequisites for functionally complex dynamical b ehaviours. Third, the incorporation of weight and spatial information qualitatively alters some conclusions drawn from the analysis of corresponding relational graphs, thus arguing for a careful re-evaluation of real-world networks in the context weighted and spatial graph theory. In summary, our study suggests that {{a deeper understanding of the}} functional dynamics and role, and possible differences in the latter, of neural and brain networks necessitate their detailed structural characterisation beyond small-world and scale-free qualities. Moreover, a detailed graph-theoretical characterisation of structural and functional bra in networks will allow to constraint developmental mechanisms which lead to the preference of specific network topologies over others. Finally, studying structural and functional patterns on the global scale with the full weight of graph theory could provide an alternative way to argue for complexity as an emergent quality of brain networks which goes beyond a pure description of the wealth of structural and functional properties observed in isolated neural systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} bottom-up recovery of structured 2 -D geometric primitives from real, complex images. A novel approach for perceptual grouping is presented, using asynchrony whose fundamental principle is to process some primitives before some others, because they carry more information. The main contribution of this work lies in {{the reduction of the}} complexity of the grouping process to a problem linear with respect to the number of image contours. Another advantageous characteristic of the proposed method is that only two parameters need to be specified. The asynchronous perceptual grouping processes a data flow of ordered contour primitives, with a rank in the flow determined according to a measure of saliency. It sequentially attempts to group each contour primitive coming in the data flow with other neighboring ones having arrived earlier. Acceptance or rejection of the current contour depends on the geometrical configuration of its neighborhood in the image; properties tested include proximity, colinearity, curvilinearity, and parallelism. The topology as well as the morphology of the relevant structures emerging throughout the whole image are captured in a rigid <b>graph.</b> <b>Junction</b> and surface characteristics are easily extractable, which can help to choose pertinent primitives for an indexing or a recognition system...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{models are}} those {{containing}} continuous and discontinuous behaviour. In constructing dynamic systems models, it is frequently desirable to abstract rapidly changing, highly nonlinear behaviour to a discontinuity. Bond graphs {{lend themselves to}} systems modelling by being multi-disciplinary and reflecting the physics of the system. One advantage {{is that they can}} produce a mathematical model in a form that simulates quickly and efficiently. Hybrid bond graphs are a logical development which could further improve speed and efficiency. A range of hybrid bond graph forms have been proposed which are suitable for either simulation or further analysis, but not both. None have reached common usage. A Hybrid bond graph method is proposed here which is suitable for simulation as well as providing engineering insight through analysis. This new method features a distinction between structural and parametric switching. The controlled junction is used for the former, and gives rise to dynamic causality. A controlled element is developed for the latter. Dynamic causality is unconstrained so as to aid insight, and a new notation is proposed. The junction structure matrix for the hybrid bond graph features Boolean terms to reflect the controlled <b>junctions</b> in the <b>graph</b> structure. This hybrid JSM is used to generate a mixed-Boolean state equation. When storage elements are in dynamic causality, the resulting system equation is implicit. The focus of this thesis is the exploitation of the model. The implicit form enables application of matrix-rank criteria from control theory, and control properties {{can be seen in the}} structure and causal assignment. An impulsive mode may occur when storage elements are in dynamic causality, but otherwise there are no energy losses associated with commutation because this method dictates the way discontinuities are abstracted. The main contribution is therefore a Hybrid Bond Graph which reflects the physics of commutating systems and offers engineering insight through the choice of controlled elements and dynamic causality. It generates a unique, implicit, mixed-Boolean system equation, describing all modes of operation. This form is suitable for both simulation and analysis.
