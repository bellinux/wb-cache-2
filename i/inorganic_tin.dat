Pewter, which is an alloy of 85-90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony, and lead, was used for flatware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin/lead soft solders, which are typically 60% or more tin. Another large application for tin is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. <b>Inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> compounds are rather non-toxic. Because of its low toxicity, tin-plated metal was used for food packaging as tin cans, which are actually made mostly of steel or aluminum. However, overexposure to tin may cause problems with metabolizing essential trace elements such as copper and zinc, and some organotin compounds can be almost as toxic as cyanide.|$|E

Triorganotin compounds are particularly toxic explaining their wide use as biocides (e. g., in antifouling paints or pesticides). Persistence of organotin compounds is governed by moderate to fast aerobic biotic degradation processes, slow anaerobic biotic degradation, slow abiotic degradation by photolysis, and fast, but reversible, adsorption/desorption processes. Organotin compounds are ubiquitously distributed in aquatic organisms. Bioconcentration in organisms and ecotoxicity are dependent on the bioavailable fraction.

The resulting increase {{in the rate of}} heme breakdown is reflected in a marked depression of cellular cytochrome P- 450 content and impairment of the oxidative metabolism of natural and foreign chemicals dependent on this hemeprotein. Organometal complexes do not mimic in all their aspects the actions of the inorganic elements which they contain. For example, organotins, in contrast to <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin,</b> produce a prolonged induction response of heme oxygenase in the liver but not in the kidney.

On the contrary, cyanobacteria predominance over green algae and the highest microbial biomass production (averaging 0. 084 g Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) L- 1 d- 1) were reached under TIN/PO 43 - concentrations of 21 mg N L- 1 / 2 mg P L- 1, no carbon limitation and an average LV-P of 0. 23 mg P-PO 43 - L- 1 d- 1.

The high concentration of <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin</b> in estuarine sediment indicates an elevated rate of debutylation in the estuarine environment. Both methylation and debutylation of TBT in Chennai harbour were greater than in Tuticorin harbour. A significant correlation (r 2 ~ 0. 75) between total butyltin and organic carbon contents in sediment was found. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report on the distribution of butyltins and methylated butyltin in sea-water and sediment and octyltins in sea-water in the Indian marine environment...|$|E
40|$|This report {{represents}} {{the conclusions of}} a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food contaminants, with the aim to advise on risk management options {{for the purpose of}} public health protection. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation of contaminants and assessments of intake. A summary follows of the Committee’s evaluations of technical, toxicological and intake data for certain food contaminants (acrylamide, ethyl carbamate, <b>inorganic</b> <b>tin,</b> polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Cadmium was assessed to determine the impact of different maximum limits on intake. Annexed to the report are tables summarizing the Committee’s recommendations for intakes and toxicological evaluations of the food contaminants considered, and a description of the statistical methods for dose–response modelling as applied at this meeting...|$|E

30|$|As {{the waste}} audit indicated, {{a large part}} of {{household}} waste in Accra is potentially recyclable as organic waste accounts for about 60 %, while paper and other <b>inorganic</b> recyclables (glass, <b>tin)</b> are fairly represented. Yet, this opportunity remains poorly unexplored. Indeed, within the city, a compost plant built in 1976 at Teshie (another suburb of Accra), with a processing capacity of 200 tonnes a day was decommissioned in 2002 due to operational difficulties (see Oteng-Ababio et al. 2013). In particular, lack of source separation of waste greatly affected its operations. Thus, the NGO’s activities demonstrate a bold attempt to both tap into the untapped potential embedded in waste and help advance that scholarship in the area of environmental sustainability.|$|R
40|$|Sishili Bay is {{the most}} {{important}} aquiculture and tourism area for the city of Yantai, China; however, red tides occurred frequently and have caused huge economic losses in this bay in recent years. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the local ecological environments in the bay, we conducted this research between 2003 and 2008 to analyze variations in nutrients and chlorophyll (chl-a) during high frequency red tide period (May to September). The results show that the chl-a concentration increased from 2. 70 in 2003 to 7. 26 mg/m(3) in 2008, while the concentration of total <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen (<b>TIN)</b> and silicate (SiO(3) -Si) increased lineally from 5. 18 and 1. 45 mu mol/L in 2003 to 18. 57 and 9. 52 mu mol/L in 2008, respectively, and the annual phosphate (PO(4) -P) varied between 0. 15 and 0. 46 mu mol/L. Special attention was given to a red tide in August 2007 occurred when water temperature was high and nutrient concentrations increased sharply because of a heavy rainfall. Overall, the results show the P limitation in Sishili Bay, and reveal that red tides were caused by eutrophication from terrestrial inputs and local warm weather, particularly during rainy periods. Therefore, to control red tide, greater efforts should be made to reduce sewage discharges into Sishili Bay, particularly during rainfall seasons.

40|$|Abstract [...] Sedimentary {{denitrification}} acts {{to remove}} nitrogen {{from both the}} sediments and water column in continental shelf ecosystems, sothat in enclosed shelf areas where water residence times are long (about {{a year in the}} Gulf of Maine), significant rates of sedimentary denitrification might lower inorganic nitrogen concentrations. We examined this using a basin-wide suite of hydro-graphic and nutrient data collected in mid-summer. Total <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen (<b>TIN)</b> concentrations (nitrate + nitrite + ammonium) were highest in the aged North Atlantic continental slope waters found at depth in the Jordan Basin on {{the eastern side of the}} Gulf. Phosphate and silicate concentrations were moderately high in these waters. On the western side of the Gulf, Wilkinson Basin receives much less of the nutrient-rich slope waters. In these deep waters, TIN concen-trations were lower and phosphate and silicate concentrations higher than in the Jordan Basin. In the intermediate and deep waters, TIN/PO 4 ratios averaged 19 on the eastern side but only 15 - 16 on the western side of the Gulf. Partially isolated regions within the Gulf had even lower TIN/PO 4 ratios. The differences in this ratio suggested the occurrence of either a non-stoichiometric reduction in nitrogen or an enrichment in phosphate between the eastern and western sides of the Gulf. The relationship between phosphate and silicate was identical in open waters on both sides o...|$|R
