40|$|This work {{introduces}} two new lost cost, electronically controlled <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> {{systems for}} small gas turbine engines, particularly applicable in remotely piloted vehicles. The first one incorporates a diaphragm operated flat-seat bypass valve {{to maintain a}} constant differential pressure across the <b>metering</b> <b>valve,</b> which is actuated by a digital linear actuator. In the second one, both the metering and the bypass valves are controlled by two independently operated digital linear actuators. The mathematical models for the first <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system, were created and used for computer simulation. Next, after preparing the experimental test set-up, the manufactured prototype was tested and the models for both the steady state and the dynamic response were validated. Three design optimization criteria, fuel flow linearity, low sensitivity to the design parameters changes and fast dynamic response were examined to improve {{the performance of the}} proposed <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system. Finally, a multi-objective optimization technique was developed and implemented to obtain the best design parameters of the system.

Finally, to investigate the impact of different control strategies on the dynamic response of the engine, a dynamic model for the engine was also developed and used.

40|$|In industries,flow of any fluid varies over a {{very wide}} range. It ranges from very low to very high velocity. Because of this variation, various types of flow {{measurement}} elements have been developed. Out of all these, hot wire anemometer, orifice meter and rotameter are widely used. Responses of fluids with different densities and sensors with different diameters have been studied. Since these components are delicate to heat exchange between the component and its composition, temperature and environment, their responses vary with conditions provided. Using hot-element sensor we also measured the concentration of gas components {{in a mixture of}} two known gases. This method is based on thermal conductivity of mixture. Thermal conductivity of mixture depends on individual thermal conductivities of gases of mixture and individual fractional concentration of that gases. Taking different types of probes and different types of fluid we compare the behavior of sensor so that we can determine the best conditions for measurements of properties like velocity and composition of fluids.

The presented scheme provides early detection of degradation and ability to score its significance in order to inform maintenance planning and consequently reduce disruption.

The non-parametric statistics approximate the data distribu-tion for a sliding time window, with the change in distribution is indicated using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a historical perspective}} of the advancement of control technologies for aircraft gas turbine engines. The paper primarily covers technology advances in the United States in the last 60 years (1940 to approximately 2002). The paper emphasizes the pioneering technologies that have been tested or implemented during this period, assimilating knowledge and experience from industry experts, including personal interviews with both current and retired experts. Since the first United States-built aircraft gas turbine engine was flown in 1942, engine control technology has evolved from a simple hydro-mechanical <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> to a full-authority digital electronic control system (FADEC) that is common to all modern aircraft propulsion systems. At the same time, control systems have provided engine diagnostic functions. Engine diagnostic capabilities have also evolved from pilot observation of engine gauges to the automated on-board diagnostic system that uses mathematical models to assess engine health and assist in post-flight troubleshooting and maintenance. Using system complexity and capability as a measure, we can break {{the historical development of}} control systems down to four phases: (1) the start-up phase (1942 to 1949), (2) the growth phase (1950 to 1969), (3) the electronic phase (1970 to 1989), and (4) the integration phase (1990 to 2002). In each phase, the state-of-the-art control technology is described and the engines that have become historical landmarks, from the control and diagnostic standpoint, are identified. Finally, a historical perspective of engine controls in the last 60 years is presented in terms of control system complexity, number of sensors, number of lines of software (or embedded code), and other factors...|$|E
40|$|An innovative, efficient, {{and robust}} {{algorithm}} is presented {{for the evaluation}} of the instantaneous flow-rate in high-pressure liquid flow pipelines. This algorithm is based on the pressure time histories measured at two locations. A simple ordinary differential equation has been derived from the mass and momentum conservation laws and has been solved analytically. This equation allows the flow-rate time fluctuations to be evaluated accurately around their mean value, without any need for initial datum on the liquid flow velocity. A measuring device has been designed and realized to evaluate the flow-rate. The proposed flowmeter layout consists of a piece of pipeline endowed with two piezoresistive pressure sensors equipped with miniaturized thermocouples, the pressure sensor conditioners and a central processing unit (CPU), in which the algorithm {{for the evaluation of}} the flow-rate has been implemented. A more sophisticated version of the flowmeter algorithm, which includes unsteady friction in the flow-rate evaluation, has also been developed. Different algorithm versions have been assessed and successfully validated through a comparison with numerical flow-rate data predicted using a reliable onedimensional model of a common rail (CR) fuel injection system. The prototypal flowmeter has been installed at the delivery section of a CR volumetric pump in order to investigate the flow-rate ripple. The flowmeter traces have been compared with the predictions of a previously developed theoretical model for the pump delivered instantaneous flow-rate, in order to further assess the reliability of both the model and the flowmeter as well as to {{have a better understanding of}} the cause and effect relationships between the flow-rate time history and the dynamic working of the pump.

40|$|The use {{of diesel}} engine has been {{increasing}} in agricultural and industrial applications. The unfavorable diesel smoke, however, discourage the wide-spread use due to health hazards. The smoke also limits the maximum power output. Reduction of diesel smoke by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line smoke opacity meter, and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy. With sufficiently fast computation, on-line identification might be possible and adaptive control of fuel metering could be implemented. Adaptive control with on-line identification and appropriate sensors leads to an integrated engine management system...|$|E
