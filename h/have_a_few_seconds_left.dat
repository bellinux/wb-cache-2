50|$|Kishin Houkou Demonbane TV is an {{animated}} adaptation of Kishin Houkou Demonbane for the PS2, which began airing on May 18, 2006, and ended on August 17, 2006. The characters showcased in the TV series differ slightly {{from those in}} the PS2 Game. For example; Metatron <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of screentime in the first few episodes then never shows up again, Sandalphon is never seen, Ryuuga is seen only in the ending sequence, and Dagon's design was changed entirely.|$|R
6000|$|It is true {{that our}} guide, with that sense of {{responsibility}} which seems to weigh heavy on guides even when asleep, had awakened at the usual hour of starting--daybreak--and, from the mere force of habit, had given forth his accustomed and sonorous [...] "Leve! leve!"--rise, rise. From the mere force of habit, too, we all turned round to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> repose on our other sides before obeying the order, but suddenly light flashed into our minds, and various growls in varied keys saluted our guide.|$|R

50|$|In chess {{played with}} a time control, time trouble, time pressure, or its German {{translation}} Zeitnot, is the situation where <b>a</b> player <b>has</b> little time to complete the required moves. When forced to play quickly, the probability of making blunders is increased, so handling the clock is {{an important aspect of}} chess playing. The last move of the time control (often move 40) is especially prone to blunders if players only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to play it, and many games have been lost due to poor time management in time pressure.|$|R
60|$|While {{the enemy}} spoke, Gilda <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> {{in which to}} reflect. Above all things {{she was a woman}} of sense and one who valued her own dignity; she knew quite well that the making of a scene outside an inn in a strange town and at this hour of the night could but result in a loss of that dignity which she so highly prized, seeing that she was entirely at the mercy of men who were not likely to yield either to her protests or to her appeals.|$|R
40|$|The {{taste of}} this {{particular}} chunk of fresh pineapple, the one which I am just now eating, is scrumptious. That taste is something the chunk has in common with other such chunks, like the one I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> ago and the one I will <b>have</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> time. The taste of this pineapple chunk is thus a feature, a property, which this and various other chunks of pineapple share. Now, intuitively at least, no purely mathematical entity, like a function, is scrumptious. Hence a property, like the taste of this chunk of pineapple, cannot be any such function. This kind of argument, if sound, would cut a wide swathe through the field of metaphysics. All those theories which attempt to reduce ontologically suspicious types of entities (properties, propositions, persons, medium-sized dry goods) to mathematical entities (like classes or functions) would fall to the blade. This could well help to reduce the impact of contemporary philosophy on the world’s dwindling forests. I save contemporary metaphysics by explaining where the argument goes wrong...|$|R

5000|$|... "Follow The Leader" [...] is an eidetic music game {{designed}} {{to test the}} player's memory. Here, a pattern of musical notes are played and four colored panels light up correspondingly. The player then <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to repeat the sequence back to the computer. If the sequence is repeated correctly then the computer generates a longer string of notes to perform. As the game progresses, the speeds at which the tune is performed and at which the response by the player must be given are increased. Further enhancing {{the difficulty of the}} game, the four colored panels cease to light up in higher levels.|$|R
5000|$|The US team {{goes into}} a {{defensive}} mode as the Soviet team becomes increasingly aggressive to score in the final ten minutes. The clock ticks down the final <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> in which commentator Al Michaels says his now famous words, [...] "Do you believe in miracles?! Yes!" [...] The Americans are able to hold off the Soviets, and complete {{one of the biggest}} upsets in sports history. As the team proudly celebrates on the ice with the roaring crowd, an obviously emotional, shaken and proud Herb leaves the rink to an empty corridor to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of quiet with himself, taking in what he and the team have just accomplished.|$|R

5000|$|Edgar (voiced by Jesse Moises) - Not seen until Chapter 6, Edgar is the Prince of Etheria who had {{previously}} appeared in King's Quest IV, where he was kidnapped by the faerie witch Lolotte before he was rescued by Rosella. He was then enchanted by Malicia and turned into the troll king, taking {{the place of the}} real king as her puppet. Edgar plays an important role {{towards the end of the}} game; when he gets hit by Malicia's spell, Rosella <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to revive him. Depending on Rosella's actions and choices, Edgar either dies or lives, and his parents subsequently mourn his death or celebrate his return to Etheria.|$|R

50|$|Speech {{recognition}} was discontiguous, {{meaning the}} player <b>had</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to speak into a headset when prompted. This headset {{was equipped with}} a noise-canceling microphone to help isolate speech from any other sounds. Speech samples would be compared against allowed responses, and a match along with probability of accuracy {{would be sent to}} the Halcyon main processor.|$|R

5000|$|Half {{court is}} a term used in {{basketball}} for the middle line of the basketball court. A shot taken from half court, {{referred to as a}} half court shot, is a shot taken from beyond the line at center circle. Anything beyond the half court line is considered a full court shot. It is most commonly used as a buzzer beater. It is also a streetball term where the teams only use half of the full court. The most common backcourt shot style is known as [...] "the Runner". If the shooter <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to spare, [...] "the Runner" [...] can be used to shorten the distance to the rim while also adding extra power to the shot. Other backcourt shot styles include: [...] "the Sheed" [...] (named after Rasheed Wallace); [...] "the Contested Prayer"; and [...] "the Zoran". Since an NBA game court is 94 feet long, the midcourt line is 47 feet away from each baseline.|$|R
5000|$|Tornado's undefeated status ended that night. After Freckles Brown {{learned he}} had drawn him, {{when it was}} his turn, they were both loaded into chute #2. That chute, by the way, now resides in the Chamber of Commerce. Later, Brown said the crowd was so loud he could not hear the whistle, but knew he had made it when the rodeo clowns moved in. [...] After the two were introduced, {{there was a great}} silence in the arena. All eyes were pinned on chute #2. Then Tornado {{exploded}} out of the gate, and Brown's eyes were fixed on his shoulders. Butler snapped his first of two iconic photographs. One of two photographs, of which one would be lost. Brown recounted the ride in detail, noting that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> {{in the middle of the}} ride where he was concerned, but toward the end was confident that he would make it to the eight-second qualifying buzzer.|$|R

2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. For them, {{to go into}} the studio to record a demo was as big a step as going in to record an album. Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't have any money to spend on things like that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth <b>had</b> sent out <b>a</b> tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett liked it so much he wanted to sign the band. Later, Åkerfeldt received a call from Barrett, who wanted to release a full-length album by Opeth.|$|R
50|$|Minimize standby latency {{and ensure}} standby correctness:Standby latency {{is defined as}} the time between when a standby is told to become active and when it is {{actually}} providing service. “Hot” standby systems are those that actively update internal state in response to active system checkpoints, resulting in millisecond down times. “Cold” standby systems are offline until the active fails and typically restart from a “baseline” state. For example, many cloud solutions will restart a virtual machine on another physical machine if the underlying physical machine fails. “Cold” fail over standby latency can range from 30+ seconds to several minutes. Finally, “warm” standby is an informal term encompassing all systems that are running yet must do some internal processing before becoming active. For example, a warm standby system might be handling low priority jobs - when the active fails it aborts these jobs and reads the active's checkpointed state before resuming service. Warm standby latencies depend on how much data is checkpointed but typically <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> latency.|$|R
25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While {{they did have}} some reasonable doubts {{as to whether or}} not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew <b>had</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.|$|R
