5|$|Dromaeosauroides is a genus of dromaeosaurid {{theropod}} dinosaur {{from the}} Early Cretaceous {{of what is}} now Denmark.

Dromaeosauroides is the <b>first</b> <b>known</b> dinosaur from this location, and the only one which has been scientifically named.

5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important for two reasons. Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for example, only the Cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary literary text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. In some cases, the <b>first</b> <b>known</b> representation of a myth in geometric art predates its <b>first</b> <b>known</b> representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.|$|E
