5|$|Corder {{spent the}} next three days in prison agonising over whether to confess to the crime and make a clean breast of his sins before God. He finally confessed after several {{meetings}} with the prison chaplain, entreaties from his wife, and pleas from both his warder and John Orridge, the governor of the prison. He strongly denied stabbing Maria, claiming that he had accidentally shot <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> after they argued while she was changing out of her disguise.|$|E
500|$|On 5 March 2009, Winehouse {{was arrested}} and charged with common assault {{following}} a claim by Sharene Flash that Winehouse hit <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> at the September 2008 Prince's Trust charity ball. Winehouse's spokesperson announced the cancellation of the singer's US Coachella Festival appearance in light of the new legal issue, and Winehouse appeared in court on 17 March to enter her plea of not guilty. On 23 July, her trial began with prosecutor Lyall Thompson charging that Winehouse acted with [...] "deliberate and unjustifiable violence" [...] while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance. She testified that she did not punch Flash, but tried to push her away because she was scared of her; she cited her worry that Flash would sell her story to a tabloid, Flash's height advantage, and Flash's [...] "rude" [...] behaviour. On 24 July, District Judge Timothy Workman ruled that Winehouse was not guilty, citing the facts that all but two of the witnesses were intoxicated at the time of the incident and that medical evidence did not show [...] "the sort of injury that often occurs when there is a forceful punch to the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Glenn {{declined}} Gilligan's and {{the state}} Democratic party's request that he run for lieutenant governor and challenged Metzenbaum again for the other Ohio Senate seat (vacated by Republican William B. Saxbe, who became U.S. Attorney General in early 1974). Metzenbaum was the short-term incumbent, appointed by Gilligan in January. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had [...] "never held a payroll". Glenn's reply {{became known as the}} [...] "Gold Star Mothers" [...] speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and [...] "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and tell her that her son did not hold a job". He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999. Glenn was reelected in 1980, defeating Republican challenger Jim Betts by over 40 percent. Metzenbaum ran again in 1976 against the incumbent, Taft, winning a close race on Jimmy Carter's coattails.|$|E
60|$|The man {{raised his}} head and looked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> It was a way he had with whomever he talked, of looking them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|One of {{her hands}} stole from her muff, stole out half-hesitatingly towards him. Julien took it in his and raised it to his lips. Then he looked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and answered: [...] "It's straight, all right. But why can't we {{meet some}} other time? You ain't told {{me your name}} yet. An' where d'ye live?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re like a couple of boxers. On the first occasion, I poked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Just for a giggle she kept blackening it up to make it look worse." ...|$|E
60|$|She snuggled {{closer to}} the fire, and put out her hands to warm them, the snow-flakes {{descending}} soft and still on her old gray head and making it white and whiter. The crowd was gathering now, and an egg came flying and struck <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> and broke and ran down her face. There was a laugh at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had my {{time over}} again I wouldn't have come past Assouan," [...] said she. [...] "I can't think what possessed {{me to bring}} {{you all the way}} up here, Sadie. Your mother will think that I am clean crazy, and I'd never dare to look <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> if {{anything}} went wrong with us. I've seen all I want to see of this river, and all I ask now is to be back at Cairo again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{far below}} <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of <b>the</b> world, {{but she knew}} what a {{wonderful}} man he was, so she didn't mind what people said about her marrying beneath her." ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "It has its compensations," [...] quoth he, in that curious cold {{tone of his}} {{that left}} one {{wondering}} whether he meant or not what he seemed to mean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--not very; oh yes, I'm well--" [...] She {{had begun}} {{to move forward with}} the last {{question}}, and he found himself walking with her. [...] "Did she--has Miss Swan come back with you?" [...] he asked, looking <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> with more question than he had put into his words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Daddy!" [...] she said, and {{was past}} and gone! Daddy! She hadn't called him that for years. He drew {{a long breath}} and {{followed}} slowly down. There was all the folly with that confetti stuff {{and the rest of}} it to go through with yet. But he would like just to catch her smile, if she leaned out, though they would hit <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> with the shoe, if they didn't take care. Young Mont's voice said fervently in his ear: ...|$|E
60|$|The man hesitated: it {{did seem}} a 'little thing,' {{and if it was}} to make his wife {{contented}} and happy it was well worth the risk. So he took hold of the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully, while the woman stooped down to peep. Suddenly she startled back with a scream, for a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen, and had nearly hit <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Round and round the room it ran, round and round they both ran after it, knocking down chairs and vases in their efforts to catch the mouse and put it back in the tureen. In the middle of all the noise the door opened, and the mouse ran out between the feet of the king. In one instant both the man and his wife were hiding under the table, and to all appearance the room was empty.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{the clouds}} fast {{gathering}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic grew blacker, and blacker still. I saw a great change in Annapolis. Men of affairs went about with grave faces, while gay and sober alike were touched by the spell. The Tory gentry, to be sure, rattled about in their gilded mahogany coaches, in spite of jeers and sour looks. My Aunt Caroline wore jewelled stomachers to the assemblies,--now become dry and shrivelled entertainments. She kept her hairdresser, had three men in livery to her chair, and a little negro in Turk's costume to wait on her. I often met her in the streets, and took a fierce joy in staring <b>her,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> And Grafton! By a sort of fate I was continually running against him. He was a very busy man, was my uncle, and had a kind of dignified run, which he used between Marlboro' Street and the Council Chamber in the Stadt House, or the Governor's mansion. He never did me the honour to glance at me. The Rev. Mr. Allen, too, came a-visiting from Frederick, where he had grown stout as an alderman upon the living and its perquisites and Grafton's additional bounty. The gossips were busy with his doings, for he had his travelling-coach and servant now. He went to the Tory balls with my aunt. Once I all but encountered him on the Circle, but he ran into Northeast Street to avoid me.|$|E
60|$|I {{had to look}} <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> since {{nothing else}} would do her; and, as I did so, all the might of manhood in me rose up in hot revolt against the lie I would have told her. That unfaltering, impelling gaze of hers drew the truth from my lips in spite of myself.|$|R
60|$|There was a tense {{moment in}} which she found him, looking <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> strangely less ugly than she had supposed, {{and then he was}} gone, rolling along on his beat with that air which all policemen must achieve, of having no {{feelings}} at all, and--as long as it behaves itself--no interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human race.|$|R

50|$|Virgil, after {{listening}} in on Gillespie's {{meeting with the}} Purdys, visits the Endicotts and Duena to ask them some more questions, and Duena asks him to bring her down to the police station.

After stating that she believes him, she kisses him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Weston quietly, looking <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "I {{know you}} would say nothing that was not kind of me. Still, {{the only thing that}} would affect my people would be the fact that I haven't succeeded at {{anything}} yet." [...] He smiled rather grimly. [...] "I'm not sure it wouldn't please them, in a way. You see, they probably expected it." ...|$|R

5000|$|In October 2004, {{fans of the}} Boston Red Sox rioted {{just outside}} Fenway Park after the Red Sox won the American League Championship Series over the New York Yankees.

50|$|In the 1980s, See 'N Say {{pointers}} were streamlined into {{a uniform}} design, a large arrow with a sticker affixed to it depicting a bee, farmer, and so forth. By 1989, the chatty ring {{was replaced by}} a lever that could be pulled to make the toy talk, after a Rhode Island girl became blind when the string snapped off and hit <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Tucker met fire-spinner Kevin Wiley {{during an}} outdoor festival in Colorado. After a minor {{accident}} in which Wiley [...] "hit <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> with a flaming ball of Kevlar", the two became lovers, partners and fellow performers.

6000|$|...

6000|$|... ‘D’ ye think I {{mind for}} Mr. Archer?’ he cried shrilly, with a clack of laughter; {{and then he}} came close up to her, stooped down with his two palms upon his knees, and looked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> with a strange hard expression, {{something}} like a smile. ‘Do I mind for God, my girl?’ he said; ‘that’s what it’s come to be now, do I mind for God?’ ...|$|R

50|$|In the Blu-ray deleted scenes, Rose McGowan is {{featured}} {{as one of}} Osiris's henchmen named Boots McCoy; one scene shows her confronting Luz and shooting her through a cat she is holding, hitting <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and seemingly killing her. However, in the film, this action was given to Von Jackson, and it is later revealed Luz is merely blinded. In other deleted scenes Jessica Alba also {{plays the role of}} Sis, Sartana's twin sister.
