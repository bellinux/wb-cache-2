5|$|A quasi-linear {{complex of}} {{thunderstorms}} began developing near the Highway 81 corridor west of Oklahoma City between 4:00 and 4:45p.m.CDT, and rapidly reached severe intensity. At 5:33p.m.CDT (2233UTC), the National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> in Norman, Oklahoma issued a tornado warning for Canadian County, prompted by increasingly strong tornadic circulation {{exhibited in the}} southernmost supercell of this complex.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} {{afternoon}} hours, forecasters at both the SPC and the National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> in Norman, Oklahoma, realized that a major event was likely to take place based solely on observational data from radar and weather satellite imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms would occur.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} impact {{was reported in}} Canada, as the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Prior to the storm's arrival, the Newfoundland Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> issued a hurricane warning for southeastern Newfoundland. The ferry between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was disrupted, and boats across the region were sent back to harbor. Rainfall was fairly light, peaking at 2.39inches (60.8mm) in southeastern Newfoundland, and sustained winds reached 71mph (115km/h) at Cape Race.|$|E

5|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), {{was created}} in 1965 {{as a way for}} the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Weather Bureau to work together, reduce the {{duplication}} of services, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to {{the second floor of the}} old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. Weather Bureau made the Boise office its “hub of fire weather activities” in the west where fire weather specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south of the Salmon River. The U.S. Weather Bureau changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The National Weather Service Boise, Idaho is {{a weather}} <b>forecast</b> <b>office</b> {{responsible}} for weather forecasts, warnings and local statements {{as well as}} aviation weather forecasts and fire weather forecasts for 3 counties in Southeast Oregon and 14 counties in Southwest and South central Idaho. The U.S. Weather Bureau established {{an office in the}} Sonna Building on December 1, 1898. Since then, the U.S Weather Bureau office, now known as the National Weather Service <b>forecast</b> <b>office</b> gained forecast responsibility of Southern Idaho on June 22, 1970 which was expanded to the entire state of Idaho in 1973. After modernization in 1993, the forecast responsibility was changed to Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. The current office in Boise maintains a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar system, 8 Automated airport weather station (ASOS) systems and Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly improve forecasting in the region. Continuous weather observations have been maintained for the city of Boise since February 1, 1964 about 5 months after the U.S. Army established Fort Boise. The post surgeon for the U.S. Army took observations until July 1, 1877 when the U.S. Signal Service, established an office downtown. The Signal Office was discontinued on July 1, 1890.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office,</b> which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather <b>forecast</b> <b>office</b> in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather <b>forecast</b> <b>office</b> for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E
5|$|As {{it entered}} Cleveland County, the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center {{activated}} emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others {{present at the}} facility {{in the event that}} the supercell should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing a danger to personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office,</b> based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would {{be turned over to the}} 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The supercell, however, continued on a northeastward track, sparing the Norman area.|$|E

5|$|At 1:50p.m. CDT (18:50UTC), the SPC {{issued a}} tornado watch for {{northern}} and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance {{of two or}} more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado. Isolated shower activity began forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch, eventually growing into a line of strong to severe thunderstorms, including supercells. One such high-precipitation supercell was first severe warned at 6:11p.m. CDT (23:11UTC); the National Weather Service office in Chicago, Illinois warned of winds up to 70mph (110km/h) and quarter- to golf ball-sized hail. The weather <b>forecast</b> <b>office</b> upgraded the severe thunderstorm warning to a tornado warning at 6:35p.m. CDT (23:35UTC), and four minutes later, trained storm spotters reported a damaging tornado north of Ashton. This was one of several tornadoes observed across the Central United States on April8 and April9.|$|E
5|$|Before Chataan {{affected}} Guam, officials canceled U.S. Independence Day festivities, {{and residents}} purchased storm supplies. Although {{the center of}} the eye did not strike Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120km/h (75mph), with gusts to 167km/h (104mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170km/h (106mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200km/h (125mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536mm (21.1in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311mm (12.2in) in about three hours. The Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> on the island reported 265mm (10.4in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250mm (10in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6m (12ft) in Umatac.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 12, the National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> in Guam, {{using data}} from the JTWC, placed Tinian and Saipan under a Typhoon Watch whilst declaring a Tropical Storm Watch also {{declared}} for Guam and Rota. By September15, the islands of Agrihan, Tinian and Saipan before being upgraded to tropical storm warnings and a typhoon watch. Additionally, the watches in place for Guam and Rota were discontinued. These warnings were kept in force until late on September 14, when the warnings for Tinian were canceled and the typhoon watch for Saipan was canceled, while the typhoon watch was upgraded to a Typhoon Warning as Choi-wan rapidly intensified. The Tropical Storm Warning in place for Saipan was canceled during September 15 as Choi-wan intensified into a high-end Category 4 equivalent super typhoon. All watches and warnings were discontinued during the afternoon of September16 once Choi-wan was no longer a threat to the Mariana Islands.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the cyclone, schools, businesses, and public transit were closed on Guam. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed approximately 15 representatives to the island to mitigate the response time {{in the wake of}} the storm. Eight schools were opened as shelters, and more than 1,000 residents sought refuge during the height of the storm. Additional shelters were opened on the islands of Rota, Tinian, and Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and nearly 200 people sought cover there. Airports and seaports between the three islands were shut down, causing flights to be canceled. Earlier in 2015, the Guam Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> created a Facebook page to help inform residents about typhoons; during Dolphin, the page received over 425,000views.|$|E
5|$|The National Weather Service <b>forecast</b> <b>office</b> in Gray, Maine, {{operates}} NOAA Weather Radio station KZZ41 on 162.5MHz {{from the}} summit of Mount Washington. Due to its point as the highest elevation in the Northeast and the frequency range NWR broadcasts on, the station can be heard at very far distances. It has been heard in northwest Vermont (at Vergennes), much of western Maine, and northern Massachusetts (at Dracut and Salisbury, the latter of which had clear reception). Based on the official NWS coverage area map, it can be heard clearly throughout most of New Hampshire, western Maine, northeast Vermont, and portions of southern Canada. During very clear conditions, KZZ41 {{has the potential to}} reach the majority of northern Massachusetts (including some northern areas of Greater Boston and much of the North Shore) as well as the majority of Vermont and Maine.|$|E
50|$|PDS tornado {{warnings}} {{are currently}} issued on an experimental basis by the 38 National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Offices</b> within the Central Region. The {{criteria for a}} PDS warning is when a tornado on the ground has been spotted or confirmed, or a significant tornado is expected (due to radar signatures). While the intention of this experimental warning may be to replace the loosely defined tornado emergency, PDS tornado warnings are structured as the second highest level of tornado warning within the Impact Based Warning system (an experiment - which also includes tags within warning products illustrating radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes, and damage potential - participated by the 33 Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Offices</b> within the Central Region, as well as eight additional offices within the Western, Eastern and Southern regions that began utilizing the system {{in the spring of}} 2014); a tornado emergency, the highest warning level, is used within the United States for destructive tornadoes approaching more densely populated areas. These are the first warnings issued with PDS wording, and like PDS flash flood watches, are issued by local <b>forecast</b> <b>offices.</b>|$|R
50|$|PDS {{wind chill}} {{warnings}} are issued {{when there is}} an enhanced risk of frost bite, hypothermia, and eventually death due to extremely low wind chills.

50|$|The NWS {{performs}} {{its primary}} task through {{a collection of}} national and regional centers, and 122 local weather <b>forecast</b> <b>offices</b> (WFOs). As the NWS is a government agency, most of its products are {{in the public domain}} and available free of charge.|$|R
5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 {{construction}} {{began on}} a new NWS Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> at the Logan County Airport in Lincoln. The new office {{would be part of}} a modernization plan that relocate all operation to Lincoln and close the Peoria and Springfield offices. In 1994 the new Lincoln office was officially accepted by the federal government but did not have any operational responsibilities to begin with. The following year the upper air equipment from the National Weather Service Paducah was moved to the new Lincoln location, the only function the new office had at the time was to take observations using this equipment. In the spring of 1995 construction began {{on a new}} WSR-88D radar system in Lincoln. The first five meteorologists reported to the Lincoln location, but forecasting responsibilities remained at the Peoria and Springfield offices. By September 1995 the Lincoln office began full-time operations sand picks up the counties from the Peoria and Springfield offices as well as a few from the Saint Louis and Evansville offices. On October 1, 1995 the National Weather Service offices in Peoria and Springfield were officially closed after serving Central Illinois since the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center {{relocated}} {{its operations}} to Norman, Oklahoma, and was rechristened the Storm Prediction Center. At that time, the guidance center was housed at Max Westheimer Airport (now the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport), co-located {{in the same}} building as the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the local National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Office</b> (the latter of which, in addition to disseminating forecasts, oversees the issuance of weather warnings and advisories for the western two-thirds of Oklahoma and western portions of North Texas, and issues outline and status updates for SPC-issued severe thunderstorm and tornado watches that include areas served by the Norman office). In 1998, the Center began issuing the National Fire Weather Outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to the development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors. The Day 3 Convective Outlook (which is similar in format to the Day 2 forecast) was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000, and was made an official product in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Prior to this event, all of {{the weather}} {{forecasts}} for the region originated in Chicago. After the failure to provide an accurate forecast for this blizzard, forecasting responsibilities were expanded to include 24-hour coverage and more <b>forecasting</b> <b>offices</b> were created, yielding more accurate local forecasts.|$|R
25|$|Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Warning – A large tornado {{has been}} {{confirmed}} to be producing damage and is moving into and through the warned area. It is usually issued as the initial tornado warning or as a complete re-issuance of the previous tornado warning. These may also include wording for a Tornado Emergency. This type of warning was initially issued only by National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Offices</b> in Wichita and Topeka, Kansas, and Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City/Pleasant Hill, Missouri; it was expanded to include 33 additional National Weather Service Weather <b>Forecast</b> <b>Offices</b> within the Central Region Headquarters in 2013, and then to eight additional offices within the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions {{in the spring of}} 2014.|$|R
