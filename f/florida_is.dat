5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, <b>Florida,</b> <b>is</b> the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country. This is, in part, attributable to service by low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an emerging international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} of <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> {{located in the}} continent of Gondwana at the South Pole 650 Mya. When Gondwana collided with the continent of Laurentia 300 Mya, it had moved further north. 200 Mya, the merged continents containing what would <b>be</b> <b>Florida,</b> had moved north of the equator. By then, <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> surrounded by desert, {{in the middle of}} a new continent, Pangaea. When Pangaea broke up 115 mya, Florida assumed a shape as a peninsula.The emergent landmass of <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> Orange Island, a low-relief island sitting atop the carbonate Florida Platform which emerged about 34 to 28 million years ago.|$|R

5|$|The {{terrain of}} South <b>Florida</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} and consistently flat. The limestone that underlies the Everglades {{is integral to}} the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South <b>Florida</b> <b>is</b> {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origins}} to {{approximately}} {{the area of}} Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in <b>Florida</b> <b>is</b> mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, <b>Florida,</b> <b>is</b> based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E
5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in <b>Florida</b> <b>is</b> the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E
5|$|South <b>Florida</b> <b>is</b> a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|E

50|$|Between 1718 and 1734, <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> {{governed by}} Lt. General Antonio de Benavides, {{a native of}} Tenerife in the Canary Islands, while Carlos Benites Franquis de Lugo and Simón de Herrera, both natives of Tenerife, governed Texas in 1736-1737 and in 1811 respectively. In 1740, La Real Compañía de Comercio de La Habana (The Royal Society of Commerce of Havana), a monopolistic {{corporation}} formed to encourage commercial traffic between Cuba and <b>Florida,</b> <b>was</b> required by Spanish statutes to provide two vessels bringing 50 Canarian families annually to Florida. Between 1757 and 1759, 121 Canarian families <b>were</b> sent to <b>Florida,</b> (although most of the settlers emigrated to Cuba when the province was ceded to Great Britain after the Seven Years' War), followed by another 863 Canarian families {{in the years after}} the loss of the province, according to authors Carlos Canales Torres and Fernando Martinez Láinez. <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> returned to Spain in 1783. When <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> ceded to the United States in 1819, however, most of the new settlers also emigrated to Cuba, as happened in 1763, when <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> ceded to Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Spanish West Florida (Spanish: <b>Florida</b> Occidental) <b>was</b> a {{province}} of the Spanish Empire from 1783 until 1821, when both it and East <b>Florida</b> <b>were</b> ceded to the United States.|$|R
5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,301 {{species of}} native flora that are {{tropical}} or subtropical in nature, which {{arrived on the}} Florida peninsula about 5,000 years ago. Winds, water, and birds carried most of the tropical flora. The subtropical species spread from more northern locations. As of 2010 1,392 additional non-native plant species have been identified and established themselves in South Florida. A variety of avenues are available for species to be brought by humans deliberately or by accident: agricultural experiments, in shipping containers, or attached to vehicles. South <b>Florida</b> <b>is</b> a transportation hub for shipping and traffic between the U.S. and the Caribbean and Central and South America. In 1990, 333 million plants were brought into Miami International Airport. Both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences (IFAS) experiment with plants in laboratories throughout Florida.|$|E

The institution offers twenty-one galleries of European paintings as well as Cypriot antiquities and Asian, American, and contemporary art. The museum's art collection currently consists of more than 10,000 objects that include a wide variety of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, photographs, and decorative arts from ancient through contemporary periods and from around the world. The most celebrated items in the museum are 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century European paintings, including a world-renowned collection of Peter Paul Rubens paintings. The Ringling Museum collections constitute the largest university museum complex in the United States. In 2014 the Ringling was selected as the second most popular attraction in Florida by the readers of USAToday Travel.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of Phoenix's freeway system {{is composed of}} three major freeways—Interstate 10, Interstate 17, and U.S. Route 60. Interstate 10, being a transcontinental route between California and <b>Florida,</b> <b>is</b> the most heavily traveled freeway in the Valley of the Sun. Interstate 17 runs {{down the center of}} Arizona, connecting Phoenix with Sedona, Prescott, Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. U.S. Route 60 spans most of the country, but is only a controlled-access highway (i.e. freeway) for a few short stints, one of them being in the East Valley. West of Phoenix, it shuttles travelers to cities such as Wickenburg, Kingman and Las Vegas (by way of a connection in Wickenburg with U.S. Route 93). In addition to these three freeways, three beltways, Routes 101, 202, and 303 loop around Phoenix, the East Valley, and the West Valley, respectively. State Route 51 connects Downtown with the northern reaches of the city, and Arizona State Route 143 is a distributor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.|$|E
