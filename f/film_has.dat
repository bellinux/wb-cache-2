30|$|The nanocrystalline ZnS {{semiconducting}} {{thin films}} of 500  nm thickness have been deposited on glass substrate at different substrate temperatures (T s) by thermal evaporation technique. The structural property of deposited thin <b>films</b> <b>has</b> been measured by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray. The electrical and optical properties of thin <b>films</b> <b>have</b> been determined by D.C. two point probe and ultra-violet visible spectroscopy measurements. The X-ray diffraction patterns show that thin <b>films</b> <b>have</b> cubic structure. The electrical resistivity of thin <b>films</b> <b>has</b> decreased from 0.36  ×  106 to 0.15  ×  106  Ω cm as substrate temperature increases from 300 to 400  K.
