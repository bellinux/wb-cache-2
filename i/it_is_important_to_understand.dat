5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

However, health studies have demonstrated that headache, stress, blood pressure, fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings. It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers, while reducing energy consumption.|$|E
30|$|Finally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} how exemplar study findings can be generalized.

Correlational exemplar studies predict the experiences and characteristics that are likely to accompany the construct of interest, but we cannot claim that these experiences and characteristics cause exemplarity. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> bear in mind that while the exemplars are highly developed in one particular area, they are not necessarily highly developed in others, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> bracket findings to the construct of interest.|$|R

25|$|Because {{there are}} often many {{different}} possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how they are related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give formulas for the coordinates in one system {{in terms of the}} coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and polar coordinates (r,θ) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ.|$|E

Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties with standing, walking, turning corners, {{climbing}} stairs, and a slowing of gait {{are experienced}} as astronauts re-adapt to Earth's gravity, until terrestrial motor strategies are fully re-acquired. Adaptation to spaceflight also induces {{a significant increase}} in the time required to traverse an obstacle course on landing day, and recovery of functional mobility takes an average of two weeks. These difficulties can have adverse consequences for an astronauts’ ability to stand up or escape from the vehicle during emergencies and to function effectively immediately after leaving the spacecraft after flight. Thus <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the cause of these profound impairments of posture and locomotion stability, and develop countermeasures.|$|E

25|$|Firearm {{owners are}} subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not {{exclusively}} their state of residence. Reciprocity between states exists in certain situations, such as with regard to concealed carry permits. These are recognized on a state-by-state basis. For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun.|$|E
25|$|When {{protecting}} the coastline <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the how the sedimentary budget {{can be affected}} when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ engineering structures {{as a means of}} {{protecting the}} coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches {{but at the same time}} starving down drift beaches. This management approach is not used so much these days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not aging {{directly}} affects women's sexual functioning during menopause {{is another}} area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically {{in the areas of}} desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning. This means that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire. Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status. Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status can have on quality of life is often underestimated.|$|E
