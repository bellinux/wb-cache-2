60|$|When I say the Richmond Hotel, {{you must}} not {{understand}} me {{to speak of the}} Star and Garter in the town of that ilk situated in the county of Surrey, England. The Richmond where I passed my uncomfortable Christmas Eve stands {{on the banks of the}} pretty St. Francis River in Lower Canada. I had gone out to the colony in the autumn of that year, to look after a small property of my mother's near Kamouraska; and I originally intended to spend the winter in Quebec. But as November and December wore away, and the snow grew deeper and deeper upon the plains of Abraham, I became gradually aware that a Canadian winter was not the best adapted tonic in the world for a hearty young man with a slight <b>hereditary</b> <b>predisposition</b> to consumption. I had seen enough of Arctic life in Quebec during those two initial months to give me a good idea of its pleasures and its drawbacks. I had steered by taboggan down the ice-cone at the Falls of Montmorenci; I had driven a sleigh, tête-à-tête with a French Canadian belle, to a surprise picnic in a house at Sainte Anne; I had skated, snow-shoed, and curled to my heart's content; and I had caught my death of cold on the frozen St. Lawrence, not to mention such minor misfortunes as getting my nose, ears, and feet frostbitten during a driving party up the banks of the Chaudière. So a few days before Christmas, I determined to strike south. I would go for a tour through Virginia and the Carolinas, to escape the cold weather, waiting for the return of the summer sun to catch a glimpse of Niagara and the great lakes.|$|E

This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with <b>hereditary</b> <b>predispositions</b> and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease.

40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies of}} the effects of {{religion}} on blood pressure suggest that religious commitment is inversely associated with blood pressure and that several religious denominations or groups have relatively low rates of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. In this review, we examine the implication that certain characteristics and functions of religion account for this association, and we posit 12 possible explanations for this finding. We propose that a salutary effect of religion on blood pressure can be explained by some combination of the following correlates or sequelae of religion: the promotion of health-related behavior; <b>hereditary</b> <b>predispositions</b> in particular groups; the healthful psychosocial effects of religious practice; and, the beneficial psychodynamics of belief systems, religious rites, and faith. Since past epidemiologic studies may have been methodologically limited or flawed, possible explanations for the findings of these studies also include epistemological confusion, measurement problems, and analytical errors. Finally, for the sake of completeness, two more speculative hypotheses are identified: superempirical and supernatural influences or pathways. blood pressure hypertension religion methodology epidemiology...|$|R

When conducting his research of these diseases, Pearl recorded the height, weight, handedness, measurements of different body parts, and physical descriptions. Just like Galton, he believed that race was an important factor in human characteristics and believed in using biology and genetics to improve the long-term health of the population. Although he tried to be quantitative, objective, and systematic, his classifications of different races were influenced by social norms and prejudices.|$|E
50|$|Tumoral {{calcinosis}} {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which there is calcium deposition in the soft tissue in periarticular location i.e. around joints. The accumulations are outside the joint capsule. They are frequently seen in patients undergoing renal dialysis. It is also considered by some to have a <b>hereditary</b> <b>predisposition.</b> The name indicates calcinosis (calcium deposition) which resembles tumor (like a new growth). They are not true neoplasms - they don't have dividing cells. They are just deposition of inorganic calcium with serum exudate.Children and adolescents (6 to 25 years) are the most commonly affected. The symptom that the accumulations cause is not pain but swelling around joints. They have propensity to enlarge progressively and ulcerate the overlying skin and extrude. They are most common around shoulders, hips and elbows. Laboratory evaluation reveal normal serum calcium levels and hyperphosphatemia. Rarely ALP (alkaline phosphatase - an enzyme active at sites of bone formation) may be elevated. Treatment is normalization of serum phosphate levels and resection of lesion. Surgical removal should be complete and if part of it is left, there is inevitable recurrence. Cutting through the excised calcium deposition reveals semifluid calcium suspension in albumin encapsulated by fibrous tissue.|$|E
5000|$|Neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis (NICO) is a {{controversial}} term, {{and it is}} questioned to exist by many. Osteonecrosis of the jaws refers {{to the death of}} bone marrow in the maxilla or the mandible due to inadequate blood supply. It is not necessarily a painful condition, typically there will be no pain at all unless bone necrotic bone becomes exposed to the mouth or through the facial skin, and even then this continues to be painless in some cases. When pain does occur, it is variable in severity, and may be neuralgiform or neuropathic in nature. The term NICO is used to describe pain caused by ischemic osteonecrosis of the jaws, where degenerative extracellular cystic spaces (cavitations inside the bone) are said to develop as a result of ischemia and infarctions in the bone marrow, possibly in relation to other factors such as a <b>hereditary</b> <b>predisposition</b> for thrombus formation within blood vessels, chronic low-grade dental infections and the use of vasoconstrictors in local anesthetics during dental procedures. This proposed phenomenon has been postulated to be the cause of pain in some patients with AFP or trigeminal neuralgia, but this is controversial. NICO is said to be significantly more common in females, and the lesions {{may or may not be}} visible on radiographs. When they are visible, the appearance is very variable. About 60% of the lesions appear as a [...] "hot spot" [...] on an technetium 99 bone scan. Proponents of NICO recommend decortication (surgical removal of a section of the cortical plate, originally described as a treatment for osteomyelitis of the jaws) and curettage of the necrotic bone from the cavitation, and in some reported cases, this has relieved the chronic pain. However, NICO appears to show a tendency to recur and develop elsewhere in the jaws. The American Association of Endodontists Research and Scientific Affairs Committee published a position statement on NICO in 1996, stating: ...|$|E
5000|$|High {{dietary intake}} of {{fructose}} contributes significantly to hyperuricemia. In a large {{study in the}} United States, consumption of four or more sugar-sweetened soft drinks per day gave an odds ratio of 1.82 for hyperuricemia.

This interference has a dual action, both increasing the conversion of ATP to inosine and hence uric acid and increasing the synthesis of purine. [...] Fructose also inhibits the excretion of uric acid, apparently by competing with uric acid for access to the transport protein SLC2A9.

40|$|AbstractThe PTEN tumor {{suppressor}} is mutated {{in diverse}} human cancers and in <b>hereditary</b> cancer <b>predisposition</b> syndromes. PTEN is a phosphatase that can act on both polypeptide and phosphoinositide substrates in vitro. The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase domain {{that is similar}} to protein phosphatases but has an enlarged active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C 2 domain. The PTEN C 2 domain binds phospholipid membranes in vitro, and mutation of basic residues that could mediate this reduces PTEN's membrane affinity and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells. The phosphatase and C 2 domains associate across an extensive interface, suggesting that the C 2 domain may serve to productively position the catalytic domain on the membrane...|$|R

40|$|Perforin, a pore-forming toxin {{released}} from secretory granules of NK cells and CTLs, {{is essential for}} their cytotoxic activity against infected or cancerous target cells. Bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in the perforin gene are invariably associated with a fatal immunoregulatory disorder, familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (FHL 2), in infants.

Herein we report a family in which a wide range of systemic inflammatory and neoplastic manifestations have occurred across three generations. We found that disease was linked to two missense perforin gene mutations (encoding A 91 V, R 410 W) that cause protein misfolding and partial loss of activity. These cases link the partial loss of perforin function with some solid tumours that are known to be controlled by the immune system, as well as haematological cancers.
