25|$|The P54C was {{followed}} by the P54CQS which operated at 120MHz. It was fabricated in a 0.35µm BiCMOS process and was the first commercial microprocessor to be fabricated in a 0.35µm process. Its transistor count is identical to the P54C and, despite the newer process, it had an identical <b>die</b> <b>area</b> as well. The chip was connected to the package using wire bonding, which only allows connections along the edges of the chip. A smaller chip would have required a redesign of the package, as there is a limit on the length of the wires and the edges of the chip would be further away from the pads on the package. The solution was to keep the chip the same size, retain the existing pad-ring, and only reduce the size of the Pentium's logic circuitry to enable it to achieve higher clock frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized <b>die</b> <b>area</b> and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

2500|$|The V80 (μPD70832) was {{launched}} {{in the spring of}} 1989. Incorporating on-chip caches and a branch predictor, it was declared NEC's 486 by Computer Business Review. The performance of the V80 was two to four times that of the V70, depending on the application. For example, unlike its V70 predecessor, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier reducing integer multiplication to 9 cycles compared to 23 cycles in the V70. (For more such differences, see next section.) The V80 was manufactured in a 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a <b>die</b> <b>area</b> of [...] consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged as a 280-pin PGA and operated at 25 or 33MHz with a claimed peak performance of 12.5 and respectively 16.5 MIPS. The V80 had separate 1KB on-die instruction and data caches and a 64-entry branch predictor; the performance gains attributed to the latter was about 5%. The launch prices if the V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33MHz and $960 for the 25MHz version. Supposedly a 45MHz version was scheduled for 1990, but this did not materialize.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Modern RF topologies utilize a {{quadrature}} {{and frequency}} spread spectrum scheme {{in order to}} increase data throughput, avoid interference, and preserve data integrity. Many commercial solutions strongly favor the single LC oscillator owing to its simplicity and low-phase noise. Cross-coupling LC oscillators decrease quadrature output error, while increasing phase noise, which can cause adjacent channel interference. The LC oscillator also has a very limited effective tuning range and requires large <b>die</b> <b>areas,</b> which increases equipment and manufacturing costs. A flexible and ultra-wideband pulsed dual-integrator quadrature oscillator utilizing only resistors and capacitors that can be configured to exhibit strongly non-linear or quasi-linear time-domain response and can tune over a decade of GHz frequencies is proposed...|$|R

Dissection of perigastric and extraperigastric lymph nodes, defined as 'extended' (> 26 nodes dissected) in 39 cases and 'limited' (7). The cumulative 5 -year survival rate was 47 % in patients without lymph node metastases; 29 % in those with 1 - 7 nodes involved and 17 % in those with > 8 nodes involved (p= 0. 002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, in 65 nodenegative cancer cases, demonstrated an area under the curve for vital status (alive or dead) of 0. 602 (95 % CI: 0. 473 - 0. 721). All node-negative cases with a number equivalent to or exceeding the cutoff point of 23 nodes were alive.

Therefore, shrinking designs demand additional verification before being signed-off for manufacturing.
