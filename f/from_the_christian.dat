5|$|Aramaic was {{the primary}} {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the three}} largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> community in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Calafia meets Radiaro, a Moslem warrior who convinces {{her that}} she should join him in retaking Constantinople <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> armies holding it. Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take their ships, weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, though she has no concept {{of what it means}} to be Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, as there is no other metal in California. They fill their ships with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with penguins began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king penguins <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a king penguin chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the penguins that it is a daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E

5|$|Matthias convoked the Diet to make {{preparations}} for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For the same purpose, he received subsidies from Pope Paul II. However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid {{could be expected}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> powers and tacitly gave up his anti-Ottoman foreign policy. He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II's envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465.|$|E

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross, {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{described}} as depicting a combination of scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, one of whose feet is thrust into the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, while a hand is placed against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir. The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus's defeat of Satan.|$|E
5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E
5|$|During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries were {{approved}} by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990, {{but this was not}} immediately supported by the government. On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region and looked at the proposed areas of the Triangle Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Democratic Party, stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.|$|E

5|$|Five {{references}} in Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on Easter Eve and being denied entry by the presiding bishop {{because he had}} not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed. At 6.36.3, he writes of letters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, a contemporary of Philip (he held the patriarchate from 247 to 265). At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that Alexander Severus (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.|$|E
5|$|Following the abdication of the Russian Tsar in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia—and {{beyond it}} India—open to the Turkish Army. The War Office {{responded with a}} plan to send a force of {{hand-picked}} British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. This force became known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Charles Dunsterville, the inspiration for the titular character of Rudyard Kipling's novel Stalky & Co.. It arrived in Baku in August 1918. It was hoped that Dunsterforce could raise an army <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Georgian, Armenian and Assyrian people who had supported the Russians and had historically feared the Turks. While Dunsterforce had some success the task proved beyond its ability.|$|E

The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide had to step down from office that year. His successor was Helen Bjørnøy. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 19972001, 20012005 and 20052009.

The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The city would pay NOK 224 million, while the state would pay NOK 673 million.|$|E
5|$|In September 1792 Heywood was court-martialed {{and with}} five others {{was sentenced to}} hang. However, the court {{recommended}} mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions that gave him his first command {{at the age of}} 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence.|$|E
5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of the conversion of the khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The conversion of the khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E
