25|$|Sinecatechins (marketed as Veregen and Polyphenon E) is an {{ointment}} of catechins (55% epigallocatechin gallate) {{extracted from}} green tea and other components. Mode {{of action is}} undetermined. It appears to have higher clearance rates than podophyllotoxin and <b>imiquimod</b> and causes less local irritation, but clearance takes longer than with <b>imiquimod.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Imiquimod</b> (Aldara) is {{a topical}} immune {{response}} cream, {{applied to the}} affected area. It causes less local irritation than podofilox but may cause fungal infections (11% in package insert) and flu-like symptoms (less than 5% disclosed in package insert).|$|E
25|$|For {{low-risk}} disease, {{radiation therapy}} (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (<b>imiquimod</b> or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of <b>imiquimod</b> showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Imiquimod</b> {{is a form}} of {{immunotherapy}} initially {{proposed as}} a treatment for molluscum based on promising results in small case series and clinical trials. However, two large randomized controlled trials, specifically requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act both demonstrated that <b>imiquimod</b> cream applied three times per week was no more effective than placebo cream for treating molluscum after 18 weeks of treatment in a total of 702 children aged 2–12 years. In 2007, results from those trials—which remain unpublished—were incorporated into FDA-approved prescribing information for <b>imiquimod,</b> which states: [...] "Limitations of Use: Efficacy was not demonstrated for molluscum contagiosum in children aged 2–12." [...] In 2007, the FDA also updated imiquimod's label concerning safety issues raised in the two large trials and an FDA-requested pharmacokinetic study (the latter of which was published). The updated safety label reads as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Potential {{systemic}} {{absorption of}} <b>imiquimod,</b> with {{negative effects on}} {{white blood cell counts}} overall, and specifically neutrophil counts: [...] "Among the 20 subjects with evaluable laboratory assessments, the median WBC count decreased by 1.4*109/L and the median absolute neutrophil count decreased by 1.42L−1." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ (lentigo maligna) have {{resolved}} with {{an experimental}} treatment, [...] <b>imiquimod</b> (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some dermasurgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating {{the area with}} Aldara cream postoperatively for three months.|$|E
2500|$|A 0.15–0.5% podophyllotoxin (also called podofilox) {{solution}} in a gel or cream. Marketed as Condylox (0.5%), [...] Wartec (0.15%) and Warticon (0.15%), {{it can be}} applied by the patient to the affected area and is not washed off. It is the purified and standardized active ingredient of the podophyllin (see below). Podofilox is safer and more effective than podophyllin. Skin erosion and pain are more commonly reported than with <b>imiquimod</b> and sinecatechins. Its use is cycled (2 times per day for 3 days then 4–7 days off); one review states that it should only be used for four cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Potential {{adverse effects}} of <b>imiquimod</b> use: [...] "Similar to the studies {{conducted}} in adults, the most frequently reported adverse reaction from 2 studies in children with molluscum contagiosum was application site reaction. Adverse events which occurred more frequently in Aldara-treated subjects compared with vehicle-treated subjects generally resembled those seen in studies in indications approved for adults and also included otitis media (5% Aldara vs. 3% vehicle) and conjunctivitis (3% Aldara vs. 2% vehicle). Erythema was the most frequently reported local skin reaction. Severe local skin reactions reported by Aldara-treated subjects in the pediatric studies included erythema (28%), edema (8%), scabbing/crusting (5%), flaking/scaling (5%), erosion (2%) and weeping/exudate (2%)." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Imiquimod</b> {{signals to}} the innate arm {{of the immune system}} through the {{toll-like}} receptor 7 (TLR7), commonly involved in pathogen recognition. Cells activated by <b>imiquimod</b> via TLR-7 secrete cytokines (primarily interferon-α (IFN-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)). There is evidence that <b>imiquimod,</b> when applied to skin, can lead to the activation of Langerhans cells, which subsequently migrate to local lymph nodes to activate the adaptive immune system. Other cell types activated by <b>imiquimod</b> include natural killer cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes. Overall <b>imiquimod</b> acts on several levels, which appear to synergistically underlie the profound antitumoral activity of the compound.|$|E
50|$|Good {{results have}} been noted {{with the use of}} <b>imiquimod</b> for Bowen's disease, {{including}} on the penis (erythroplasia of Queyrat), although <b>imiquimod</b> is not (as of 2013) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of any type of squamous cell carcinoma, and serious side effects can occur with use of <b>imiquimod.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Imiquimod</b> is {{a topical}} immune-enhancing agent {{licensed}} {{for the treatment}} of genital warts. <b>Imiquimod</b> stimulates the immune system through the release and up-regulation of cytokines. Treatment with <b>Imiquimod</b> cream applied 2-3 times per week for 12 to 16 weeks was found to result in complete resolution of AKs in 50% of people, compared to 5% of controls. The <b>Imiquimod</b> 3.75% cream has been validated in a treatment regimen consisting of daily application to entire face and scalp for two 2-week treatment cycles, with a complete clearance rate of 36%. While the clearance rate observed with the <b>Imiquimod</b> 3.75% cream was lower than that observed with the 5% cream (36 and 50 percent, respectively), there are lower reported rates of adverse reactions with the 3.75% cream: 19% of individuals using <b>Imiquimod</b> 3.75% cream reported adverse reactions including local erythema, scabbing, and flaking at the application site, while nearly a third of individuals using the 5% cream reported the same types of reactions with <b>Imiquimod</b> treatment. However, it is ultimately difficult to compare the efficacy of the different strength creams directly, as current study data varies in methodology (e.g. duration and frequency of treatment, and amount of skin surface area covered).|$|E

50|$|The {{method of}} action of sinecatechins is undetermined. In its use for {{treatment}} of genital warts caused by the human papilloma virus, sinecatechins appear to have higher clearance rates than podophyllotoxin or <b>imiquimod</b> and causes less local irritation.

5000|$|Some {{superficial}} cancers {{respond to}} local therapy with 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy agent. Topical treatment with 5% <b>Imiquimod</b> cream, with five applications {{per week for}} six weeks has a reported 70-90% success rate at reducing, even removing, the BCC carcinoma. Both <b>Imiquimod</b> and 5-fluorouracil have received FDA approval, and topical IMQ is approved by the European Medicines Agency for treatment of small superficial basal-cell carcinoma. [...] Off label use of <b>imiquimod</b> on invasive basal-cell carcinoma has been reported. <b>Imiquimod</b> may be used prior to surgery {{in order to reduce}} the size of the carcinoma. One can expect a great deal of inflammation with this treatment. [...] Chemotherapy often follows Mohs surgery to eliminate the residual superficial basal-cell carcinoma after the invasive portion is removed. Some advocate the use of <b>imiquimod</b> prior to Mohs surgery to remove the superficial component of the cancer. Removing the residual superficial tumor with surgery alone can result in large and difficult to repair surgical defects. One often waits a month or more after surgery before starting the <b>Imiquimod</b> or 5-fluorouracil to make sure the surgical wound has adequately healed. Some people advocate the use of curettage (see EDC below) first, followed by chemotherapy. These experimental procedures are not standard care. The 2008 study reported that topical IMQ appears effective in the treatment of primary small superficial BCCs, but only 'may possibly' have a role in the treatment of primary nodular BCC.|$|E

50|$|<b>Imiquimod</b> (Aldara) is {{an immune}} {{response}} modifier {{that has been}} studied {{for the treatment of}} actinic cheilitis. It promotes an immune response in the skin leading to apoptosis (death) of the tumor cells. It causes the epidermis to be invaded by macrophages, which leads to epidermal erosion. T-cells are also activated as a result of <b>imiquimod</b> treatment. <b>Imiquimod</b> appears to promote an “immune memory” that reduces the recurrence of lesions. There is minimal scarring. Complete clearance has been demonstrated in up to 45% of patients with actinic keratoses. However, the dose and duration of therapy, as well as the long-term efficacy, still need to be established in the treatment of actinic cheilitis.|$|E
