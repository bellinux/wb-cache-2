5000|$|Improper <b>earmuff</b> fit {{can cause}} discomfort, {{which in turn}} may cause the {{individual}} to avoid wearing the hearing protection device, reducing its effectiveness. Characteristics of a comfortable <b>earmuff</b> include: lightweight material, soft and removable circumaural cushions, low heat and humidity buildup, easy maintenance, reduction in low-frequency noise, no resonances of sound within the earcup, wide headband, and large enough earcups to allow for full coverage of the outer ear. If the individual finds the hearing protection device to be uncomfortable, {{he or she should}} explore other options for hearing protection, such as a different style of <b>earmuff</b> or earplugs.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for sound to transmit through the <b>earmuff</b> materials, reducing the device's effectiveness. This transmission is primarily seen above 1000 Hz.|$|E
50|$|<b>Earmuffs</b> {{are another}} type of HPD. The main {{difference}} between <b>earmuffs</b> and earplugs, is that <b>earmuffs</b> are not inserted inside the ear canal. Instead the muffs create a seal around {{the outside of the}} ear to prevent noise from reaching the inner ear. <b>Earmuffs</b> are easy to wear and often provide a more consistent fit than an earplug. There are <b>earmuffs</b> available that use the principle of active noise control to help reduce noise exposures. However, the protection <b>earmuffs</b> offer may be mitigated by large sideburns or glasses as the seal of the <b>earmuffs</b> may be broken by these objects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Earmuffs</b> are objects {{designed}} {{to cover a}} person's ears for hearing protection or for warmth. They consist of a thermoplastic or metal head-band, that fits over the top or back of the head, and a cushion or cup at each end, to cover the external ears. This article primarily focuses on the <b>earmuffs</b> for hearing protection. The difference between passive and active <b>earmuffs</b> is discussed, {{as well as a}} brief history of <b>earmuffs.</b> Finally, principles of hearing protection are introduced and the effectiveness of <b>earmuffs</b> for protecting against noise-induced hearing loss is discussed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Earmuffs</b> cover a person's ears for thermal protection. <b>Earmuffs</b> {{consist of}} a {{thermoplastic}} or metal head-band, that fits {{over the top of}} the head, and a pad at each end, to cover the external ears. <b>Earmuffs</b> were invented by Chester Greenwood in 1873.|$|R
50|$|Chester Greenwood (1858-1937), is locally {{famous as}} the {{inventor}} of the <b>earmuff,</b> which were manufactured at a local factory and shipped across the colder parts of North America. Greenwood invented the <b>earmuff</b> at age 15, obtained a patent for it in 1877. He engaged in many other business endeavours in Farmingtion, including establishing its first telephone exchange (with equipment he manufactured), a bicycle factory, and a machine shop. His factory building still stands in Farmington on Front Street, as does the Greenwood Block in Main Street.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} noise {{reduction}} from dual hearing protection is NOT a {{sum of the}} noise reductions ratings from the two devices. For example, if wearing an earplug with a NRR of 25 dB and an <b>earmuff</b> with an NRR of 20 dB, the combined protection would not be 45 dB. Instead, 5 dB should {{be added to the}} higher of the two NRRs. In the preceding example, the combined <b>earmuff</b> and earplug NRR would be estimated at 30 dB (25 dB plus 5).|$|E
5000|$|Workers {{may want}} to wear their hearing aids under an <b>earmuff.</b> According to OSHA, hearing aids {{should not be used}} in areas with {{dangerous}} noise levels. However, OSHA allows for the professional(s) in charge of the hearing loss protection program to decide on a case-by-case basis if a worker can wear their hearing aids under an <b>earmuff</b> in high-level noise environments. However, workers are not permitted to wear their hearing aids (even if they are turned off) instead of using HPD. OSHA specifies that hearing aids are not [...] "hearing protectors" [...] and do not attenuate enough sound to be used instead of HPD.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Hearing {{protection}} devices {{are one of}} the primary noise reduction tools in developing countries. This study is intended to produce and apply acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) /clay nanocomposites to fabricate a laboratory single cup <b>earmuffs</b> and then compare it with double cup and single cup pure ABS <b>earmuffs</b> in terms of noise attenuation performance and comfort. In addition, the noise attenuation performance of single cup pure ABS <b>earmuffs</b> is compared with double cup pure ABS <b>earmuffs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the work}} environment, {{apart from the}} noise, {{employees}} may be exposed to other harmful factors. Therefore, they wear hearing protectors and other personal protective equipment. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether simultaneous use of <b>earmuffs</b> and respiratory protective devices affects the attenuation of <b>earmuffs.</b> Material and Methods: The study was conducted in laboratory conditions using the subjective REAT (Real Ear Attenuation at Threshold) and objective MIRE (Microphone in Real Ear) methods. The REAT method was used to measure sound attenuation of <b>earmuffs,</b> while MIRE was used to determine changes in attenuation of <b>earmuffs</b> due to the use of other personal protective equipment. Results: The study showed reduction in attenuation of <b>earmuffs</b> due to the use of a full face mask up to 20 dB. Using a full face mask causes that attenuation of <b>earmuffs</b> in the low frequency range is close to zero. Reduction in attenuation due to the use of half masks for complete with particle filters (half masks) is 3 – 15 dB. Simultaneous use of <b>earmuffs</b> and filtering half masks makes small changes in attenuation not exceeding 3 dB. Conclusions: The study showed that full face masks give the greatest reduction in attenuation of <b>earmuffs.</b> On the other hand, the least reduction is observed in the case of filtering half masks. There is a significant difference between the reduction in attenuation of <b>earmuffs</b> worn with half masks for complete with particle filters because they may be equipped with different kind of the head strap.

50|$|There are two {{different}} types of <b>earmuffs</b> used to protect the user from loud sounds based on the acoustical properties and materials used to create them: passively attenuating and actively attenuating <b>earmuffs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} a passive <b>earmuff</b> to {{attenuate}} a signal {{is based on the}} materials used. Materials, such as a cupped foam coated in hard plastic, will block sound due to the thick and dampening properties of the foam.|$|E
5000|$|... 1957 - Willard Meeker {{developed}} a paper design and working model of {{active noise control}} applied to a circumaural <b>earmuff.</b> This headset had an active attenuation bandwidth of approximately 50-500 Hz, with a maximum attenuation of approximately 20 dB.|$|E
50|$|One {{simple method}} for {{checking}} <b>earmuff</b> fit is to lift {{one or both}} muffs away from the head while in a noisy environment. If the noise is considerably louder with the adjustment, then the earmuffs are providing at least some degree of noise reduction.|$|E
5000|$|... • Burrito bowls on {{the menu}} are <b>earmuffs</b> and band camp. <b>Earmuffs</b> have a {{selection}} of protein, seasoned rice beans, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and guacamole. The vegetarian option, band camp, has the same ingredients minus the protein.|$|R
50|$|Acoustic <b>earmuffs,</b> {{also known}} as ear defenders: cups lined with sound-deadening material, like thermal <b>earmuffs</b> and {{headphones}} in appearance, which are worn as hearing protection. These may be carried on a head-band or clipped onto the sides of a hard hat, for use on construction sites. Some manufacturers combine headphones with ear defenders, allowing the wearer to listen to music, communication or other audio source and also enjoy protection or isolation from ambient noise. For extra sound attenuation, earplugs {{can also be used}} in conjunction with <b>earmuffs.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{deciding}} between <b>earmuffs</b> and earplugs, it is {{also important}} to consider the noise reduction levels achieved at different sound frequencies. In general, <b>earmuffs</b> provide less attenuation for low-frequency (<500 Hz) sounds than earplugs. Thus, in situations where noise is dominated by low-frequency energy, earplugs are likely to be more effective. <b>Earmuffs</b> also fail to provide any noise reduction at infrasonic frequencies (< 20 Hz), which is energy that cannot be heard because it falls below the range of human hearing sensitivity. In contrast, earplugs can provide some attenuation to infrasonic sounds.|$|R
50|$|The Chester Greenwood House is an {{historic}} house on Maine State Route 27 in Farmington, Maine. Built in 1896, {{it is an}} architecturally distinctive sophisticated Queen Anne Victorian. It is also notable {{as the home of}} Chester Greenwood, who invented the <b>earmuff.</b> It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.|$|E
5000|$|A typical <b>earmuff</b> attenuates (decreases) {{the level}} of noise by {{approximately}} 23 dB when tested under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. The EPA requires that <b>earmuff</b> manufacturers test each device's performance and indicate their specific noise-reduction capabilities on the product labeling. This single number is called the Noise Reduction Rating, or NRR. Unfortunately, when worn in real life, the actual attenuation of the device is likely {{much lower than the}} labeled NRR. Experiments have indicated that the actual attenuation achieved by ordinary users of earmuffs is only 33% to 74% of the labeled NRR. [...] Improper fit, device deterioration, and a poor seal with the head all contribute to reduced device performance. Despite these drawbacks, research has shown that the real-world performance of earmuffs is in closer agreement to manufacturers' labels than it is for earplugs. This suggests that earmuffs are more intuitive for users to wear correctly and in some cases may be a more appropriate choice of hearing protection.|$|E
5000|$|Chester Greenwood (December 4, 1858 - July 5, 1937), of Farmington, Maine, {{invented the}} <b>earmuff</b> in 1873, {{at the age}} of 15. [...] He {{reportedly}} {{came up with the idea}} while ice skating and he asked his grandmother to sew tufts of fur between loops of wire. [...] His patent was for improved ear protectors. He manufactured these ear protectors, providing jobs for people in the Farmington area for nearly 60 years.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Tom sneaks {{behind the}} fence and leans over it to place <b>earmuffs</b> over the {{sleeping}} dog. However, his feet cause a board to creak out of place, leaving him dangling over the dog as it continues to fall. Tom saves himself by curling his tail around {{the foundation of the}} fence such that he and the board are pulled back up to the fence. Tom makes noises to test the <b>earmuffs,</b> and when the dog stays asleep, he goes off to corner Jerry. Jerry blows his whistle while Tom only looks more menacing than before, but then Jerry pulls out a pair of <b>earmuffs</b> and continues whistling. Thinking they're the dog's <b>earmuffs,</b> Tom gets so scared that he rolls himself into a ball and bowls off the pier, and even grabs the crab and attaches it to his tail. However, in the final scene, Jerry then puts that pair on as he lies down next to the dog (who still had his <b>earmuffs</b> on) to take a nap.|$|R

5000|$|Analysis of {{physical}} hazards such as noise {{that would lead}} to use of earplugs or <b>earmuffs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Earmuffs for {{the purpose}} of hearing {{protection}} are believed to have originated during World War II. [...] Pilots of military aircraft wore leather flaps over their ears, supposedly to protect against noise-induced hearing loss due to engine noise. Prototype versions of earmuffs, composed of a headband and cuffs to fit over the outer ear, were soon after developed. These early versions were not practical due to the discomfort caused by the headbands being tightly fixed against the head. In 1954, an <b>earmuff</b> with a more comfortable cushion design was developed.|$|E
5000|$|NIOSH has {{proposed}} a different method for derating based upon the type of protector. [...] For earmuffs, the NRR should be derated by 25%, for slow-recovery foam earplugs the derating is 50% for all other protection, the derating is 70%. NIOSH applies the C-A spectral compensation differently than OSHA. Where OSHA subtracts the 7-dB factor first and derates the result, NIOSH derates the NRR first and then compensates for the C-A difference. For example, to find the derated NRR for an <b>earmuff</b> by using the NIOSH derating system, the following equation would be used: ...|$|E
5000|$|Active noise {{reduction}} earmuffs incorporate Electronic Noise Cancellation or Active Noise Cancellation to attenuate (roughly 26 dB NRR) low frequency noise. A microphone, circuit, and speaker inside the muff {{are used to}} actively cancel out noise. As a signal enters the microphone, the electronics within the <b>earmuff</b> cast a signal back that is 180° out of phase with the signal, thus [...] "cancelling" [...] this signal. This opposing signal reduces the amplitude of the waveform and reduces the signal. These earmuffs are designed to protect against a continuous signal, particularly low frequency sounds, such as diesel locomotives, heavy tractors, or airfields.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{important}} to consider the age and physical condition of <b>earmuffs.</b> <b>Earmuffs</b> should be inspected regularly for cracks and changes in shape or firmness. Headbands may also lose their tension or ability to properly adjust to the head, which could lead to a decrease in device effectiveness. Physical changes could create an opening to the ear, allowing sound through and reducing attenuation.|$|R
50|$|Thermal <b>earmuffs,</b> worn in cold environments {{to keep a}} person's ears {{warm with}} pads of cloth or fur.|$|R
5000|$|Chester Greenwood {{invented the}} thermal <b>earmuff</b> in 1873, {{at the age}} of 15. He {{reportedly}} {{came up with the idea}} while ice skating, and had his grandmother sew tufts of fur between loops of wire. [...] He was awarded patent #188,292 on March 13, 1877. He manufactured these ear protectors, providing jobs for people in the Farmington, Maine area, for nearly 60 years. Every year, on the first Saturday of December, the town of Farmington celebrates [...] "Chester Greenwood Day" [...] with a variety of activities. A parade in Chester's honor is a part of the festivities. Everyone participating in the parade must wear earmuffs.|$|E
50|$|A proper {{fit of the}} {{earmuffs}} on {{the head}} is essential to providing adequate hearing protection. Individuals will require earmuffs of differing sizes. This is especially important to remember when considering earmuffs for children. Muffs should make a good seal against the head and should fully cover the outer ear without pushing against the ears. Additionally, the headband should be the correct length to hold the cushions over the ears. Otherwise, sound can leak under the muffs and will reach the users' ears. Some wearers may use their earmuffs when hair is covering their ears or while wearing glasses. Prior to placement on the head, hair should be carefully pulled back {{and away from the}} cushions. Placing earmuffs over obstructing hair or safety glasses with thick frames may reduce the <b>earmuff</b> attenuation by 5-10 dB. Even eye-glasses with thinner frames can reduce the effectiveness of hearing protection by 3-7 dB.|$|E
5000|$|Motivational {{techniques}} {{can be implemented}} to promote hearing conservation program compliance {{and the use of}} hearing protection. One suggestion is continued education at the workers' audiometric screening. They should be asked to bring along their current hearing protection device to the screening. If the results are normal and the inspection of the hearing protection device is good, praise can be given for following protocol. If there is a shift in their hearing, instruction can be given again about the proper use of hearing protection and the importance of wearing them. Audiograms can be very useful in showing workers how noise can affect their hearing. One specific {{way to do this is}} to perform two hearing test on an employee on two different days. [...] One day the hearing test will be after wearing hearing protection all day and the other will be after not wearing hearing protection for the day. The difference can then be discussed with the worker and he/she has a tangible way to see how noise affects hearing. Another technique is using [...] "internal triggers" [...] to motivate employees to comply to the hearing conservation program. [...] If the individual already suffers from tinnitus and/or hearing loss they are probably more likely to use hearing protection because he/she does not want that problem to progress with noise exposure. Finally, the hearing protection offered should be comfortable so the worker will wear it. It is suggested that workers have a variety of hearing protection devices available to them, including at least one type of <b>earmuff</b> and two different forms of earplugs, to fit the individual needs and wants of the workers.|$|E
50|$|Personal noise {{reduction}} devices can be passive, active or a combination. Passive ear protection includes earplugs or <b>earmuffs</b> which can block noise up {{to a specific}} frequency. Earplugs and <b>earmuffs</b> can provide the wearer with 10 dB to 40 dB of attenuation. However, use of earplugs is only effective if the users have been educated and use them properly; without proper use, protection falls far below manufacturer ratings. Higher consistency of performance has been found with custom-molded earplugs. Because of their ease of use without education, and ease of application or removal, <b>earmuffs</b> have more consistency with both compliance and noise attenuation. Active ear protection (electronic pass-through hearing protection devices or EPHPs) electronically filter out noises of specific frequencies or decibels while allowing the remaining noise to pass through.|$|R
