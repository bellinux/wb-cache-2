40|$|The O 2 {{dissociation}} and O atoms adsorption on free-standing germanene are {{studied by}} using first-principles calculations in this letter. Compared with the spontaneous dissociation of oxygen molecule on free-standing silicene in air, germanene is {{more stable than}} silicene from kinetic point of view, with overcoming energy barrier of about 0. 55 eV. Especially, {{in contrast with the}} unique chemical adsorption of O 2 -dissociation-induced O atoms on silicene, oxygen molecule can behave a correspondingly stable adsorption on germanene surface. Moreover, single O atom adsorption on germanene is also different to that on silicene, resulting in two opposite migration pathways on germanene surface. Furthermore, once the oxygen molecule dissociates into O atoms on germanene surface, the migration and desorption of O atoms are relatively difficult under room temperature due to the strong Ge-O bonds in the O-adsorbed germanene, in favor of forming <b>germanium</b> <b>oxides.</b> The results provide compelling evidence to show that free-standing gemanene is relatively stable in oxygen,which is different to silicene essentially...|$|R

For that, hafnium oxide films were deposited on germanium, which was passivated or not with sulfur.

Ab initio modeling can provide mechanistic understanding of the performance of prospective materials and guide design. We review our recent comparative ab initio studies of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and aluminum interactions with different phases of several actively experimentally studied electrode materials, including monoelemental materials carbon, silicon, tin, and <b>germanium,</b> <b>oxides</b> TiO 2 and VxOy as well as sulphur-based spinels MS 2 (M = transition metal). These studies are unique in that they provided reliable comparisons, i. e., at the same level of theory and using the same computational parameters, among different materials and among Li, Na, K, Mg, and Al. Specifically, insertion energetics (related to the electrode voltage) and diffusion barriers (related to rate capability), as well as phononic effects, are compared. These studies facilitate identification of phases most suitable as anode or cathode for different types of batteries. We highlight the possibility of increasing the voltage, or enabling electrochemical activity, by amorphization and p-doping, of rational choice of phases of oxides to maximize the insertion potential of Li, Na, K, Mg, Al, as well as of rational choice of the optimum sulfur-based spinel for Mg and Al insertion, based on ab initio calculations.

The infla-red absorption spectra of crystals in the Li 2 O-GeO 2, Na 2 O-GeO 2 and K 2 O-GeO 2 systems, whose crystal structures were known, have been measured and the wave numbers of the main Ge-O-Ge vibration peaks in the 700 ~ 875 cm- 1 range have been correlated with the coordination number of germanium atoms in the crystals. It has been indicated that the shift of the absorption band toward lower wave numbers are caused not only by occurrence of six-coordinated Ge atoms but also by presence of alkali oxides in the crystal composition.
