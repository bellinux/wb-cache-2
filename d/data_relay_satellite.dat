5|$|Radio {{communications}} provided telemetry {{and scientific}} data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links {{were also used}} during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, Mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to the core module. The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the Luch <b>data</b> <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, {{in order to receive}} commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Orbital Segment {{communicates}} {{directly with}} the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to Zvezda. The Lira antenna also has the capability to use the Luch <b>data</b> <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> system. This system, used for communications with Mir, fell into disrepair during the 1990s, and so {{is no longer in}} use, although two new Luch satellites—Luch-5A and Luch-5B—were launched in 2011 and 2012 respectively to restore the operational capability of the system. Another Russian communications system is the Voskhod-M, which enables internal telephone communications between Zvezda, Zarya, Pirs, Poisk and the USOS, and also provides a VHF radio link to ground control centres via antennas on Zvezda exterior.|$|E
25|$|The US Orbital Segment (USOS) {{makes use}} of two {{separate}} radio links mounted in the Z1 truss structure: the S band (used for audio) and Ku band (used for audio, video and data) systems. These transmissions are routed via the United States Tracking and <b>Data</b> <b>Relay</b> <b>Satellite</b> System (TDRSS) in geostationary orbit, which allows for almost continuous real-time communications with NASA's Mission Control Center (MCC-H) in Houston. Data channels for the Canadarm2, European Columbus laboratory and Japanese Kibō modules are routed via the S band and Ku band systems, although the European Data Relay System and a similar Japanese system will eventually complement the TDRSS in this role. Communications between modules are carried on an internal digital wireless network.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} unique {{features}} of telemetry system design for spacecraft. One {{of these is}} the approach to the fact that for any given satellite in LEO, because it is traveling so quickly, it may only be in contact with a particular station for ten to twenty minutes. This would require hundreds of ground stations to stay in constant communication, which is not at all practical. One solution to this is onboard data storage. Data storage can accumulate data slowly throughout the orbit and dump it quickly when over a ground station. In deep space missions, the recorder is often used the opposite way, to capture high-rate data and play it back slowly over data-rate-limited links. Another solution is <b>data</b> <b>relay</b> <b>satellites.</b> NASA has satellites in GEO called TDRS, Tracking and <b>Data</b> <b>Relay</b> <b>Satellites,</b> which <b>relay</b> commands and telemetry from LEO satellites. Prior to TDRS, astronauts could communicate with the Earth for only about 15% of the orbit, using 14 NASA ground stations around the world. With TDRS, coverage of low-altitude satellites is global, from a single ground station at White Sands, New Mexico.|$|R

Pointing accuracy of antenna pointing mechanisms {{plays an important role}} in dictating the efficiency of the satellite communication system. Since the pointing accuracy is affected by composite factors including joint clearances, thermal load, etc., achieving a high pointing accuracy is a challenging task especially in space.|$|R
