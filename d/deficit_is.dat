This statement resembles {{the income statement}} of a business, but may use terms like excess or deficit rather than profit or loss. It shows the net results, by each fund, of the organization's activities during the fiscal year reported. The excess or <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> shown as a change in fund balances, simpler to an increase or decrease in owner's equity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living. The most noticeable <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E

5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E

40|$|Neuropsychologic <b>deficits</b> <b>are</b> {{prevalent}} among schizophrenic patients and are {{closely associated with}} pathogenesis and outcome. The pattern, extent, severity and contributing factors to such <b>deficits</b> remain to <b>be</b> examined in Taiwanese schizophrenic patients. Methods: A total of 122 schizophrenic patients and 94 healthy subjects for comparison were assessed by a comprehensive neuropsychologic test battery covering the eight cognitive domains of verbal ability, visual spatial ability, abstraction/execution, verbal memory, visual memory, perceptual/motor ability, mental control and attention. The relationships among cognitive deficits, demographic characteristics, clinical historical variables and clinical symptoms were further explored by multivariate regression analysis. Results: A pattern of selective deficits superimposed on a generalized <b>deficit</b> <b>was</b> found for schizophrenic patients as a group. The mean overall <b>deficit</b> <b>was</b> 1. 93 standard deviations below the control mean, and abstraction/execution, verbal memory, visual memory and attention were relatively impaired among the eight cognitive domains. However, there was also marked heterogeneity in individual performances in that 24. 2 %, 46. 2 % and 29. 5 % of patients performed at within normal range, moderately impaired and severely impaired levels, respectively. Duration of illness substantially affected the profile and severity of the deficits, suggesting a progressive deteriorating course in neuropsychological performance. The major predictors of cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> number of formal years of education achieved and concurrent severity of disorganization symptoms. Conclusion: In a large sample of schizophrenic patients who underwent comprehensive neuropsycho-logic evaluation, the current results confirmed that cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> prevalent but not a universal feature within schizophrenia. The selective impairment pattern also confirmed that such <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> mainly in frontal and frontotemporal related functions. Despite evidence suggesting that disease chronic-ity entailed a decline in selective cognitive domains, the trajectory of the neuropsychologic <b>deficits</b> remains to <b>be</b> examined by further longitudinal studies...|$|R

40|$|We studied 65 {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} a first stroke who had an appropriate CT-proven small infarct in {{the territory of the}} lateral (61 patients), medial (3 patients) or both lateral and medial lenticulostriate arteries (1 patient) from the middle cerebral artery. While more than 75 % of these patients were either hypertensive or diabetic (having at least one cause for small-artery disease), embolic sources were encountered in 35 %, either from large vessels (28 %), and/or from the heart (15 %). Other causes (angiitis, migraine) were found in only 9 %. The neurologic <b>deficit</b> <b>was</b> purely motor in more than 50 % of the patients (in half of them with neuropsychological dysfunctions), a sensori-motor <b>deficit</b> <b>was</b> present in 30 % (in half of them with neuropsychological dysfunctions), and only 20 % had ataxic hemiparesis. No one had pure sensory stroke. None of the classical lacunar syndrome or the modality of sensory, motor or ataxic <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> specific for any topographic subdivision of LS territory, but there was a tendency for clinical features to be linked with the involved basal ganglia and the topography of pathways in the internal capsule as delineated by anatomical studies. Pure motor <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> associated with infarcts in the medial and posterior part of LS territory, visual field deficits and hemineglect always corresponded to posteriorly situated infarcts. Neuropsychological <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> common in infarcts in the anterior and posterior subdivisions of LS territory, with a major effect of the size of infarct. Sensory <b>deficits</b> <b>were</b> not correlated with any location in LS territory, probably because thalamo-efferent fibres have a more diffuse course through the internal capsule...|$|R
40|$|The {{labour market}} is {{strongly}} segmented, being normally {{characterized by the}} coexistence of two forms of deficits: the labour demand deficit (i. e. unemployment) and the labour offer deficit (i. e. vacancy jobs). As these <b>deficits</b> <b>are</b> obvious {{in the case of}} some different occupations or of some different regions, then they will have a weak compensation. Between 2005 - 2008 these <b>deficits</b> <b>are</b> increasing at Romanian regions level. The most important of them are in Public administration, and Education. On regions the most importants <b>deficits</b> <b>are</b> in Bucharest-Ilfov (the richest) and North-East (the poorest). On Occupation group the biggest <b>deficits</b> <b>is</b> for specialists with intellectual and scientific occupations. There is also a trend of increasing for labour market defficits on regional level. The most important regonal <b>deficits</b> <b>are</b> in: North-East, West and Bucharest-Ilfov. On regions the most important <b>deficits</b> <b>are</b> for Farmers and skilled workers in agriculture, forestry and fishery in Bucharest-Ilfov (gravitational effect) and South-West: specialists with intellectual and scientific occupations: West,and Bucharest-Ilfov; workers for maintenance and adjustment: North-East. There is a negative relation between the two deficits, so that the rate of unemployment tends to get decreased below the level of the natural unemployment and the rate of the vacancy will get increased during the periods when a strong economic growth is recorded; the inverse relation has been represented within the "Beveridge curve". This study is to confirm the validity of the Beveridge curve for Romania during the period between January 2004 and June 2009, using the monthly data.

25|$|PD {{patients}} often demonstrate {{deficits in}} their ability to sequence information, or date events.
