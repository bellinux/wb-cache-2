5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> new antibiotics.

5|$|Current historiography {{developed}} in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.|$|E

5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the biological species concept.|$|E
