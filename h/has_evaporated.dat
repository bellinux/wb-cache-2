Such presses may leave an intended imprint on the tea, such as an artistic design or simply the pattern of the cloth with which the tea was pressed. Many powdered tea bricks are moistened with rice water in pressing to assure that the tea powder sticks together.

25|$|The {{second and}} more serious problem, {{unacknowledged}} by bank management, the financial regulator and the Irish government, is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to domestic {{problems in the}} crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio. These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand <b>has</b> <b>evaporated.</b> The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had propped up demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land at an average value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.|$|E

2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one <b>has</b> <b>evaporated,</b> instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's so much going on that it's starting to feel unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes no sense at all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E

60|$|Alas! I {{found my}} late poor and {{contented}} friend {{one of the}} richest and most miserable men in Paris. Instead of rejoicing hi the ample competency restored to him, he is daily repining at the superfluity withheld. He no longer wanders in happy idleness about Paris, but is a repining attendant in the ante-chambers of ministers. His loyalty <b>has</b> <b>evaporated</b> with his gayety; he screws his mouth when the Bourbons are mentioned, and even shrugs his shoulders when he hears the praises of the king. In a word, {{he is one of the}} many philosophers undone by the law of indemnity, and his case is desperate, for I doubt whether even another reverse of fortune, which should restore him to poverty, could make him again a happy man.|$|E
6000|$|The whole Epithalamion is very noble, with an organ-like {{roll and}} majesty of numbers, {{while it is}} {{instinct}} with the same joyousness which {{must have been the}} familiar mood of Spenser. It is no superficial and tiresome merriment, but a profound delight in the beauty of the universe and in that delicately surfaced nature of his which was its mirror and counterpart. Sadness was alien to him, and at funerals he was, to be sure, a decorous mourner, as could not fail with so sympathetic a temperament; but his condolences are graduated to the unimpassioned scale of social requirement. Even for Sir Philip Sidney his sighs are regulated by the official standard. It was in an unreal world that his affections found their true object and vent, and it is in an elegy of a lady whom he had never known that he puts into the mouth of a husband whom he <b>has</b> <b>evaporated</b> into a shepherd, the two most naturally pathetic verses he ever penned:-- ...|$|E

This forenoon there stood the horses, tether'd together, dripping, steaming, chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping also. The fires are half-quench'd." [...] There is a poetic poise in this brief, vivid statement, apart from its bare economy of means. It is the lump awaiting the leaven no less than is [...] "Cavalry Crossing a Ford." [...] To this supreme spectator an apple orchard in May, even the White House in moonlight, no more and no less than these battle-scenes, rendered up their dignity, life, and beauty, their true human significance. But in [...] "Drum-Taps" [...] the witness is not always so satisfactory.

60|$|The king's {{household}} has {{not only}} several strong traces of this feudality, but it is formed also upon the principles of a body corporate: {{it has its own}} magistrates, courts, and by-laws. This might be necessary in the ancient times, {{in order to have a}} government within itself, capable of regulating the vast and often unruly multitude which composed and attended it. This was the origin of the ancient court called the Green Cloth,--composed of the marshal, treasurer, and other great officers of the household, with certain clerks. The rich subjects of the kingdom, who had formerly the same establishments, (only on a reduced scale,) have since altered their economy, and turned the course of their expense from the maintenance of vast establishments within their walls to the employment of a great variety of independent trades abroad. Their influence is lessened; but a mode of accommodation and a style of splendor suited to the manners of the times has been increased. Royalty itself has insensibly followed, and the royal household has been carried away by the resistless tide of manners, but with this very material difference: private men have got rid of the establishments along with the reasons of them; whereas the royal household has lost all that was stately and venerable in the antique manners, without retrenching anything of the cumbrous charge of a Gothic establishment. It is shrunk into the polished littleness of modern elegance and personal accommodation; it <b>has</b> <b>evaporated</b> from the gross concrete into an essence and rectified spirit of expense, where you have tuns of ancient pomp in a vial of modern luxury.|$|E
6000|$|The natural {{tendency}} of civilisation is to obliterate those distinctions {{which are the}} best salt of life. All the fine old professional flavour in language <b>has</b> <b>evaporated.</b> Your very gravedigger has forgotten his avocation in his electorship, and would quibble on the Franchise over Ophelia's grave, instead of more appropriately discussing the duration of bodies under ground. From this tendency, from this gradual attrition of life, in which everything pointed and characteristic is being rubbed down, till the whole world begins to slip between our fingers in smooth undistinguishable sands, from this, we say, it follows that we must not attempt to join Mr. Tatler in his simple division of students into Law, Divinity, and Medical. Nowadays the Faculties may shake hands over their follies; and, like Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight (in Love for Love) they may stand in the doors of opposite class-rooms, crying: [...] "Sister, Sister--Sister everyway!" [...] A few restrictions, indeed, remain to influence the followers of individual branches of study. The Divinity, for example, must be an avowed believer; and as this, in the present day, is unhappily considered by many as a confession of weakness, he is fain to choose {{one of two ways}} of gilding the distasteful orthodox bolus. Some swallow it in a thin jelly of metaphysics; for it is even a credit to believe in God on the evidence of some crack-jaw philosopher, although it is a decided slur to believe in Him on His own authority. Others again (and this we think the worst method), finding German grammar a somewhat dry morsel, run their own little heresy as a proof of independence; and deny one of the cardinal doctrines that they may hold the others without being laughed at.|$|E
