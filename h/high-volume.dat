5|$|In {{comparison}} with its Xeon family of server processors, Itanium {{has never been}} a <b>high-volume</b> product for Intel. Intel does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007.|$|E
5|$|LeMond founded LeMond Composites in 2016 to {{manufacture}} <b>high-volume,</b> low-cost carbon fiber composites under a licensing {{agreement with the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory and an exclusive 20-year licensing agreement with Deakin University. LeMond and his family moved from Minnesota to Oak Ridge, Tennessee {{to be close to}} the $125 million LeMond Composites manufacturing facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{area has}} a number of <b>high-volume</b> road links to {{neighbouring}} Glasgow. The A77 main Glasgow to Kilmarnock road passes through the centre of the town and crosses the A727 from Paisley to East Kilbride at the Eastwood Toll. The nearest motorway is the M77, of which Junction 3 Darnley is the interchange for Giffnock.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a <b>high-volume,</b> year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, {{which is not the}} case for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|Railroads {{reached their}} {{maturity}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the industrialized countries of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in <b>high-volume</b> situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to <b>high-volume</b> production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a <b>high-volume</b> modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Coventry Street {{has been}} a centre for <b>high-volume</b> food outlets. The first J. Lyons and Co. Corner House was built on Coventry Street in 1907, on the west corner with Rupert Street. It {{was one of the}} first {{buildings}} in London to have a white-glazed terracotta exterior. In 1920, the former premises of Lamberts at Nos.10–12 were demolished in order to accommodate an extension that could accommodate up to 3,000 diners. Scott's Restaurant first operated in Coventry Street. Originally opening as an oyster warehouse in 1872 at No.18 as part of the London Pavilion, it moved to No.19 in 1891, expanding as a full restaurant. The restaurant moved to Mount Street in Mayfair in 1967. In 1887, the Leicester, a public house, opened at the corner of Coventry Street and Wardour Street. It closed in 1927 so the neighbouring department store could expand.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a <b>high-volume</b> shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a <b>high-volume</b> producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of this}} portion, {{the road}} is divided, with a tree-lined median strip. Businesses, both local and national, line {{both sides of the}} road and traffic is heavy. It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route62 or US62), a major {{contributor}} to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of the Boulevard Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and <b>high-volume.</b> There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has seen some rapid growth in the last few years.|$|E
25|$|<b>High-volume</b> {{lithography}} is used presently {{to produce}} posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it.

25|$|Kenneth Dixon was {{appointed}} {{as chairman and}} chief executive in 1981. Between 1981 and 1987, Rowntree invested nearly £400million in upgrading its manufacturing facilities and developing <b>high-volume,</b> product-dedicated equipment for several of the company's leading global brands, including Kit Kat, After Eights, and Smarties.|$|E
25|$|Wax tablets {{were used}} for <b>high-volume</b> {{business}} records of transient importance until the 19th century. For instance, the salt mining authority at Schwäbisch Hall employed wax records until 1812. The fish market in Rouen used them even until the 1860s, where their construction and use had been well documented in 1849.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Amazon.com {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York due to the <b>high-volume</b> and inability to deliver timely, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, UPS {{became the}} first small-package carrier to offer {{customers}} the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to <b>high-volume</b> shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.|$|E
25|$|A four-slide, {{also known}} as a multislide, multi-slide, or four-way, is a {{metalworking}} machine tool used in the <b>high-volume</b> manufacture of small stamped components from bar or wire stock. The press is most simply described as a horizontal stamping press that uses cams to control tools. The machine is used for progressive or transfer stamping operations.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, workers {{construct}} a snow berm {{to a depth}} of several feet along the perimeter of the soon-to-be ice pier. <b>High-volume</b> pumps then flood the pack ice with seawater {{to a depth of}} about 10cm (4in). The seawater typically freezes solid within 24 hours. Personnel repeat the flooding until they achieve a thickness of 1.5m (5ft).|$|E
25|$|The AMC Rebel (known as the Rambler Rebel in 1967) is a {{mid-size}} car {{produced by}} American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1967 to 1970. It replaced the Rambler Classic. The Rebel {{was replaced by}} the similar AMC Matador for the 1971 model year. The Rebel was positioned as the <b>high-volume</b> seller in the independent automaker's line of models.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications to HIFU for {{prostate}} cancer include a prostate volume larger than 40grams, which can prevent targeted HIFU waves from reaching the anterior and anterobasal regions of the prostate, anatomic or pathologic conditions that may interfere with the introduction or displacement of the HIFU probe into the rectum, and <b>high-volume</b> calcification within the prostate, {{which can lead to}} HIFU scattering and transmission impairment.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{aircraft}} research was redirected to more conventionally fueled designs {{and resulted in}} the successful SR-71. By advancing {{the state of the}} art in LH2 propulsion, and by establishing an industrial infrastructure for <b>high-volume</b> hydrogen production, the groundwork was laid for successful use of liquid hydrogen as a Liquid rocket propellant for the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} <b>high-volume</b> {{surgical}} {{center with}} a total of 66 operating rooms. The construction of the $523 million Children and Women's Hospital and the $132 million Eye Center expansion added 18 operating rooms to the health system for a total of 82 operating rooms. Outpatient care is provided at the main medical campus in Ann Arbor and at numerous satellite locations.|$|E
25|$|The June 28, 2015 {{failure of}} Falcon 9 Flight 19 meant a delay {{of at least}} six months on the Falcon 9 launches. On February 3, 2016, Lockheed Martin {{announced}} that it had been awarded an order for JCSAT-17 for delivery in 2019. Because of its configurable S band payload, it would be able to redirect capacity to concentrate on disaster relief efforts or other <b>high-volume</b> events.|$|E
25|$|Lambretta {{introduced}} the first <b>high-volume</b> production {{use of a}} single, floating, front disc brake, enclosed in a ventilated cast alloy hub and actuated by cable, on the 1962 TV175, followed by the range-topping GT200 in 1964. The 1969 Honda CB750 introduced hydraulic disc brakes {{on a large scale}} to the wide motorcycle public, following the lesser known 1965 MV Agusta 600, which had cable-operated mechanical actuation.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{manufacturing}} polyurethane finished goods range from small, hand pour piece-part operations to large, <b>high-volume</b> bunstock and boardstock production lines. Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, {{wait until it}} cures, then demold the finished part.|$|E
25|$|As a {{printing}} technology, lithography {{is different from}} intaglio printing (gravure), wherein a plate is either engraved, etched, or stippled to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and woodblock printing or letterpress printing, wherein ink {{is applied to the}} raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of <b>high-volume</b> books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with offset lithography, which has become {{the most common form of}} printing technology since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, RMI {{took this}} process {{a step further}} by {{launching}} a for-profit venture, Hypercar Inc. This independent company, in which RMI has a minority interest, is now taking the lead in advancing key areas of Hypercar research and development. In 2004, Hypercar Inc. {{changed its name to}} Fiberforge to better reflect the company's new goal of lowering the cost of <b>high-volume</b> advanced-composite structures by leveraging the patents of David F. Taggart, {{one of the founders of}} Hypercar, Inc.|$|E
25|$|Several polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are useful}} flame retardants. Of penta-, octa-, and decaBDE, {{the three most}} common PBDEs, only decaBDE is still in widespread use since its ban in the European Union in 2003. DecaBDE, also known as decabromodiphenyl oxide, is a <b>high-volume</b> industrial chemical with over 450,000 kilograms produced annually in the United States. Decabromodiphenyl oxide is sold under the trade name Saytex 102 as a flame retardant {{in the manufacture of}} paints and reinforced plastics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there have been}} {{successful}} attempts to develop automated, computer image analysis systems for screening. Although, on the available evidence automated cervical screening could not be recommended for implementation into a national screening program, a recent NHS Health technology appraisal concluded that the 'general case for automated image analysis ha(d) probably been made'. Automation may improve sensitivity and reduce unsatisfactory specimens. Two systems have {{been approved by the}} FDA and function in <b>high-volume</b> reference laboratories, with human oversight.|$|E
