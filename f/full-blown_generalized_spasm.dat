40|$|Coronary artery spasm {{is common}} during {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention and is easily relieved by intracoronary administration of vasodilators. We report {{the case of}} a patient who had severe, protracted, <b>generalized</b> <b>spasm</b> of the entire left coronary artery system during coronary artery stenting. The spasm, which was unresponsive to intracoronary vasodilators administered via guiding catheter, resulted in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Local injection of nitroglycerin via a transit catheter in the coronary artery eventually resolved the spasm and reversed the cardiogenic shock. To our knowledge, this is the 1 st report of such a case in the English-language medical literature...|$|R

40|$|Infantile spasms {{constitute}} both {{a distinctive}} seizure type and an age-specific epilepsy syndrome {{that have been}} extensively described for over a century. Stan-dardization of the classification of infantile spasms has evolved, culminating in recent recommendations for separately recognizing and distinguishing the seizure type (spasms or epileptic spasms) and the epilepsy syndrome of infantile spasms (West syndrome). More-detailed descriptions of the clinical and electrographic features of epileptic spasms and hypsarrhythmia have emerged. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have revealed clues about pathophysiology and increased the etiologic yield of the diagnostic evaluation of pa-tients with infantile spasms. Adrenocorticotrophic hor-mone remains the treatment of choice for many neu-rologists. Recent controlled studies support vigabatrin as first-line therapy, and open-label studies suggest that topiramate, lamotrigine, and zonisamide {{may be useful in}} treating spasms. Recent reports of visual-field constriction with vigabatrin may limit its use. Surgical treatment has been used successfully in a select sub-group of patients with secondarily <b>generalized</b> <b>spasms</b> from a single epileptogenic zone. Although the progno-sis for most patients with infantile spasms remains poor, further studies identifying predictors of favor-able prognosis and recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of infantile spasms offer hope of safer and more-effective therapies that improve long...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The diagonals {{of regular}} n-gons for odd n are shown to form {{algebraic}} fields with the diagonals {{serving as the}} basis vectors. The diagonals are determined as the ratio of successive terms of generalized Fibonacci sequences. The sequences are determined {{from a family of}} triangular matrices with elements either 0 or 1. The eigenvalues of these matrices are ratios of the diagonals of the n-gons, and the matrices are part of a larger family of matrices that form periodic trajectories when operated on by a matrix form of the Mandelbrot operator at a point of <b>full-blown</b> chaos. <b>Generalized</b> Mandelbrot matrix operators related to Lucas polynomials have similar periodic properties. 1...|$|R
40|$|Botulism and tetanus are {{diseases}} {{caused by}} neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, respectively. The bacteria and the toxins they produce are closely related. Both diseases are {{rare in the}} UK and the developed world, but tetanus, in particular, is {{a major cause of}} death in the developing world, causing between 100, 000 and 200, 000 deaths each year. In botulism a descending flaccid paralysis occurs, whereas in tetanus <b>generalized</b> muscle <b>spasms</b> develop. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction can occur in either disease, and in tetanus cardiovascular parameters can fluctuate widely. Early involvement of respiratory muscles means that rapid recognition and prompt institution of supportive measures are important in improving survival...|$|R
25|$|The {{tetanus toxin}} {{initially}} binds to peripheral nerve terminals. It is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions {{until it reaches}} the central nervous system. There it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory motor nerve endings, and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis. The effect of the toxin is to block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) across the synaptic cleft, which is required to check the nervous impulse. If nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms, the <b>generalized</b> muscular <b>spasms</b> characteristic of tetanus are produced. The toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, synaptobrevinII, and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.|$|R
40|$|The major form of {{familial}} hyperekplexia, a rare {{autosomal dominant}} disorder, {{is characterized by}} an abnormal startle reaction elicited by auditory and somatosensory stimuli, with transitory stiffness during the neontam period, followed later by falling attacks accompanied by momentary generalized muscular stiffness. Affected neonates occasionally have fatal hypertonia. The minor form is characterized only by an inconstant excessive startle response. We encountered a family in which three females presented with a partial or complete major form of the disease. All our patients were hyperreflexic, insecure gait was present in two subjects, without concomitant spontaneous nocturnal myoclonus. The pathophysiological basis of the hyperekplexia remains unclear. The abnormal startle reflex, probably related {{to the lack of}} inhibition by higher centers, is relayed in the caudal brainstem (ponto-medullary reticular formation), where bulbospinal motor efferents originate. Moreover, nonspecific changes such as large somatosensory evoked potentials and long-loop reflexes ("C-responses") may indicate increased cortical neuronal excitability. Polygraphic studies in these patients were normal. The locus of the major form of the disorder is located on chromosome 5 q 33 -q 35. Sequence analysis of the alpha 1 subunit of the inhibitory glycine receptor (GLRA 1) revealed a mutation at the same codon 271 in several families (G 1192 A and G 1192 T). We analyzed this gene and found a G 1192 A mutation changing an ARG to a LEU codon in all three presented patients. Sporadic cases may represent new mutations or lack of penetrance in some family members. Only one of our three patients needed clonazepam. The diagnosis of this disorder rules out epilepsy, or psychogenic pathological startle reaction. Electrophysiological criteria are useful, however perinatal hypertonia or a tonic <b>generalized</b> <b>spasm</b> accompanied with falls following an abnormal startle reaction and genetic studies remain the diagnostic milestones of familial hyperekplexia...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Hyperekplexia (HPX) was first described in 1958 by Kirstein and Silverskoild [1] who reported a family with emotionally precipitated drop seizures. It is a rare non-epileptic disorder characterized by generalized stiffness immediately after birth which normalizes during the first two to three years of age [2], exaggerated persistent star-tle reaction to unexpected auditory, somatosensory and visual stimuli, and non-habituating <b>generalized</b> flexor <b>spasm</b> in response to tapping of the nasal bridge (glabel-lar tap) which is the clinical hallmark of HPX [3, 4]. Minimum stimuli may provoke severe jerky movements of all limbs, but the course of the disease is usually be-nign with spontaneous amelioration with increasing age [2]. The exaggerated startle response however, persists to adulthood leading to unprotected falls without loss o...|$|R
50|$|After injection, inhalation, or ingestion, {{the first}} {{symptoms}} to appear are <b>generalized</b> muscle <b>spasms.</b> They appear very quickly after inhalation or injection — within {{as few as}} five minutes — and take somewhat longer to manifest after ingestion, typically approximately 15 minutes. With a very high dose, the onset of respiratory failure and brain death can occur in 15 to 30 minutes. If a lower dose is ingested, other symptoms begin to develop, including seizures, cramping, stiffness, hypervigilance, and agitation. Seizures caused by strychnine poisoning can start as early as 15 minutes after exposure and last 12 - 24 hours. They are often triggered by sights, sounds, or touch and can cause other adverse symptoms, including hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuric kidney failure, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory acidosis. During seizures, mydriasis (abnormal dilation), exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyes), and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) may occur.|$|R

Clinical findings included <b>generalized</b> exercise-induced muscle <b>spasms</b> with normal response to muscle percussion. Electromyography showed no myotonic discharges, thus ruling out myotonia. Whereas histological examination of muscle tissue was unremarkable, Ca(2 +) -ATPase activity of sarcoplasmatic reticulum membranes (SERCA 1) was markedly decreased compared to control animals. Mutation analysis revealed {{the presence of}} a missense mutation in the ATP 2 A 1 gene encoding the SERCA 1 protein (p. Arg 559 Cys). The present case presents similarities to human Brody's disease, but also to pseudomyotonia and congenital muscular dystonia previously described in different cattle breeds...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{reported}} responses of myotonic patients to depolarizing relaxants reveals the variable incidence and extent of induced myotonia. Generalized myotonia due to suxamethonium is described in a patient with myotonia congenita and, from subsequent investigations during a second operation, {{the action of the}} drug is clarified. Such a myotonic response is attributed to fasciculation, and a normal depolarizing block was demonstrated with continued administration of the drug. Suggestions are made for the anaesthetic management of such patients. Among the less common diseases which may lead to an altered or dangerous response to anaesthesia are three hereditary muscle disorders comprising the myotonic syndrome. Kaufman in 1960 des-cribed the anaesthetic hazards involved, and in-cluded in his account an instance of generalized myotonia due to decamethonium. Subsequently, Paterson (1962) described a case of generalized myotonia caused by suxamethonium. In each of these patients {{it was not possible to}} inflate the lungs during the myotonic spasm. It is the purpose of this paper to describe another instance of <b>generalized</b> myotonic <b>spasm</b> caused by suxamethonium, and to offer from further observations a possible explanation of the mechanisms involved...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} in {{clinical}} tetanus for a simple prognostic classification for all pa-tients at time of admission to the hospital. Data from three randomized clinical trials performed in India in the 1960 s, which contained information on several prog-nostic variables for 1, 385 patients, {{have been used to}} study different methods of prog-nosis. A logistic regression performed on the combined data from the trials suggested that the probability of death is related separately to the period of onset (the time from the first symptom to <b>generalized</b> reflex <b>spasms),</b> to the time from first symp-tom to admission to the hospital, and to the clinical assessment of severity of tetanus on admission; the effects of these variables have been studied by tabulation. A new system is proposed for assigning patients to three prognostic groups, defined by time from first symptom to admission and whether or not reflex spasms were present on admission to the hospital. The range of fatality rates is 10 %- 63 %. Neonates are assigned to a separate group with a fatality rate of 72 %. Other prognostic groupings are also explored in case it is felt that the above method relies too heavily on local arrangements for medical care...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of stress-induced cardiomyopathy (takotsubo syndrome) {{have not been}} fully determined. A clinical case {{of the development of}} stressinduced cardio-myopathy in a patient with microvascular angina is presented. A 73 -year-old woman was hospitalized to the cardiology clinic with a diagnosis of acute circular myocardial infarction (elevation ST II, III, aVF, V 2 - 6, positive troponin test). According to coronary angiography stenosis of coronary arteries were not identified. According to echocardiography the following abnormalities were revealed: decrease in global contractility of the myocardium, hyperkinesia of the basal parts of the left ventricle {{and at the same time}} akinesia of the apex and hypokinesia of the middle segments of the left ventricle. After 1 month a contractility of the myocardium was normal, there were no zones of violation of contractility. It was suggested that the patient had takotsubo syndrome. Anginal pain due to physical and emotional stress with unchanged coronary arteries suggested primary microvascular angina. It was confirmed by the presence of endothelium-dependent vasodilation disorders that were revealed by positron emission tomography of myocardium with cold pressor test and peripheral arterial tonometry. This clinical case demonstrates one of the discussed pathogenetic {{mechanisms of}} the takotsubo syndrome – <b>generalized</b> microvascular <b>spasm.</b> As the patient suffered previously from chronic microvascular angina, it seems logical in this case to regard stress-induced cardiomyopathy as an acute form of microvascular angina...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hyperekplexia (HPX) {{is a rare}} non-epileptic {{disorder}} manifesting {{immediately after}} birth with exaggerated persistent startle reaction to unexpected auditory, somatosensory and visual stimuli, and non-habituating <b>generalized</b> flexor <b>spasm</b> in response to tapping of the nasal bridge (glabellar tap) which forms its clinical hallmark. The course of the disease is usually benign with spontaneous amelioration with age. The disorder results from aberrant glycinergic neurotransmission, and several mutations were reported in the genes encoding glycine receptor (GlyR) α 1 and β subunits, glycine transporter GlyT 2 {{as well as two}} other proteins involved in glycinergic neurotransmission gephyrin and collybistin. Methods The phenotype of six newborns, belonging to Saudi Arabian kindred with close consanguineous marriages, who presented with hyperekplexia associated with severe brain malformation, is described. DNA samples were available from two patients, and homozygosity scan to determine overlap with known hyperkplexia genes was performed. Results The kindred consisted of two brothers married to their cousin sisters, each with three affected children who presented antenatally with excessive fetal movements. Postnatally, they were found to have microcephaly, severe hyperekplexia and gross brain malformation characterized by severe simplified gyral pattern and cerebellar underdevelopment. The EEG was normal and they responded to clonazepam. All of the six patients died within six weeks. Laboratory investigations, including metabolic screen, were unremarkable. None of the known hyperkplexia genes were present within the overlapping regions of homozygosity between the two patients for whom DNA samples were available. Conclusions We present these cases as a novel syndrome of lethal familial autosomal recessive hyperekplexia associated with microcephaly and severe brain malformation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Tetanus rarely {{occurs in}} {{developed}} countries, {{but it can}} result in fatal complications including respiratory failure due to <b>generalized</b> muscle <b>spasms.</b> Magnesium infusion {{has been used to}} treat spasticity in tetanus, and its effectiveness is supported by several case reports and a recent randomized controlled trial. Case presentations Three Caucasian Greek men aged 30, 50 and 77 years old were diagnosed with tetanus and admitted to a general 12 -bed intensive care unit in 2006 and 2007 for respiratory failure due to generalized spasticity. Intensive care unit treatment included antibiotics, hydration, enteral nutrition, early tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. Intravenous magnesium therapy controlled spasticity without the need for additional muscle relaxants. Their medications were continued for up to 26 days, and adjusted as needed to control spasticity. Plasma magnesium levels, which were measured twice a day, remained in the 3 to 4. 5 mmol/L range. We did not observe hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias or other complications related to magnesium therapy in these patients. All patients improved, came off mechanical ventilation, and were discharged from the intensive care unit in a stable condition. Conclusion In comparison with previous reports, our case series contributes the following meaningful additional information: intravenous magnesium therapy was used on patients already requiring mechanical ventilation and remained effective for up to 26 days (significantly longer than in previous reports) without significant toxicity in two patients. The overall outcome was good in all our patients. However, the optimal dose, optimal duration and maximum safe duration of intravenous magnesium therapy are unknown. Therefore, until more data on the safety and efficacy of magnesium therapy are available, its use should be limited to carefully selected tetanus cases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many {{plant species}} show {{potential}} as alternatives to synthetic pesticides but {{little is known}} about their acute mammalian toxicity. The single-dose acute oral toxicities of crude aqueous extracts of Strychnos spinosa and Bobgunnia madagascariensis fruits and the foliage of Vernonia amygdalina and Cissus quadrangularis (plant species that are commonly used as pesticides in Southern Africa) were evaluated in BALB/c mice. Plant extracts (up to 75 % w/v or v/v) were orally administered to sexually mature mice. Behavioural changes, clinical signs and mortality were monitored for 4 days. Mice that received S. spinosa had <b>generalized</b> tonic muscle <b>spasms</b> and a high mortality of 83 %. Those that received B. madagascariensis exhibited signs of buccal and nasal irritation with occasional sneezes during administration and a high mortality of 75 % was recorded. C. quadrangularis consumption resulted in much lower mortality of 21 % while no clinical signs of toxicity were evident on mice administered V. amygdalina. Chemical analysis showed the presence of secoiridoids in the seedless pulp of S. spinosa. These results indicate that aqueous extracts of S. spinosa and B. madagascariensis fruits and foliage of C. quadrangularis may have deleterious health implications on humans and animals; hence, advice o...|$|R
