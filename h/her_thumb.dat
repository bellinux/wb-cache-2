5|$|Harris {{signed with}} the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to play for head coach Anson Dorrance. Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught her right hand as she was warming up and shattered <b>her</b> <b>thumb.</b> After a surgery that inserted three pins in <b>her</b> <b>thumb,</b> she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept her out for the entire 2005 season. Despite being hurt, Harris still made the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E

50|$|When all {{the baby}} animals grow, {{they learn to}} fly. When Stellaluna and the birds are out playing, it gets dark and the birds go home without her because {{they will not be}} able to see in the dark. Stellaluna keeps flying, but when Stellaluna's wings hurt, she stops to rest. When she does, she hangs by <b>her</b> <b>thumbs.</b> Soon another bat comes to ask why Stellaluna is hanging by <b>her</b> <b>thumbs.</b> She tells the bat the story of what had {{happened}} after she and her mother were attacked by the owl. Another bat interrupts the story. That bat is Stellaluna's mother. Stellaluna and her mother are happily reunited and Stellaluna finally understands why she is so different.|$|R

England were forced into a late change for the tournament during this series, when Susie Rowe fractured <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> and was replaced by the uncapped Amy Jones. England were grouped with Australia, India and Pakistan in Group A, following their group stage exit in the previous World Twenty20.|$|E
25|$|After {{making her}} {{international}} debut against New Zealand in 2004, she suffered an injury which kept {{her out of}} the international side for several years. She earned a recall to the national side just before the 2007–08 Ashes series, when first choice wicket-keeper Jodie Fields (then Jodie Purves) broke <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> in a club match. However, Coleman retired from international cricket following the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, after Fields was preferred as wicket-keeper throughout the tournament. Coleman is the 99th woman to play One Day International cricket for Australia.|$|E

40|$|A 13 -year-old girl sought medical advice, {{saying that}} {{for two years}} it had been {{increasingly}} {{difficult for her to}} extend her little finger. An examination revealed that all her fingers, with the exception of <b>her</b> <b>thumbs,</b> had no interphalangeal fold. Her mother had less pronounced signs of the same type. This abnormality seemed {{to be the result of}} an autosomal gene with dominant transmission...|$|R
25|$|Thumb was not {{appearing}} in New York City when Lavinia was hired, but {{he met her}} when he visited the Museum {{in the autumn of}} 1862. He told Barnum the same day that he {{had fallen in love with}} <b>her.</b> <b>Thumb</b> wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that the little man was rich.|$|E
500|$|Type 1 is [...] "partial or {{total removal}} of the {{clitoris}} and/or the prepuce". Type Ia (circumcision) involves {{removal of the}} clitoral hood only. This is rarely performed alone. The more common procedure is Type Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood. The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> and index finger and cuts it off.|$|E
500|$|The firefight {{included}} large-scale {{troop movements}} and the simulated destruction of major bridges [...] coal dust and dynamite {{were used to}} create explosions. Nine troop formations held three positions each during the tightly scripted invasion sequence; they were directed via telephone (one line per formation) and flash-lamp signals from the headquarters established at the Chamber of Commerce building. The defensive pattern employed {{was similar to that}} used during the First World War in Paris to conduct soldiers to the front. Light tanks were stationed at road and rail junctions as fighting intensified. Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired blanks at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8:00am. Dressing stations were set up at strategic points to treat the mock casualties; they also treated the two real casualties of the event – a soldier who sprained his ankle, and a woman who cut <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> preparing toast during the early-morning blackout.|$|E
60|$|When she exerted the {{pressure}} {{she cried out}} with pain, for she had succeeded only in hurting herself. Billy grinned at her futility. She dug <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> into his neck in imitation of the Japanese death touch, then gazed ruefully at the bent ends of her nails. She punched him smartly {{on the point of}} the chin, and again cried out, this time to the bruise of her knuckles.|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} reaction {{that occurs when}} plaster is mixed with water is exothermic. When plaster sets, it can reach temperatures of more than 60 °C and, in large volumes, can burn the skin. In January 2007, a secondary school student in Lincolnshire, England sustained third-degree burns after encasing her hands in a bucket of plaster {{as part of a}} school art project. The burns were so severe she required amputation of both <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> and six of her fingers.|$|R
5000|$|A DC {{induction}} motor {{located at the}} end of each arm rotates the gondolas; three more on the middle lifting structure rotate the entire assembly and move the tower. To start the ride, most Condors require three buttons be hit at the same time to start the cycle. (The operator in the booth uses his or <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> on the two buttons located on the panel, while an attendant in a location around the perimeter must be holding that one as well.) ...|$|R
500|$|Simultaneously, Baker {{was cast}} as the title {{character}} in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll (1956), a role initially intended for Marilyn Monroe. Tennessee Williams, who had written and developed the screenplay based on two of his one-act plays, wanted Baker to play the part after seeing her perform a scene from his script at the Actors Studio; likewise, Kazan had been impressed by her performance in All Summer Long on Broadway the year prior. Shot in Benoit, Mississippi, directly after Baker had completed Giant, {{her role in the}} film as a sexually repressed teenaged bride to a failed middle-aged cotton gin owner brought Baker overnight fame and a level of notoriety even before the film's release. In the fall of 1956, artist Robert Everheart, under contract with Warner Bros., constructed a [...] billboard in Times Square promoting the film, depicting the now-iconic image of a scantily clad Baker lying in a crib sucking <b>her</b> <b>thumb.</b> The controversial advertising campaign for the film caused a pre-emptive backlash from religious groups, and on December 16, 1956, Cardinal Francis Spellman of St. Patrick's Cathedral denounced the film and advised his parish against seeing it. A formal condemnation by the Roman Catholic National Legion of Decency ensued, which considered it [...] "grievously offensive to Christian and traditional standards of morality and decency." ...|$|E
500|$|The breed {{has four}} {{recognized}} colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background {{are known as}} Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot {{in the middle of}} the forehead: this is called the [...] "Blenheim" [...] spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the [...] "Duchess Thumb Print", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with <b>her</b> <b>thumb,</b> resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won. Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as [...] "King Charles" [...] in the King Charles Spaniel. Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over, although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules. The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, [...] on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail. This colour is referred to as [...] "Prince Charles" [...] in the King Charles Spaniel.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from <b>her</b> <b>thumb,</b> the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Vann {{fought a}} notable duel with his {{brother-in-law}} John Falling, with both armed with muskets and on horseback (Falling died). Vann was generous with his money {{to those in}} need, but ruthless to those who crossed him. He ordered a slave Isaac, caught stealing, to be burned alive. In the same incident, Vann had a teenaged girl slave hung by <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> to tell about the theft; the Moravian missionaries rescued her and tried to dissuade him from the murder of Isaac.|$|R

500|$|Noah binds and gags Vicky {{with duct}} tape and uses an audio {{recording}} of her voice to lure Claire to her house. When Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky's dead body, with her throat having been slashed by Noah. A horrified Claire contacts the police, but runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and he says his mother wasn't {{the woman in the}} crash. [...] His mother killed herself after his father cheated on her, so he caused the accident which killed his father and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him. A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them. Noah pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. Garrett, having freed himself, attempts to choke Noah with a rope, prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest. Claire stabs Noah's eye with Kevin's EpiPen. When Noah removes the EpiPen from his eye and blindly attempts to strangle Claire to death, she then jams <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> into the same damaged eye to blind him further, much to Noah's agony and he strikes her across the face. When he later holds Kevin at gunpoint, she pulls a switch that drops an engine on Noah, killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as the police arrive. Garrett is put in an ambulance. A paramedic says that Garrett will be fine. Claire and Kevin ride in the ambulance with him and Claire tells Garrett that he's gonna be okay and promises him after he arrives at the hospital, [...] "we're going home.", hinting at a family reconciliation between Claire, Garrett and Kevin. As all three family members remain together in the ambulance, the ambulance then drives off into road to the hospital and the camera pans out to the moon hovering in the night sky.|$|E

SOC commonly affects major joints including the knee {{followed by the}} hip, elbow, and wrist. SOC cases in the hand are not reported as often as SOC of major joints. Particularly SOC of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is rare. We report on a 57 -year-old female with primary SOC of the carpometacarpal joint of <b>her</b> left <b>thumb.</b> Surgical excision was performed and the patient had no symptoms with full range of motion of <b>her</b> left <b>thumb.</b> At 3 years of follow-up, there was no recurrence...|$|R

50|$|This {{painting}} shows a postmortem {{portrait of}} a woman from the Horvath-Stansith family, K. Horvath-Stansith. She appears to be lying on a bed, but her body has been specially prepared and she is lying not on a bed, but a prepared catafalque laid with a Kilim carpet and special red damask cushion. Her fingers have already discoloured and thread is wrapped around <b>her</b> <b>thumbs.</b> Theoretically, the location is her local church {{and this is how}} she looked during the funeral service. She is wearing the costume of the former Hungarian region of Levoča and the closefitting cap she has on is probably not the headgear she wore when she was alive.|$|R
