25|$|Taxicab {{geometry}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the differences in <b>discrete</b> <b>frequency</b> distributions. For example, in RNA splicing positional distributions of hexamers, which plot the probability of each hexamer appearing at each given nucleotide near a splice site, can be compared with L1-distance. Each position distribution can be represented as a vector where each entry represents the likelihood of the hexamer starting at a certain nucleotide. A large L1-distance between the two vectors indicates {{a significant difference in the}} nature of the distributions while a small distance denotes similarly shaped distributions. This is equivalent to measuring the area between the two distribution curves because the area of each segment is the absolute difference between the two curves' likelihoods at that point. When summed together for all segments, it provides the same measure as L1-distance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Real-time systems face {{significant}} {{challenges in}} thermal management with their adoption of modern multicore processors. While earlier research on feedback thermal control has shown promise {{in dealing with}} the uncertainties in the thermal characteristics, multicore processors introduce new challenges that cannot be handled by previous solutions designed for single-core processors. Multicore processors require the temperatures and real-time performance of multiple cores to be controlled simultaneously, leading to multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) control problems with inter-core thermal coupling. Furthermore, current Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) mechanisms only support a finite set of states, leading to discrete control variables that cannot be handled by standard linear control techniques. This paper presents Real-Time Multicore Thermal Control (RT-MTC), the first feedback thermal control framework specifically designed for multicore real-time systems. RT-MTC dynamically enforces both the temperature and the CPU utilization bounds of a multicore processor through DVFS with <b>discrete</b> <b>frequencies.</b> RT-MTC employs a highly efficient controller that integrates saturation and proportional control components rigorously designed to enforce the desired core temperature and CPU utilization bounds. It handles <b>discrete</b> <b>frequencies</b> through a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) that achieves effective thermal control by manipulating the dwelling time of <b>discrete</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As a result RT-MTC can achieve effective thermal control with {{only a small number of}} frequencies typical in current processors. The robustness and advantages of RT-MTC over existing thermal control approaches are demonstrated through extensive simulations under a wide range of uncertainties in term of power consumption.
