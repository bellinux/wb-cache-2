40|$|AbstractContemporary {{increases}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration are {{in large part}} the result of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Scenario analysis is commonly used to generate projections of future carbon dioxide emissions, the resulting atmospheric concentrations and climate impact. In most scenario modelling published to date, carbon dioxide emission scenarios are based on demand-side (socioeconomic and technology) factors. The fossil fuel resource is assumed ample enough that supply-side factors do not drive future emission scenarios. This {{review of the literature}} on non-renewable resource extraction rate modelling and empirical studies of the global fossil fuel resource base suggests this assumption is unsafe. Supply-side factors can be expected to drive extraction rates and therefore carbon dioxide emissions as fossil fuel resources become significantly depleted. It is likely that the future carbon dioxide <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> will become dominated by supply-side factors during the 21 st century. By omitting this possibility, most scenario analysis is too narrow. An implication of such narrow scenario analysis is that policy driven by the UNFCCC‟s agreement to “avoid dangerous climate change” targets only demand-side factors to the exclusion of supply-side factors. As supply-side factors come to drive the carbon dioxide <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory,</b> policy focus should switch from demand-side factors to supply-side factors...|$|E

40|$|Global {{energy sector}} carbon dioxide {{emissions}} between 2007 and 2010 have been growing much faster than projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IEA 2011). Roughly 75 % of this growth {{can be attributed to}} developing countries that are increasingly manufacturing goods destined for consumption in the developed world (Peters et al. 2011). This study examines the energy sector carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> and <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> of 64 developing countries from 1980 to 2006. Approximately 50 % of these countries have relatively flat slopes when their emissions are plotted over time or against gross domestic product per capita. To shed some light on how this is possible, two competing theories of globalization are tested. World-systems theory argues that global economic integration is predicated on core-periphery exploitation, which leads to unsustainable development. World-society theory, on the other hand, contends that global social integration diffuses modern environmental values, which leads to structural isomorphism and sustainable development. World-society diffusion in this study is approximated by the network measure of degree centrality, which is calculated from shared ratifications of international environmental treaties. To find out if these opposing dynamics significantly impact <b>emissions</b> and <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> independently, or in conjunction, three different methods are used: Prais-Winsten panel regression with panel-corrected standard errors, cross-section ordinary least squares regression and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Findings from the panel regressions indicate that network centrality in global environmental treaty regimes has a significant, albeit weak, negative effect on {{carbon dioxide emissions}}. This effect is further attenuated by high levels of world-system exploitation, as measured by International Monetary Fund (IMF) credit. The first set of cross-section regressions indicate that network centrality has a significant, but weak, negative effect on <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted against GDP per capita when restricted to those countries that have low levels of IMF credit. The second set of cross-section regressions indicate that network centrality has a significant, but once again weak, negative effect on <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted over time when restricted to those countries that have low levels of foreign direct investment (FDI). The fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses reveal that world-society diffusion is only implicated in two out of five sufficient configurations for membership in the outcome set of countries with relatively flat <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted against GDP per capita. Furthermore, world-society diffusion, at least as approximated in terms of network centrality in international environmental treaty regimes, is not implicated in any of the sufficient configurations when the outcome involves membership in the set of countries with relatively flat <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted over time.

40|$|International audienceThe {{rate and}} {{manner in which}} {{transport}} infrastructure (e. g. roads, railway tracks, airports) is deployed, will {{play an important role}} in determining energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions and the economic impact of the transport sector. This paper describes an exercise where the costs of infrastructure deployment for the transport sector have been incorporated into the IMACLIM-R Global E 3 IAM. In addition to adding these costs, the modelling of the criteria for the deployment of infrastructure for roads has also been improved. It is found that this model recalibration results in a more accurate baseline as compared to historically observed data (2001 – 2013) for investments in energy demand, road infrastructure, and passenger kilometers travelled. Regarding macroeconomic effects, it is found that the imposition of a carbon <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> to 2100 cause GDP to decrease relative to the newly calibrated baseline – this is a standard IAM result. However, when the deployment of infrastructure for roads and air travel is further constrained, the GDP loss is less than with a fixed carbon <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> only. This is because early restriction of infrastructure for roads and air travel allows an expansion of public transport infrastructure which is adequate to meet low-carbon transport service demand whereas when less public transport infrastructure is available, more costly mitigation investments must be made in other parts of the economy. This suggests that restricting infrastructure deployment as a complementary policy to carbon pricing, lowers the cost of mitigatio...|$|E

Over the past few years, LBNL has established and significantly enhanced its China End-Use Energy Model which is based on the diffusion of end-use technologies and other physical drivers of energy demand. This model presents an important new approach for helping understand China's complex and dynamic drivers of energy consumption and implications of energy efficiency policies through scenario analysis. A baseline ('Continued Improvement Scenario') and an alternative energy efficiency scenario ('Accelerated Improvement Scenario') have been developed {{to assess the impact of}} actions already taken by the Chinese government as well as planned and potential actions, and to evaluate the potential for China to control energy demand growth and mitigate emissions. In addition, this analysis also evaluated China's long-term domestic energy supply in order to gauge the potential challenge China may face in meeting long-term demand for energy. It is a common belief that China's CO{sub 2 } emissions will continue to grow throughout this century and will dominate global emissions. The findings from this research suggest that this will not necessarily be the case because saturation in ownership of appliances, construction of residential and commercial floor area, roadways, railways, fertilizer use, and urbanization will peak around 2030 with slowing population growth.

40|$|Thesis Abstract: Chapter I: Regional {{burden sharing}} of GHG {{mitigation}} policies – A Canadian perspective. The {{distribution of the}} burden of cost arising from the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a contentious issue in policy discussions; more so among regional jurisdictions in the federalist countries with decentralized authorities over environmental regulations. In this setting, often the policy discussions are focused on the distribution of regional emission reduction targets that, in turn, entails negotiations over the distribution of the scarcity rents and the regional transfers of wealth. The allocation of regional emission entitlements is thus a key factor that could hinder the political feasibility of a national GHG mitigation policy. In this paper, we build a multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Canadian economy to assess the implications of different burden sharing rules governing the national GHG abatement policy with a cap-and-trade system of emission permits. In addition to assessing the impacts of traditional regional emissions allocation rules that involve intra-regional transfers of wealth, we consider a particular emission allocation that avoids such transfers, which may be a more palatable option given the context of likely fierce negotiations over the issue. Our results indicate to differing outcomes depending on the allocation policy in use. The CGE framework is also able to shed light on the transmission mechanisms that drive the results underlying the policy options. Chapter II: Endogenous technological change and emission allowances. Given the imminent threat of global warming due to GHG emissions, a number of emission mitigation policies have been proposed in the literature. However, they generally suffer from the classical equity-efficiency trade-off. High costs from equity concerns often render environmental policies politically unattractive and thus hard to implement. Recent advancement in the climate policy modeling literature that incorporates endogenous technological change (ETC) into the framework can potentially bring new insights into this debate. Using an inter-temporal, multi-sector CGE approach with ETC incorporated into the framework, this paper builds a model that focuses on the equity-efficiency debate for the policymakers. Canada is chosen as the country of investigation for this purpose. The paper provides a new welfare ranking of four permit allocation policies that address the equity-efficiency trade-off. In a second-best setting with pre-existing distortions, output-based allocation (OBA) of emission permits is compared to three other policy options: (i) an emissions trading system with grandfathered allocation (GFA), (ii) an auction permit trading system where permit revenue is recycled to lower payroll taxes (RPT), and (iii) a hybrid of OBA and R&D subsidy (O-R&D). We find that adapting OBA, as well as O-R&D, is welfare improving over GFA. The implicit output subsidy, entailed in the OBA policy, mitigates against the rising cost effect in the GFA policy. This is reinforced through added investment incentive in R&D when ETC in incorporated into the framework. With O-R&D, since the R&D subsidy corrects for market imperfections in the knowledge accumulation process, the effect is further bolstered, culminating into mitigation of uneven distributional outcome for energy-intensive industries as a whole. Contrary to previous results, we also find that, in terms of the welfare metric, OBA unequivocally improves the distributional outcome across sectors as compared to the RPT policy. Inclusion of ETC also unequivocally generates a higher welfare ranking for all permit policy schemes. Chapter III: Emission permit banking and induced technological change. This paper attempts to undertake an exploratory research by integrating two themes in the emission mitigation policy literature, which include: the inter-temporal emission permit banking and borrowing and the role of induced technological change in emission mitigation. Using a simple optimal control approach, we construct a unified framework that evaluates the optimal path of emissions and the optimal trajectory of permit price when both inter-temporal banking and borrowing of permits and the effects of induced technological change (ITC) are present. We find that ITC leads to a declining <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> over time. The effect of ITC on the optimal permit price path, however, is ambiguous and critically depends on the extent of marginal cost saving that emanates from emission-saving technological innovation...|$|E

40|$|Time-resolved photon {{counting}} {{technique was}} employed to study dynamics of photoluminescence from the ensemble and single CdSe/ZnS quantum dots with the alloyed core/shell interfaces. The ensemble data revealed enhanced effect of disorder-induced trap states for increasing emission energy, as implied from {{the changes in the}} distribution of total decay rates. The <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> collected for single quantum dots showed familiar, two-state blinking pattern. It suggests that in a large-band-offset CdSe/ZnS system, the introduced alloying of the core-to-shell region cannot smooth enough the confinement potential in order to suppress nonradiative Auger recombination and blinking.

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} 134 {{tree species}} {{from the eastern}} United States for potential response to several scenarios of climate change, and summarized those responses for nine northeastern United States. We modeled and mapped each species individually and show current and potential future distributions for two emission scenarios (A 1 fi [higher emission] and B 1 [lower emission]) and three climate models: the Parallel Climate, the Hadley CM 3, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in this region, especially under a high <b>emissions</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Results indicate that while species with potentially increasing areas of suitable habitat in the Northeastern US substantially outnumber those with decreasing areas of habitat, there are key species that show diminishing habitat area: balsam fir (Abies balsamea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), red spruce (Picea rubens), bigtooth and quaking aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. tremuloides), and black cherry (Prunus serotina). From these results we identified the top 10 losers and gainers for each US state in the region by scenario and <b>emissions</b> <b>trajectory.</b> By combining individual species importance maps and developing assembly rules for various classes, we created maps of potential forest types for the Northeast showing a general loss of the spruce–fir zone with advancing oak–hickory type. Further data, maps, and analysis can be found a...|$|R
40|$|Long-range global carbon {{emission}} forecasts span {{such a wide}} range as to yield little guidance for climate policy. We focus herein on global per capita emissions, which we show to be trendless around a stationary mean of 1. 14 tonnes. Gaussian and simulated confidence intervals imply that most emissions scenarios currently in use are unrealistically high. Embedding Hotelling resource price dynamics in a Ramsey growth model yields predictions that global per capita emissions will not trend upwards: instead convergence implies declining average emissions. We conclude that the lowest greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> {{are the most likely}} over the next 50 years...|$|R
