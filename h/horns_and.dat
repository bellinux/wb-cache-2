5|$|The large nasal <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> frills of Styracosaurus {{are among}} the most {{distinctive}} facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function {{has been the subject of}} debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown <b>horns,</b> <b>and</b> loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E
5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> two trumpets {{are added}} to the original scoring. When possible Fauré employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist, partly because the soprano lines, particularly the solo in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.|$|E
25|$|Brain {{often asked}} composers to write new works {{for him to}} perform. Many composers offered their {{services}} to Brain without even being asked. Among them were Benjamin Britten (Serenade for Tenor, <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> Strings, Canticle III), Malcolm Arnold (Horn Concerto No. 2), Paul Hindemith (Concerto for <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> Orchestra), York Bowen (Concerto for <b>Horn,</b> Strings <b>and</b> Timpani), Peter Racine Fricker (Horn Sonata), Gordon Jacob (Concerto for <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> String Orchestra), Mátyás Seiber (Notturno for <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> Strings), Humphrey Searle (Aubade for <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> Strings), Ernest Tomlinson (Rhapsody <b>and</b> Rondo for <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> Orchestra, Romance <b>and</b> Rondo for <b>Horn</b> <b>and</b> Orchestra), Lennox Berkeley (Trio for <b>Horn,</b> Violin <b>and</b> Piano) and Elisabeth Lutyens.|$|R

5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical {{relationships in the}} spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and <b>horns,</b> <b>and</b> stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they {{may also have been}} used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E

5000|$|Horn trio {{can mean}} a work written for three horns or horns {{as well as}} one for <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> two other instruments. In the latter category, an {{important}} genre is the trio for <b>horn,</b> violin <b>and</b> piano. Although there are a few earlier examples, the tradition of this scoring was inaugurated in 1865 by Johannes Brahms with his Trio in E-flat, opus 40. Related combinations are those of (1) oboe, <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> piano, (2) clarinet, <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> piano, (3) <b>horn,</b> bassoon, <b>and</b> piano <b>and</b> (4) flute, <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> piano.|$|R
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

In December 2013, he ranked number one on the Forbes 30 under 30 list. Mars is known for his stage performances and retro showmanship. He is accompanied by his band, The Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums and <b>horns,</b> <b>and</b> also serve as backup singers and dancers. Mars performs {{in a wide range of}} musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name refers {{to the fact that}} it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset is the result of a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> which bred true.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with the black wildebeest. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation, however it may occur when both species are confined within the same area, and the offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had congenital abnormalities relating to their teeth, <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> the Wormian bones of the skull. Another study reported {{an increase in the}} size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some hybrid animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The bluebuck rock {{paintings}} from the Caledon river valley {{have been attributed}} to Bushmen. They show six antelopes facing a man, and were supposedly inspired by shamanic trance; they may depict a Bushman visiting the spirit-world through a tunnel. The Bushmen possibly believed that the bluebuck had a supernatural potency, like other animals in their environment. The animals in the paintings are similar in proportion to the reedbuck, but the large ears, <b>horns,</b> <b>and</b> lack of a mane rule out species other than the bluebuck.|$|E

5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more <b>horns,</b> <b>and</b> in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest. Basset <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> {{the muscular}} neck {{may have been}} used in fighting conspecifics. According to separate studies, rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of Carnotaurus remain unclear: some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} frill use in sexual display was first {{proposed}} in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship {{or in other}} social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song.

5|$|Welsh Black cattle are the {{traditional}} breed of Wales. These hardy cows with <b>horns</b> <b>and</b> shaggy coats {{are able to}} thrive on poor quality pasture and moorland {{and can be used}} to provide both milk and beef. Large numbers were raised in Wales and herded on foot to be fattened in England for selling in English markets. On Welsh farms they were used to pull ploughs and sometimes wagons during the nineteenth century, and were the prized possessions by which a man's wealth could be estimated. Nowadays, many have been crossed with Charolais, Limousin or Hereford bulls but pure bred herds can still be found {{in many parts of the}} uplands.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{focuses on}} the formal structures and tonal language of four trios that include horn by American composer Simon A. Sargon: "Huntsman, What Quarry?" Two Poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay for Soprano, <b>Horn,</b> <b>and</b> Piano (1990); Trio for <b>Horn,</b> Violin, <b>and</b> Piano: "The Legacy" (1993); A Clear Midnight: Six Songs Set to Poems of Walt Whitman for Baritone, <b>Horn,</b> <b>and</b> Piano (1996); and Sonic Portals: Trio for Oboe, <b>Horn,</b> <b>and</b> Piano (2003). Comparisons with precedent works of like instrumentation demonstrate that Sargon's trios, though musically unique, merit a place alongside masterworks like Carl Reinecke's Trio, op. 188, for oboe, <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> piano; Franz Schubert's Auf dem Strom for soprano, <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> piano; and especially Johannes Brahms's Trio, op. 40, for violin, <b>horn,</b> <b>and</b> piano. Other precedent, contemporary, and related works are also mentioned. Sargon's ability to write idiomatically for the <b>horn</b> <b>and</b> other instruments is discussed, and consideration is given to some elements required to create a good performance of Sargon's chamber music. Included are a brief biography of Simon Sargon, letters from colleagues {{with whom he has}} worked closely, lists of his instrumental music and recordings of some of these pieces, and lists of other works in the genres discussed herein...|$|R
