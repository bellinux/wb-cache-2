40|$|Master in the Electric Power IndustryIn {{light of}} European {{electricity}} market liberalization this master‘s thesis addresses the envisaged grid interconnection – a high voltage subsea cable with 200 megawatt transmission capacity – {{between the two}} EU member states Malta and Italy. So far, Malta‘s electric power system has been isolated and therefore electricity supply in the small European island state has heavily relied on imported fossil fuels. Consequently, Malta‘s exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices inherently impedes to reliably predict electricity generation costs. This motivates to investigate whether and to what degree the vulnerability to distinct oil price scenarios can be overcome with the new interconnector {{that is expected to}} be operational as of 2014 / 2015. Generally, an isolated power system like in Malta implies peculiarities. This master paper thoroughly examines whether the <b>interconnection</b> <b>cable</b> to Sicily breaks up the Maltese market and potentially threatens the privileges of the incumbent utility Enemalta. It presents the drivers that have forced the small EU member state to radically revise its hitherto energy policy. Primarily our Malta-Sicily case study i.) discusses the cable‘s qualitative implications – in particular institutional challenges – and ii.) numerically determines potential consequences for Maltese electricity consumers. Our numerical sensitivity analysis defines the merit order for both Malta‘s isolated and the future generation setup differentiating between three distinct oil price scenarios. Based on the constructed marginal cost curves, we then simulate the interconnection case. Malta‘s quantity imports and the cable‘s total capacity utilization indicator are two key findings. Moreover, the algorithm enables to determine the average electricity spot price with interconnector and the computation of rents for both the supplier and cable owner. Our analysis demonstrates that the submarine interconnector does not inherently reduce the electricity price level for Maltese consumers. It thus renders whether and in which of the presented generation setups and distinct oil price scenarios Malta‘s interconnected power system benefits. The study concludes that the cable‘s impact significantly depends on the considered generation setup, the oil price scenario and the market design. In sum, this thesis simulates how the theoretical concept of market liberalization practically applies to the EU island‘s micro power system. Its added value originates from both a qualitative and quantitative analysis which shows that the cable‘s impact for Maltese end consumers is importantly co-determined by Enemalta‘s future positioning. Although the link will certainly promote the creation of a single European electricity market, this paper suggests to thoroughly rethink infras...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work has been to investigate the electric system stability, reliability and power security of an &# 147;off-grid&# 148; isolated network system integration of an offshore wind farm to offshore oil and gas platforms via HVAC transmission, considering different network topologies for wind power penetration, network losses, application of FACTS devices and different system voltage levels. The system stability studies were performed by steady state and dynamic simulations, analysing different perturbation events in the system. The power system model under study was established as a continuation of a previous work concerning a single platform system. The model {{can be seen to}} represent the Oseberg oilfield in the Norwegian Sea consisting of five offshore platforms. The complete model represents a grid integration of the five offshore platforms with a total load demand of 147 MW to an offshore wind farm of 100 MW production via HVAC as an isolated system. Wind farm capacity is less but of comparable size to the total load. Each platform has its own offshore power generation units (Gas Turbines - GTs) to cover the load demand at each platform. Load demands were selected based on recently collected real operational power consumption data from Statoil, ASA. In this study, 8 GTs were installed at different specific platforms to cope with the load of 150 MW. Three different network topology configurations were considered, denoted Star, Star-F and Meshed. Four types of perturbation/disturbance events were analysed: Starting of 9 MW asynchronous motor at Platform 4, loss of a GT at Platform 4, sudden loss of wind power production and loss of <b>interconnection</b> <b>cable</b> between Platform 1 and Plaform 4. The dynamic system stability was assessed by measuring frequency and voltage deviations at specific load buses to ensure whether transient deviations were following offshore NORSOK or IEC standards correctly or not. For each type of disturbances, different topology aspects were considered and analysed for different outages and different cases of percentage of wind power penetration. It could be seen that generators at platforms in all cases were able to regain synchronism by maintaining terminal voltage and power factor within allowed ranges after disturbances caused by Starting of 9 MW motor, loss of wind power, loss of a GT and loss of cable. This can be explained because the isolated network system has a strong spinning reserve capacity. But not all studied scenarios were dynamically stable, following NORSOK standards for transient of voltage and frequency variations. The results showed the importance of an integrated grid system: Starting of big induction motor was found not to give large frequency or voltage deviations compared to the previous study of a single platform system since the integrated system has a larger inertia. Voltage deviations were found most critical in case of starting big motors. In addition, a meshed topology have better performace with less voltage and frequency deviation compared to the other two topologies for all perterbation events and cases. The results also showed that loss of wind power was more critical at high wind power penetration levels. A 100 % sudden loss of wind power gave unacceptable frequency deviations. The study of two different voltage levels, 36 kV and 52 kV showed that a 52 kV network gave better dynamic stability behaviour compared to the other one. The study of FACTS devices applications showed that a STATCOM was more efficient in dynamic control of voltage than an SVC due to its better reactive power compensation capability at lower voltage, thus improving power transmission capability for the same power ratings. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{and analysis of}} low level vibrations and Acoustic Emissions in components, fabrications and structures, is often accomplished by the utilisation of multiple distributed piezoelectric sensors.

40|$|The in-vivo {{observation}} of the neural activities generated by {{a large number of}} closely located neurons is believed to be crucial for understanding the nervous system. Moreover, the functional electrical stimulation of the central nervous system is an effective method to restore physiological functions such as limb control, sound sensation, and light perception. The Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is being successfully used in the treatment of tremor and rigidity associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. Cochlear implants have also been employed as an effective treatment for sensorineural deafness by means of delivering the electrical stimulation directly to the auditory nerve. The most significant contribution of this PhD study is the development of next-generation microprobes for the simultaneous stimulation and recording of the cortex and deep brain structures. For intracortical applications, millimetre length multisite microprobes that are rigid enough to penetrate into the cortex while integrated with flexible <b>interconnection</b> <b>cables</b> are demanded. In chronic applications, the flexibility of the cable minimizes the tissue damage caused by the relative micro-motion between the brain and the microprobe. Although hybrid approaches have been reported to construct such neural microprobes, these devices are brittle and may impose severe complications if they break inside the tissue. In this project, MEMS fabrication processes were employed to produce non-breakable intracortical microprobes with an improved structural design. These 32 channel devices are integrated with flexible <b>interconnection</b> <b>cables</b> and provide enough mechanical strength for penetration into the tissue. Polyimide-based flexible implants were successfully fabricated and locally reinforced at the tip with embedded 15 µm-thick gold micro-needles. In DBS applications, centimetre long microprobes capable of stimulating and recording the neural activity are required. The currently available DBS probes, manufactured by Medtronic, provide only four cylindrical shaped electrode sites, each 1. 5 mm in height and 1. 27 mm in diameter. Although suitable for the stimulation of a large brain volume, to measure the activity of a single neuron but to avoid measuring the average response of adjacent cells, recording sites with dimensions in the range of 10 - 20 µm are required. In this work, novel Three Dimensional (3 D) multi channel microprobes were fabricated offering 32 independent stimulation and recording electrodes around the shaft of the implant. These microprobes can control the spatial distribution of the charge injected into the tissue to enhance the efficacy and minimize the adverse effects of the DBS treatment. Furthermore, the device volume has been reduced to one third the volume of a conventional Medtronic DBS lead to significantly decrease the tissue damage induced by implantation of the microprobe. For both DBS and intracortical microprobes, the impedance characteristics of the electrodes were studied in acidic and saline solutions. To reduce the channel impedance and enhance the signal to noise ratio, iridium (Ir) was electroplated on gold electrode sites. Stable electrical characteristics were demonstrated for the Ir and gold electrodes {{over the course of a}} prolonged pulse stress test for 100 million cycles. The functionality and application potential of the fabricated microprobes were confirmed by the in-vitro measurements of the neural activity in the mouse hippocampus. In order to reduce the number of channels and simplify the signal processing circuitry, multiport electrostatic-actuated switch matrices were successfully developed, fabricated, and characterized for possible integration with neural microprobes to construct a site selection matrix. Magnetic-actuated switches have been also investigated to improve the operation reliability of the MEMS switching devices...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{integrated}} circuits (ICs) are significant sources of undesired electromagnetic wave. Therefore, characterization of chip-level emission {{is essential to}} comply with EMC tests at the product level. A Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell is a common test instrument used to measure IC radiated emission and the test cost is relatively low. Regular IC radiated emission measurements using GTEM tend to neglect some significant emission sources. Thus, this research proposed an alternative methodology to perform field measurement of the IC inside the GTEM cell in order to optimize the field measurements. This research study also attempted analysis of the overall GTEM cell performance using transmission line theory. An FPGA chip was adopted as the IC under test because of its flexibility in configuration to any digital circuit. The investigations discovered {{that the impact of}} the FPGA board supporting components and <b>interconnection</b> <b>cables</b> can be significantly reduced with appropriate shielding and grounding. The electric field predict a far distance from the FPGA chip was carried out based on the dipole moment technique. In particular, the dipole moment model emphasizing the tiny horizontal and vertical radiation elements inside the FPGA chip as Hertzian antenna and small current loop. Equations to predict the horizontal and vertical electric field were developed based on Hertzian antenna and small current loop which relate the tiny radiation sources to electric and magnetic dipole moments. The prediction was validated with 3 -meter field measurements in a semi-anechoic chamber. On top of that, a spiral-like pattern was developed to obtain a correction factor for further improvement of the correlation between prediction and SAC measurement. The results revealed that the correction factor effectively reduced the gap between the prediction and measurement fields and boosted the correlation coefficient by 44 %. The difference of peak values also has limited to less than 10 dB after correction. These results suggest a promising finding for a future EMI test of ICs with a cheaper GTEM cell...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly focused on (i) {{modeling}} of dc distribution systems for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), (ii) proposing {{a method to}} enhance {{the stability of the}} dc distribution systems, and (iii) proposing an energy management strategy to control the power flow in the dc distribution system. The dc distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid. In the first part, a systematic method for developing a model for a dc distribution system, based on the configuration of the system is proposed. The developed model is of the matrix form and, therefore, can readily be expanded to represent a dc distribution system of any desired number of dc-dc converters. The model captures both the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the system, and includes the port capacitors of the converters, as well as the <b>interconnection</b> <b>cables.</b> Thus, it can be used for identifying the condition for the existence of a steady state, as well as for stability analysis. In the second part, the thesis proposes a method for enhancing the stability of the dc distribution system. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware. The thesis presents mathematical models for the original and modified systems and demonstrates that the proposed technique expands the stable operating region of the dc distribution system. The thesis further proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for the dc distribution system. Using an on-line constrained optimization algorithm, the proposed EMS offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: (1) The fast energy exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange time and (2) The optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues through selling their stored energy.
