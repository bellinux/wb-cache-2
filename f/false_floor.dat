25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a <b>false</b> <b>floor</b> to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E
500|$|Hartford, Connecticut gangster Robert [...] "Bobby the Cook" [...] Gentile {{has been}} {{suggested}} on multiple occasions as knowing {{the location of the}} Gardner works. In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a <b>false</b> <b>floor</b> {{with the help of his}} son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the black market. In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art. [...] In 2015, Gentile submitted to a lie detector test, denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful. According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works. Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago. On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.|$|E

50|$|From {{this period}} {{increased}} {{knowledge and understanding}} of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, coupled to the availability of plywood and reliable waterproof glues saw dramatic changes. Clinker and carvel construction was dropped and glued up hollow pear shaped masts became standard. By the late 1960s a greater understanding of the science behind planning saw hulls made with increasingly less rocker, very fine forward with very flat aft sections. Once trapezes were introduced the number of crew dropped to 4 by the early 70s and then to 3. Designs became wider, especially aft. As speeds increased so did capsizes, so an effort was made to install built in buoyancy and some self draining capabilities with transom flaps, venturi floor drains built in tanks, especially forward and <b>false</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R

40|$|Excessive floor {{vibration}} due {{to human}} activities is of growing concern {{due to the}} increase in use of lighter and high-strength materials for long span floors. This problem is exacerbated in office buildings due to the reduction in inherent damping associated with modern fit outs. Excessive floor vibratiom are often realised after the completion of construction or following a change of use of the floor. The main cause of uncertainty in design or vibration assessment of floors is damping. There are few optiom for rectifying floor with excessive vibrations. These include increasing stiffoess, which is often not practical or increasing damping. This paper presents an innovative passive viscoelastic damper to reduce floor vibratiom. This damper can be easily tuned to the fundamental frequency of the floor and can be designed to achieve various damping values. The damper can be sufficiently small to fit within ceiling cavities or under <b>false</b> <b>floors...</b>|$|R

The exterior was dilapidated and covered in a black coating.The architect Eugène Millet, a pupil of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, was given the job of restoring the château to hold the planned National Museum of Antiquities in 1855 and was told to remove all traces of the cells that the Ministry of War had installed when it {{was used as a}} prison. In 1857 he reported that all the partitions forming the cells and dungeons had been demolished {{and the rest of the}} chateau had been cleaned.Construction work began in 1862 with the destruction of the West pavilion. Millet's goal was to restore the building to its state as it was under Francis I of France.Eugène Millet died in Cannes on 24 February 1879.The restoration was continued by Auguste Lafollye and Honoré Daumet, and finally completed in 1907.|$|R

50|$|Yordas Cave is a solutional cave {{formed in}} Lower Carboniferous limestone. Yordas Beck {{normally}} sinks {{at the top}} of the gorge, and reappears from a passage near the top of Yordas Pot. From the base of the shaft it follows the passage down to the Chapter House waterfall, before disappearing in confined passages at the end of the Main Chamber. In flood conditions a lake can rise in the Main Chamber up to 2 m deep, before the water is able to flow out of the show cave entrance. The underground stream next appears in Kingsdale Master Cave, and it resurges at Keld Head 2.7 km down the valley. The Main Chamber is several hundred thousand years old, and was formed by solution under phreatic conditions before the Kingsdale valley had formed and allowed it to drain. The square profile of the chamber has resulted from rock collapses from joints. A number of different <b>false</b> <b>floors</b> which may still be seen clinging to the walls indicate that the cave was subject to cycles of deposition and re-excavation during the recent ice ages.|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{vibrations}} {{can occur in}} floor systems due to excitation from human activities such as walking and aerobics. In building floors, excessive vibrations are generally not a safety concern for building floor systems but a cause of annoyance and discomfort. Excessive vibrations typically occur in: (a) light weight floors; (b) floor systems with low stiffness where the floor dominant natural frequency {{is close to the}} excitation frequency; and (c) floors with low damping. While the floor mass and stiffness are normally constant during the life of the structure and can be estimated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, damping is more difficult to predict because it is mostly associated with non-structural components such as partitions, <b>false</b> <b>floors,</b> suspended ceilings and ducts as well as furniture such as filing cabinets and bookshelfs. Current trends in the building industry associated with using lightweight materials, long-span open-plan floors and adoption of the electronic office, give rise to the importance of understanding floor vibrations and specifically damping. This paper provides a summary of factors affecting floor vibrations and discusses available damping systems which can be used to reduce vibration levels in floor systems...|$|R

Dangerous spikes, <b>false</b> <b>floors</b> and ancient booby traps test the archaeologist's skills before he attempts to make a getaway with the golden idol. The stunt show then moves on to the busy and audience-participant filled streets of Cairo. Indy and Marion watch street acrobats before events take a turn for the worse and a massive fight scene breaks out. The Cairo street scene concludes with Indy shooting at a Jeep loaded with explosives, producing a fiery conclusion. The final scene of the stunt show recreates the action-packed sequence in which Indy and Marion try to stop the Nazis from flying the Ark to Berlin; the reenactment is complete with a scaled-down version of a German Luftwaffe aircraft with symbols imitating the swastika (actual swastikas were used in the show up until the 2000s). Indy fights a large German mechanic while Marion mans the aircraft's machine gun, blowing away everything in sight. Indy and Marion are able to make a narrow escape just as the airport is engulfed in flames.|$|R
