25|$|When {{an older}} {{individual}} is completing a task, such as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> or doing work, {{they are using}} their working memory to help them complete this task.

Additionally, working memory {{plays a role in}} the comprehension and production of speech. There is often a decline in sentence comprehension and sentence production as individuals age. Rather than linking this decline directly to deficits in linguistic ability, it is actually deficits in working memory that contribute to these decreasing language skills.|$|E
