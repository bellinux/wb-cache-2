40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to define 1 D shear wave {{velocity}} (Vs) models with depth for crustal structures in the Campanian Plain (southern Italy). This objective is achieved by the non linear inversion with Hedgehog method of Rayleigh wave dispersion data of fundamental mode extracted by FTAN multifilter technique from two station noise cross-correlation (NCF), combined with regional data. The Campanian Plain is a graben like structure mainly filled of Miocene-Pleistocene alluvial, terrigenous and marine sediments deposited on Mesozoic carbonate platform lying at depths greater than 3 km. It is bordered by quiescent volcanoes in the North (Roccamonfina) and in the South (Campi Flegrei and Vesuvio) and seat of past volcanic activity as testified by lava bodies detected in deep drillings. The definition of Vs models in such context {{is very important to}} detect high temperatures related to magmatic activities. Vs velocity reductions have been detected beneath Campi Flegrei and the bay of Napoli at ~ 10 km depth; at a depth of about ~ 5 km or at 8 - 10 km depth below Vesuvio; at 6 - 9 km beneath Roccamonfina; 10 - 15 km depth, beneath two paths crossing the Campanian Plain. Seismic noise measurements have been performed during the period April 2009 – April 2010, using Kinemetrics Q 330 broadband stations equipped with Episensor ES–T FBA (<b>Force</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>Accelerometer).</b> The stations have been set at the borders of the Campanian Plain and noise recordings have been also cross-correlated with those of the INGV-Osservatorio Vesuviano network (OV) at Campi Flegrei. The cross-correlation of a diffused field, recorded at a pair of receivers, is related to the Green function of the medium. According to many researches in the last years, this is true also for one side NCF, coming out from a preferential source-receivers distribution. A total of 19 NCF have been analysed but only 7 average dispersion curves of Rayleigh group velocities have been computed. One-side cross-correlations have resulted being the sea the source of the recorded noise. Stability analysis shows that the computed NCF change daily but preserve monthly, even after some year. Dispersion data from NCF are relative to higher periods than those from earthquake recordings and are in very good agreement at the same periods. Despite some path, only the vertical component of the cross-correlation function has given reliable results. The dispersion data extracted from the NCF and some earthquake signals with T ≥ 3 s, have been combined with regional group and phase dispersion data (7 - 10 s < T < 150 s) in the Hedgehog inversion, allowing to investigate a maximum depth of 73 km. The main features of the Vs models in {{the central part of the}} Campanian Plain are the top of Mesozoic carbonatic sequences at about 4 km and the presence of Vs velocity reductions at 15 km. Such low velocity layer rises to 6 - 8 km in the south-eastern part of the Plain, towards Vesuvio. The Vs reductions (about 10 %) can be explained with the presence of partially melted material, in agreement with the studies at Vesuvio and Campi Flegrei. Moreover, a sharp increase of Vs to 3. 85 km/s at about 8 - 9 km of depth, above the low velocity layer, resembles the models at Roccamonfina and Colli Albani of a cooling magma chamber. These results are in agreement with the noticeable thickness of lava found in deep drillings and can be considered as the seismic signature of a widespread volcanic activity in the Campanian Plain as hypothesized on the basis of volcanological and geochemical studies (Campanian Volcanic Zone) ...|$|E

The frequency range of the ac-celerometer is from DC to 200 Hz and has the ability to record shaking level as high as 2 g. The broadband velocity sensor is capable of measuring ground-motion up to 20 cm/sec with a bandwidth from 0.008 Hz to 70 Hz. All of the stations record signals continuously at 100 and 20 samples per second, respectively. Time synchronization is maintained in the main processor based on time received according to the NTP (network time protocol) through communication with an internet time server. The R- 1 rotational seismometer has a resolution of 1.2 × 10 − 7 rad/sec (eentec, 2007). The sensitivities of the velocity and acceleration sensors are 2.384 × 10 − 5 cm/sec/count (Hutt et al., 2008) and 2.337 × 10 − 4 cm/sec 2 /count (Kinemetrics, 2002), respectively.

The two embankment dams are 66, 56 meters high and 960, 1008 meters long respectively. One of the dams suffered from severe landslide because of the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake, the design PGA of this site is set to 0. 25 g. Because of the complexity, it is quite difficult to predict the dam earthquake response by numerical simulation, thus the recorded motion data will be very useful for the dam dynamic design and seismic safety assessment. In order to monitor the earthquake response of the two dams, two unique sets of new type earthquake monitoring system are developed and installed in February 2003. Each of the system consists of a Data Logger (16 bit resolution, synchronous 18 channels) and 16 <b>Force</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Accelerometers</b> (0 - 50 Hz, 120 dB).

Structural monitoring systems are also required for the acquisition of real-time response toring system of over 350 sensors; the system cost is estimated to have been over $ 8 million ~Farrar 2001 !. A significant contributor to costs are expensive installations that can represent up to 25 % of the total system cost. In addition, installations can be a chal-lenging undertaking, with potentially over 75 % of the installation time attributed to the installation of system wires ~Straser and Kiremidjian 1998 !. Commercial monitoring systems make exten-sive use of force-balance accelerometers that have been specially designed for installation in civil structures. With broad dynamic ranges, they represent an accurate method of measuring both am-bient and forced structural responses. However, the cost of indi-vidual <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> <b>accelerometers</b> can be high, with uniaxial versions costing over $ 1, 000 each ~Celebi 2001 !. The high costs associated with commercial monitoring sys-tems can be eradicated through the adoption of new and revolu-tionary technologies from related engineering fields.

Various MEMS-based accelerometers are commercially available that can serve as accurate substitutes for traditional force-balance accelerometers at substantially reduced costs.

30|$|The {{strong motion}} seismographs in DMG and KKA Geo-SIG AC 23 have accelerometers {{that are not}} the <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> type. This <b>accelerometer</b> {{is based on a}} {{geophone}} mass-spring system (i.e., velocity transducer of the natural frequency 4.5  Hz) with electronic corrector that over-damps the geophone by applying a voltage with opposite polarity over the geophone and then the output response will be flat and proportional to the acceleration in the frequency range from 0.1 to 100  Hz, and an amplifier is applied to this voltage difference to regulate the gain (GeoSIG Ltd. 2015). Therefore, for these two accelerometric stations, an attention is required on S/N for very small amplitude signal at the low-frequency range. However, a quantitative discussion related to PKIN is possible within the target frequency range of this study, i.e., over 0.5  Hz and also the consideration is possible on the relation of DMG with KKA over 0.3  Hz as explained below.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of earthquake hazard mitigation research is to gain sufficient understanding of the phenomena involved in an earthquake to minimize {{the loss of life}} and property resulting from such an event. In order to design safe, economical structures and facilities in seismic areas, it is necessary {{to understand the nature of}} the ground motion generated by an earthquake. This understanding can ultimately come only from the measurement of the strong ground motion resulting from actual damaging earthquakes. In order to facilitate the acquisition of strong ground motion data world-wide, an International Workshop on Strong Motion Earthquake Instrument Arrays was held in 1978 in Hawaii. Participants in the Workshop appealed to the earthquake-threatened countries of the world to undertake a concerted effort to establish strong-motion accelerograph arrays and networks. In response to the appeal of these experts in earthquake hazard mitigation, and in accord with the "China-U. S. Protocol for Scientific and Technical Cooperation in Earthquake Studies," a joint research project on strong ground motion measurement has been established in China. In the first phase of this project, from April 1981 to December 1984, 22 Kinemetrics PDR- 1 Digital Event Recorders equipped with FBA- 13 <b>Force</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Accelerometers,</b> and 18 Kinemetrics SMA- 1 Analog Accelerographs were deployed in China. Of this total, 13 PDR- 1 and 3 SMA 1 instruments were deployed in a surface array and a three-dimensional array in the aftershock region of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. These two arrays recorded a total of 1053 near-source accelerograms from 416 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from ML = 1. 2 to 5. 7. The source-station distances ranged from 2 to 45 kilometers. Most of the records contain the complete P- and S-wave motion along with accurate absolute time. Both the volume and quality of the accelerograms are much greater than ever before obtained in China. The largest event recorded was the ML = 5. 7 Lulong earthquake of October 19, 1982. Nine instruments were triggered by this event. The epicentral distance from the recording stations ranged from 5 to 41 kilometers, and the corresponding peak horizontal acceleration ranged from 0. 217 to 0. 008 g. Accelerograms were recorded by the three-dimensional array from twenty-eight events. Measurements were made to a depth of 900 meters below the ground surface. The records obtained provide a unique source of data for the study of the propagation of seismic waves near the earth's surface. In order to make these data more useful, they will be published along with site data in a separate volume. In this report, 218 of the most significant accelerograms; are published. The data was obtained from earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from ML = 2. 3 to 5. 7. All of the data reproduced in this report is available on 9 -track computer tape...|$|R
