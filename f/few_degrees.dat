The IMA relinquished the standard after concluding that the majority of artworks could sustain a greater range of humidity, so permitting the museum to save on the cost of energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up a steep slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E

5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake was only a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, {{but he did not}} find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|Lying a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> west of Beta is Delta Pavonis, {{a nearby}} Sun-like but more evolved star; {{this is a}} yellow subgiant of {{spectral}} type G8IV and apparent magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 light years distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation's eastern border with Indus is Gamma Pavonis, a fainter, solar-type star 30 light years from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: SCR 1845-6357 (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting of a red dwarf and brown dwarf companion lying around 12.6 light years distant, while Gliese 693 is a red dwarf of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 light years away.|$|E

5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E
5|$|The {{two stars}} in Serpens Caput that {{form part of}} the Snake's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis, both third-magnitude A-type main-sequence stars. Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an Am star, while Mu is a binary. Located {{slightly}} northwest of Mu is 36 Serpentis, another A-type main-sequence star. This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Bo√∂tis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a slowly pulsating B star, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis {{is defined as the}} line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally no more than a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> below the freezing point. Major snowfalls {{can result from}} nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20‚Äì30cm (8‚Äì12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30¬∞C (86¬∞F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a <b>few</b> <b>degrees</b> per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E

40|$|Sixty Duroc pigs, {{representing}} {{offspring of}} three {{lines from the}} fifth generation of divergent selection for leg weakness, were examined to determine correlated responses in joint angularity. The lines were low, control, and high, with the latter having superior front leg structure. At approximately 100 kg, 10 pigs of each sex and line were scored for front and rear leg structure and movement. The shoulder, elbow, carpal and hock joints were measured for resting angles and range of motion. The model {{to analyze the data}} included the effects of line, sire, sex and side and a covariable for weight. High-line pigs had significantly smaller (P 3 ÃÜc. 05) resting angles of the elbow joint than did control- or low-line pigs. The low-line pigs, however, had significantly smaller resting angles at the carpal joint (P 3 ÃÜc. 01) and greater resting angles at the hock joint (P 3 ÃÜc. 05) than did control- or high-line pigs. The low-line pigs had <b>fewer</b> <b>degrees</b> extension at the elbow joint and <b>fewer</b> <b>degrees</b> flexion at the carpal joint than did control- or high-line pigs. High-line pigs had <b>fewer</b> <b>degrees</b> of flexion of the elbow joint than did control-or low-line pigs. Resting angles and range of motion for the elbow and carpal joints were less on the left side than on the right side. Males had greater degrees of extension and total degrees of movement at the elbow joint than did females. Selection for different degrees of leg weakness resulted in accompanying alterations in angularity of joints...|$|R
25|$|Touchdown PCR (Step-down PCR): {{a variant}} of PCR that aims to reduce nonspecific {{background}} by gradually lowering the annealing temperature as PCR cycling progresses.
