50|$|The topical {{substantivity}} and water-resistance of hydrolyzed jojoba esters {{make them}} {{well suited to}} hold other substances {{on the surface of}} the skin or hair. Examples are: sunscreens and UV filters, pigments (for decorative cosmetics), insect repellents, quaternium <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> agents, fragrance, and botanical extracts. Hydrolyzed jojoba esters can extend the moisturizing properties of traditional emulsions, and work as a refatting agent in astringents and toners. The high pH of Hydrolyzed jojoba esters make them suitable as a gel neutralizer to thicken carbomer gels. The most common applications are sunscreens, fragranced lotions, and <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> agents.|$|R

40|$|The {{dissolution}} behaviour in sulphate solutions {{of so-called}} non-porous anodic alumina <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen and i n a moist oxygen atmosphere on chemically polished aluminium has "been investigated. Evidence is presented {{which indicates that}} the non-porous anodic <b>films,</b> <b>formed</b> at 7 - 30 volts, consisted of two regions, a thin, less soluble region adjacent to the metal and a thicker, more soluble outer region into which hydroxyl ions were incorporated. The structure {{might be related to}} the initial method of surface preparation adopted. It is suggested that <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C consist of crystalline Y-alumina, whilst those formed in the moist oxygen atmosphere a t 500 C possibly consist of amorphous alumina with someadsorbed water and are less faulted than the crystalline oxide. Again, there is some indication that the structure of these filmsis strongly influenced by the initial method of surface preparation used. The dissolution behaviour of the anodic <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C can be understood in terms of the extent of sulphate ion adsorption, apparently greater under the same conditions for the former type, and its effect on rate of transfer of protons, hydroxyl ions and water across the oxide/solution interface. A reaction scheme, proposed earlier to account for the behaviour during dissolution of the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid, appears adequate to explain the dissolution behaviour observed in the present studies. However, the type of behaviour, although rather similar for both' anodic non-porous and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C, was quite different from the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{properties}} of free-standing anodic alumina films {{obtained from the}} one-sided anodization of aluminum are discussed. The <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of high-pure aluminum were shown to have maximum flexural strength. Even {{a small amount of}} impurities decreases the flexural strength of the resulting free-standing anodic alumina films to be associated with their higher defectiveness. The microhardness of thick and thin films of anodic alumina is discussed as well. The microhardness of the free-standing porous anodic alumina <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of low binary alloys of aluminum is shown to be lower than one of <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of high-pure aluminum...|$|R

As for <b>film</b> <b>form,</b> there are concepts that help us to understand the function of it. The basic concern of this thesis is constructing three basic repetition types by grounding on the perceptions of repetition in philosophy by also using basic concepts of repetition in <b>film</b> <b>form.</b> These types of repetitions in <b>film</b> <b>form</b> are specified as informative, constructive and poetic repetitions.

The paper set up the fine boring squeezed liquid film damped system of multi degree of freedom vibration simulation model and solve mathematical model by transfer matrix theory. The damping coefficient for the fine boring system can be obtained. The mechanical device of liquid film damping system is established. 20 # machine oil, 40 # machine oil, and cutting fluid are used to the system. The tests indicate that the effect of liquid <b>film</b> <b>formed</b> by cutting fluid is better than oil <b>film</b> <b>formed</b> by machine oil in the static test, but oil <b>film</b> <b>formed</b> by machine oil is better than liquid <b>film</b> <b>formed</b> by cutting fluid in the effect of dynamic test.

40|$|<b>Film</b> <b>forming</b> systems offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for topical and transdermal drug delivery, in particular enabling production of a supersaturated state which can greatly improve drug absorption and bioavailability. However the suitability of individual <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymers to stabilise the supersaturated state and optimise delivery of drugs is not well understood. This study reports the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure the solubility of methylphenidate both as the free base and as the hydrochloride salt in two polymethacrylate copolymers, Eudragit RS (EuRS) and Eudragit E (EuE) and relates this {{to the ability of}} <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> using these polymers to deliver methylphenidate across a model membrane. EuRS provided greater methylphenidate delivery when the drug was formulated as the free base in comparison EuE because the lower solubility of the drug in EuRS provided a higher degree of drug saturation in the polymeric film. In contrast EuE provided greater delivery of methylphenidate hydrochloride as EuRS could not prevent its crystallisation from a supersaturated state. Methylphenidate flux across the membrane could be directly related to degree of saturation of the drug in the film formulation as estimated by the drug solubility in the individual polymers demonstrating the importance of drug solubility in the polymer included in <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> systems for topical/transdermal drug delivery. In addition DSC has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for determining the solubility of drugs in polymers used in <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> systems and the approaches outlined here are likely to be useful for predicting the suitability of polymers for particular drugs in <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> transdermal drug delivery systems...|$|R
