40|$|We {{compared}} flanker congruency effects (FCE) for flanker stimuli {{that were}} part of merely <b>instructed</b> S-R mappings or S-R mappings that had already been practiced. Four new S-R mappings were <b>instructed</b> before each block of trials. In applied flanker blocks, each <b>instructed</b> stimulus could appear as target and as flanker. In merely <b>instructed</b> flanker blocks, two stimuli only served as targets, whereas the other two exclusively appeared as flankers. Significant FCEs were observed for both flanker conditions even though the instruction-based FCE was (a) smaller than the FCE from applied mappings and (b) decreased with task practice. These results suggest that instructions alone can induce S-R associations that lead to automatic response activation when <b>instructed</b> stimuli appear as flankers. Execution of <b>instructed</b> rules seems to strengthen the <b>instructed</b> associations, leading to increased response conflict...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} shown that instructions about stimulus-response (S-R) mappings can influence task performance even when these instructions are irrelevant for the current task. In the present study, we tested whether automatic effects of S-R instructions occur because the <b>instructed</b> stimuli automatically activate their corresponding responses. We registered the lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) that were evoked by the <b>instructed</b> stimuli while participants were performing a task for which those mappings were irrelevant. <b>Instructed</b> S-R mappings clearly affected task performance in electrophysiological and behavioral measures. The LRP was found to deflect {{in the direction of the}} response tendency that corresponded with the <b>instructed</b> S-R mapping. Early activation of the <b>instructed</b> response was observed but occurred predominantly on slow trials. In contrast, response conflict evoked by <b>instructed</b> S-R mappings did not modulate the N 2 amplitude. The results strongly suggest that, like experienced S-R mappings, <b>instructed</b> S-R mappings can lead to automatic response activation, but possibly via a different route...|$|R

40|$|Following {{differential}} fear conditioning, {{the instruction}} that the unconditional stimulus {{will no longer}} be presented (<b>instructed</b> extinction) reduces differential electrodermal responding to CS+ and CS-, but does not affect differential conditional stimulus valence evaluations. Reductions in differential electrodermal responding have been attributed to the provision of verbal instructions; however, during <b>instructed</b> extinction the unconditional stimulus electrode is often removed as well. This removal could reduce the participants 2 ̆ 7 general arousal levels rendering the detection of differential electrodermal responding difficult. The current study examined this alternative interpretation by comparing the electrodermal responses and conditional stimulus valence evaluations of an instruction/electrode-on group, an instruction/electrode-off group, and a control group who were not <b>instructed.</b> Following <b>instructed</b> extinction, differential electrodermal responding was eliminated in both instruction groups, an effect that was not influenced by the attachment/removal of the electrode. Replicating previous findings, conditional stimulus valence was not affected by <b>instructed</b> extinction. The results suggest that verbal instructions, not unconditional stimulus electrode removal, reduce differential electrodermal responding during <b>instructed</b> extinction manipulations...|$|R
