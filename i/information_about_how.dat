As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. This helps the player collect <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to attack them effectively.

5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on how a test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, some of Twitter's {{revenue and}} user growth {{documents}} were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll. The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 {{in the third}} quarter and US$4million in the fourth quarter along with 25million users {{by the end of the}} year. The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54billion in revenue, US$111million in net earnings, and 1billion users. No <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.|$|E

5|$|The {{revised version}} of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (the WAIS-R) was {{developed}} by David Wechsler and published by Psychological Corporation in 1981. Wechsler changed {{a few of the}} boundaries for classification categories and a few of their names compared to the 1958 version of the test.

5|$|There is {{also much}} <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the {{universe}} was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E
5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> many people were in or {{would be in the}} town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E

It is also known that members of the Academy of Gondishapur travelled to Damascus. The Academy of Gondishapur remained active throughout the time of the Abbasid caliphate, though.|$|E
40|$|A root apical {{meristem}} {{is the only}} source of cells for all tissues in the root. The root growth relies on its function. Regulation of a cell division frequency and cell differentiation affects organization and function of the differentiated tissues and the proper meristem function. If the cell differentiation overbalances the cell proliferation, the meristem exhaustion occurs and the root growth irreversibly terminates. This thesis describes existing knowledge about regulation of the primary root {{apical meristem}} of model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays, explains these findings in the context of plant postembryonal development and provides <b>informations</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> and under what conditions the primary root growth might be terminated...|$|R

25|$|Most {{common is}} STRs (short tandem repeat). A certain section of DNA is {{examined}} for {{a pattern that}} repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats {{is the value of}} the marker.

25|$|As a {{historical}} dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary explains words by showing their development {{rather than merely}} their present-day usages. Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that {{the sense of the}} word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.|$|E
25|$|While {{scholars}} {{have discovered a}} fair amount of <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> Irish Kingship worked, relatively little is actually related by early Irish laws. In particular, very little material survives regarding succession practices, which have been reconstructed as the system of Tanistry. A section of the Senchas Már tract on status was apparently devoted to succession, although little survives. Most early material on succession was collected by Domnal O'Davoren in the 16th century. Another seemingly important omission is that the laws never mention the High King of Ireland centred at Tara. Likewise, the laws only once mention the practice of individuals being ineligible for kingship if they are blemished (a practice more widely evident elsewhere, especially in Irish mythology). However, that mention is only incidental to a regulation on the compensation for bee stings when the legal tract Bechbretha relates the story of Congal Cáech, who was deposed on account of being blinded by a bee.|$|E

Victory Point further provides information on the shootdown of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command's 160th Special Operation's Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR(A)) MH-47 Special Operations Helicopter, which resulted in the deaths of 8 Navy SEALs and 8 Army Special Operations aviators,and the search for and recovery of Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of the four-man Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team.|$|E
