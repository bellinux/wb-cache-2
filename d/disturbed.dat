5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in <b>disturbed</b> environments tending to be more inbred than populations in {{relatively}} intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of <b>disturbed</b> populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, <b>disturbed</b> populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{drifting}} accuracy of aerostatic bearings, the manufacturing errors effects on <b>disturbing</b> torque of aerostatic bearings is studied by using the finite element method. The finite element mathematic model of the major influence factors of <b>disturbing</b> torque is established. Then, the finite element equation in the gas film domain is solved and the <b>disturbing</b> torque {{in the presence of}} <b>disturbing</b> factors is calculated. The research focuses on elliptical error and prismatic error of journal and incline error of throttle slit. The setting angle of journal, incline position angle of throttle slit and radial eccentricity ratio which affect the <b>disturbing</b> torque is also studied. The results show that roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit affect the <b>disturbing</b> torque significantly, that is the greater roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit the greater <b>disturbing</b> torque. <b>Disturbing</b> torque is periodic function of setting angle of journal and incline position angle of throttle slit. Radial eccentricity ratio affects the <b>disturbing</b> torque, and there is specific radial eccentricity ratio makes <b>disturbing</b> torque to be extreme point or zero point. In the research, the theoretical <b>disturbing</b> torque value is compared with the experimental value of a certain aerostatic bearing, find that they are on the whole accordant with each other and then prove that the finite element model and the method use to solve the problem is correct. The research is of great significance for designing, manufacturing and assembling aerostatic bearings and for performance prediction of aerostatic bearings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{mechanism}} of drain <b>disturb</b> is studied in silicon– oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon Flash electrically erasable program-mable read-only memory cells. It is shown that <b>disturb</b> {{is a serious}} problem in programmed cells and is caused by injection of hot holes from substrate into the oxide/nitride/oxide stack. The origin of these holes is identified by analyzing the influence of halo doping, channel doping, and channel length scaling on drain <b>disturb.</b> Band-to-band tunneling at the drain junction is nor-mally the dominant source of these holes. It is also shown that holes generated out of impact ionization of channel electrons become dominant in cells with high channel leakage (especially at lower channel lengths). Finally, the effect of repeated program/ erase cycling on drain <b>disturb</b> is studied. Drain <b>disturb</b> be-comes less severe with cycling, the reasons for which are deter-mined using gate-induced drain leakage measurements and device simulations.

40|$|Abstract: Aiming at the {{shortcomings}} on workload and time {{consumption in the}} computation of <b>disturbing</b> gravity of the ballistic trajectory points using gravity potential model, this study puts forward an alternative method to approximate the <b>disturbing</b> gravity of the active phase of trajectory numerically, which is called the finite space partitioning method. Based {{on the principles of}} finite element partition and interpolation, firstly the finite space around the trajectory is partitioned into proper-sized spatial cubic blocks, and the <b>disturbing</b> gravity of each vertex of every cubic block could be computed using geopotential model, and then the <b>disturbing</b> gravity of any trajectory point could be interpolated from those gravity values of the block vertices immediately. Numerical experiments indicate that the <b>disturbing</b> gravity of trajectory can be computed fast and accurately using this method. This method not only overcomes {{the shortcomings}} of workload in method based on gravity potential model, but also shortens the time consumption greatly.

40|$|Abstract Noise, light, restless or {{aggressive}} patients may constitute <b>disturbing</b> effects {{for a patient}} who is hospitalized in an intensive care ward. These <b>disturbing</b> factors form {{an integral part of}} modern medicine. Invasive methods, monitoring technologies and other devices securing vital functions of a patient in an intensive care ward mean a greater chance for the patient to survice and recover but also a greater chance of discomfort during hospitalization in an intensive care ward. The objective of the thesis was to find out how nurses in intensive care wards influence negative <b>disturbing</b> factors affecting the patients in connection with the regime of the intensive care ward, and how the patients react to negative <b>disturbing</b> factors in intensive care wards. Five hypotheses were raised. The first hypothesis was to confirm whether nurses are aware of negative factors affecting patients hospitalized in an intensive care ward. The second hypothesis was confirm whether nurses eliminate these <b>disturbing</b> factors as much as possible with respect to maintenance of the intensive care ward operation. The third hypothesis was to verify whether patients regard these <b>disturbing</b> factors as negative. These three hypotheses have been confirmed. The fourth hypothesis was to confirm that noise is regarded by the patients as the worst <b>disturbing</b> effect. This hypothesis has been confirmed. The fifth hypothesis was to confirm whether <b>disturbing</b> effects are more easily endured by men than women. This hypothesis has not been confirmed. Data were collected by means of a quantitative research. Patients and nurses obtained anonymous questionnaires. The research was conducted in the intensive care wards in hospital Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. The research revealed the following facts. The objectives have been fulfilled. Four of five hypotheses have been confirmed. Both patiens and nurses are conscious of the <b>disturbing</b> effects. Nurses in the intensive care wards have opportunites to influence negative <b>disturbing</b> factors without affecting the operation of the intensive care ward. Negative <b>disturbing</b> effects are frequent in intensive care wards and form an integral part of their regime. This thesis may lead the nurses worging in intensive care wards to considerations how to reduce negative effects that are <b>disturbing</b> for the patients...|$|R
