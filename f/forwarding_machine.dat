50|$|Italy's Societ√† Italiana Aviazione, a Fiat company, licence-built {{a number}} of MF.11s under the {{designation}} SIA 5 from early 1915, fitted with a fixed <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun and a 74.5 kW (100 hp) Fiat A.10 engine.|$|R
50|$|On 7 December, Shaw {{was still}} drydocked, {{receiving}} adjustments to her depth charge mechanisms. During the Japanese attack, she took three hits: two bombs through the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun platform, and one through the port {{wing of the}} bridge. Fires spread through the ship. By 0925, all fire-fighting facilities were exhausted, and the order to abandon ship was given. Efforts to flood the dock were only partially successful; and, shortly after 0930, her forward magazine exploded.|$|R
5000|$|Unique powers {{collected}} during gameplay may replace, extend or add to previous powers, {{depending on which}} character is in play and which power obtained. The characters handle the unique powers differently. For instance, collecting the [...] "fire power" [...] allows Nikki to shoot destructive fireballs, while it grants Fargus invincibility and a deadly touch, but requires him to constantly move <b>forward.</b> <b>Machines</b> and equipment are also available throughout the game, although they are tied to certain areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} FIAT 2000 at Rome {{was left}} in a depot for several years, until it was sent on the orders of Colonel Maltese to Forte Tiburtino, risking to catch fire during the travel. In 1934 it was seen again in a Campo Dux parade, having been repainted and even rearmed, with two 37/40 mm guns instead of the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> guns. It was later reportedly transformed into a monument at Bologna, after that its fate is unknown, like the other tank.|$|R
5000|$|Improved {{extended}} range torpedo bomber introduced in late 1942. It {{was not available}} in significant numbers until mid-1943. Known also as SM.79bis, SM.79GA, or SM.579. Powered by AR.128 engines of approximately [...] each, giving increased performance (speed increased to 475 km/h, and climb to 5,000 m in 16 minutes 7 sec). Ventral nacelle deleted. 1,000 L (260 US gal) fuel tank mounted in the bomb bay. The <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun was retained, with its flash protection, probably as an anti-ship weapon.|$|R
50|$|The escort Wing Leader, Wg Cdr Blatchford, vainly {{attempted}} {{to recall the}} bombers but they were soon hemmed in by fighters. Under constant attack by II Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 1, 487 Squadron continued on to its target, the few surviving aircraft completing bombing runs before being shot down. The Squadron was virtually wiped out. Trent shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 with the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> guns of his plane. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft (Ventura AJ209) was hit, went into a spin and broke up.|$|R

5000|$|At least 15 Oxfords {{along with}} some Consuls were {{supplied}} to the Union of Burma Air Force in the late 1940s with some being modified to carry pod-mounted <b>forward</b> facing <b>machine</b> guns and rocket projectiles.|$|R
50|$|Sd.Kfz. 251/16 - Flammpanzerwagen. Fitted {{with two}} flame {{projectors}} and initially a rear-mounted flamethrower, detachable but still {{connected to the}} vehicle, to be operated by dismounted infantry. This was {{in addition to the}} standard <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun mount. Six Sd.Kfz. 251/16 Flammpanzerwagens were authorised for issue to each Panzergrenadier regiment or in the Pioneer battalion. Though vulnerable, they were used very successfully at night to quickly attack enemy infantry who had just captured German trenches, hitting the enemy before they could consolidate and bring up the heavy weapons that would make them much costlier to defeat later. Late ausf. D versions had larger gunshields.|$|R
50|$|On September 26 the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began. The {{offensive}} {{lasted for}} forty-five days and left {{tens of thousands}} dead. On the morning of October 12, Woodfill and his company were stationed near Cunel when his men were advancing through thick fog. As they moved <b>forward,</b> <b>machine</b> gun fire broke out from German held positions targeting Woodfill and his men. While the other men took cover, Woodfill quickly advanced on the machine gun emplacement while avoiding being hit. As he approached the emplacement he opened fire, disabling three German soldiers. A German officer rushed Woodfill and engaged him in hand-to-hand combat, but Woodfill gained the advantage and killed him.|$|R
50|$|Directional shots - Though each ship is {{armed with}} a <b>forward</b> firing <b>machine</b> gun, they also have two {{multi-directional}} cannons(called the Fang system) which can be rotated around the ship's radius so as to fire in any direction the player chooses.|$|R
2500|$|In the Battle of Kursk (Operation Citadel), General V. Ryazanov {{became a}} master {{in the use}} of attack {{aircraft}} en masse, developing and improving the tactics of Il-2 operations in co-ordination with infantry, artillery and armored troops. Il-2s at Kursk used the [...] "circle of death" [...] tactic: up to eight Sturmoviks formed a defensive circle, each plane protecting the one ahead with its <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> guns, while individual Il-2s took turns leaving the circle, attacking a target, and rejoining the circle. Ryazanov was later awarded the Gold Star of Hero of Soviet Union twice, and the 1st Assault Aviation Corps under his command became the first unit to be awarded the honorific title of Guards.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{innovation}} of fully mechanized technology that has been introduced in forestry {{since the beginning of}} the 21 st century up to now. The goal of this work is to summarize the data on the development of harvesters and forwarders, to determine their characteristics and present the ways how the innovation of this machinery affects its daily operation. The main directions of development that can be seen in this branch of engineering are reduction of pressure on the soil surface and of the damage to existing forest stand, reduction in emissions, improvement in the working conditions, increased power and workforce efficiency. This thesis focuses on harvesting and <b>forwarding</b> <b>machines,</b> their innovation and practical utility...|$|R

2500|$|With the D.H.2, the F.E.8 was [...] one of {{the first}} {{so-called}} [...] "scout" [...] aircraft designed from the outset as a single-seat fighter. In the absence of a synchronization gear to provide a <b>forward</b> firing <b>machine</b> gun for a tractor scout such as the S.E. 2, it was given a pusher layout.|$|R
25|$|On 22 October 1944 Bellamy's troop {{was part}} of a screen for {{infantry}} advancing near Doornhoek in the south of the Netherlands when it came under small arms, mortar and artillery fire. He engaged the enemy posts, eventually taking out three, and assisted the infantry in getting <b>forward.</b> <b>Machine</b> gun bullets struck his tank and caused molten lead to splatter in his face, and his tank entered a minefield and nearly ran over a mine. A jerry can of petrol spilt and set his bedding on fire, but he managed to get his burning tank and crew to safety. His beret was later found to have two bullet holes in it. For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross, which was personally presented to him by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in a ceremony on 5 March 1945.|$|R

50|$|Armed {{version for}} Border guard duties. Two fixed <b>forward</b> firing PK <b>machine</b> guns and one inside cabin firing through open cabin doors and two rocket launchers.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{were now}} more careful after the ambush, and used their {{artillery}} and machine guns to fire at suspected positions before sending their infantry <b>forward.</b> Light <b>machine</b> guns were positioned up {{among the trees}} and caused many Chinese casualties. Eventually the Chinese set up their heavy machine guns to fire {{at an angle to}} deal with this menace.|$|R
2500|$|A support {{position}} was established about [...] from the Indonesians, {{from where the}} attached forward observer {{would be able to}} call in artillery support if required. In addition one platoon was positioned in a location from where they could provide support by fire on to the company-sized position in order to distract them during the initial assault. By noon the battle preparation had been completed and Maunsell led his two assault platoons in single file up the ridge towards the summit. An advance party, consisting of 16 men under the command of Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu, led the way, crawling silently up the steep ridge and clearing the way {{for the rest of the}} company. It took over an hour to cover the [...] before the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun pit was located. The plan was to kill the sentry manning the machine gun silently, however, when the party was [...] from the pit, the sentry spotted them and opened fire, wounding one of the Gurkhas.|$|R
5000|$|As the torpedo boats rapidly approached, Liberty {{opened fire}} on them. This was after the aerial attacks. At the inquiry, Commander McGonagle {{expressed}} that the torpedo boats appeared to be approaching in an attack formation. Thus, he sent a person to the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun to fire at them. After several shots were fired, McGonagle ordered cease fire. Then a machine gun on 03 level sounded like it was firing, but nobody was seen at the gun. McGonagle said that he felt sure the torpedo boat captains believed they were under fire from the Liberty. Ensign Lucas, the ship's gunnery officer who left the bridge shortly after {{the beginning of the}} air attack and then returned during the torpedo boat attack, testified that he gave permission for manned firing of the 03 level machine gun after the torpedo boats began firing at Liberty. Then, later when the gun was unmanned, heat from a nearby fire apparently caused machine gun rounds at the 03 level gun to explode.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was conventional in layout, high-wing cantilever monoplane, of mixed construction (metal and wood). The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section, {{made of a}} metal frame, covered with metal (upper fuselage) and canvas (sides and bottom), front part was made of duralumin. Wings were of wooden construction, plywood covered. There was a crew of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in a glazed nose, with a <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun turret and a significant pointed [...] "beard" [...] below. The pilot's canopy was above a fuselage, offset to the left. The rear gunner operated an upper turret, elevating to a working position. The main undercarriage retracted into engine nacelles. The plane was powered by two Bristol Pegasus VIII radial engines, normal power: 670 hp (500 kW), take-off power: 700 hp (522 kW). Bombs were carried in a bomb bay in the fuselage, the maximum load was 660 kg.|$|R
50|$|It {{was fitted}} {{with both a}} {{rearward}} firing machine gun, mounted on a flexible ring mounting, and a <b>forward</b> firing synchronized <b>machine</b> gun and was very probably the first aircraft to be so armed.|$|R
50|$|A support {{position}} was established about 800 yards m from the Indonesians, {{from where the}} attached forward observer {{would be able to}} call in artillery support if required. In addition one platoon was positioned in a location from where they could provide support by fire on to the company-sized position in order to distract them during the initial assault. By noon the battle preparation had been completed and Maunsell led his two assault platoons in single file up the ridge towards the summit. An advance party, consisting of 16 men under the command of Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu, led the way, crawling silently up the steep ridge and clearing the way {{for the rest of the}} company. It took over an hour to cover the 50 yards m before the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun pit was located. The plan was to kill the sentry manning the machine gun silently, however, when the party was 10 yards m from the pit, the sentry spotted them and opened fire, wounding one of the Gurkhas.|$|R
40|$|Network {{virtualization}} {{provides the}} ability to run multiple concurrent virtual networks over a shared substrate. However, {{it is challenging to}} design such a platform to host multiple heterogenous and often highly customized virtual networks. Not only minimal interference among different virtual networks is desired, high speed packet processing is also required. This paper presents PdP, a flexible virtual network platform which can achieve high speed packet processing. A PdP node has a cluster of machines that can perform packet processing in parallel. Each virtual network can be allocated with one or multiple <b>forwarding</b> <b>machines</b> so as to satisfy the packet processing requirement of the virtual network. Furthermore, a virtual network hosted in PdP has the freedom to be fully customized. Both the control plane and the data plane of a virtual network run in virtual machines so as to be isolated from other virtual networks. We have built a proofof-concept prototype of the PdP platform using off-the-shelf commodity hardware and open source software. The performance measurement shows promising results.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was quite small for its bomb load and range; it was allowed {{in part by}} a lift-generating, airfoil-shaped fuselage, which was another then-unusual feature (previously used e.g. on PZL.26 sports plane). It was much shorter and had smaller wings than many German and French counterparts; it was slightly larger than the Lockheed Model 10 Electra Amelia Earhart used. The crew consisted of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with a <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun. The radio operator sat inside the fuselage, above the bomb bay, and he also operated an underbelly rear machine gun. The main undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles. The undercarriage was double-wheeled, with an independent suspension for each wheel. The plane was powered by two Bristol Pegasus radial engines. The PZL.37A had Pegasus XII B engines (normal power: 860 BHP (873 cv, 642 kW), maximum: 940 BHP (953 cv, 701 kW)), the PZL.37B had Pegasus XX engines (normal power: 905 HP (918 cv, 675 kW), maximum: 970 BHP (984 cv, 723 kW)).|$|R
50|$|Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu led an {{advanced}} party of 16 men {{in an attack}} on the <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> gun position, from where they were to provide support {{to the rest of the}} company during their attack. They were about 10 yards away when the Indonesian sentry opened fire, wounding one of the Gurkhas and alerting the rest of the platoon. Seeing the danger that they were in, Rambahadur Limbu rushed the machine gun and destroyed it with a grenade. Alerted, the rest of the Indonesian platoon began to fire on the forward pit, thus making it an untenable position from which to provide support for the company attack. In order to report this fact to his platoon commander, Limbu exposed himself to enemy fire before returning to pull two of his wounded comrades to safety. An hour-long fire-fight followed, which has since become known as the Battle of Bau, during which the Gurkha company launched an assault on the Indonesian position. At least 24 Indonesians are believed killed in the attack, while the Gurkhas suffered three killed and two wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Bombs were fitted {{under the}} wings and in an {{internal}} fuselage bomb bay. It usually carried one 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb but {{there were reports that}} the D4Y sometimes carried two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, for example during the attack on the light aircraft carrier only 30 kg (70 lb) bombs were carried externally. The aircraft was armed with two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 97 aircraft machine guns in the nose and a 7.92 mm (.312 inm) Type 1 machine gun selected for its high rate of fire, {{in the rear of the}} cockpit. The rear gun was replaced by a 13 mm (.51 in) Type 2 machine gun. This armament was typical for Japanese carrier-based dive-bombers, unlike [...] "carrier attack bombers" [...] (i.e. torpedo bombers) like the Nakajima B5N and B6N which were not given forward-firing armament until the late-war Aichi B7A, which was expected to serve as both a dive-bomber and torpedo-bomber, and was given a pair of 20mm Type 99-2 cannon. The <b>forward</b> <b>machine</b> guns were retained in the kamikaze version.|$|R
50|$|Nose turret {{removed and}} {{replaced}} with solid nose fitted with 2x fixed <b>forward</b> firing 12.7mm <b>machine</b> guns. 8 prototypes built of varying configurations. None selected for mass production due to minimal increase in speed. Dive brakes used on Ki-48 IIb.|$|R
50|$|Whatton bars loop {{behind the}} legs of penny-farthing riders {{so that they can}} still keep their feet on the pedals and also be able to leap feet-first <b>forward</b> off the <b>machine.</b> These are also used on {{recumbent}} bicycles for under-seat steering.|$|R
