5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are <b>gas</b> <b>porosity,</b> shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates <b>gas</b> <b>porosity.</b> An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E

25|$|A {{casting defect}} is an {{undesired}} irregularity {{in a metal}} casting process. Some defects can be tolerated while others can be repaired, otherwise they must be eliminated. They are broken down into five main categories: <b>gas</b> <b>porosity,</b> shrinkage defects, mold material defects, pouring metal defects, and metallurgical defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>porosity</b> can {{sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish from microshrinkage because microshrinkage cavities can contain gases as well. In general, microporosities will form if the casting is not properly risered or if a material with a wide solidification range is cast. If neither of these are the case then most likely the porosity is due to gas formation.|$|E
40|$|The main {{impurities}} {{in aluminum}} melt are hydrogen and Al 2 O 3, which can deteriorate melt quality and materials performance. However, the diffusion process of H atoms in aluminum melt and the interactions among Al atoms, Al 2 O 3 and hydrogen {{have been studied}} rarely. Molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations are employed to study the diffusion behaviors {{of different types of}} hydrogen, such as free H atoms, H atoms in H 2 and H+ ions in H 2 O using COMPASS force field. Correspondingly, force field types h, h 1 h and h 1 o are used to describe different types of hydrogen which are labeled as Hh, Hh 1 h and Hh 1 o. The results show that the adsorption areas are maximum for Hh 1 o, followed by Hh 1 h and Hh. The diffusion ability of Hh 1 o is the strongest whereas Hh is hard to diffuse in aluminum melt because of the differences in radius and potential well depth of various types of hydrogen. Al 2 O 3 cluster makes the Al atoms array disordered, creating the energy conditions for hydrogen diffusion in aluminum melt. Al 2 O 3 improves the diffusion of Hh and Hh 1 o, and constrains Hh 1 h which accumulates around it and forms <b>gas</b> <b>porosities</b> in aluminum. Hh 1 o is the most dispersive in aluminum melt, moreover, the distance of Al-Hh 1 o is shorter than that of Al-Hh 1 h, both of which are detrimental to the removal of Hh 1 o. The simulation results indicate that the <b>gas</b> <b>porosities</b> can be eliminated by the removal of Al 2 O 3 inclusions, and the dispersive hydrogen can be removed by adsorption function of gas bubbles or molten fluxes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{spite of}} {{knowledge}} of conventional gating design casting defects such as shrinkage and <b>gas</b> <b>porosities</b> were found in front axle housing a critical automotive component. This component is generally made out of spheroidal graphite iron. A flawed gating system {{was found to be}} the reason for improper fluid flow and melt solidification which in turn produced casting defects. Optimization of the gating and risering system by using casting simulation software ADSTEFAN was carried out. Through several simulation iterations, it was concluded that defect free casting could be obtained by modifying the initial gating ratio 2 : 2 : 1 to 2 : 1. 76 : 1. Also shifting of sprue location from centre to end and providing the risers at location prone to formation of shrinkage porosity led to the decrease in size of the shrinkage porosity about 97 %...|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{sorption}} {{is modeled}} by {{the combination of}} adsorption and dissolution. We use the Langmuir adsorption equation to represent adsorbed gas and Henry’s equation to represent dissolved gas. A quite reasonable K coefficient is obtained in Henry’s equation. The effect of dissolved <b>gas</b> on <b>porosity</b> and permeability is also discussed. For non-Darcy gas flow, the apparent permeability model for free gas is established by combining the slip flow and Knudsen flow equations. For adsorbed gas, the surface diffusion effect is also considered in this model. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed.|$|R

25|$|To prevent <b>gas</b> <b>porosity</b> the {{material}} may be melted in a vacuum, {{in an environment}} of low-solubility gases, such as argon or carbon dioxide, or under a flux that prevents contact with the air. To minimize gas solubility the superheat temperatures can be kept low. Turbulence from pouring the liquid metal into the mold can introduce gases, so the molds are often streamlined to minimize such turbulence. Other methods include vacuum degassing, gas flushing, or precipitation. Precipitation involves reacting the gas with another element to form a compound that will form a dross that floats to the top. For instance, oxygen can be removed from copper by adding phosphorus; aluminum or silicon can be added to steel to remove oxygen. A third source consists of reactions of the molten metal with grease or other residues in the mould.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>porosity</b> is the {{formation}} of bubbles within the casting after it has cooled. This occurs because most liquid materials can hold {{a large amount of}} dissolved gas, but the solid form of the same material cannot, so the gas forms bubbles within the material as it cools. <b>Gas</b> <b>porosity</b> may present itself {{on the surface of the}} casting as porosity or the pore may be trapped inside the metal, which reduces strength in that vicinity. Nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen are the most encountered gases in cases of <b>gas</b> <b>porosity.</b> In aluminum castings, hydrogen is the only gas that dissolves in significant quantity, which can result in hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>porosity.</b> For casting that are a few kilograms in weight the pores are usually [...] in size. In larger casting they can be up to a millimeter (0.040in) in diameter.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the given P-T conditions and methane content {{for the formation of}} <b>gas</b> hydrate, <b>porosity</b> is considered as an important factor favoring the formation and concentration of gas hydrate (e.g., Ginsburg et al. 2000; Jin et al. 2002). High porosity should favor occurrence of <b>gas</b> hydrate. <b>Porosity</b> decreases monotonically downhole from ~ 63  % just below seafloor to ~ 47  % at ~ 3021  mbsl in Hole C 0008 A (Expedition 316 Scientists 2009). Expedition 316 Scientists do not observe significant deviations from the downhole trend. Moreover, porosity does not show any particular trend related to the occurrence of the IS layers. In Hole C 0008 C, porosity does not vary significantly over the studied interval (~ 60  %), although higher value (~ 65  %) intervals are present (Fig.  8). In Hole C 0008 A, porosity is also ~ 60  %, except for the ~ 2889 – 2906  mbsl interval where porosity is ~ 65  % on average (Fig.  8). The intervals that present higher measured porosity values host ferrimagnetic iron sulfides in both holes. Because the overall slightly decreasing trend of porosity cannot explain the spatial distribution of the IS layers, the possibility that localized slight changes in porosity occur cannot be ruled out. The intervals with higher porosity would favor the formation of gas hydrate leading to the formation of ferrimagnetic iron sulfides.|$|R
40|$|In foundry {{practice}} {{the occurrence of}} solidification defects limits the production {{and the performance of}} cast components. In high-pressure die casting (HPDC) the most common defects are shrinkage or <b>gas</b> <b>porosities</b> and bifilms. Thin sections, typical of HPDC components, are the most susceptible to casting defects, and these microstructural imperfections can be detrimental to both the mechanical and aesthetic properties. Even though laminations are not as harmful as internal defects, die cast components with this kind of superficial defects are always rejected by customers, thus requiring further machining operations. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the lamination defects that occur on the surface of some Al-Si-Cu cast covers produced by means of HPDC. In order to evaluate the influence of the different injection parameters on the final quality of the die casting products, melt temperature, plunger speed and upset pressure have been varied within a range of suitable values. The obtained castings have been studied by performing visual inspections and metallographic analyses by means of optical microscopy (OM), revealing the presence of many bifilms spread over the entire cross section of some cast parts. The presence of laminations, bifilms and cold shuts has been correlated to the considered processing conditions, proposing a new criterion parameter for the quantification of surface quality, called Lamination Ratio (LR) ...|$|R

These pipelines {{play an important role}} in modern societies and are crucial in providing needed fuels for sustaining vital functions such as power generation, heating supply and transportation. If the pipeline carrying these chemicals burst/leaks it results huge loss of life, money, time and environmental disaster. Causes of these pipelines failure are internal weld discontinuities such as lack of penetration, lack of fusion, <b>gas</b> <b>porosities,</b> oxides, other inclusions and cracks etc. Pipeline girth welding under field conditions has always faced severe demands with regard to quality and cost. Consequently, the past years has seen the development of a number of methods such as various manual, as well as partly or fully mechanized processes or a combination of various welding processes. Intermixing of weld fluxes, change the chemical compositions of electrodes etc are applied for purpose of high weld quality, high productivity, strength and economy in pipeline welding field. Improvement in weld quality has been a challenge as new processes were introduced and existing processes were stretched to their limit. Competion in the field of welding is increasing day by day. Fabricators look for welding process which is cost effect and is able to give higher deposition rate better penetration and robust structures.

40|$|Hot {{cracking}} {{root causes}} in two HSLA welded steels were investigated and remedies were proposed to avoid hot cracking at {{centerline of the}} weld. The specimens were welded in Tjoint configuration keeping the constant welding parameters for both investigated alloys: Gr. 50 (with lower content of alloying elements and yield strength of 345 MPa) and Gr. 80 (with higher content of alloying elements and yield strength of 550 MPa). Metallographic studies were performed using optical and electron microscopy. Base metal, weld and HAZ were all characterized and discussed. Local chemical changes in centerline of the weld were also investigated with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). All welds of Gr. 80 showed hot cracking at the centerline while none of the Gr. 50 welds were cracked. This {{can be explained by}} interlocking effect of secondary dendrite arms (SDA) in Gr. 50 welds which enhances the resistance of weld centerline to hot cracking. Longer SDA is attributed to larger size of grains in HAZ of Gr. 50 compared to grain size in Gr. 80. The larger is the grain size of HAZ, the larger will be the width of primary dendrite arm (PDA) which in turn induces longer SDA. High residual stresses in Gr. 80 base metal are also detected as a contributing factor. Existence of nonmetallic inclusions engulfed by <b>gas</b> <b>porosities</b> can also ease the crack propagation. Finally remedies and preventive action have been suggested to avoid formation of hot cracks...|$|R
