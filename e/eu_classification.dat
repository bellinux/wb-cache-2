A detailed system analysis of the fuel cell stack operating at an average temperature of 62 C and the surrounding balance-of-plant (BoP) are taken into account. The gas processing section and the heat recovery system were also designed and optimized in term of heat recovery. Low-grade waste heat, mainly recovered from the PEM stack and the burner exhaust, has been found suitable for feeding a low-temperature thermal user such a radiant floor heating system (operating at ∼ 35 - 45 C). According to this configuration, the heat-exchanger network has been optimized following the pinch analysis methodology, and the floor heating system has been sized accordingly. The micro-cogeneration system has been modelled in term of mass and energy balances while efficiency maps were obtained for a varying fuel utilization and current density of the stack. The maximum electrical efficiency achieved is around 36 % (AC, LHV), with a stack current of 30 A and a Fuel Utilization (FU) of 80 %. The global efficiency (that includes also heat recovery toward the thermal utility) is above 75 % for same stack operating conditions.

The results show that there is empirical evidence to support our main hypotheses: even when controlling for variables that reflect standard coalition theories and for patterns of party competition on the national sphere, we find that coalitions are more likely to form if the respective parties are also part of the government in the regions that belong to the same NUTS area...|$|E

The {{goal of the}} study was to assess whether the in vitro tests would correctly predict in vivo classifications according to the <b>EU</b> <b>classification</b> scheme, “R 38 “ and “no label “ (i. e. non-irritant). 58 chemicals (25 irritants and 33 non-irritants) were tested, having been selected to give broad coverage of physico–chemical properties, and an adequate distribution of irritancy scores derived from in vivo rabbit skin irritation tests. In Phase 1, 20 of these chemicals (9 irritants and 11 nonirritants) were tested with coded identities by a single lead laboratory for each of the methods, to confirm the suitability of the protocol improvements introduced after a prevalidation phase. When cell viability (evaluated by the MTT reduction test) was used as the endpoint, the predictive ability of both EpiDerm and EPISKIN was considered sufficient to justify their progression to Phase 2, while the predictive ability of the SIFT was judged to be inadequate.

40|$|TheTh UK has {{developed}} a simple scheme to provide practical control advice to {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), to assist them in their risk assessments and risk management decisions. This scheme makes use of toxicological hazard information indicated by R-phrases assigned under the European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>classification</b> system, to assign substances to hazard bands. In the UK scheme, the allocation of substances to hazard bands according to R-phrases has taken into account three key factors: whether or not the toxicological endpoint has an identifiable dose threshold; the seriousness of the resultant health effect; and the relative exposure levels at which toxic effects occur. Based on all these considerations, R-phrases have been allocated to hazard bands within the scheme. An evaluation exercise has been undertaken, to compare the output of the scheme with established health-based occupational exposure limits, for more than 100 subst-ances. The results of this exercise demonstrate that as far as possible, the scheme recommends control strategies which should provide adequate control. This scheme is potentially a very powerful means of helping SMEs adequately control chemical health risks in the workplace. Since it utilises the EU-agreed classification system, the scheme can be applied to any substance supplied and used in the workplace and it may also be used internationally. ICrown copyright © 1998.
