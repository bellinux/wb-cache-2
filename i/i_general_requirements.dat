In chapter <b>I,</b> <b>general</b> <b>requirements</b> to be imposed on any nonlinear electrodynamics and their implementation in the electrodynamics of Born and Infeld are discussed. In chapter II, within the nonlinear electrodynamics of Born the propagation of a light wave {{in the presence of}} a homogeneous electric or magnetic field as well as the interaction of two plane light waves in vacuo are studied.

40|$|It {{is within}} the scope of {{practice}} of a Registered Nurse to administer medications that provide palliative sedation at the end of life. This may include medications classified as anesthetic agents, but not to be administered to provide an anesthetic as in A. R. S. 32 - 1661. For the purpose of this advisory opinion, palliative sedation is defined as follows: the monitored use of medications intended to provide relief of refractory symptoms but not to intentionally hasten death. A refractory symptom is one that cannot be controlled in a tolerable time frame despite use of therapies, and seems unlikely to be controlled by further therapies without excessive or intolerable acute or chronic side effects/complications. <b>I.</b> <b>GENERAL</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b> A. Written Policy and Procedure is maintained by the employer. 1. Administration of medications must be on the order of a person licensed in this state to prescribe such medications. 2. The patient must have sufficient level of nursing care to maintain sedation. 3. The agency has identified medications allowed for palliative sedation...|$|E

40|$|In {{fundamental}} physics, {{this has}} been the century of quantum mechanics and general relativity. It has also been the century of the long search for a conceptual framework capable of embracing the astonishing features of the world that have been revealed by these two ``first pieces of a conceptual revolution''. <b>I</b> discuss the <b>general</b> <b>requirements</b> on the mathematics and some specific developments towards the construction of such a framework. Examples of covariant constructions of (simple) generally relativistic quantum field theories have been obtained as topological quantum field theories, in nonperturbative zero-dimensional string theory and its higher dimensional generalizations, and as spin foam models. A canonical construction of a general relativistic quantum field theory is provided by loop quantum gravity. Remarkably, all these diverse approaches have turn out to be related, suggesting an intriguing general picture of general relativistic quantum physics.

40|$|Objective Challenges {{faced by}} academia {{are no longer}} shaped by {{information}} accessibility but rather, and perhaps surprisingly so, by availability. A {{case in point is}} the lack of information on pharmacy education in Lebanon. In an attempt to salvage the status of pharmacy education in Lebanon on the national, regional, and international educational maps, the present work highlights the legacy of pharmacy education in Lebanon, mainly in the context of educational institutions, programs, and curricula. Methods This manuscript tackles pharmacy education in Lebanon as it relates to three educational systems—French, Lebanese, and American—that were pioneered by Saint-Joseph University (USJ), the Lebanese University (LU), and the Lebanese American University (LAU), respectively. Results Although the three systems follow similar pharmacy curricula, they differ greatly in terms of the weight they place on each of the major areas of focus (<b>i.</b> e., <b>general</b> <b>requirements,</b> basic/biomedical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, clinical sciences, and pharmacy practice experiences). Conclusions The success of pharmacy education in Lebanon is attributed not only to the diverse academic systems/curricula but also to sociocultural perceptions (i. e., status and knowledge), organizational jurisprudence and licensure (i. e., Lebanese Order of Pharmacists and Lebanese Board Examination), and international recognition (i. e., Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education–accredited LAU and French government–affiliated USJ). These factors have initiated a surge of students toward pharmacy education with the positive momentum Lebanese universities have long awaited for. PublishedN/...|$|R
