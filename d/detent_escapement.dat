25|$|In 1782, Arnold {{took out}} another patent {{to protect the}} latest and most {{important}} inventions, which were potentially lucrative. Several other watchmakers, most notably Thomas Earnshaw, had started to copy Arnold's work. Around 1780, Earnshaw modifyied his <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> by mounting the detent on a spring to create the spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{the patent}} {{concerned}} the escapement—a modification of Arnold's pivoted <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> that essentially mounted the detent on a spring. The specification only shows the part of this escapement that is the method of impulse on the impulse roller.|$|E
25|$|Arnold's pivoted <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> did {{not need}} oil on acting surfaces, with the {{advantage}} {{that the rate of}} action did not deteriorate, and remained stable for long periods. At the time, only vegetable oil was available, which degraded quickly compared to modern lubricants.|$|E
5000|$|In 1748, {{he invented}} a pivoted <b>detent</b> type of <b>escapement,</b> or {{detached}} escapement, {{which makes him}} {{the inventor of the}} detent escapement: [...] "The invention of the detached escapement belongs to P. Le Roy".|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, a year later, in 1783, Earnshaw—through another watchmaker, Thomas Wright—took out {{a patent}} that {{included}} Earnshaw's pattern of integral compensation balance and spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> in the multiple specification. However, {{both of these}} were undeveloped and compared to Arnold's were of little use, the balance especially having to be redesigned.|$|E
25|$|By 1772, Arnold had {{finalized}} {{the design}} of his pocket timekeepers and started series production with a standardized movement caliper, this being around 50mm in diameter, larger than a conventional watch of the period, and showing seconds with a pivoted <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> and spiral compensation curb. However, the latter appears to have proved ineffective, {{which seems to have}} substantially slowed the rate of production.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of <b>detent</b> <b>escapement,</b> but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E
500|$|Nautical {{chronometers}} were {{of great}} importance in the 18th and 19th centuries as aids to navigation. [...] Accurate measurement of time was needed for the determination of longitude. [...] Earnshaw {{was not the first}} to make such chronometers, but {{he was one of the}} first to make them cheaply enough that they started to become essential equipment for a ship at sea. [...] By the time the Beagle set sail it was being reported in The Nautical Magazine that the price of chronometers was dropping rapidly while the same quality was being maintained. [...] Earnshaws' chronometer had a novel escapement mechanism, the spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement,</b> and a bimetallic strip for temperature compensation so that it would continue to maintain accuracy in all climates around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} debate over who invented the spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement,</b> Arnold or Earnshaw. This argument, first {{initiated}} by Earnshaw, has been continued by horological historians (such as Rupert Gould) to present day. However, the argument is irrelevant.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1777, Arnold {{redesigned}} his chronometer, {{making it}} larger {{in order to}} accommodate the new [...] "T" [...] balance that worked with his pivoted <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> and patented helical spring. The first chronometer of this pattern was signed [...] "Invenit et Fecit" [...] and given the fractional number 1 over 36, as {{it was the first of}} this new design.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, {{after much}} argument, the Board of Longitude granted Earnshaw and Arnold awards for their {{improvements}} to chronometers. Earnshaw received [...] £2500 and John Arnold's son, John Roger Arnold, received £1672. The bimetallic compensation balance and the spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> in the forms designed by Earnshaw {{have been used}} essentially universally in marine chronometers since then. For this reason, Earnshaw is also generally {{regarded as one of}} the pioneers of chronometer development.|$|E
2500|$|From a {{technical}} point of view, however, the design was entirely sound and highly accurate over long periods. Arnold evidently learned {{the lessons that}} Harrison had learned before him—using a large, quickly oscillating balance (18,000 beats per hour) with small pivots. Arnold's <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> provided minimal interference with the controlling helical balance spring, since the temperature compensation was in the balance itself. Harrison had suggested this as a prerequisite, though he never developed the idea.|$|E
2500|$|From 1772 to 1775, Arnold {{also made}} about thirty five pocket timekeepers. Not many, about ten of these, survive and none in their {{original}} form, as Arnold was constantly upgrading their specification. They appear to have originally had a pivoted <b>detent</b> <b>escapement,</b> with a steel balance and a helical balance spring. A spiral bimetallic curb acting on this spring was intended to provide the temperature compensation, but this system evidently did not work, as every watch was subsequently altered and improved by Arnold shortly afterwards. Surviving chronometers from this series include Numbers 3,29 [...] and 28.|$|E
2500|$|These {{included}} {{his balance}} designs, helical springs {{made of steel}} or gold, the spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement,</b> the overcoil balance spring, and even the layout of an Arnold dial design that Breguet incorporated into his own.

Arnold's pattern first appeared in 1783, on the enamel dials Arnold designed for his small chronometers, and the proportions and layout of their figuring is identical {{to that of the}} classic [...] "Breguet" [...] type of engine turned metal dials which appeared around 1800, and which were quite unlike anything else made in France or Switzerland at the time.|$|E

50|$|In 1780, he {{devised a}} {{modification}} to the detached chronometer escapement, the detent being {{mounted on a}} spring instead of on pivots. This spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> was patented by Thomas Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783. Whilst initially the design was crude and unsuccessful, with modifications it later became the standard form in marine chronometers, following {{the invention of the}} <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> by Pierre Le Roy in 1748.

50|$|About {{the same}} time in France, Pierre Le Roy invented in 1748 the <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> {{characteristic}} of modern chronometers.

50|$|The detent or {{chronometer}} escapement {{is considered}} the most accurate of the balance wheel escapements, and was used in marine chronometers, although some precision watches during the 18th and 19th century also used it. The early form was invented by Pierre Le Roy in 1748, who created a pivoted detent type of escapement, though this was theoretically deficient. The first effective design of <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> was invented by John Arnold around 1775, but with the detent pivoted. This escapement was modified by Thomas Earnshaw in 1780 and patented by Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783, however as depicted in the patent it was unworkable. Arnold also designed a spring <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> but, with improved design, Earnshaw's version eventually prevailed as the basic idea underwent several minor modifications {{during the last decade}} of the 18th century. The final form appeared around 1800, and this design was used until mechanical chronometers became obsolete in the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|The duplex watch {{escapement}} {{was invented}} by Robert Hooke around 1700, improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, and put in final form by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782.The early forms had two escape wheels. The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the cylinder escapement, and could equal that of the (early) lever escapement and when carefully made was {{almost as good as}} a <b>detent</b> <b>escapement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Invented around 1974 and {{patented}} in 1980 by English watchmaker George Daniels, the Co-axial escapement is {{a modification}} of the lever escapement with some features of the <b>detent</b> <b>escapement.</b> Considered {{by some to be}} one of the most significant horological advancements since the invention of the lever escapement, the co-axial escapement functions with a system of 3 pallets that separates the locking function from the impulse, avoiding the sliding friction of the lever escapement. This makes lubrication of the pallets unnecessary and thereby eliminates one of the shortcomings of the traditional lever escapement.|$|E
50|$|Pierre Le Roy (1717-1785) was a French clockmaker. He was the {{inventor}} of the <b>detent</b> <b>escapement,</b> the temperature-compensated balance and the isochronous balance spring. His developments are considered as the foundation of the modern precision clock. Le Roy was born in Paris, eldest son of Julien Le Roy, a clockmaker to Louis XV who had worked with Henry Sully, in which place Pierre Le Roy succeeded his father. He had three brothers: Julien Le Roy (1686-1759) a clockmaker and watchmaker, Julien-David Le Roy (1724-1803) an architect, and Charles Le Roy (1726-1779), a physician and Encyclopédiste.|$|E
50|$|The échappement naturel was the {{invention}} of Abraham Louis Breguet, {{one of the most}} eminent watchmakers of all time. Following the introduction of the detent chronometer escapement with a temperature compensated balance, very close rates could be achieved in marine chronometers and to a lesser degree in pocket chronometers. This achievement was due, other things being equal, to the minimal interference with the balance during unlocking and impulse. A further key advantage of this escapement was that {{there was no need for}} oil on the escapement’s working surfaces and hence no deterioration in the friction between the working surfaces as the oil aged. A drawback was that the <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> as it was used in pocket chronometers was prone to stopping as a result of motion. Most escapements are capable of being stopped by a sudden movement but the <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> gives an impulse to the balance only when it is moving in one direction. The escapement is therefore not self-starting. The lever escapement, as used in most modern mechanical watches, avoided this problem. In common with most other escapements it gave an impulse to the balance in both directions of the balance swing. This creates another problem in doing so because the introduction of a lever between the balance and the final (escape) wheel of the escapement requires lubrication on the acting surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Breguet {{realised}} {{that this}} problem (more serious {{at the time}} because of the rather poorer oils then available) could be removed {{and many of the}} advantages of the <b>detent</b> <b>escapement</b> retained if an impulse were given in both directions of the balance. In order to do this he geared two escape wheels together, one escape wheel driven by the fourth wheel of the wheel train, which in turn was geared to and drives a second escape wheel. A pivoted detent swings freely between them and locks each escape wheel in turn on a coaxial set of locking teeth.|$|E
