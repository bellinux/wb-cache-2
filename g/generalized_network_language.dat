The <b>network</b> <b>language</b> has formed a unique system of computer language library. So studying of computer language has great significance {{to the development of}} the <b>network</b> <b>language.</b> Language library capacity can’t be unlimited expansion. To enhance the computer <b>language</b> <b>network</b> function we must use correlation algorithm to simplify the computer language. In this paper, an improved method based on the <b>network</b> <b>language</b> new is proposed. We apply the neural network speech recognition model with multi hierarchy recognition technology to computer language, and put forward TEI model of computer <b>network</b> <b>language</b> identification. We use the VB program to call on the MATLAB software, successfully simplify the complex recognition process of the <b>network</b> <b>language.</b> At the same time, computer <b>network</b> <b>language</b> also has certain reference value for English language learning. It can help learners to avoid the negative effects of <b>network</b> <b>language</b> on the English language...|$|R

30|$|To better {{facilitate}} the increased needs for effective information exchange, continuing technological advances in wireless and wired communications {{and the development}} of online social networks have given rise to “generalized” network systems. The latter consist of a physical layer, i.e., a wireless medium, and a social overlay, where social encounters develop, forming combined cyber-physical, e.g., social-wireless networks, referred to as <b>generalized</b> <b>networks</b> [1]. According to [2], <b>generalized</b> <b>networks,</b> even when consisting of a physical (e.g., wireless multihop) and only one social network can significantly improve information spread. In this paper, we focus on social-wireless types of <b>generalized</b> <b>networks,</b> while other types may be straightforwardly considered.|$|R

Several applications of the <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> design problems arise in fields of telecommunications, facility and locations, transportation, energy distribution, etc. In this paper we present a new approach to the <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> design problems based on distinguishing between global connections (connections between clusters) and local connections (connections between nodes from different clusters).

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the recent emergence of <b>generalized</b> <b>networks</b> {{as a fundamental}} computer-based planning tool and demonstrates {{the power of the}} associated modeling and solution techniques when used together to solve real-world problems. The first sections of the paper give a non-technical account of how <b>generalized</b> <b>networks</b> are used to model a diversity of significant practical problems. To begin, we discuss the model structure of a <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> (GN) and provide a brief survey of applications which have been modeled as GN problems. Next we explain a somewhat newer modeling technique in which <b>generalized</b> <b>networks</b> form a major, but not the only, component of the model. The later sections give a technical exposition of the design and analysis of computer solution techniques for large-scale GN problems. They contain a study of GN solution strategies within the framework of specializations of the primal simplex method. We identify an efficient solution procedure derived from an integrated system of start, pivot, and degeneracy rules. The resulting computer code is shown, on large problems, to be at least 50 times more efficient than the LP system, APEX III...|$|R
40|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{study on}} neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> modeling (NNLM) is performed in this paper. Different architectures of basic neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> models are described and examined. A {{number of different}} improvements over basic neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> models, including importance sampling, word classes, caching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied separately, and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of every technique are evaluated. Then, the limits of neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> modeling are explored from the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of the statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed word by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network by updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any significant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge represented by neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> models is the approximate probabilistic distribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the knowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in a natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> modeling further is discussed. Comment: 20 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Behavioral {{interventions}} are effective strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. However, implementation of such strategies {{relies heavily on}} the accurate estimation of the high-risk population size. The multiplier method and <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> scale-up method were recommended to estimate the population size of those {{at high risk for}} HIV by UNAIDS/WHO in 2003 and 2010, respectively. This study aims to assess and compare the two methods for estimating the size of populations at high risk for HIV, and to provide practical guidelines and suggestions for implementing the two methods. Methods: Studies of the multiplier method used to estimate the population prevalence of {{men who have sex with}} men in China published between July 1, 2003 and July 1, 2013 were reviewed. The <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> scale-up method was applied to estimate the population prevalence of men who have sex with men in the urban district of Taiyuan, China. Results: The median of studies using the multiplier method to estimate the population prevalence of men who have sex with men in China was 4 – 8 times lower than the national level estimate. Meanwhile, the estimate of the <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> scale-up method fell within the range of national level estimate. Conclusions: When high-quality existing data are not readily available, the multiplier method frequently yields underestimated results. We thus suggest that the <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> scale-up method is preferred when sampling frames for the general population and accurate demographic information are available...|$|R
30|$|Different {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate language models from a given corpus. Recently, researchers have used different neural network architectures to estimate the language models from a given corpus using unsupervised learning neural networks capabilities. Generally, neural networks have demonstrated success compared to conventional n-gram language models. With languages that have a rich morphological system and a huge number of vocabulary words, the major trade-off with neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> models is the size of the network. This paper presents a recurrent neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> model based on the tokenization of words into three parts: the prefix, the stem, and the suffix. The proposed model is tested with the English AMI speech recognition dataset and outperforms the baseline n-gram model, the basic recurrent neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> models (RNNLM) and the GPU-based recurrent neural <b>network</b> <b>language</b> models (CUED-RNNLM) in perplexity and word error rate.

In this work, we mainly focus on the diffusion of useful information over <b>generalized</b> <b>networks</b> based on the SIS epidemic model. Our model lies between the frameworks of population dynamics and network models, since we study system state transitions while considering neighborhood relations in a node-degree sense.|$|R

The operations of matroid union, matroid partitioning, matroid intersection, and the theorem on the greedy algorithm, Rado's theorem, and Brualdi's symmetric version of Rado's theorem have been important for some of these applications. In this paper we consider the application of matroids to solve problems in network synthesis.

Three-dimensional {{images of the}} pore space are discretized using a <b>generalized</b> <b>network</b> [...] described in a companion paper ([URL] [...] that comprises pores that are divided into smaller elements called half-throats and subsequently into corners. Half-throats define the connectivity of the network at the coarsest level, connecting each pore to half-throats of its neighboring pores from their narrower ends, while corners define the connectivity of pore crevices. The corners are discretized at different levels for accurate calculation of entry pressures, fluid volumes and flow conductivities that are obtained using direct simulation of flow on the underlying image. This paper discusses the two-phase flow model {{that is used to}} compute the averaged flow properties of the <b>generalized</b> <b>network,</b> including relative permeability and capillary pressure.
