5|$|In {{imperfect}} Batesian mimicry, the mimics do {{not exactly}} resemble their models. Many reasons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> for this.|$|E
5|$|The cyst {{forms of}} a {{particular}} group of ciliates, the tintinnids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> to be affiliated to Chitinozoans.|$|E
5000|$|Coniine from hemlock {{consumed}} by quail <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as the cause, though quail resist eating hemlock. Hellebore <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{as the source}} of the toxin. [...] It <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> asserted that this evidence points to the seeds of the annual woundwort (Stachys annua) being the causal agent. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that Galeopsis ladanum seeds are not responsible.|$|R
50|$|The Bytham River <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{proposed}} as an ancient river in Pleistocene Great Britain that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> to <b>have</b> {{run through the}} English Midlands until around 450,000 years ago. Its course <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as the route taken by the first humans to visit Britain.|$|R
50|$|Association with EPHX1 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{and related}} species of macrofungi {{accumulate}} vanadium (up to 500mg/kg in dry weight). Vanadium {{is present in}} the coordination complex amavadin in fungal fruit-bodies. The biological importance of the accumulation is unknown. Toxic or peroxidase enzyme functions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} beetles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as {{suitable}} as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas and saproxylic beetles in forests <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as potential indicator species.|$|E
5|$|The grove Snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is {{regularly}} eaten by the song thrush, and its polymorphic shell patterns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as evolutionary responses to reduce predation; however, song thrushes {{may not be}} the only selective force involved.|$|E
50|$|Involvement of scabies <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|R
2500|$|An extreme gender {{imbalance}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as {{a justification}} for polyandry. For example, the selective abortion of female fetuses in India {{has led to a}} significant margin in sex ratio and, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested,</b> results in related men [...] "sharing" [...] a wife.|$|R
50|$|A {{recent example}} is the Korean spicy chicken dish dakdoritang, the naming origin of which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as a Japanese-Korean hybrid (dak(닭) means chicken in Korean, whereas dori(とり) means bird in Japanese). The refined word dakbokkeumtang (닭볶음탕) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested,</b> with some controversy.|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the Tribal Hidage remains unknown. Over the years {{different}} theories <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> for its purpose, linked {{with a range of}} dates for its creation.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} is catalysed with weak base like piperidine or pyridine. The production method {{has not changed}} since the substance was discovered by Corson and Stoughton. Other bases, solvent free methods and microwave promotion <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> to improve {{the production of the}} substance.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} real-life inspirations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> for James Bond, the fictional {{character}} created in 1953 by British author, journalist and Naval Intelligence officer Ian Fleming; Bond appeared in twelve novels and nine short stories by Fleming, {{as well as}} a number of continuation novels and twenty-six films, with seven actors playing the role of Bond.|$|E

50|$|Erythrocytes are in {{the shape}} of a biconcave disc. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that this shape is optimal for surface area, but this {{hypothesis}} <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> widely accepted. In addition, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that the biconcave shape is needed to optimise the blood's flow properties.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that signals}} {{other than those}} {{directly}} detectable in sequences may improve gene prediction. For example, the role of secondary structure {{in the identification of}} regulatory motifs <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reported. In addition, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> that RNA secondary structure prediction helps splice site prediction.|$|R
5|$|Courtier and {{journalist}} Dermot Morrah alleged {{that there was}} brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. This seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{on the grounds that}} Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf was deposed in 806 and {{according}} to a Frankish record, returned to his kingdom in 808. No record has survived of his death {{or the end of}} his reign: dates from 811 to 830 <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b> He was possibly buried at the Mercian royal monastery of Breedon on the Hill, which carries a dedication to Saint Mary and Saint Hardulph, with whom Eardwulf is identified by several historians.|$|E
5|$|No {{records of}} the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b> The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and {{is now one of}} the more popular cat breeds in the world.|$|E

5|$|Seven shorter NoL Eurostar trains {{for these}} Regional Eurostar {{services}} were built, but these services never ran. Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris {{at the time}} of growth of low-cost air travel during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against the cheaper and quicker airlines. Other reasons that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> for these services having never been run were both government policies and the disruptive privatisation of British Rail.|$|E
5|$|Since 1980, some reforms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{to improve}} the {{performance}} of official scorers. In 2001, MLB formed a scoring committee to review their performance, and by 2008 the committee was given the authority to overturn scoring decisions. This authority {{was used by the}} scoring committee three times during the 2009 season. In 2006, an academic study seemed to confirm the historical existence of a home-team bias in scoring decisions, but this measurable bias decreased after 1979.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{they are}} {{referred}} to, in Latin, as magnus rotulus pipae. Several {{sources for the}} actual idea of making the rolls as rolls <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested,</b> including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician {{who may have been}} from Sicily.|$|E

50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} Canu or Cano {{referred}} to in the Annals of Ulster is the Canu Garb named by Senchus fer n-Alban, making this Nechtan the grandson of Gartnait II, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as a son of Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata.|$|R
5|$|Teratological (developmentally abnormal) {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} {{to occur in the}} United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or virus infection <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The most {{luminous}} supernova {{ever recorded}} is ASASSN-15lh. It was first detected in June 2015 and peaked at , which is twice the bolometric luminosity {{of any other}} known supernova. However, {{the nature of this}} supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggested.</b> e.g. the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole.|$|E
