25|$|On 27 August 2012, Jane's Defence {{reported}} that Dmitry Rogozin had recently {{called for the}} bomber {{to be capable of}} <b>hypersonic</b> <b>speed</b> in order to match and better the air defenses of the United States. It is unclear whether Rogozin's comments refer to the bomber being hypersonic or to its ability to carry hypersonic air-launched missiles. In March 2013, it was {{reported that}} the selected PAK DA design would be a subsonic flying wing.|$|E
25|$|Several {{missions}} of Falcon 9 v1.1 {{were followed by}} post-mission test flights calling for the first-stage booster to execute a flip around maneuver, a boostback burn to reduce the rocket's horizontal velocity, a re-entry burn to mitigate atmospheric damage at <b>hypersonic</b> <b>speed,</b> a controlled atmospheric descent with autonomous guidance to the target and finally a landing burn to cut vertical velocity to zero just before reaching the ocean or landing pad. SpaceX announced the test program in March 2013, and their intention to continue to conduct such tests until they can return to the launch site and perform a powered landing.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s many {{aerospace}} industry observers {{believed that the}} U.S. had the technological capability to build a Mach 5 (<b>hypersonic</b> <b>speed)</b> replacement for the aging Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Detailed examinations of the U.S. defense budget claimed to have found money missing or channeled into black projects. By the mid-1990s reports surfaced of sightings of unidentified aircraft flying over California and the United Kingdom involving odd-shaped contrails, sonic booms, and related phenomena that suggested the US had developed such an aircraft. Nothing ever linked any of these observations to any program or aircraft type, but the name Aurora was often tagged on these {{as a way of}} explaining the observations.|$|E
50|$|The X-15 had a thick wedge tail {{to enable}} it to fly in a steady manner at <b>hypersonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> This {{produced}} {{a significant amount of}} drag at lower speeds; the blunt end {{at the rear of the}} X-15 could produce as much drag as an entire F-104 Starfighter. A wedge shape was used because it is more effective than the conventional tail as a stabilizing surface at <b>hypersonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> A vertical-tail area equal to 60 percent of the wing area was required to give the X-15 adequate directional stability. Wendell H. Stillwell Stability at <b>hypersonic</b> <b>speeds</b> was aided by side panels which could be extended out from the tail to increase the overall surface area, and these panels doubled as air-brakes.|$|R

2500|$|Aquaman has {{a number}} of other superhuman powers, most of which derive from {{the fact that he is}} adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of {{underwater}} environments. He has the ability to breathe underwater and possesses a superhuman physique strong enough for his lungs to work unaffected by the immense pressure and the cold temperature of the ocean depths, also making him tough enough to withstand attacks from superhuman opponents and resist machine gun fire. He also possesses superhuman strength as a result. [...] Aquaman possesses superhuman strength, but his strength is always underrated, considering the company that he keeps. Aquaman frequently displays feats of Super-Atlantean (the average Atlantean can lift/press approximately 2 tons) and Superhuman strength. While not on par with Superman and Wonder Woman, he has proven capable of leaps up to 6 miles. He threw an 8000-ton Soviet sub from the ocean floor (2.5 miles deep) to the surface and completely out of the water. [...] Aquaman and Wonder Woman both pulled a Naval Super Carrier through the ocean and onto land, They weigh at the least 70,000 tons or 140,000,000lbs. He single-handedly fights and defeats one of DC's most feared and toughest to defeat villains The Shaggy Man whose power and abilities are on par with Doomsday. He has lifted a 200-ton cruise ship completely out of the water. He has broken off a tectonic plate sending it crashing down to the ocean floor. [...] He can swim at very high speeds, capable of reaching speeds of 3,000meters per second (10,800km [...] per hour) and can swim up Niagara Falls. He also has swum to the four corners of the world gathering magic crystals needed to save the earth all within a few hours, and outswam a jet going <b>hypersonic</b> <b>speed</b> (6000mph). He can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing, granting limited sonar. Although he can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects, Aquaman grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods. However, when Batman invented Aquaman's water suit he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a [...] "dehumidifier". This weakness was later removed from continuity in 2011, establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his Atlantean heritage, but he still runs the risk of dying by dehydration within incredibly hostile environments. AC had been bestowed an ability he never showcased before gifted unto him by an old Sea Monarch, so far one of the said proclivities granted to him was the ability of unaided flight under his own power.|$|E
