5|$|Alma is {{nonetheless}} freed when her storage chamber is opened by ATC researcher {{and leader of}} Project Origin, Harlan Wade (Grant Goodeve), who felt guilty over the company's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father. The player is then called to sabotage the structure's reactor, running a gauntlet against Alma's ghosts before the whole location explodes. In {{the aftermath of the}} detonation, a Delta Force Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from the rubble, rescuing him. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Jin wonders what happened to Alma. Just then, the helicopter loses power, and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin: the destruction of the Origin facility <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> her quest to get closer to her son.|$|E
5|$|Hill was a gymnast {{early in}} life, nearly broke {{a world record}} lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to {{climbing}} at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and {{became a part of}} the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{division of}} plots from seashore to centre has not prevented the differentiation of Réunion's territory into two qualitatively distinct zones.

25|$|European {{immigration}} in Argentina <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> since this wave from Eastern Europe. According to the National Bureau of Migrations, some 14,964 Europeans have settled in Argentina (3,599 Spaniards, 1,407 Italians and 9,958 from other countries) {{during the period}} 1999–2004. To this figure, many of the 8,285 Americans and 4,453 Uruguayans may be added, since these countries have European-descended majorities of 75% and 87% in their populations.|$|E

25|$|In the past, asthma was {{generally}} considered a contraindication for diving due to theoretical concern about {{an increased risk}} for pulmonary barotrauma and decompression sickness. The conservative approach was to arbitrarily disqualify asthmatics from diving. This <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> asthmatics from diving, and experience {{in the field and}} data in the current literature do not support this dogmatic approach. Asthma has a similar prevalence in divers as in the general population.|$|E
25|$|Munch's {{refusal to}} be drawn on this topic while he lived fed {{this version of the}} story. Later {{historical}} research has conclusively shown, however, that the accusations are completely without foundation, and it has not been proven that such a meeting in Rostock even took place. Most historians classify the Rostock myth as a mere conspiracy theory. But that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> the 'Rostock myth' from surfacing with regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|Widow Jane Mine, a {{drift mine}} {{into one of}} the hillsides, is the oldest cement mine on the property. It was {{constructed}} using the room and pillar technique, where pillars of dolostone have been left to support the overlying rock. The largest of the mines, it has been likened to an underground pillared room.

25|$|With the {{redevelopment}} of the Beltline and the Downtown East Village at the forefront, efforts are underway to vastly increase {{the density of}} the inner city, but this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> the rate of sprawl. In 2012, the combined population of the downtown neighbourhoods (including the Downtown Commercial Core, the Downtown East Village, the Downtown West End, Eau Claire, Chinatown, and the Beltline) was 36,228. However, looking at all of the inner-city neighbourhoods, the combined population was 179,304.|$|E

Pakistan, for example, has reached the Grand Final twice; while the Philippines, Argentina, Peru, Greece and Israel have all reached the semi-finals.

25|$|Woodland's origins trace back to 1850 when California gained its {{statehood}} and Yolo County was established. Since {{the town}} started growing in population and resources, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped.</b> The area was well irrigated {{due to the}} efforts of James Moore, and this drew people out to try their hand at farming. The endeavor was successful as people found the soil in the area very fertile. The city gained a federal post office and the next year the county seat was moved from Washington (present day West Sacramento, California) to Woodland after Washington was flooded. The addition of a railroad line, the close proximity to Sacramento, and the more recent addition of Interstate 5, helped create a thriving city.|$|E
25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>stopped</b> exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E
