40|$|Africa?s {{regional}} centre for natural resource mapping Cue: For {{a country to}} develop, making best use of its resources is clearly essential. These will include natural resources such as water, timber and minerals {{as well as the}} skills, knowledge and labour of its people. But if natural resources are to contribute to long term development, careful planning is needed, based on accurate, detailed information including up-to-date maps. The Regional Centre for Resource Mapping for Development is an inter-government organisation based in Kenya that was set up to support responsible resource use in Africa. The organisation works at many levels, supporting government mapping departments as well as individual communities. Tesfaye Korme, one of the directors of the Centre, spoke recently to Susanna Thorp about its work. She began by asking him to explain the problems that have affected resource use in the continent, and how his Centre is helping to address them. IN:		?Africa has a lot of resources? OUT:	?should assure to the community. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Tesfaye Korme of the Regional Centre for Resource Mapping for Development talking to Susanna Thorp. Transcript Korme	Africa has a lot of resources, and we have big problem in managing our resources. First of all we don?t know how to explore resources. Once we discover resource we don?t care of environment. So we build the regional state capacities in how to protect the resource, use friendly the resource, explore the resources. Thorp	<b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> perhaps in Southern Africa for instance, where you have helped a country really look at the resources available and allowed them to incorporate that into their planning. Korme	Well in Southern Africa region we have developed the local capacity of the national authorities like mapping authority. So we generally deliver them a satellite image, give training to their people and sometimes we do field work with them. Thorp	Now, Lesotho I know is a very small country. Does Lesotho have the capacity to do the type of planning and resource management that it needs? Korme	Fortunately the natural resource mapping doesn?t need a lot of human labour; most of the works are done using computers and the satellite data. So for small country, you don?t need hundreds of people, maybe five people can correctly map and prepare decision-support tools. For Lesotho we have trained five people and they are doing very well. For Botswana we were working with them on wetland, it?s the richest wetland in Africa in terms of flora and fauna. So that wetland needs very careful protection, so we help them in mapping it, we help them how to update gradually the maps. Thorp	So a lot of training and capacity building is obviously an important part of your work, but <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of a project perhaps that you?ve done this year where you?re looking at a particular natural resource and maybe helping to document that. Korme	In southern Kenya at the border between Kenya and Tanzania, the question was raised by the Masai people. They want to know the limit of their forest and everybody comes to the forest with guns and then they cut the timber and they go away. Nobody knows that the forest belongs to the society. Unfortunately in that place there were two communities both sharing the border, so we worked out a program with the Masai and we trained the local people, we organised them in such a way the data collection using GPS is conducted by themselves. The other communities started to fight, they said ?Who gave you the right to map this boundary? They don?t have the right to ask anyone, you are not the one to do it!? So they stopped us with violent reaction, we called the local authorities, the government body, to reconcile the two communities and then they show us the real boundary of the forest. Now it is an official border, that both communities accepted and now they consider the forest as their own property. So, what we say is we involve them at grass root level. In technical data producing they need training. Otherwise if you leave the technical work to them, it is a waste of money and time, because the data that will come up will not be sufficient to produce a standard product. So to share the information you should collect standard, understandable, and quality information. Someone who can understand that map can go to that place, can invest on minerals, can invest on forests, can invest on agriculture. So we have to produce something that everyone can understand. Thorp	That?s a very good point that you?ve just made, that people can go to the Internet and access that information, and we have had several concerns raised by the participants {{over the last couple of}} days, that by working with communities and asking them to express knowledge about their areas, that actually they can be releasing information that other people can come in and exploit, so local communities can actually make themselves very vulnerable. Korme	The best solution is you expose information, you discuss how to preserve it. There are two contradictory things; one is civilisation, development, the other is maintaining the tradition, the culture. We have to compromise one to the other. They have to use their resources for development and a better life. At minimum 80 % of the profit should go back to community development. That is the policy that the government should assure to the community. End of track. Supporting mapping for sustainable management of natural resources...|$|E
40|$|Stopping slash-and-burn Cue: Slash-and-burn {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of agriculture, and in areas with low {{population}} density it can still be a sustainable way of survival. But forest land which has been cleared and cultivated needs a long time to recover; when population increases, recovery times for the land are reduced, and in time it becomes degraded and exhausted. However, changing the methods used by slash-and-burn cultivators is notoriously difficult. Many countries have found that sending in government extension officers to train in better methods simply does not work. Non-government organisations, however, have a better track record when it comes to working closely with communities. They often use a participative approach, helping people to work out their own solutions to their problems, rather than imposing solutions from the outside. One example is the Green Living Movement, an organisation which is working with the Lala people, slash-and-burn cultivators who live in a remote part of Zambia. In our next report, Emmanuel Mutamba of the Green Living Movement talks to Daniel Sikazwe about how the organisation is working with the Lala people to make their management of the forest more sustainable. IN:		?Basically the Lala people ?? OUT:		??can advise the people properly. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Emmanuel Mutamba hoping a better relationship between Zambia?s forest services and indigenous tribes in the future. Transcript Mutamba	Basically the Lala people in that area are getting most of their livelihoods from the forest, through the use of ?chitemene? which is a slash-and-burn system of agriculture, which has resurfaced after a while. During the beginning of the 1990 s, we saw the chitemene system coming back to life after the government policy changed towards agriculture. People were no longer able to get free inputs through government loans, so they reverted back to what was almost dying, the chitemene system. Now it is in full force and the threat on the forest is quite high. So this {{is one of the}} areas that we are really working towards, to help our communities start looking at sustainable management systems. Sikazwe	And these sustainable management systems, you work with the community. But then getting those people together requires some very good skills on your part. Just what are some of these specific methods that you are using to work with the community there? Mutamba	In this case we are looking at an area where people are cut off from the main areas of economic activity, so you have to really appreciate that their basic life-supporting system circles around the forest, or the natural resources. And while we are trying to help people manage their resources, we also realise that they have to use them. So we have to strike a balance at conservation and utilisation. So basically those are the systems that we are using. But we are going further. We are not just going there to train the people, we are going there to also learn about the difficulties that people are going through. Then when we start learning the difficulties that people are going through, we create a relationship, and once we create a relationship, we start understanding the intra-conflicts that exist in communities and natural resource management. You go there not as an expert, but as a partner with the people. So you give them what you have learned from school, but if it does not work, it does not work, so you revise what you have learned, you start thinking anew. Sikazwe	Can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of one method that you have had to re-do or rethink, as you have said, in the joint forest management? Mutamba	Well one of them is the thinking that the chitemene system, for instance, is bad. Just going there and saying, ?The chitemene system is bad! Stop!? is not the best approach. The best approach is that we start looking at why do we say the chitemene system is not sustainable. So we start looking at the issues like the population has increased; it means that we shall have more forest felled in a short period of time, because we are now many. The population has increased, it means that if we all go and attack the forest upstream, which means that the impact on the streams, our water, will be enormous. So you start looking at all these resultants of certain activities. So people start appreciating these issues. Sikazwe	Let me take you back a little. You talked about going to live with the community. What exactly do you mean? Mutamba	Basically what I mean there is you go and stay there, let?s say for a period of three months up to six months. Sikazwe	Do you have specific officers that do that? Mutamba	Yes we have got what we call field volunteers. Most of them have got some skills of some kind, we have had even qualified foresters staying with people in the villages. And they train them on new management systems. They also learn of what the indigenous people do to manage the forest. Then together they come up with workable programmes. Now when these volunteers, field volunteers, come out of the field, then they have quite a wealth of knowledge that they have learned themselves from their experiences. And in future we hope that if these people are sort of employed in the mainstream forest department, then we think that we will have people with the right attitudes who can advise the people properly. End of track. An NGO in Zambia has volunteers living with forest communities, in order to build up trust and work together on alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} when Swedish and English are used in English teaching and how the pupils view the importance of the classroom language for their language development. My research questions are “In what situations is Swedish and English respectively spoken during the English lessons?” and “What are the pupils' opinions concerning the significance of English and Swedish in the classroom for their language development?”. To answer my questions, I have used relevant theoretical research and conducted two observations and two group interviews in a secondary school. The observations have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of how it can function in the classroom and the interviews have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the opportunity to hear the pupils' different perspectives on how it is done in the classroom and their different opinions concerning this matter. According to the research, it is of great importance that the pupils are offered the opportunity to use the English language as much as possible in the classroom. Some researchers claim that the teacher should create a classroom environment where everybody speaks English only (Stoltz 2009, p. 145), while others argue that there is a point in speaking Swedish in some selected situations (Harmer, 2007, p. 132). According to my study, the pupils agree on that it is important that they speak as much English as possible. However, there are times when they consider the use of Swedish accepted, and that is mainly to help the understanding of English phenomena, such as grammar. In conclusion, there is a point in speaking English to a high extent in the classroom, but there may be situations where Swedish may be a valuable tool in the understanding of the English language...|$|R

40|$|This {{is a book}} on the “dark side” of {{information}} technology, as it describes how the vulnerabilities of systems and networks can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. It is important that students and practitioners understand how advanced {{the state of the art}} in exploiting vulnerabilities is, since only a deep understanding of the problem will lead to good solutions. Engebretson presents an overview of the tools a penetration tester might use to test the vulnerability of a system or network. The tools are described in some detail, mainly focusing on the syntax of commands. The interpretation of the results is described only superficially. The reader is left wondering what exactly is going on and why. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> few <b>examples</b> to illustrate this point. In several places, the book warns the penetration tester that stealth is important. However, there is no information on how stealthy the various tools are, nor is there a discussion on how to use the tools in the stealthiest manner. The book often suggests that the reader should learn about a particular topic [...] for example, Internet protocols (p. 53) : “To truly master port scanning you will need to have a solid understanding of these protocols. ” Another example is the discussion (p. 79) of the differences between bind and reverse payloads. The book provides some of the facts, but it does not explain the relevance or the underlying principles. There are no pointers to further studies, references, or even Web pages. What exactly do we have to learn? Why? Where can we find the relevant material? I have read books similar to this one, but on topics that are far from my area of expertise (for example, Nanotechnology for dummies [1]), which I found more readable because the relevance of the topic was clear, and links to further information were provided. In summary: if the reader knows little about networking and is looking for a book that will get him started on penetration testing, then this book may be useful. But it won’t get the reader anywhere near successful penetration tests, because a much better understanding of networking than the book provides will be needed. Unfortunately, the book does not even try to point readers in the right direction to becoming proficient penetration testers. 1) E. Boysen, Nanotechnology for dummiesDummies Series: Dummies Series.
