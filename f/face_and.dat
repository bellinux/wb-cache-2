5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden.

40|$|Men {{generally}} prefer feminine women’s <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices over masculine women’s <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices, {{and these}} cross-modal preferences are positively correlated. Men’s preferences for female facial and vocal femininity have typically been investigated independently by presenting soundless still images separately from audio-only vocal recordings. For {{the first time}} ever, we presented men with short video clips in which dynamic <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices were simultaneously manipulated in femininity/masculinity. Men preferred feminine men’s faces over masculine men’s <b>faces,</b> <b>and</b> preferred masculine men’s voices over feminine men’s voices. We found that men preferred feminine women’s <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices over masculine women’s <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices. Men’s attractiveness ratings of both feminine <b>and</b> masculine <b>faces</b> were increased {{by the addition of}} vocal femininity. Also, men’s attractiveness ratings of feminine and masculine voices were increased by the addition of facial femininity present in the video. Men’s preferences for vocal and facial femininity were significantly and positively correlated when stimuli were female, but not when they were male. Our findings complement other evidence for cross-modal femininity preferences among male raters, and show that preferences observed in studies using still images and/or independently presented vocal stimuli are also observed when dynamic <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices are displayed simultaneously in video format...|$|R

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain.

40|$|Converging {{evidence}} suggests that the fusiform gyrus is involved in the processing of both <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> words. We used fMRI to investigate {{the extent to which the}} representation of words <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> in this region of the brain is based on a common neural representation. In Experiment 1, a univariate analysis revealed regions in the fusiform gyrus that were only selective for <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> other regions thatwere only selective forwords. However, we also found regions that showed bothword-selective and face-selective responses, particularly in the left hemisphere. We then used a multivariate analysis to measure the pattern of response to faces andwords. Despite the overlap in regional responses,we found distinct patterns of response to both <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> words in the left and right fusiform gyrus. In Experiment 2, fMR adaptation was used to determine whether information about familiar <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> names is integrated in the fusiform gyrus. Distinct regions of the fusiform gyrus showed adaptation to either familiar faces or familiar names. However, there was no adaptation to sequences of <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> names with the same identity. Taken together, these results provide evidence for distinct, but overlapping, neural representations for words <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> in the fusiform gyrus...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate that semantic and episodic information {{is more likely to}} be retrieved from faces than voices [Damjanovic & Hanley, 2007, Memory and Cognition, 35 (6), 1205 - 1210]. Previous studies investigating this 'face advantage' over voice used famous <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices as stimuli, which induced several methodological difficulties. We present four studies aimed at further examining the differential retrieval of semantic and episodic information from <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices. Study 1 and 2 compare the retrieval of semantic and episodic information from pre-experimentally personally familiar <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices [Brédart, Barsics, & Hanley, 2009, European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 21 (7), 1013 - 1021; Barsics & Brédart, 2011, Consciousness and Cognition, 20 (2), 303 - 308]. In Study 3, an associative learning paradigm is used in order to strictly control the frequency of exposure with <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices. The recall of semantic information is subsequently assessed from <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices. In Study 4, distinctiveness impact on semantic information retrieval from <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> voices is assessed, as it could constitute a key factor underlying the face advantage over voice. All results are in line with the face advantage. These findings are discussed at the light of current models of person recognition. An account in terms of expertise is finally proposed.
