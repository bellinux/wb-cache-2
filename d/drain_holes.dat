2500|$|At {{the top of}} {{the toilet}} bowl is a rim with many angled <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> that are fed from the tank, which fill, rinse, and induce {{swirling}} in the bowl when it is flushed. Mounted above the toilet is a large holding tank with approximately [...] of water in modern designs. This tank is built with a large drain [...] diameter hole at its bottom covered by a flapper valve that allows the water to rapidly leave the holding tank. The plumbing is built to allow entry of the tankâ€™s water into the toilet in a very short period. This water pours through the holes in the rim and a siphon jet hole about [...] diameter {{in the bottom of the}} toilet. Some designs use a large hole in the front of the rim to allow faster filling of the bowl.|$|E
2500|$|The Perpendicular {{clerestory}} windows {{north and}} south are 15th-century, each with three lights, topped with cinquefoil moulded surrounds, and edged above with hood moulding. Part of a blocked roundel window, above the east bay of the south arcade, is evidence of earlier circular 10th-century clerestory windows. [...] The clerestory parapet is horizontally straight, set with a raised latticework frieze with quatrefoil moulding, and shields within the alternate central rhombus devices. Upon the parapet and between the windows are crocketed pinnacles supported by reused 15th-century grotesque corbels, below which are roof <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> The unusual pinnacle on the south-east corner of the nave is referred to by Pevsner: [...] "But what is the strange en-crusted canopy at the SE corner". This pinnacle is {{a representation of the}} arms of the Myddleton family, Fulbeck manor owners of the 15th century, and includes a Wyvern and Harpy supporting a shield containing a lion rampant, surmounted by a Saracen's head. The south porch dates from the 14th century, is gabled, with side windows and side stone benches. The {{north and south}} aisle roofs are both 19th-century. The south aisle pointed-arch east window of three lights, and the south wall's two windows of four lights, are all 14th-century, and contain trefoil heads and quatrefoils, with hood mould surrounds.|$|E
5000|$|Geologically, much of {{the area}} {{surrounding}} the lake is lava bed created {{during a period of}} volcanic activity around 1000 BCE in the Cascade Range of Oregon.Water levels on the lake change significantly over the seasons; in spring, autumn, and winter the lake is a popular fishing location, but during the summer the lake drains completely through lava tube <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> {{in the bottom of the}} lake. Open lava tubes are scattered around the region, and the nearby Fish Lake (...) is another lake with underwater <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> Over the years, locals have attempted to fill in the <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> with debris, and used heavy machinery to carve holes elsewhere in the lakebed to keep some water from draining out. A research project in 2003 inferred that the water goes through the lava tubes into Clear Lake 9.5 km southwest.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} for sills/rocker panels, is to block <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> and simply fill {{them up with}} wax and then drain most of it out (the excess can be stored and reused), leaving a complete coating inside. Anti-rust wax like phosphoric acid based rust killers/neutralizers can also be painted on already rusted areas. Loose or thick rust must be removed before anti-rust wax like Waxoyl or a similar product is used.|$|E
50|$|At {{the top of}} the scuttle or mug is a soap holder. Traditionally, it {{was used}} with a hard block of shaving soap (rather than soft soap or cream) and {{therefore}} had <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> at the bottom. Later scuttles and mugs do not include the holes, and thus can be used with creams and soft soaps. Some scuttles and mugs have concentric circles on the bottom, which retain some water thus helping to build lather.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{enrobing}} involves placing {{the items on}} the enrober's feed band, which may consist of a wire mesh or containers in which the confection to be enrobed are placed, with each container having <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> to recover excess chocolate. The enrober maintains the coating medium at a controlled constant temperature and pumps the medium into a flow pan. The medium flows from the flow pan in a continuous curtain and bottoming bed that the food items pass through, completely coating them. A wire mesh conveyor belt then transports the coated confection to a cooling area.|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional, {{unsteady}} flow of a two-layer fluid {{in a tank}} is considered. Each fluid is inviscid and flows irrotationally. The lower, denser fluid flows with constant speed out through a <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> of finite width {{in the bottom of}} the tank. The upper, lighter fluid is recharged at the top of the tank, with an input volume flux that matches the outward flux through the drain. As a result, the interface between the two fluids moves uniformly downwards, and is eventually withdrawn through the <b>drain</b> <b>hole.</b> However, waves are present at the interface, and they have a strong effect on the time at which the interface is first drawn into the drain. A linearized theory valid for small extraction rates is presented. Fully nonlinear, unsteady solutions are computed by means of a novel numerical technique based on Fourier series. For impulsive start of the drain, the nonlinear results are found to agree with the linearized theory initially, but the two theories differ markedly as the interface approaches the drain and nonlinear effects dominate. For wide drains, curvature singularities appear to form at the interface within finite time...|$|R

50|$|The only {{example of}} {{representational}} carving {{to be found}} at Ritigala {{is in the form}} of decorated urinals that consist of urine cup, <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> and foot supports. It is believed that these decorated stones were meant to depict the architectural and ritualistic excesses of the orthodox monastic chapters to which the Pamsukuilikaa (monks devoted to extreme austerity) were opposed. It is also argued that the act of urination on decorated urinal stones was for them a symbolic act of dissociation.|$|R
50|$|Sump pump {{systems are}} also {{utilized}} in industrial and commercial applications to control water table-related problems in surface soil. An artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation {{can cause the}} ground to become unstable due to water saturation. As long as the pump functions, the surface soil will remain stable. These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> throughout. They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in.|$|E
50|$|A {{limber hole}} is a drain hole through a frame or other {{structural}} {{member of a}} boat designed to prevent water from accumulating against {{one side of the}} frame, and allowing it to drain toward the bilge. Limber holes are common in the bilges of wooden boats. The term may be extended to cover <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> in floors. Limber holes are created in between bulkheads so that one compartment does not fill with water. The limber holes allow water to drain into the lowest part of the bilge {{so that it can be}} pumped out by a single bilge pump (or more usually, one electric and one manual pump).|$|E

40|$|The vortex {{is created}} in a {{cylinder}} (5 -in diameter, 15 -in high) where water flows in tangentially {{near the bottom}} and flows out at the bottom center through a <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> into a bucket. A submersible pump circulates the water. A PVC pipe is inserted in the vortex and its bottom end is positioned freely at the <b>drain</b> <b>hole.</b> This insertion breaks down the air-core vortex. As a result, more water drains out causing the water level to drop below the pipe's mid-point. The incoming flow then drags the pipe with it around the cylinder, while the pipe's bottom end remains at the <b>drain</b> <b>hole.</b> Eventually, the pipe is oriented vertically along the central axis due to radial pressure gradients (i. e., higher pressure near the cylinder wall, lower pressure near the central axis). As soon as the water level rises above the pipe, the air-core vortex is re-formed above and through the pipe. The water level keeps increasing to about 2 - 3 inches above the pipe. At this point, air-core instabilities become large enough to induce oscillations which throw the pipe's top end off center. This action destroys the air-core vortex which again increases the out flow rate, lowering the water level. Then, the above sequence is repeated; it continues {{as long as the}} incoming flow is maintained. We observed the phenomenon quite accidentally while experimenting with creation of water fountains with special effects. It appears the phenomenon has not been reported in the literature, and we would like to investigate it further. One possible application might be a source of whirling motion in kinetic sculptures. The video was presented in the APS-DFD Gallery of Fluid Motion in Salt Lake City, November 2007. This short video shows a curious cyclic phenomenon that occurs when a PVC pipe interacts with an air-core vortex, created in a cylinder with a tangential inflow and central outflow at the bottom...|$|R

50|$|Several {{types of}} recirculators are {{currently}} on the market. Effective and reasonably priced, the smaller units are composed of fractional horsepower attachments to a pot sink, which loops water through a pump {{at one end of}} the sink. All that is needed to retrofit most recirculators in the pot sink is an electrical outlet and a mechanic who will make the appropriate cutout in your sink. One manufacturer has introduced a unit that is able to recirculate, agitate and heat water using the existing <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> as the water inlet. This new unit can be installed easily and does not require any holes to be punched in the sink itself.|$|R
5000|$|Following run 13, {{an attempt}} was made to wash a fuel element in the wash cell. During the operation, an {{explosion}} occurred of sufficient magnitude to lift the shield plug out of the wash cell. It is believed the tetralin-related decomposition products caused a substantial amount of sodium to be trapped in the fuel rod elements by blocking <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> There were no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the wash-cell explosion. As a result of the explosion, no further washing of the elements was done. Measurements from within the reactor building indicated extremely high radioactivity levels throughout the building. Within several days radioactivity in the high bay had been reduced to normal levels, except for the area immediately around the wash cells.|$|E
5000|$|PepsiCo {{introduced}} the first two-liter sized soft drink bottle in 1970. The bottle {{was invented by}} {{a team led by}} Nathaniel Wyeth of DuPont, who received the patent in 1973. In 1985, a three-liter bottle appeared on supermarket shelves. The design is still used to this day by some bottlers. Most modern-day two-liter bottles are one piece of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) with a base that is molded with a radial [...] to provide strength for the bottom and the ability to stand upright. Most early two-liters had a separate opaque base glued to the hemispherical bottom of the clear PET flask. This base had a coaxial corrugation and <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> It was abolished in the 1990s, in part due to difficulties recycling the two separate plastics.|$|E
5000|$|During initial filling of the reservoir, the dam {{developed}} {{several large}} vertical cracks on the upstream side - some more than 400 ft long - {{due to the}} rapid change of water pressure from the rising reservoir.

In June 1980, the dam again experienced leakage problems when a 236 ft crack opened on its upstream face, sending more than [...] of water spraying across the downstream side of the dam. Seventy drainage holes were drilled into the crack to relieve pressure before the crack was permanently sealed by an aggregate of cement, volcanic ash and sawdust. The cost of the repair exceeded $1 million.|$|E
