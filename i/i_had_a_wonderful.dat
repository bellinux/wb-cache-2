500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS. Phelps had previously stated {{that there would be}} cast changes to the series due to monetary reasons. When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> talk when I came to Y and I think we're really quite fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E

[...] "I'd heard the stories, so I checked him out. I called Bob De Niro and Michael Mann, who'd worked with him on Heat, and they both gave him raves... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experience {{in spite of all}} the naysayers." [...] Jeffrey Katzenberg (producer of Prince of Egypt) talks about the actor: [...] "Val was one of the first people cast in The Prince of Egypt. He was there every step of the way; patient, understanding, and phenomenally generous with his time." ...|$|E

She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would be what I would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E

5000|$|After the war, Salmonì visited {{many schools}} and colleges to share his experiences. His book In the End, I Beat Hitler also recounts his experiences, {{incorporating}} elements of irony and black humour.

They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son, Kelyan Makélélé (born 2 February 2005). The couple split in early 2009.

2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.|$|E

To this he agreed, {{on behalf of his}} Grace, who needs money much, but inquired as to himself. I replied £500 for him and his jackals, including Dr. Legh, of which no account would be asked. He told me it was not enough, for after the jackals had their pickings nothing would be left for him but the bones; I, who asked so much, must offer more, and he made as though to dismiss me. At the door I turned and said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> pink pearl that he, who loved jewels, might like to see--a pink pearl worth many abbeys. He said, 'Show it;' and, oh! he gloated over it like a maid over her first love-letter. 'If there were two of these, now!' he whispered.|$|E
60|$|We became engaged, as I have told; {{we broke}} {{it off and}} joined again. We went through a {{succession}} of such phases. We had no sort of idea {{what was wrong with}} us. Presently we were formally engaged. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> interview with her father, in which he was stupendously grave and H--less, wanted to know about my origins and was tolerant (exasperatingly tolerant) because my mother was a servant, and afterwards her mother took to kissing me, and I bought a ring. But the speechless aunt, I gathered, didn't approve--having doubts of my religiosity. Whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days; and to begin with, every such separation was a relief. And then I would want her; a restless longing would come upon me. I would think of the flow of her arms, of the soft, gracious bend of her body. I would lie awake or dream of a transfigured Marion of light and fire. It was indeed Dame Nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid, inexorable way; but I thought it was the need of Marion that troubled me. So I always went back to Marion at last and made it up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us, and more and more I urged her to marry me....|$|E

For long I had not the courage to tell him I came {{to bring him back}} East. I kept putting it off. And I rode, I climbed, I camped, I lived outdoors. At first it nearly killed me. Then it grew bearable, and easier, until I forgot. I wouldn't be honest if I didn't admit now that somehow <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> time, in spite of all.... Glenn's business is raising hogs. He has a hog ranch. Doesn't it sound sordid? But things are not always what they sound--or seem. Glenn is absorbed in his work. I hated it--I expected to ridicule it. But I ended by infinitely respecting him. I learned through his hog-raising the real nobility of work.... Well, at last I found courage to ask him when he was coming back to New York. He said 'never!'... I realized then my blindness, my selfishness. I could not be his wife and live there. I could not. I was too small, too miserable, too comfort-loving--too spoiled. And all the time he knew this--knew I'd never be big enough to marry him.... That broke my heart. I left him free--and here I am.... I beg you--don't ask me any more--and never to mention it to me--so I can forget." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was one Sunday I {{walked with}} brother Marlowe, {{who was an}} aged man, {{one of the local}} preachers, all the way to Hetton-Deeps--that's a village where the people get their living by working in the lead-mines, and where there's no church nor preacher, but they live like sheep without a shepherd. It's better than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we set out early in the morning, for it was summertime; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where there's no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look smaller, but you see the heavens {{stretched}} out like a tent, and you feel the everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton, brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling, for he overworked himself sadly, at his years, in watching and praying, and walking so many miles to speak the Word, as well as carrying on his trade of linen-weaving. And {{when we got to the}} village, the people were expecting him, for he'd appointed the time and the place when he was there before, and such of them as cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest, so as others might be drawn to come. But he felt as he couldn't stand up to preach, and he was forced to lie down in the first of the cottages we came to. So I went to tell the people, thinking we'd go into one of the houses, and I would read and pray with them. But as I passed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors, and the hard looks of the men, who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky, I felt a great movement in my soul, and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit entering into my weak body. And I went to where the little flock of people was gathered together, and stepped on the low wall that was built against the green hillside, and I spoke the words that were given to me abundantly. And they all came round me out of all the cottages, and many wept over their sins, and have since been joined to the Lord. That was the beginning of my preaching, sir, and I've preached ever since." ...|$|E
