And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ja’far’s widow Asma recalled: “God’s Messenger {{came to me}} and asked, ‘Where are Jafar’s children?’ I {{brought them}} to him and he embraced them and smelled them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. ‘O God’s Messenger,’ I asked, ‘Have you heard {{something}} about Jafar?’ ‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘He was killed today.’ <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{travelers}} {{described what}} they saw during the attack to reporters. One man stated, [...] "We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 meters away from him." [...] He continued, [...] "We ducked behind a ticket counter but <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting." [...] Lastly he said [...] "He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously {{to see if anyone}} was going to stop him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first few}} seconds {{are the most}} crucial and {{controversial}} of the disaster. Survivors insist that a female official immediately stood up and shouted: [...] "Students sit down; don’t move. Let the leaders walk out first (...) [...] " [...] (Note: In Chinese, the order: 让领导先走 has since became a popular internet catch phrase, meaning the government officials have priority over ordinary folks in times of emergency). She has since been identified in online articles as Kuang Li (况丽), who was vice-director of the state petroleum company’s local education centre, though {{there has been no}} official confirmation of this. [...] The teachers obeyed, and the children remain seated. [...] By the time the about 20 Communist Party officials had filed out through the only opened emergency exit, when all the other exits remained locked, it was too late. Teachers hurried the pupils out of their seats to other exits, only to find that the emergency exit doors were locked, and no one seem to care enough to get them opened. [...] Parents and survivors alleged that Kuang took refuge in a ladies’ cloakroom that could have sheltered 30 people and barred the doors behind her. [...] A 10-year-old boy said [...] "My teacher asked me to run out of the theatre, but when <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> the hall was smothered in smoke and fire. The power then cut out. People could see nothing. The place was full of crying and shouting." ...|$|E
