5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy <b>javelins)</b> and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as <b>javelins</b> and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two <b>javelins</b> and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, <b>javelins</b> and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E

50|$|The size, shape, minimum weight, {{and center}} of gravity of the <b>javelin</b> are all defined by IAAF rules. In {{international}} competition, men throw a <b>javelin</b> between 2.6 and 2.7 m in length and 800 g in weight, and women throw a <b>javelin</b> between 2.2 and 2.3 m in length and 600 g in weight. The <b>javelin</b> has a grip, about 150 mm wide, made of cord and located at the javelin's {{center of gravity}} (0.9 to 1.06 m from the <b>javelin</b> tip for the men's <b>javelin</b> and 0.8 to 0.92 m from the <b>javelin</b> tip for the women's <b>javelin).</b>|$|R
5|$|Velites {{were first}} used, and created, at {{the siege of}} Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of {{citizens}} who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower. They were trained to ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal to fling <b>javelins</b> at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with <b>javelins</b> before the battle began in earnest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Javelins</b> were {{transferred}} {{away from the}} route shortly prior to Stagecoach's sale of the operation to Transdev, and the service was briefly operated with 15-year-old Leyland Olympians.

5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting. Later, Julius Caesar, invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC, noted British charioteers throwing <b>javelins,</b> then leaving their chariots to fight on foot.|$|E

50|$|In the Soviet, period {{there were}} many great Latvian <b>javelin</b> throwers. <b>Javelin</b> thrower Inese Jaunzeme became first Latvian who won Olympic Games she did it in 1956 Olympics. In 1960 Summer Olympics gold medal won another <b>javelin</b> thrower Elvīra Ozoliņa. Latvian <b>javelin</b> thrower Jānis Lūsis won 1968 Summer Olympics also he is 4 time European champion. Lūsis set two world records in <b>javelin</b> throw, 91.68 m in 1968 and of 93.80 m in 1972. In 1987, IAAF {{nominated}} him as the all-time greatest <b>javelin</b> thrower in the world.

5|$|Gillan's {{first attempt}} at a band was called Garth Rockett and the Moonshiners, and {{consisted}} of himself on vocals and drums, alongside guitarist Chris Aylmer, who later went on to work with Bruce Dickinson. The band covered songs such as Tommy Roe's Sheila and The Shadows' Apache. He discovered he couldn't sing and play drums at the same time, so settled {{on the role of}} lead vocalist, performing regularly at St Dunstan's Hall, the local youth club. He soon switched to another local band who also played at Dunstan's Hall, Ronnie and the Hightones, who renamed themselves as the <b>Javelins</b> after he joined. The band played covers of Sonny Boy Williamson, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard, and were early customers of then-local music shop owner Jim Marshall. The <b>Javelins</b> disbanded in March 1964, with guitarist Gordon Fairminer leaving to join what eventually became the group Sweet.|$|E
5|$|Pitched battles were {{conducted}} in a similar fashion: the velites would gather at the front and fling <b>javelins</b> to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The Athenian {{commanders in}} Corinth, Iphicrates, who {{commanded}} the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, saw that an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry, {{and decided to}} take advantage of this fact. Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth, while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit, flinging <b>javelins</b> at the Spartan hoplites.|$|E

50|$|The <b>javelin</b> {{was part}} of the pentathlon of the Ancient Olympic Games {{beginning}} in 708 BC in two disciplines, distance and target throw. The <b>javelin</b> was thrown {{with the aid of a}} thong, called ankyle wound around the middle of the shaft. Athletes would hold the <b>javelin</b> by the thong and when the <b>javelin</b> was released this thong unwound giving the <b>javelin</b> a spiraled flight.|$|R
5|$|The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first <b>javelins</b> were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and {{the increasing number of}} horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such <b>javelins</b> were removed from the record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E
5|$|The light {{infantry}} of 1,200 velites {{consisted of}} unarmoured skirmishing troops {{drawn from the}} youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and buckler (90cm (3ft) diameter), {{as well as several}} light <b>javelins,</b> each with a 90cm (3ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c.25cm (10in) narrow metal point. Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular rorarii.|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were the}} {{youngest}} and usually the poorest (being 5th class citizens, with property worth 4002,500 denarii) soldiers in the legion, and could rarely afford much equipment. They were armed with veretum, light <b>javelins,</b> each with a 90 cm (3 ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c. 10 in (25 cm) narrow metal point, and tips designed to bend on impact to prevent them being thrown back, similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries. Livy says that they each carried seven <b>javelins,</b> however Roman satirist Lucilius says that they carried five, suggesting that the amount may have changed.They also carried darts, 30 in long, which also had a tip {{that was designed to}} bend on impact. The hastati and principes carried gladii, relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres (29 inches) in length, as their main weapons, and the velites carried them as backup weapons. They fought in a very loose, staggered formation like most irregular troops, and carried small round shields called parma, 90cm (3feet) in diameter.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy <b>javelins</b> that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E

In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation, Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson, the most elite Antigonid-period {{infantry}} were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai <b>javelins,</b> swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men. They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides (bronze shield) and leukaspides (white shield) regiments.|$|E
