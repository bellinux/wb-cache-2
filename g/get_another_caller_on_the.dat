50|$|PC Choice Chatâ€”PC {{has his own}} {{radio talk}} show called PC Choice Chat, and people begin to call in asking for advice on which {{computer}} to get. All the callers ask for advice on a computer that would qualify as a Mac but not as a PC. One caller asks for a computer for people who hate <b>getting</b> viruses, <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> asks for PC help like Mac Geniuses, and a third caller wants to switch to Mac altogether. PC ignores these calls.|$|R

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>caller</b> {{claimed the}} plane had been downed by Mossad, the Israeli {{intelligence}} service.|$|R
50|$|Most {{directory}} assistance systems use automated readback systems {{to give out}} the phone number. This frees the {{directory assistance}} operator to move <b>on</b> to <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> {{as soon as the}} correct listing is located.|$|R
50|$|Busy line interrupt, {{also known}} as {{emergency}} breakthrough, is a function on land line telephones that allows a caller to interrupt a phone conversation of <b>another</b> <b>caller,</b> especially one {{who does not have}} call waiting.|$|R
60|$|When they {{returned}} from lunch, and reentered the outer office, Pugsy Maloney, raising {{his eyes for}} a moment from his book, met them with the information that <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> had arrived and was waiting in the inner room.|$|R
50|$|One More - Callers {{must try}} guess the top answer in a top ten list. However, a caller can still win {{with a lower}} answer than number 1 as long as <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> does not guess an answer higher on the list.|$|R
60|$|With a {{friendly}} nod of his head, the skeleton hurried away to reassure {{his wife that}} he was safe and well; and before he had hardly disappeared within the tent Toby had <b>another</b> <b>caller,</b> who {{was none other than}} his old friend Old Ben, the driver.|$|R

60|$|Late that {{afternoon}} <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> thundered {{at the door}} of the house in Berkeley Square. The Duke of Westerham desired to see Miss Le Mesurier. The butler was respectful but doubtful. Miss Le Mesurier had just arrived from a journey and was lying down. The Duke, however, was insistent. He waited twenty minutes in a small back morning-room and presently Jeanne came in to him.|$|R
5000|$|Calls into to shamelessly {{promote his}} band, Dead for a Ducat. Band member Keegan is <b>another</b> {{frequent}} <b>caller.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 30 April, several callers {{speaking}} to journalists reported heavy shelling of residential areas. One caller said the shelling likely {{came from the}} Air Force academy. <b>Another</b> <b>caller</b> counted over 50 explosions. Misrata came under renewed attack {{late at night and}} {{in the early hours of}} the following morning. Gaddafi's troops were seen for the first time wearing gas masks, leading to speculation that they were preparing to use chemical weapons.|$|R
5000|$|Up {{until the}} phone lines were {{connected}} directly to Penn's house {{there would be a}} significant delay between the time Penn said the caller's name and when the caller would respond, this would sometimes result in the caller being dropped just after they said hello. There was also many times when the caller would be dropped completely and Penn would have to pick <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> from the list.|$|R
50|$|Call Queue - A {{directory}} {{similar to}} a Hunt Group that keeps the <b>caller</b> <b>on</b> hold until one of the destination numbers becomes available.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps I exaggerate. Love, {{living or}} dying, {{even if it}} is not blind, cannot, I suppose, focus objects very precisely. It sees only itself or disillusionment. Whether or not, the duel was interrupted. In the full light of the window, Fanny turned softly {{at the opening of the}} door. Marvell was announcing <b>another</b> <b>caller.</b> At his name my heart leapt up like William Wordsworth's at the rainbow. It was Sir Walter Pollacke.|$|R

60|$|The Honourable Hilary had had <b>another</b> <b>caller</b> {{that morning}} besides Dr. Harmon,--no less a personage than the {{president}} of the Northeastern Railroads himself, who had driven down from Fairview immediately after breakfast. Austen having gone to the station, Dr. Tredway had received Mr. Flint in the darkened hall, and had promised to telephone to Fairview the verdict of the specialist. At present Dr. Tredway did not think it wise to inform Hilary of Mr. Flint's visit--not, at least, until after the examination.|$|R

60|$|Miss Mackenzie {{had been}} three weeks at Littlebath {{when the day}} arrived on which she {{was to go to}} Mrs Stumfold's party, and up to that time she had not enjoyed much of the society of that very social place. Indeed, in these pages have been {{described}} with accuracy all the advancement which she had made in that direction. She had indeed returned Miss Todd's call, but had not found that lady at home. In doing this she had almost felt herself to be guilty of treason against the new allegiance which she seemed to have taken upon herself in accepting Mrs Stumfold's invitation; and she had done it at last not from any firm resolve of which she might have been proud, but had been driven to it by ennui, and by the easy temptation of Miss Todd's neighbouring door. She had, therefore, slipped out, and finding her wicked friend to be not at home, had hurried back again. She had, however, committed herself to a card, and she knew that Mrs Stumfold would hear of it through Miss Baker. Miss Baker's visit she had not returned, being in doubt where Miss Baker lived, being terribly in doubt also whether the Median rules of fashion demanded of her that she should return the call of a lady who had simply come to her with <b>another</b> <b>caller.</b> Her hesitation <b>on</b> this subject had been much, and her vacillations many, but she had thought it safer to abstain. For the last day or two she had been expecting the return of Mr Rubb, junior--keeping herself a prisoner, I fear, during the best hours of the day, so that she might be there to receive him when he did come; but though she had so acted, she had quite resolved to be very cold with him, and very cautious, and had been desirous of seeing him solely with a view to the mercantile necessities of her position. It behoved her certainly to attend to business when business came in her way, and therefore she would take care to be at home when Mr Rubb should call.|$|R
50|$|Carl makes a cameo {{appearance}} in the video game Grand Theft Auto V, as an angry <b>caller</b> <b>on</b> the in-game radio station FlyLo FM. Carl has appeared in promotional videos for KFC and Carl's Jr.. Carl has appeared in a Slim Jim commercial.|$|R

5000|$|On 26 March 2013, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama {{expressed}} {{opposition to}} the idea of same-sex marriage. Answering a question raised by a <b>caller</b> <b>on</b> a radio talk-back programme, he stated that same-sex marriage [...] "will not be allowed because it is against religious beliefs".|$|R
60|$|Mr. Helstone {{was about}} to add to this speech some half-jesting, half-serious {{warnings}} to Miss Keeldar {{on the subject of}} her rumoured partiality for her talented tenant, when a ring at the door, announcing <b>another</b> <b>caller,</b> checked his raillery; and as that other caller appeared {{in the form of a}} white-haired elderly gentleman, with a rather truculent countenance and disdainful eye--in short, our old acquaintance, and the rector's old enemy, Mr. Yorke--the priest and Levite seized his hat, and with the briefest of adieus to Miss Keeldar and the sternest of nods to her guest took an abrupt leave.|$|R
50|$|Even the {{listeners}} at home could take part: while at {{first there was}} {{no easy way to}} get <b>callers</b> <b>on</b> the air, by 1936, NBC engineers had designed a method for letting listeners call in from remote locations where they had gathered to listen to the show.|$|R
