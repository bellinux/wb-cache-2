After <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E

Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and do you do it? Well I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth as long as I could hold a tone. When you play you must let only the amount of air pass the lips that is needed to produce the tone—no more. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on this and now I can play an air or an allegro exercise as long as I can hold a tone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scarry {{borrowed}} Paul Brown's coaching techniques at Western Reserve, instituting well-organized practices there. [...] "I {{had a lot}} {{of ideas}} about coaching before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for the Browns," [...] he said in 1947. [...] "But the manner in which Paul organized his practice and all his duties impressed me. I try to do the same here." [...] With no good passer or runner and a lack of depth, Reserve's Red Cats performed poorly in Scarry's first season, but he was praised for making the most out of a thin squad. In his second year in 1949, the Red Cats improved to a 4–5–1 record, and Scarry was expected to stay on for a third season. The following year, however, he resigned to take an assistant coaching position at Santa Clara University in California under former Browns assistant Dick Gallagher.|$|E
