From 7 a.m. to past midnight every day for three weeks, Shuying looked across the island for her daughter. The police, including a Criminal Investigation Department team, conducted an intensive search for the girl, and police officers carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds. Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library, a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons, distributed over 70,000 leaflets appealing for information. Two Singaporeans offered rewards of S$10,000 and S$5,000 for finding Huang Na, while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip-offs. The search even extended to Malaysia, with volunteers putting up posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.|$|E

He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a <b>denim</b> <b>jacket.</b> He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E

In [...] "cue card", Lennon wears a flower-pattern shirt under a <b>denim</b> <b>jacket,</b> while Ono holds up a series of cryptically worded cue cards, the messages on which include [...] "Smile", [...] "Hope" [...] and [...] "Peace", as she speaks into a microphone. Although Ono appears to have a more active role, she is again blindfolded and the words she speaks cannot be heard. Rodriguez describes both clips as [...] "terrifically engaging, providing suitably dynamic visuals to a powerful song", yet he considers that the [...] "cue card" [...] performance [...] "captures much more of the ambience, with frequent shots of White's stellar work and the studio dancers".|$|E

When the bridge kicks in, the images flicker to a party scene on a rooftop with lots of people enjoying themselves. The finger then re-appears and clicks on the scroll bar, which appears on screen as if to rewind the clip and the original scene of Rowland alone on the rooftop plays as the music fades.|$|E
