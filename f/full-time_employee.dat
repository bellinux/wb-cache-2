25|$|In 1934, at {{the behest}} of the American Federation of Labor, Senator Robert F. Wagner began work on a bill that would have banned the {{replacement}} of striking workers. The bill was strongly opposed by the National Association of Manufacturers and other employer groups, which argued that the bill would permanently deprive replacement workers of the right to join a union, participate in a union, or become a <b>full-time</b> <b>employee.</b> Many of Sen. Wagner's legal and labor advisors also made the same arguments. The National Urban League also opposed the bill as since many AFL unions discriminated against African American workers, who were often employed as strikebreakers. The League felt the bill would be racially discriminatory and hinder the League's efforts to open union membership to all.|$|E

500|$|Until the 1990s, the Act and its {{application}} to medical residents were not an issue. Many hospitals assessed and paid FICA taxes {{on behalf of their}} employees. The University of Minnesota's hospitals did not, however, and in the early 1990s, the Social Security Administration sued to recover a small portion of those taxes. An initial administrative review ruled for the Social Security Administration, but the district court reversed. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision after granting a de novo review, and the University recovered $40 million. A number of other residency programs quickly filed lawsuits, attempting to recoup the taxes they had paid. After some of those programs were successful in other circuit courts, the Treasury agreed to repay the taxes it had collected. However, it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in April 2005 that stated that any <b>full-time</b> <b>employee,</b> which includes nearly all medical residents, were ineligible to receive the student exemption, clearly stating that it was doing so to [...] "overturn court rulings that had upheld the view that residents remained students".|$|E
