50|$|The first {{generation}} of MMP inhibitors {{were based on the}} structure of the collagen molecule. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme. The first MMP inhibitors that were tested in patients were <b>Ilomastat</b> and Batimastat, hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors. However, neither compound showed good oral bioavailability.Thus far, Periostat (active ingredient is doxycycline hyclate) is the only MMP inhibitor that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used for the treatment of periodontitis. Other MMP inhibitors have exhibited serious side effects during preclinical trials. These side effects are caused by insufficient selectivity. Most MMP inhibitors are unable to target specific MMPs connected to specific pathological conditions. Instead, they inhibit multiple MMPs, some of which have protective functions or are not related to pathology.MMPs have been regarded as promising targets for cancer therapy. Preclinical studies investigating the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were encouraging. Following these results, clinical studies were conducted but turned out to be disappointing. Recent studies have shown that MMPs may even have paradoxical roles in tumor progression. MMPs seem to have tumor-promoting effects as well as tumor suppressive effects dependent on different contexts.|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{inhibition}} of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) is a promising target for acute cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Therefore, here we investigated if the MMP inhibitor <b>ilomastat</b> administered either before ischemia or before reperfusion {{is able to}} reduce infarct size via {{inhibition of}} MMP- 2, the most abundant MMP in the rat heart. Infarct-size limiting effect of <b>ilomastat</b> (0. 3 – 6. 0 μmol/kg) was tested in an in vivo rat model of myocardial infarction induced by 30 min coronary occlusion/ 120 min reperfusion. <b>Ilomastat</b> at 0. 75 and 1. 5 μmol/kg decreased infarct size significantly {{as compared to the}} vehicle-treated (dimethyl sulfoxide) group (from 66. 1 ± 4. 6...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{tension and}} {{contracture}} are two related facets of tissue biology. This study assessed {{the effect of}} <b>ilomastat,</b> a broad-spectrum matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor, on generation of tension by Dupuytren’s disease fibroblasts. Nodule and cord-derived fibroblasts were isolated from five patients with Dupuytren’s disease; flexor retinaculum acted as the control. A culture force monitor (CFM) provided an in vitro model of tissue organization to assess development of mechanical tension, lattice contraction and spatial remodelling by fibroblasts. Responses to <b>ilomastat</b> were compared to treatment with a control peptide. Nodule and cord-derived fibroblasts exhibited a two-fold increase in tension compared with flexor retinaculum. <b>Ilomastat</b> significantly inhibited development of tension by nodule and cord but not flexor retinaculum derived fibroblasts at 100 mM. These results imply that MMP activity mediates regulation of tensile strength by Dupuytren’s disease fibroblasts and {{may be an important}} therapeutic target in patients with Dupuytren’s disease...|$|E
40|$|Lethal toxin, {{produced}} by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is {{a major contributor to}} morbidity and mortality in animals and humans who have contracted anthrax. One component of this toxin, lethal factor (LF), proteolytically inactivates members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK or MEK) family. In this study we show that CMT- 300, CMT- 308, and <b>Ilomastat,</b> agents initially characterized as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors which are in early stages of development as pharmaceuticals, effectively inhibit the zinc metalloproteinase activity of LF. All three inhibitors, CMT- 300, CMT- 308, and <b>Ilomastat,</b> inhibit LF-mediated cleavage of a synthetic peptide substrate based on the N-terminal domain of MEKs. Inhibition of LF-mediated MEK proteolysis by all three agents was also achieved using lysates of the human monocytoid line MonoMac 6 as sources of MAPKKs and visualization of the extent of cleavage after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by detection by Western blotting. Finally, we have demonstrated inhibition of intracellular MEKs in viable human monocytes and MonoMac 6 cells by these agents after incubation of the cells with a reconstituted preparation of recombinant lethal toxin. All three agents are effective inhibitors when incubated with LF prior to exposure to cells, while the CMTs, but not <b>Ilomastat,</b> are also effective when added after LF has already entered the viable cell targets. These results offer promise for strategies to combat effects of the lethal toxin of B. anthracis...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the protective effects of <b>ilomastat,</b> an exogenous matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, on trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNB) -induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into model group, protective groups A and B, and normal control group. Rats {{in the model}} group received only intra-colonic TNB. Rats in the protective groups A and B received intra-peritoneal <b>ilomastat</b> of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively, beside TNB. Rats in the normal control group received only intra-colonic normal saline. After 3 wk, segments of colon were obtained. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were {{used to examine the}} expression of MMP- 1 and TIMP- 1. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used for pathological study. RESULTS: The model of UC was successfully induced in rats. Inflammation of colonic mucosa greatly improved in protective groups A and B. Expression of MMP- 1 and TIMP- 1 in the model group, protective groups A and B was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (P < 0. 0001) with MMP- 1 expression increased more significantly than TIMP- 1 expression. Expression of MMP- 1 in protective groups A and B was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0. 0001). Expression of MMP- 1 in protective group B was significantly lower than that in protective group A (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: <b>Ilomastat</b> improves TNB-induced UC in rats by inhibiting the MMP- 1 activity...|$|E
40|$|Development of the {{embryonic}} kidney {{results from}} reciprocal signaling between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme. To identify the signaling molecules, we developed an assay in which metanephric mesenchymes are rescued from apoptosis by factors secreted from ureteric bud cells (UB cells). Purification and sequencing {{of one such}} factor identified the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2 (TIMP- 2) as a metanephric mesenchymal growth factor. Growth activity was unlikely due to TIMP- 2 inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases because <b>ilomastat,</b> a synthetic inhibitor of these enzymes, had no mesenchymal growth action. TIMP- 2 was also involved in morphogenesis of the ureteric bud, inhibiting its branching and changing the deposition of its basement membrane; these effects were due to TIMP- 2 inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, as they were reproduced by <b>ilomastat.</b> Thus, TIMP- 2 regulates kidney development by at least 2 distinct mechanisms. In addition, TIMP- 2 was secreted from UB cells by mesenchymal factors that are essential for ureteric bud development. Hence, the mesenchyme synchronizes its own growth with ureteric morphogenesis by stimulating the secretion of TIMP- 2 from the ureteric bud...|$|E
40|$|Modulation of {{wound healing}} is {{required}} to inhibit scar formation after trabeculectomy. Mitomycin C and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) are the anti-proliferative drugs currently used in the clinic. Their effectiveness is limited due to their toxicity and suboptimal local tissue pharmacokinetics caused by rapid clearance within the subconjunctival space. Therefore, prolonged release of anti-scarring agents is needed. <b>Ilomastat</b> is a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor that {{has been shown to}} moderate favorably the wound healing response after surgery. However, due to rapid local tissue clearance, several injections are necessary in a clinically relevant animal model. The thesis describes the development and investigation of implantable ocular tablets for wound healing modulation after trabeculectomy. A tablet would be placed in the subconjunctival space called a bleb, which is caused by the outflow through the fistula made during surgery. While the bleb volume varies, the tablet is thought to dissolve in non-sink conditions. Tablet dissolution was evaluated in vitro using a flow chamber that mimics the liquid outflow conditions of the bleb. The in vitro release studies suggest that tablet dissolution would act to prolong drug release in comparison with injections. Tablet dissolution in the subconjunctival space is affected by many factors including the physical/chemical properties of the drug and tablet, temperature, the volume and flow rate of the dissolution media, and the surface area of the tablet. The efficacy of an excipient-free <b>ilomastat</b> tablet was evaluated using a clinically validated rabbit model. The tablet dissolution was examined using molecular dynamics simulations to consider the molecular interactions of <b>ilomastat</b> and 5 -FU undergoing dissolution in non-sink conditions. A mathematical model was also developed to describe the dissolution of excipient-free tablets in the non-sink conditions with 94...|$|E
40|$|Small tablets for {{implantation}} {{into the}} sub-conjunctival {{space in the}} eye are being developed to inhibit scarring after glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS). There {{is a need to}} evaluate drug dissolution at the molecular level to determine how chemical structure of the active may correlate with dissolution in the non-sink conditions of the conjunctival space. We conducted molecular dynamics simulations to study the dissolution process of tablets derived from two drugs that can inhibit fibrosis after GFS, 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (MMPi), <b>ilomastat.</b> The dissolution was simulated in the presence of simple point charge (SPC) water molecules, and the liquid turnover of the aqueous humor in the subconjunctival space was simulated by removal of the dissolved drug molecules at regular intervals and replacement by new water molecules. At the end of the simulation, the total molecular solvent accessible surface area of 5 -FU tablets increased by 60 times more than that of <b>ilomastat</b> as a result of tablet swelling and release of molecules into solution. The tablet dissolution pattern shown in our molecular dynamic simulations tends to correlate with experimental release profiles. This work indicates that a series of molecular dynamics simulations can be used to predict the influence of the molecular properties of a drug on its dissolution profile, and could be useful during preformulation where sufficient amounts of the drug are not always available to perform dissolution studies...|$|E

Quantitative competitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (QCRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to quantify mRNA and protein respectively for MMP- 1,- 2, and- 3 by fibroblasts during lattice contraction.

Thirty-two New Zealand White rabbits (eight rabbits per group) underwent GFS {{in the left}} eye. Group 1 received a perioperative injection of both Saratin and Bevacizumab, and later, subconjuctival injections of <b>Ilomastat</b> on days 8 and 15. Group 2 received only Saratin perioperatively, and also received <b>Ilomastat</b> injections on days 8 and 15. Group 3, the negative control, received a single perioperative injection of Balanced Saline Solution (BSS) along with post-operative BSS injections on days 8 and 15. Group 4, the positive control, received topical treatment with Mitomycin-C (MMC) {{at the time of}} surgery with no further treatment. Blebs were evaluated by an observer masked to treatment every third day. Histology was obtained on two eyes in each group on post-op day twelve as well as all eyes following bleb failure. Eyes in group 1 had a mean bleb survival time of 29 ± 2. 7 days, whereas those in group 2 that received the experimental treatment without Bevacizumab had a mean survival time of 25. 5 ± 2. 7 days. An ANOVA test showed that the Saratin/Ilomastat/Bevacizumab group demonstrated a significant prolongation of bleb survival compared to the BSS control-mean survival time of 19. 7 ± 2. 7 days-(p = 0. 0252) and was not significantly different from the MMC positive control group (p = 0. 4238) -mean survival time of 32. 5 ± 3. 3. From tissue histology at day 12, the four different groups showed marked differences in the cellularity and capsule fibrosis. The MMC eyes showed minimal cellularity, were avascular and had minimal fibrous tissue. BSS group showed high cellularity, moderate to high fibrosis, and thicker and more defined capsules than either of the treatment groups and the positive control. Both the Saratin/Ilomastat/Bevacizumab and Saratin/Ilomastat only eyes showed moderate cellularity with minimal fibrosis, with less cellularity and fibrosis present in the triple treatment group. Sequential therapy with multiple agents, including Bevacizumab, prolonged bleb function following GFS in the rabbit model and were significantly better than the negative BSS control. The experimental group did not show the same surface tissue histological thinning and side effects associated with MMC treatment...|$|E

To {{investigate}} the potential regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), {{and to identify}} individual MMPs essential for migration of human corneal epithelial cells. METHODS. Migration of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was measured with a colony dispersion assay in response to concentrations of HGF (0 – 50 ng/mL). MMP activity in the conditioned media collected from the dispersion assay was assessed by zymography. The broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor <b>ilomastat</b> (1 – 100 �M) or an MMP- 9 –neutralizing antibody (1 – 10 �g/mL) {{were included in the}} dispersion assay to determine their effects on HCEC migration.

40|$|Substance P (SP) is a prototypical neuropeptide with {{roles in}} pain and inflammation. Numerous {{mechanisms}} regulate endogenous SP levels, including the differential expression of SP mRNA and the controlled secretion of SP from neurons. Proteolysis has long been suspected to regulate extracellular SP concentrations but data {{in support of this}} hypothesis is scarce. Here, we provide evidence that proteolysis controls SP levels in the spinal cord. Using peptidomics to detect and quantify endogenous SP fragments, we identify the primary SP cleavage site as the C-terminal side of the ninth residue of SP. If blocking this pathway increases SP levels, then proteolysis controls SP concentration. We performed a targeted chemical screen using spinal cord lysates as a proxy for the endogenous metabolic environment and identified GM 6001 (galardin, <b>ilomastat)</b> as a potent inhibitor of the SP 1 – 9 -producing activity present in the tissue. Administration of GM 6001 to mice results in a greater-than-three-fold increase in the spinal cord levels of SP, which validates the hypothesis that proteolysis controls physiological SP levels...|$|E
40|$|Metalloproteases (MPs) are a {{large and}} diverse class of enzymes implicated in {{numerous}} physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling, peptide hormone processing, and cancer. MPs are tightly regulated by multiple posttranslational mechanisms in vivo, hindering their functional analysis by conventional genomic and proteomic methods. Here we describe a general strategy for creating activity-based proteomic probes for MPs by coupling a zinc-chelating hydroxamate to a benzophenone photocrosslinker, which promote selective binding and modification of MP active sites, respectively. These probes labeled active MPs but not their zymogen or inhibitor-bound counterparts and were used to identify members of this enzyme class up-regulated in invasive cancer cells and to evaluate the selectivity of MP inhibitors in whole proteomes. Interestingly, the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001 (<b>ilomastat),</b> which is currently in clinical development, was found to also target the neprilysin, aminopeptidase, and dipeptidylpeptidase clans of MPs. These results demonstrate that MPs can display overlapping inhibitor sensitivities despite lacking sequence homology and stress the need to evaluate MP inhibitors broadly across this enzyme class to develop agents with suitable target selectivities in vivo. Activity-based profiling offers a powerful means for conducting such screens, as this approach {{can be carried out}} directly in whole proteomes, thereby facilitating the discovery of disease-associated MPs concurrently with inhibitors that selectively target these proteins...|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} is {{the largest}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Despite optimal treatment, patients have a mortality which approaches 12 % at six months. Reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium is essential to salvage myocardium. However, reperfusion itself is harmful, with up to 40 % of myocardial necrosis occurring at this time. This is known as “Lethal Reperfusion Injury”. Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a channel situated in the inner mitochondrial membrane is central to this process. In its quiescent state, the MPTP remains closed, but once open it becomes non-selectively permeable to solutes of up to 1. 5 kDa, resulting in rapidly advancing necrotic cell death. The molecular structure of the MPTP has not yet been fully determined, although cyclophilin D (Cyp D) {{has been shown to be}} essential to its function. Genetic ablation of Cyp D has been shown to result in delayed opening of the MPTP and resistance to myocardial damage after acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury. MPTP inhibition is cardioprotective, and may be achieved by a variety of means including ischaemic pre- and post-conditioning, and by pharmacological agents. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the role of the MPTP (cyclophilin D) in cardioprotection from acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury. In chapter 4 we investigate whether it is possible to protect the heart in mice deficient of cyclophilin D by applying a stronger ischaemic preconditioning stimulus to that previously investigated in vivo. We found that there was a non-statistically significant trend towards a protective effect in cyclophilin D deficient mice which were subjected to a stronger IPC stimulus than that previously studied in vivo. Chapter 5 explores whether it is possible to protect the heart whilst avoiding the deleterious extra-cardiac effects of cyclosporin A by sub-cellular targeting of cyclosporin A (CsA) to mitochondria in the first in vivo testing of a mitochondrial-specific form of CsA (mtCsA). We demonstrated that mtCsA administered at reperfusion did not protect the heart of wild type mice from ischaemia- reperfusion. Chapter 6 examines the possibility of achieving cardioprotection independent of cyclophilin D. In this chapter, the effects of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, <b>Ilomastat,</b> are studied. We confirmed that MMP inhibition was cardioprotective in wild type mice and also showed for the first time in vivo that administration of <b>ilomastat</b> can protect the heart from ischaemia- reperfusion in mice deficient in cyclophilin D. In summary our data supports the hypothesis that it is possible to protect the heart from ischaemia – reperfusion in cyclophilin D deficiency by administration of an MMP inhibitor at reperfusion. We also showed a trend towards cardioprotection in cyclophilin D deficiency by administration of an increased IPC stimulus. Together, these data may suggest that necrotic cell death may not all be mediated by the MPTP, or possibly, that the MPTP may exhibit a threshold effect which is surmountable by an increase in inhibitory action of combined pharmacology or increase in IPC stimulus...|$|E
40|$|When mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes are induced to {{differentiate}} into adipocytes, they change from an extended fibroblast-like morphology to a rounded one. This change most likely occurs through extracellular matrix remodelling, {{a process known}} to be mediated in part by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we have shown by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, zymographic and immunoblot analysis that MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and membrane type 1 (MT 1) -MMP are regulated during adipose conversion. To assess the importance of MMPs for adipocytic differentiation we have used MMP-specific inhibitors as well as neutralizing antibodies. Treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes with the broad MMP inhibitor <b>Ilomastat</b> or the more restricted MMP- 2 Inhibitor I prevented their differentiation into adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by absence of triglyceride accumulation. Inhibitor treatment prevented the fibronectin-network degradation, {{as well as the}} induction of the genes for peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma and adipsin, two adipocyte phenotype markers. Inhibitor treatment was effective when applied during the early stages of adipocytic conversion, whereas inhibitor treatment during later stages had little effect. Inhibitor treatment did not inhibit clonal mitotic expansion; nor did it affect the expression pattern of the adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) or its nuclear translocation. It did, however, markedly reduce C/EBPbeta DNA-binding capacity. Taken together, these results suggest that MMPs, and notably MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, may be necessary mediators of adipocytic differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells...|$|E

Several VDAs have progressed into early clinical trials, but their therapeutic value seems to be compromised by systemic toxicity. In this report, we describe the design and characterization of a novel VDA, ICT 2588, that is nontoxic until activated specifically in the tumor by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP). HT 1080 cancer cells expressing MT 1 -MMP were selectively chemosensitive to ICT 2588, whereas MCF 7 cells that did not express MT 1 -MMP were nonresponsive. Preferential hydrolysis of ICT 2588 to its active metabolite (ICT 2552) was observed in tumor homogenates of HT 1080 relative to MCF 7 homogenates, mouse plasma, and liver homogenate. ICT 2588 activation was inhibited by the MMP inhibitor <b>ilomastat.</b> In HT 1080 tumor-bearing mice, ICT 2588 administration resulted {{in the formation of}} the active metabolite, diminution of tumor vasculature, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the tumor. The antitumor activity of ICT 2588 was superior to its active metabolite, exhibiting reduced toxicity, improved therapeutic index, enhanced pharmacodynamic effect, and greater efficacy.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Orthodontic tooth {{movement}} requires remodeling of the periodontal tissues. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{degrade the}} extracellular matrix {{components of the}} periodontal ligament, while the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) control their activity. Synthetic MMP inhibitors {{have been developed to}} inhibit MMP activity. In this study, periodontal ligament cells in contracting collagen gels served as a model for enhanced periodontal remodeling. The effect of MMP inhibitors on gel contraction and on MMP and TIMP expression was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human periodontal ligament cells were cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels and incubated with the MMP inhibitors BB 94, CMT- 3, doxycycline and <b>Ilomastat.</b> Gel contraction was determined using consecutive photographs. The relative amounts of MMPs and TIMPs were analyzed using substrate zymography and mRNA expression using quantitative polyermase chain reaction. RESULTS: All MMP inhibitors reduced MMP activity to about 20 % of the control activity. They all reduced contraction, but CMT- 3 and doxycycline had the strongest effect. These inhibitors also reduced MMP- 2, MMP- 3 and alpha-smooth muscle actin mRNA expression. The expression of MMP- 1 mRNA seemed to be increased by CMT- 3. No effects were found on the amounts of MMPs and TIMPs. CONCLUSION: Synthetic MMP inhibitors strongly reduced gel contraction by periodontal ligament cells. This was primarily caused by an inhibitory effect on MMP activity, which reduces matrix remodeling. In addition, alpha-smooth muscle actin expression was reduced by CMT- 3 and doxycycline, which limits the contractile activity of the fibroblasts...|$|E

The present {{study was designed to}} characterize the effects of PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) supernatants on cell responses involved in gingival tissue repair. Methods: We studied the response of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) to PRP and PPP fractions on: matrix contraction, cell migration, myofibroblastic differentiation, production of matrix components and proteolytic enzymes. PRP and PPP were obtained from donors using a commercial kit. Matrix contraction was evaluated by means of collagen lattices in the presence of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and actin polymerization inhibitors. The production of matrix molecules and proteinases was assessed through Western-blot. RhoA activity was evaluated through a pulldown assay. Actin distribution and focal adhesions were assessed through immunofluorescence. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) was quantified through ELISA. Results: Both PRP and PPP stimulated human gingival fibroblasts-populated collagen gel contraction and <b>Ilomastat</b> and cytochalasin D inhibited this response. PRP and PPP also stimulated MT 1 -MMP and TIMP- 2 production, RhoA activation and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration/invasion and myofibroblastic differentiation. TGF-b 1 was found at significantly higher concentrations in PRP than in PPP. Conclusions: Both PRP and PPP promote wound tissue remodeling and contraction through the stimulation of actin remodeling, the activity of MMPs, promotion of cell migration, and myofibroblastic differentiation. The similar biological responses induced by PRP and PPP suggest that both platelet-derived fractions may exert a positive effect on gingival repair...|$|E

Airway resistance and inflammatory responses, including matrix metalloproteinease- 2 (MMP- 2) and matrix metalloproteinease- 9 (MMP- 9) activities, were evaluated. Compared to values obtained in rats exposed to cadmium, pretreatment by bronchodilators administered alone significantly prevented the cadmium-induced increase of airway resistance. Formoterol elicited {{a significant decrease in}} total cell number, neutrophil and macrophage counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whereas ipratropium bromide reduced neutrophil numbers. The two compounds administered alone significantly attenuated the lung lesions associated with parenchyma inflammatory cell influx and congestion observed in the cadmium group. The increased MMP- 9 activity was significantly attenuated. Although only formoterol induced a decrease protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, both compounds inhibited the pulmonary edema by reducing wet-to-dry weight ratio which returned to values similar to those recorded in the sham group. All the effects of formoterol on the cadmium-induced inflammatory responses were reversed by propranolol. Similar anti-inflammatory effects were obtained in rats pretreated with <b>ilomastat</b> which showed a significant reduction on inflammatory cell infiltration and MMP- 9 activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Neither synergistic nor additive effects were obtained when the two bronchodilators were administered in combination. In conclusion, formoterol and ipratropium bromide partially protect the lungs against the inflammation by reducing neutrophilic infiltration. This protective effect is associated with reduced MMP- 9 activity known to play an important pro-inflammatory role in acute inflammatory process. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background LIM kinase 1 (LIMK 1) is an actin and {{microtubule}} cytoskeleton modulatory {{protein that}} is overexpressed {{in a number}} of cancerous tissues and cells and also promotes invasion and metastasis of prostate and breast cancer cells. Membrane type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT 1 -MMP) is a critical modulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover through pericellular proteolysis and thus plays crucial roles in neoplastic cell invasion and metastasis. MT 1 -MMP and its substrates pro-MMP- 2 and pro-MMP- 9 are often overexpressed in a variety of cancers including prostate cancer and the expression levels correlate with the grade of malignancy in prostate cancer cells. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine any functional relation between LIMK 1 and MT 1 -MMP and its implication in cell invasion. Results Our results showed that treatment with the hydroxamate inhibitor of MT 1 -MMP, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 <b>ilomastat</b> inhibited LIMK 1 -induced invasion of benign prostate epithelial cells. Over expression of LIMK 1 resulted in increased collagenolytic activity of MMP- 2, and secretion of pro-MMP 2 and pro-MMP- 9. Cells over expressing LIMK 1 also exhibited increased expression of MT 1 -MMP, transcriptional activation and its localization to the plasma membrane. LIMK 1 physically associates with MT 1 -MMP and is colocalized with it to the Golgi vesicles. We also noted increased expression of both MT 1 -MMP and LIMK 1 in prostate tumor tissues. Conclusion Our results provide new information on regulation of MT 1 -MMP function by LIMK 1 and showed for the first time, involvement of MMPs in LIMK 1 induced cell invasion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Oocyte {{maturation}} (OM) in teleosts {{is under}} precise hormonal control by progestins and estrogens. We show here that estrogens activate an {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (Egfr) signaling pathway in fully grown, denuded zebrafish (Danio rerio) oocytes through the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (Gper; also known as GPR 30) to maintain oocyte meiotic arrest in a germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) bioassay. A GPER-specific antagonist, G- 15, increased spontaneous OM, indicating that the inhibitory estrogen actions on OM are mediated through Gper. Estradiol- 17 beta-bovine serum albumin, which cannot enter oocytes, decreased GVBD, whereas treatment with actinomycin D did not block estrogen's inhibitory effects, suggesting that estrogens act at the cell surface via a nongenomic mechanism to prevent OM. The intracellular tyrosine kinase (Src) inhibitor, PP 2, blocked estrogen inhibition of OM. Expression of egfr mRNA and Egfr protein were detected in denuded zebrafish oocytes. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, <b>ilomastat,</b> which prevents the release of heparin-bound epidermal growth factor, increased spontaneous OM, whereas the MMP activator, interleukin- 1 alpha, decreased spontaneous OM. Moreover, inhibitors of EGFR (ErbB 1) and extracellular-related kinase 1 and 2 (Erk 1 / 2; official symbol Mapk 3 / 1) increased spontaneous OM. In addition, estradiol- 17 beta and the GPER agonist, G- 1, increased phosphorylation of Erk, and this was abrogated by simultaneous treatment with the EGFR inhibitor. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} estrogens act through Gper to maintain meiotic arrest via an Src kinase-dependent G-protein betagamma subunit signaling pathway involving transactivation of egfr and phosphorylation of Mapk 3 / 1. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that EGFR signaling in vertebrate oocytes can prevent meiotic progression...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the concept of targeting mediators of the scarring process at multiple points across the course of bleb failure, in order to prolong bleb survival. Methods: There were three linked parts to the experiment. In the first part, a cannula glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) was performed on 32 New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, and bleb survival was assessed for six different regimens plus controls by grading bleb height and width. For the second part of the study, the same GFS surgery was performed on an additional 10 NZW rabbits. Two additional filtering blebs were treated with balanced saline solution (BSS), two received mitomycin-C (MMC) (0. 4 mg/mL), and for the remaining six, a sequential regimen was given consisting of 200 mmol/L mannose- 6 -phosphate (M- 6 -P) solution at the time of surgery, followed by subconjunctival injections of antibody to connective tissue growth factor at days 2 and 4, and <b>Ilomastat,</b> a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, at days 7, 12, and 20 postoperatively. Bleb survival was again assessed. In the final part of the experiment, blebs treated with either BSS, MMC, or the above sequential multitreatment regimen were examined histologically at 14 days postoperatively in three additional NZW rabbits. Results: All six individual therapies selected resulted in some improvement of bleb survival compared to BSS control. Blebs treated with the new sequential, multitreatment protocol survived an average of 29 days (regression slope, P <. 0001 compared to control), those receiving BSS an average of 17 days, and those treated with MMC (0. 4 mg/mL) an average of 36 days. The sequential...|$|E
40|$|Airway remodelling {{describes}} the histopathological changes leading to fixed airway obstruction {{in patients with}} asthma and includes extra-cellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1) is present in remodelled airways but its relationship with ECM proteins and the resulting functional consequences are unknown. We used airway smooth muscle cells (ASM) and bronchial biopsies from control donors and patients with asthma to examine the regulation of MMP- 1 by ECM in ASM cells {{and the effect of}} MMP- 1 on ASM contraction. Collagen-I and tenascin-C induced MMP- 1 protein expression, which for tenascin-C, was greater in asthma derived ASM cells. Tenascin-C induced MMP- 1 expression was dependent on ERK 1 / 2, JNK and p 38 MAPK activation and attenuated by function blocking antibodies against the b 1 and b 3 integrin subunits. Tenascin-C and MMP- 1 were not expressed in normal airways but co-localised in the ASM bundles and reticular basement membrane of patients with asthma. Further, ECM from asthma derived ASM cells stimulated MMP- 1 expression to a greater degree than ECM from normal ASM. Bradykinin induced contraction of ASM cells seeded in 3 D collagen gels was reduced by the MMP inhibitor <b>ilomastat</b> and by siRNA knockdown of MMP- 1. In summary, the induction of MMP- 1 in ASM cells by tenascin-C occurs in part via integrin mediated MAPK signalling. MMP- 1 and tenascin-C are co-localised in the smooth muscle bundles of patients with asthma where this interaction may contribute to enhanced airway contraction. Our findings suggest that ECM changes in airway remodelling via MMP- 1 could contribute to an environmen...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerned}} {{the design and}} examination of a scaffold for tissue engineering applications. The template for the presented scaffold came from nature itself: the intercellular space in tissues that provides structure and support to {{the cells of the}} respective tissue, known as extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibres are a predominant characteristic feature of ECM, providing adhesion sites for cell-matrix interactions. In this dissertation a fibrous mesh was generated using the electrospinning technique to mimic the fibrous structure of the ECM. Two base polymers were explored: a biodegradable polyester, poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide); and a functional PEG-based star polymer, NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO). This topic was described in three major parts: the first part was materials based, concerning the chemical design and characterisation of the polymer scaffolds; the focus was then shifted to the cellular response to this fibrous scaffold; and finally the in vivo performance of the material was preliminarily assessed. The first steps towards an electrospun mesh started with adjusting the spinning parameters for the generation of homogeneous fibres. As reported in Chapter 3 a suitable setup configuration was on the one hand comprised of a spinning solution that consisted of 28. 5 w/v% PLGA RG 504 and 6 w/v% NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) in 450 µL acetone, 50 µL DMSO and 10 µL of an aqueous trifluoroacetic acid solution. On the other hand an ideal spinning behaviour was achieved at process parameters such as a flow rate of 0. 5 mL/h, spinneret to collector distance of 12 - 16 cm and a voltage of 13 kV. The NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) containing fibres proved to be highly hydrophilic as the functional additive was present on the fibre surface. Furthermore, the fibres featured a bulk degradation pattern {{as a consequence of the}} proportion of PLGA. Besides the morphologic similarity to ECM fibres, the functionality of the electrospun fibres is also decisive for a successful ECM mimicry. In Chapter 4, the passive as well as active functionality of the fibres was investigated. The fibres were required to be protein repellent to prevent an unspecific cell adhesion. This was proven as even 6. 5 % sP(EO-stat-PO) in the PLGA fibres reduced any unspecific protein adsorption of bovine serum albumin and foetal calf serum to less than 1 %. However, avidin based proteins attached to the fibres. This adhesion process was avoided by an additional fibre surface treatment with glycidol. The active functionalisation of NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA fibres was investigated with two fluorescent dyes and biocytin. A threefold, chemically orthogonal, fibre modification was achieved with these dyes. The chapters about the chemical and mechanical properties laid the basis for the in vitro chapters where a specific fibre functionalisation with peptides was conducted to analyse the cell adhesion and biochemical expressions. Beginning with fibroblasts in Chapter 5 the focus was on the specific cell adhesion on the electrospun fibres. While NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA fibres without peptides did not allow any adhesion of fibroblasts, a fibre modification with GRGDS (an adhesion mediating peptide sequence) induced the adhesion and spreading of human dermal fibroblasts on the fibrous scaffolds. The control sequence GRGES that has no adhesion mediating qualities did not lead to any cell adhesion as observed on fibres without modifications. While the experiments of Chapter 5 were a proof-of-concept, in Chapter 6 a possible application in cartilage tissue engineering was examined. Therefore, primary human chondrocytes were seeded on fibrous scaffolds with various peptide sequences. Though the chondrocytes exhibited high viability on all scaffolds, an active interaction of cells and fibres was only found for the decorin derived sequence CGKLER. Live-cell-imaging revealed both cell attachment and migration within CGKLER-modified meshes. As chondrocytes undergo a de-differentiation towards a fibroblast-like phenotype, the chondrogenic re-differentiation on these scaffolds was investigated in a long term cell culture experiment of 28 days. Therefore, the glycosaminoglycan production was analysed as well as the mRNA expression of genes coding for collagen I and II, aggrecan and proteoglycan 4. In general only low amounts of the chondrogenic markers were measured, suggesting no chondrogenic differentiation. For conclusive evidence follow-up experiments are required that support or reject the findings. The success of an implant for tissue engineering relies not only on the response of the targeted cell type but also on the immune reaction caused by leukocytes. Hence, Chapter 7 dealt with primary human macrophages and their behaviour and phenotype on two-dimensional (2 D) surfaces compared to three-dimensional (3 D) fibrous substrates. It was found that the general non-adhesiveness of NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) surfaces and fibres does not apply to macrophages. The cells aligned along the fibres on surfaces or resided in the pores of the meshes. On flat surfaces without 3 D structure the macrophages showed a retarded adhesion kinetic accompanied with a high migratory activity indicating their search for a topographical feature to adhere to. Moreover, a detailed investigation of cell surface markers and chemokine signalling revealed that macrophages on 2 D surfaces exhibited surface markers indicating a healing phenotype while the chemokine release suggested a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, the opposite situation was found on 3 D fibrous substrates with pro-inflammatory surface markers and pro-angiogenic cytokine release. As the immune response largely depends on cellular communication, it was concluded that the NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA fibres induce an adequate immune response with promising prospects to be used in a scaffold for tissue engineering. The final chapter of this thesis reports on a first in vivo study conducted with the presented electrospun fibres. Here, the fibres were combined with a polypropylene mesh for the treatment of diaphragmatic hernias in a rabbit model. Two scaffold series were described that differed in the overall surface morphology: while the fibres of Series A were incorporated into a thick gel of NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO), the scaffolds of Series B featured only a thin hydrogel layer so that the overall fibrous structure could be retained. After four months in vivo the treated defects of the diaphragm were significantly smaller and filled mainly with scar tissue. Thick granulomas occurred on scaffolds of Series A while the implants of Series B did not induce any granuloma formation. As a consequence of the generally positive outcome of this study, the constructs were enhanced with a drug release system in a follow-up project. The incorporated drug was the MMP-inhibitor <b>Ilomastat</b> which is intended to reduce the formation of scar tissue. In conclusion, the simple and straight forward fabrication, the threefold functionalisation possibility and general versatile applicability makes the meshes of NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA fibres a promising candidate to be applied in tissue engineering scaffolds in the future. Diese Dissertation beschäftigte sich mit der Entwicklung und Untersuchung eines Gerüsts zur Geweberegeneration. Der interzelluläre Raum, der in Geweben für die Gewebestruktur verantwortlich ist, wurde als Vorbild aus der Natur für das entwickelte Gerüst verwendet. Fasern sind in dieser extrazellulären Matrix (EZM) ein charakteristischer Bestandteil, die Adhäsionssequenzen für Zell-Matrix-Interaktionen enthalten und zur strukturellen Organisation der Gewebe beitragen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Faservliese mit Hilfe des elektrostatischen Verspinnens hergestellt, um die natürlichen Fasern der EZM zu imitieren. Zwei Polymere bildeten die chemische Grundlage für diese Fasern: Ein bioabbaubarer Polyester, Poly(D,L-Laktid-co-Glykolid) (PLGA) und ein funktionales auf Polyethylenglykol basierendes, sternförmiges Polymer, NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO). Der erste Teil des in drei Hauptteile untergliederten Themas beschäftigte sich mit dem chemischen Design und der Fasercharakterisierung im Sinne der Materialeigenschaften. Der zweite Teil betrachtet die Auswirkungen der Fasern auf zellulärer Ebene, während der dritte Teil einen ersten Eindruck über die in vivo Reaktion auf die Materialien vermittelt. Die ersten Schritte in Richtung eines elektrostatisch gesponnenen Vlieses begannen mit der Erforschung geeigneter Einstellungen für eine homogene Faserproduktion. Kapitel 3 thematisiert geeignete Spinnparameter, zu denen auf der einen Seite eine spinnfähige Lösung gehörte, die aus 28. 5 w/v% PLGA RG 504 und 6 w/v% NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) in 450 µL Aceton, 50 µL DMSO und 10 µL trifluoressigsaurer wässriger Lösung besteht. Auf der anderen Seite wurden Prozessparameter gefunden, wie zum Beispiel eine Flussrate von 0. 5 mL/h und ein Kollektor-Abstand von 12 - 16 cm, die bei einer Potentialdifferenz von 13 kV ein stabiles Spinnverhalten garantierten. Fasern mit dem Additiv NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) zeigten eine äußerst starke Hydrophilie, da das Additiv während des Spinnprozesses an die Faseroberfläche segregierte. Des Weiteren sind die Fasern dank des PLGA-Anteils nach einem Volumenabbaumechanismus unter physiologischen Bedingungen degradierbar. Neben der morphologischen Ähnlichkeit zwischen natürlichen Fasern der EZM und elektrogesponnenen Fasern ist die Funktionalität der synthetischen Fasern entscheidend für eine erfolgreiche Imitation der EZM. Kapitel 4 betrachtet deswegen sowohl die passive als auch aktive Funktionalität der Fasern. Unter passive Funktionalität fällt das proteinabweisende Verhalten, welches eine unspezifische Zelladhäsion verhindert. Es wurde gezeigt, dass ein Anteil von 6. 5 % sP(EO-stat-PO) in den PLGA-Fasern ausreicht, um die unspezifische Adhäsion von Albumin aus Rinderserum und fötalem Kälberserum auf weniger als 1 % zu senken. Dennoch adhärierten avidinbasierte Proteine auf den Fasern, was jedoch durch eine Behandlung mit Glycidol unterbunden werden konnte. Die aktive Funktionalisierung wurde exemplarisch mit zwei Fluoreszenzfarbstoffen und Biocytin untersucht. Mit diesen Modellmolekülen wurde eine dreifache, chemisch orthogonale Fasermodifizierung erreicht. Die Kapitel über die chemischen und mechanischen Eigenschaften haben die Grundlage für in vitro Zellversuche gelegt, bei denen eine Faserfunktionalisierung mit Peptidsequenzen durchgeführt wurde, um eine spezifische Zelladhäsion zu erreichen und die biochemische Reaktion der Zellen zu untersuchen. In Kapitel 5 lag der Fokus auf der spezifischen Adhäsion von humanen dermalen Fibroblasten an den elektrogesponnenen Fasern. Während NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA Fasern ohne Peptide keine Zelladhäsion zuließen, induzierte eine Fasermodifikation mit GRGDS, einer adhäsionsvermittelnden Peptidsequenz, sowohl die Adhäsion als auch Ausbreitung der Fibroblasten auf den Fasern. Eine Kontrollsequenz ohne adhäsionsvermittelnde Eigenschaften (GRGES), führte, wie auch Fasern ohne Peptide, zu keiner Zelladhäsion. Die Experimente von Kapitel 6 gingen über das reine Machbarkeitskonzept von Kapitel 5 hinaus, indem eine mögliche Anwendung im Bereich der Knorpelregeneration untersucht wurde. Daher wurden primäre humane Chondrozyten auf Faservliesen ausgesät, die mit unterschiedlichen Peptiden modifiziert wurden. Trotz einer allgemein sehr guten Vitalität der Zellen auf allen Fasertypen, zeigten die Chondrozyten nur auf Vliesen mit der aus Decorin abgeleiteten CGKLER-Sequenz eine aktive Interaktion. Diese konnte mit dem Live-Cell-Imaging-Verfahren anhand der Zelladhäsion und Zellmigration beobachtet werden. Da Chondrozyten in der 2 D-Expansionszellkultur einer Dedifferenzierung in Richtung eines Fibroblasten ähnlichen Zelltypen unterliegen, wurde eine 28 -tägige Studie durchgeführt, um das Redifferenzierungsverhalten auf den Fasergerüsten zu untersuchen. Dazu wurde sowohl die Glykosaminoglykanproduktion analysiert als auch die mRNA Expression der Gene, die die Kollagen I und II, Aggrecan und Proteoglykan 4 Produktion regulieren. Die chondrogenen Marker wurden in diesen Versuchen nur geringfügig ausgeschüttet, was in Anbetracht der großen Varianzen in den Messwerten auf keine Redifferenzierung schließen lässt. Für eine abschließende Beurteilung werden Folgeexperimente empfohlen, die die gemachten Beobachtungen bestärken oder widerlegen. Der Erfolg eines Implantats zur Geweberegeneration beruht nicht nur auf der gewünschten Reaktion des Zielzelltyps, sondern auch auf der Immunreaktion des Organismus, welche durch Leukozyten gesteuert wird. Folglich beschäftigte sich Kapitel 7 mit dem Verhalten und den Phänotypen primärer humaner Makrophagen auf dreidimensionalen Fasergerüsten und zweidimensionalen Oberflächen im Vergleich zueinander. Bei den Versuchen zeigte sich, dass die generelle Nicht-Adhäsivität von NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) Oberflächen für Makrophagen nicht zutrifft. Die Zellen richteten sich an den Fasern auf den Oberflächen aus oder saßen in den Poren der Vliese. Auf flachen Oberflächen ohne dreidimensionale Struktur wiesen die Makrophagen ein verzögertes Adhäsionsverhalten auf und migrierten stark über die Oberfläche auf der Suche nach topographischen Unebenheiten, um dort adhärent zu werden. Des Weiteren zeigte eine detaillierte Untersuchung der Oberflächenmarker und der Zytokinausschüttung, dass Makrophagen auf 2 D-Oberflächen gemäß der Oberflächenmarker einen entzündungs-hemmenden Phänotypen aufwiesen, während die Zytokinausschüttung einen entzündungs-fördernden Phänotypen suggerierte. Interessanterweise bot sich das entgegengesetzte Bild auf 3 D-Faseroberflächen. Hier wurde die Erkenntnis gewonnen, dass die Morphologie einen größeren Einfluss auf die Zellreaktion hat als die Oberflächenchemie. Da die Immunantwort eines Organismus auf ein Implantat stark von der interzellularen Kommunikation abhängt, wurde gefolgert, dass die NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA Fasern eine adäquate Immunantwort hervorrufen mit vielversprechenden Aussichten, die Fasergerüste im Bereich der Geweberegeneration einzusetzen. Das letzte Kapitel der Dissertation berichtet über eine erste in vivo Studie der hier vorgestellten Fasern. Mit den Fasern wurde ein bestehendes Behandlungskonzept für Hernien des Zwerchfells erweitert und die Leistungsfähigkeit in einem Kaninchenmodell überprüft. Zwei Gerüsttypen wurden untersucht, die sich in der Oberflächenmorphologie maßgeblich unterschieden: In Serie A wurden die elektrogesponnenen Fasern in ein Gel aus NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) gebettet, während die Fasern in Serie B nur mit einer dünnen Gelschicht bedeckt wurden, so dass die topografische Faserstruktur erhalten blieb. Nach 4 Monaten in vivo waren die behandelten Zwerchfelldefekte signifikant kleiner und überwiegend mit Narbengewebe gefüllt. Die ausgeprägte Granulombildung bei Fasergerüsten der Serie A konnte in der darauffolgenden Studie (Serie B) minimiert werden. Das gute Abschneiden dieser Studien wurde zum Anlass genommen, die Vliese weiterzuentwickeln und eine Medikamentenfreisetzung (<b>Ilomastat)</b> zu integrieren, um die Narbenbildung zu minimieren. Zusammenfassend beschreibt diese Dissertation einen einfachen und direkten Weg, Fasern für eine gezielte Geweberegeneration zu erzeugen, die dreifach funktionalisierbar und vielseitig anwendbar sind. Dies macht Fasergerüste auf der Basis von NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) /PLGA zu einem vielversprechenden Kandidaten um in der Geweberegeneration eingesetzt zu werden...|$|E
