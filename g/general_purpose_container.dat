In particular, the application of shipping container temporary housing is suited to post-disaster situations, design examples of which {{can be found in the}} literature. However, ensuring the success of implementing such projects in a post-disaster setting requires investigation into the social considerations of temporary housing. This research takes a qualitative approach, focusing particularly on case studies of temporary housing experiences following the Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Christchurch Earthquake in 2011 and a field study of 2009 Black Saturday bushfire-affected communities in Victoria, Australia. Key social factors found to be significant to the success of shipping container temporary housing projects relate to flexibility in ownership, reuse and siting arrangement, in addition to robust pre-disaster planning by authorities, taking into account the varying characteristics of different types of disasters...|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of larger aircraft and advances in design {{have reduced the}} occurrence of air sickness. This has led to bags being given a secondary use as <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> waterproof waste <b>containers</b> which is often reflected in the labelling of the bag and instructional diagrams. Another common use {{is that of a}} photographic mailing envelope (especially Australia). Airlines have also printed bags to serve as card game scoresheets and Continental Airlines once suggested that they be used as doggy bags for airline food. Non-airline aircrew have occasionally used these bags as improvised urinals or fecal collection devices aboard aircraft lacking on-board toilets. A specialized urine collection bag known colloquially as the [...] "piddle pack" [...] developed as an improvement from this practice. In 2010, Spirit Airlines began selling advertising space on its air sickness bags.|$|R
