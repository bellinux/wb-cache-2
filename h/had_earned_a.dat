5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a world power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick <b>had</b> <b>earned</b> <b>a</b> new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E

5|$|Karthik was {{retained}} for the Test tour of Australia as an opener, while Gambhir {{was ruled}} out after suffering an injury. However, {{he did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests, because Dravid was elevated into his opening position so that both Tendulkar and Yuvraj could bat in the middle order. When Dravid and Yuvraj both struggled in their new positions, Dravid was moved back to his No. 3 position and Yuvraj dropped for the Third Test of the series, but instead, it was Sehwagwho <b>had</b> <b>earned</b> <b>a</b> late call-up as the reserve opener after Gambhir succumbed to injuryand not Karthik who was recalled. During the Test leg of the tour, Karthik played in only one non-first-class match against an Australian Capital Territory Invitation XI, scoring 25 and 97. Karthik was selected for the limited overs component of the Australian tour, but did not play in any of the ten ODIs. This meant that in almost three months on tour, Karthik only played in a two-day match and a Twenty20 match against Australia, in which he scored eight runs.|$|E
5|$|Walls' double {{continued}} his {{success as a}} pinch hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but <b>had</b> <b>earned</b> <b>a</b> blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home {{in an attempt to}} put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm deep enough to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving Walls safe on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7–5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three pinch hitters, two defensive replacements, and a pinch runner.|$|E
