40|$|Distributional {{properties}} -including Laplace transforms- of integrals of Markov processes {{received a}} lot of attention in the literature. In this paper, we complete existing results in several ways. First, we provide the analytical solution to the most general form of Gaussian processes (with non-stationary increments) solving a stochastic differential equation. We further derive the characteristic function of integrals of Lévy-processes and Lévy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with time-inhomogeneous coefficients based on the characteristic exponent of the corresponding stochastic integral. This yields a two-dimensional integral which can be solved explicitly in a lot of cases. This applies to integrals of compound Poisson processes, whose characteristic function can then be obtained in a much easier way than using <b>joint</b> <b>conditioning</b> on jump <b>times.</b> Closed form expressions are given for gamma-distributed jump sizes as an example.

Data show that normal and hard milling of Gemmeiza 11 at <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> 12 h results highest wet gluten 30. 1 % and 29. 5 %, respectively, and recorded higher gluten index 96. 5 % and 96. 1 % by normal and hard milling at <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> 24 h, respectively. The higher damage of starch 7. 59 % and 7. 14 % {{were obtained by}} hard milling of wheat Sakha 94 at <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> 24 and 36 h, respectively. The granule surfaces of starches became damaged, flattened, scratched, cracked, rougher and less rounded at hard milling for both cultivars. The higher values of stability time 16, 15 and 14 min and lower degree of softening 20 BU were given by normal milling of wheat Gemmeiza 11 at <b>conditioning</b> <b>times</b> 36, 24 and 12 h, respectively.

30|$|First, the {{research}} shows {{that it is possible}} to develop a methodology that uses rotated contextual questionnaires in conjunction with multilevel item response models. The three approaches to scaling that we explored in this paper involved common part <b>conditioning,</b> <b>joint</b> <b>conditioning,</b> and separate conditioning. The common part conditioning used information from only the variables in the common part of the questionnaire, the <b>joint</b> <b>conditioning</b> employed information from the rotated parts jointly, and the separate conditioning used information from the rotated parts separately. We paired these latter two approaches with the two questionnaire rotation designs. In Design 1, the constructs in each rotated form showed similar correlations with performance. In Design 2, the constructs were assigned to forms in such a way that the constructs in one form had relatively higher correlations with performance whereas the constructs in the other form had relatively lower correlations with performance.|$|R

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of coal-water slurries made with Pittsburgh No. 8 coal at four solids contents was investigated with the Haake viscometer after conditioning for {{16 hours at}} 200 C. The {{results show that the}} viscosity of the slurries increases as the solids content is increased. Slurries at high solid-liquid ratios not only exhibit significant yield stresses but also viscosities which decrease with increasing in the shear rate. It was found that the empirical Heschel-Buckley equation fits the measured shear stress of slurries at different shear rates quite well. The standard deviation of the shear stress of coal-water slurries measured with the Haake viscometer was found to be less than 10 %. The apparent viscosities measured with the Brookfield Synchro-Lectric LVT viscometer were comparable with values obtained with the Haake Rotovisco RV 12 viscometer for slurries having solids contents of 50 and 55 wt%. In studying the effect of <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> on the measured viscosity of coal-water slurries (at 60 wt% solids content), it was observed that the viscosity of a slurry increases when the <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> is increased from 0. 25 to 0. 75 hour and then decreases when the <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> is increased further. The initial increase in viscosity with <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> is probably related to the penetration of water into the pores of the coal, and the decrease in the viscosity at longer <b>conditioning</b> <b>times</b> over 0. 75 hour {{may be due to the}} development of a hydration layer and the electrical double layer on coal surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{are used}} extensively {{on a very}} large scale. They {{are subject to change}} in temperature and loading conditions constantly. In the experimental study, we have tried {{to assess the impact of}} temperature and <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> on the mechanical behaviour of glass fiber reinforced composites. Interface is the most significant part of composite structure which regulates the load transfer from matrix to fiber. Its strength is measured in terms of ILSS (Inter Laminar Shear Strength). Short beam shear tests are done at ambient and 60 ⁰C for <b>conditioning</b> <b>times</b> 30 minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours. The results show that at high temperature, there is initial increase in the strength of interface up to 30 minutes followed by weakening as <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> increases to 1 hour. This again is followed by strengthening of the interface as <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> extends to 3 hours. Understanding the effect of <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> might help us in optimization of the mechanical properties. Composite material may contain randomly spaced microvoids, incipient damage sites and microcracks with statistically distributed sizes and directions. Therefore, the local strength in the material varies in a random fashion. The failure location as well as degree of damage induced in the material will also vary in an unpredictable mode. The fractured surfaces are photographed by SEM analysis and studied. As temperature increases, the mode of failure approaches matrix cracking, fiber breakage and debonding. Each test is carried out at six different crosshead speeds, 5 mm /min, 10 mm/min, 50 mm/min, 100 mm/min, 200 mm/min, and 500 mm/min. ILSS decreases as crosshead speed is increased. FTIR analysis of composite specimens was carried out to interpret the reaction between matrix and fiber at the interface. DSC analysis was done to understand the deflection of glass transition temperature with the change in temperature and <b>conditioning</b> <b>time.</b> There are a lot of conflicts over this subject and this study has tried to highlight the major factors which need to be focussed upon for further improvement in the field of composites...|$|R

Results of the moisture content measurement using these methods show a sufficiently linear relationship between measured moisture content and the proportion of viscose in the fabric samples.

Regression equations were used to predict the blend proportion of fabric samples from the moisture content data.

The aim was to evaluate the effect of <b>conditioning</b> <b>time,</b> muscle type and freezing period on the quality attributes of fresh camel meat and meat products. In experiment one, ten camels (Camelus dromedarius), approximately about 7 years old, were slaughtered at Alsalam slaughter house. Deep pectoral (DP) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles were dissected out {{from one side of the}} carcass. The muscles were put in crushed ice and transferred in an ice box to the Meat Laboratory, Faculty of Animal Production, University of Khartoum. Each muscle was divided into four groups and conditioned at 2 oC for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. Proximate chemical composition, colorimetric parameters, proteins fractionation, water holding parameters, protein electrophoresis with the assistance of SDS-page, sensory evaluation and microbial properties were studied. In experiment two, the same muscles were taken from left and right sides of the 7 camel’s carcasses; the muscles from the left side were processed immediately into fresh sausage and the others (from the right side) were conditioned for 5 days at 2 oC then processed. The sausages were frozen for 0, 1 and 30 days. Then physical parameters, proximate chemical composition, sensory evaluation, and microbial properties were studied. Analysis of variance under complete randomized design, factorial two ways was used to analyze the data. Differences between factors and combinations of factors were compared pair wise with Duncan multiple range test, at P = 0. 05. With assistance of SPSS program, Version 10. 5. pH values decreased significantly with increasing <b>conditioning</b> <b>time,</b> and DP muscle had lower pH value. Color L* increased and a* and b* decreased significantly with time, while ST muscle had significantly higher L* and lower a* and b*. Myofibrillar proteins extractability and non-protein-nitrogen increased, but sarcoplasmic and connective tissue proteins decreased significantly with the progress of <b>conditioning</b> <b>time,</b> and ST muscle had superior percentage over DP muscle. The disappearance of desmin and troponin-T and appearance of a band with molecular weight of 30 KDa with <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> indicated increased meat tenderness. The mean scores of sensory increased significantly with the progress of <b>conditioning</b> <b>time,</b> and ST muscle was superior over DP muscle. Total viable count, psychrophilic bacteria, Pseudomonas, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus faecalis increased significantly during <b>conditioning</b> <b>time,</b> while Staphylococcus aureus, total coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli decreased.

Purpose of the Study: To examine the effects of <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> and enamel surface preparation on bond strength and etching pattern of adhesive systems to enamel. Materials and Methods: Ninety-six teeth were divided into 16 conditions (N = 6) in function of enamel preparation and <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> for bond strength test. The adhesive systems OptiBond FL (Kerr, Orange, CA, USA), OptiBond SOLO Plus (Kerr), Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray, Osaka, Japan), and Adper Prompt L-Pop (3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) were applied on unground or ground enamel following the manufacturers` directions or doubling the <b>conditioning</b> <b>time.</b> Cylinders of Filtek Flow (0. 5 -mm height) were applied to each bonded enamel surface using a Tygon tube (0. 7 mm in diameter; Saint-Gobain Corp., Aurora, OH, USA). After storage (24 h/ 37 degrees C), the specimens were subjected to shear force (0. 5 mm/min). The data were treated by a three-way analysis of variance and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). The failure modes of the debonded interfaces and the etching pattern of adhesives were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Results: Only the main factor ""adhesive"" was statistically significant (p < 0. 001). The lowest bond strength value was observed for OptiBond FL. The most defined etching pattern was observed for 35 % phosphoric acid and for Adper Prompt L-Pop. Mixed failures were observed for all adhesives, but OptiBond FL showed cohesive failures in resin predominantly.

The work validated the potential of Fenton's reagent combined with dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (DDBAC) in improving sludge dewaterability and proposed the mechanism of <b>joint</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The composite conditioner dosage was optimized using response surface methodology. Results indicated the good conditioning capability of the composite conditioners. The optimum dosages for H 2 O 2, Fe 2 +, and DDBAC were 44. 6, 39. 6, and 71. 0 mg/g, respectively, at which a sludge cake water content of 59. 67 % could be achieved. Moreover, a second-order polynomial equation was developed to describe the behavior of <b>joint</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Analysis of the reaction mechanism showed that Fenton oxidation effectively decomposed extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), including loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), into dissolved organics, such as proteins and polysaccharides.

Furthermore, DDBAC further released the bound water through solubilization of TB-EPS and LB-EPS after the Fenton reaction. The bound water content of the sludge conditioned with Fenton's reagent decreased from 3. 15 to 1. 36 g/g and further decreased to 1. 08 g/g with the addition of DDBAC.

40|$|The {{influence}} of conditioning on the flotation of pyrrhotite {{in the presence}} of chlorite was investigated through flotation tests, sedimentation tests, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The flotation results show that chlorite slimes dramatically impair the flotation of pyrrhotite. Sedimentation and flotation tests reveal that conditioning can effectively remove chlorite slimes from pyrrhotite surfaces, resulting in an enhanced flotation recovery of pyrrhotite. When mixed minerals were conditioned under the natural atmosphere, a faster conditioning speed and longer <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> decreased the flotation recovery of pyrrhotite. However, when mixed minerals were conditioned under a nitrogen atmosphere, a more intensive conditioning process provided better flotation results.

Slight differences only are apparent in reading, where the original average correlation between all background constructs and performance is 0.05, but is lower (0.04) for the design with the separate conditioning of variable sets with the same correlation (samecorrsep) and higher (0.06) for both of the designs that involved the use of <b>joint</b> <b>conditioning.</b> However, the size of these differences is not substantive.|$|R

Role of the functional groups in the polymers and of operating variables such as <b>conditioning</b> <b>time</b> and desliming was examd. Studies were made on chalcopyrite-quartz and pyrite-quartz mixts. {{in the presence of the}} polymers...|$|R
