The effect of different cooling rates on the transition temperatures and microstructures were analyzed.

The solidus temperature decreases clearly with increasing cooling rates, but for the liquidus temperature there is slightly increasing trend.

It was shown that 70 wt % Zn in the alloy would be optimal to attain a thermal storage temperature of 360 - 370 o C, using solar superheated steam 400 o C as the heat charging fluid. At the stage <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> discharge, high quality steam is produced {{on the base of}} utilizing mainly the phase change <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> zinc <b>solidification</b> and partly sensible <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> the liquid phase. A heat transfer fluid (e. g. DOWTHERM-A) is used to enhance heat transfer between the storage medium and built-in heat exchangers by the effect of reflux evaporation-condensation. Since the storage process is essentially non-isothermal, a secondary, relatively small thermal buffer following the main storage is required to stabilize the steam outlet temperature. The results of calculations for a pilot of 5 MWh thermal storage show that steam sent to a turbine after the buffer may have a temperature near 330 o C during the entire charge-discharge cycle comprised of 6 and 1 hr periods respectively.
