40|$|During {{the last}} few years there have been many claims of {{differential}} treatment of minorities in the vehicle lending market- primarily among vehicle <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to analyze racial differences in interest rates paid on vehicle loans throughout the vehicle lending market. We show that the majority of both Blacks and Whites originate their loans on new vehicles at institutions other than vehicle <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> (primarily commercial banks and credit unions). Among new car loans, we find no differential treatment of Black and White borrowers conditional on the borrower’s credit history for loans originated at banks and credit unions. Likewise, we find no differential treatment of Black and White borrowers among used car loans regardless of where the loan was originated. However, we find that Blacks pay higher interest rates on new car loans originated at vehicle <b>finance</b> <b>companies,</b> conditional on borrower credit characteristics. Specifically, we find that Blacks pay 100 basis points more for their vehicle loan at the mean and 71 basis points more at the median, conditional on credit controls, relative to Whites. These point estimates translate to Black borrowers at vehicle <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> paying a premium in terms of higher financing of their new car purchases of between $ 5 and $ 7 per month. We conclude that that differential treatment in the terms of financing by race is much greater for loans originated at vehicle <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> than for loans originated at banks or credit unions. ...|$|R

From total 194 <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in the industry, the <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> who affiliate with bank or automotive manufacturer are 65 companies that contribute to 71 % of total asset of the industry. The banking industry that provides majority of funding, has made <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> {{as part of their}} integration business model. The automotive manufacturers and dealers that provide the products of financing, have the similar strategy. The acquisition of <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> has reached more than 30 transactions from 2002 until 2012. We analyzed seven micro key financial ratios (profitability, efficiency, growth, firm size, liquidity, solvability and risk). We use non parametric Mann Whitney and parametric Panel Data Dummy Regression. Our sample consists of 100 <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> which continuously published their financial statement from 2001 until 2011. The empirical results show that the integrated <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> are better in efficiency, profitability, size and growth.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether auditors bear {{any negative}} {{consequence of the}} failures of <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in New Zealand. More than 60 <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> failed since 2006 and these failures imposed massive financial loss on the investors. There is a wide perception of audit failure {{in the case of}} these failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> Therefore, it is important to examine whether there is evidence of poor audit quality in the case of failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> It is also important to investigate, from the perspective of audit theory and public policy, whether the auditors of these failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> were punished after the failures. The study examines two consequences for the auditors – disciplinary actions against the auditors by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and client loss. The paper also examines whether the auditor has been sued after the failure of any <b>finance</b> <b>company.</b> The sample is comprised of 37 failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> for which annual reports were available on the website of Companies Office New Zealand. The study finds that auditors who gave unmodified audit opinions are not more likely to face disciplinary actions than those who gave unmodified audit opinions with going concern explanation paragraphs and modified audit opinions. Furthermore, the study utilizes auditor turnover of public listed companies in New Zealand to test another consequence of <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> failures for the auditors – client loss. While there is no significant relationship between disciplinary actions and auditor turnover, a statistically significant relationship is observed between <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> failure and auditor turnover. The study also analyses litigation effect on auditors who involved with <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> failures. Under the primary liability rule – joint and several liability – in New Zealand, auditor is held liable for the loss of the client. The results of this study will be of interest to practitioners, standard setters and law makers, and will fill the literature gap on the impacts of corporate failures on auditors...|$|R

Greater competition may be good for (static) efficiency, but bad for financial stability.

In the case of Albania the margin net interest as an efficiency indicator reacts negatively against the increase of non-performing loans degree. So, their levels and dynamics should be constantly supervised by policy-makers, assessing their implications and preparing the necessary measures.

50|$|GAP waiver {{is a type}} of {{guaranteed}} auto protection.

In other words; someone has a serious accident, the appraiser deems it cost effective to replace rather than repair your vehicle, and they determine actual cash value ("ACV") on such replacement minus deductible (“DED” if applicable) to be less than what is owed to <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> by the borrower. <b>Finance</b> <b>companies</b> refer to this as the loan or lease deficiency. This deficiency is immediately due upon demand of the <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> unless the GAP waiver (or GAP insurance) is purchased. GAP waiver is direct deficiency or debt forgiveness by a <b>finance</b> <b>company.</b> Although GAP waiver and GAP insurance appear to have the same end result, they are differentiated by who can offer it. GAP waiver is offered directly to a borrower by a <b>finance</b> <b>company.</b> Any other offering or way would be GAP insurance as it carries third party indemnification. In other words, GAP insurance and GAP waivers are conceptually different. With a GAP waiver, the lender agrees to extinguish the borrower’s financial contractual obligation under terms of the loan/lease. With GAP insurance, the contractual obligation remains but it is paid for by the insurer on the borrower’s behalf. From a borrower’s perspective, the net effect is not technically the same.|$|R
