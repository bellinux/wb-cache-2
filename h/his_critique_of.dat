5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In <b>his</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{think that}} one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} {{scientific}} revolutions {{has been studied}} by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase {{in the preface to}} <b>his</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Pure Reason (1781). He referred to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of mathematics, physics, and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars. It was against this active background that Kuhn published his work.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, aged 34, Bacalbașa had served in the Assembly of Deputies as a {{representative}} of the Conservative Party. Despite this change in politics, he is mainly credited for his early contributions to Romanian literature, most of which reflect <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> the political mainstream in the monarchical era.

25|$|Marx's {{philosophy}} is thus {{inextricably linked to}} <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> political economy and to his historical interventions in the workers' movement, such as the 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program or The Communist Manifesto, written with Engels (who was observing the Chartist movement) {{a year before the}} Revolutions of 1848. Both after the defeat of the French socialist movement during Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 1851 coup and then after the crushing of the 1871 Paris Commune, Marx's thought transformed itself.|$|E
25|$|One {{especially}} difficult aspect of Hegel's work is his innovation in logic. In response to Immanuel Kant's {{challenge to the}} limits of pure reason, Hegel develops a radically new form of logic, which he called speculative. The difficulty in reading Hegel was perceived in Hegel's own day, and persists into the 21st century. To understand Hegel fully requires paying attention to <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> standard logic, such as the law of contradiction and the law of the excluded middle. Many philosophers who came after Hegel and were influenced by him, whether adopting or rejecting his ideas, did so without fully absorbing his new speculative or dialectical logic.|$|E
25|$|Reid was criticised, {{partly for}} <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> Hume, by Kant and J. S. Mill, who {{were two of}} the most {{important}} influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of a priori knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.|$|E

5000|$|Mathematical {{historian}} Judith Grabiner comments, “Berkeley’s {{criticisms of}} the rigor of the calculus were witty, unkind, and — {{with respect to the}} mathematical practices he was criticizing — essentially correct” [...] While <b>his</b> <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> the mathematical practices were sound, his essay has been criticized on logical and philosophical grounds.|$|R
25|$|Although Boas {{was making}} a very {{specific}} contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.|$|E
25|$|Asturias {{wrote an}} epic trilogy about the {{exploitation}} of the native Indians on banana plantations. This trilogy comprises three novels: Viento fuerte (Strong Wind; 1950), El Papa Verde (The Green Pope; 1954), and Los ojos de los enterrados (The Eyes of the Interred; 1960). It is a fictional account {{of the results of}} foreign control over the Central American banana industry. At first, the volumes were only published in small quantities in his native Guatemala. <b>His</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> foreign control of the banana industry and how Guatemalan natives were exploited eventually earned him the Soviet Union's highest prize, the Lenin Peace Prize. This recognition marked Asturias {{as one of the few}} authors recognized in both the West and the Communist bloc during the period of the Cold War for his literary works.|$|E
25|$|Academic Abdullahi El-Tom, in <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> the book, {{states that}} the latter half {{is not nearly as}} well-argued as the heavily {{statistical}} beginning, making points that are then not substantiated and sometimes falling into polemical statements. For example, the Black Book {{states that the}} equipment that was to be used for the Western Highway Project was diverted to the Northern Highway Project, which is both widely rumored and believed, but no evidence is provided to back it up. El-Tom further makes the following observations: it has an implicit view of Sudan as Islamic; it emphasizes the grievances of Western Sudan (i.e. Darfur and Kordofan) over the other marginalized regions; and it has an unforgiving stance towards all the north, rather than just the three clans identified as controlling the government (i.e. the Shaigiya, the Jaaliyeen and the Danagla).|$|E
50|$|Agobard of Lyon (-840) was a Spanish-born {{priest and}} {{archbishop}} of Lyon, during the Carolingian Renaissance.
