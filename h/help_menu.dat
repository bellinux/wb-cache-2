The main change to the game involves the HUD, which was redesigned so as to accommodate touchscreen controls. For example, rather than the building menu always present onscreen, it is accessed by pressing an icon which opens the [...] "Build Menu".

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to identify and describe task-based documentation; (2) to identify and describe any purported changes in users attitudes when IT migration was preceded by task-based documentation; (3) to suggest implications of task-based documentation on users attitude toward IT acceptance. Questionnaires were given to 150 university students. Of these, all 150 students participated in this study. The study determined the following: (1) if favorable pre-implementation attitudes toward a new e-mail system increase, as a result of training, if users expect it to be easy to learn and use; (2) if user acceptance of an e-mail program increase as expected perceived usefulness increase as delineated by task-based documentation; (3) if task-based documentation is more effective than standard <b>help</b> <b>menus</b> while learning a new application program; and (4) if training that requires active student participation increase the acceptance of a new e-mail system. The following conclusions were reached: (1) Positive pre-implementation attitudes toward a new e-mail system are not affected by training even if the users expect it to be easy to learn and use. (2) User acceptance of an e-mail program does not increase as perceived usefulness increase when aided by task-based documentation. (3) Task-based documentation is not more effective than standard <b>help</b> <b>menus</b> when learning a new application program.

It may also be helpful as a resource to those who have completed a course in ArcView but don’t always remember how to perform particular tasks. This manual does not try to be comprehensive, focusing instead on the basic tools and functions that users new to GIS should know how to use.

40|$|Objective: Combine the MSHA and OSHA {{versions}} of the HazCom Helper into one easy-to-use software tool. Background: MSHA Rule 30 CFR Part 47 and OSHA Rule 29 CFR 1910. 1200 (also known as the HazCom rules) require all companies to develop a written program to track hazardous chemicals at their sites. More specifically, the rule requires that companies list all chemicals and determine which are hazardous; develop a written Hazard Communication Program; label all containers used to store hazardous chemicals; obtain or develop Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemicals stored or produced; provide workers with training in working around hazardous chemicals; and make information about hazardous chemicals available to all workers. Approach: NIOSH personnel developed the HazComWriter to replace the HazCom Helper-MSHA version (NIOSH Publication 2003 - 118) and the HazCom Helper-OSHA version (NIOSH Publication 2005 - 135). The HazComWriter {{is designed to help}} companies write their required HazCom plan and list all hazardous chemicals at a company's site. HazComWriter: This software leads the person responsible for writing the HazCom plan step-by-step through its preparation. Prompts, suggestions, and <b>Help</b> <b>menus</b> are provided to help the writer fill in the proper information. A list of all hazardous chemicals at a site can be entered in Appendix A and the program can be saved and edited when necessary.

Much of the control is managed through the mouse and keyboard-shortcuts, with the game using an interface system like Caesar III, with buttons incorporated on it linked to different types of construction the player needs for their city (housing, roads, schools, warehouses, etc.), as well as buttons to view messages, undo mistakes and cycle through trouble-spots, along with {{a map of the}} region Ancient Egypt extended into, a group of advisers, called Overseers, that the player can rely on for information on the city's development and any problems encountered, and in-game overlays that can detail any rising issues and if housing is getting what it needs for its current level. All aspects of city life, such as housing, religion, warfare, and trade, are designed carefully to closely reflect that of actual Ancient Egyptian cities of the time, including the goods and services that they had available, with names of various pharaohs used in the game along with the appearance of historical characters from the period of Egypt's ancient history; limited encyclopedic information about ancient Egyptian practices is provided in the game's <b>help</b> <b>menu</b> and instruction booklet. While the game uses the deben as its currency, in reality it is not the case as no standardised pieces of metal have been found to indicate the actual currency of Ancient Egypt. Although the puzzle-like aspect of Pharaoh keeps the simulation far from realistic, the game stays true to the chronological order and timing of major events in the history of Egypt, including monument construction, wars and national disasters, the births and deaths of notable leaders, and the founding and fall of ancient cities.|$|E
