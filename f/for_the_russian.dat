5|$|The Bure family made {{precious}} watches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> tsars from 1815 until 1917, and Bure {{was named}} after his great-grandfather, a watchmaker to Tsar Alexander III. As craftspersons to the imperial family, the Bures were granted noble status. After Bure sustained his first serious knee injury in 1995, he pursued the watchmaking business during his rehabilitation period {{in an attempt to}} revive the family business. Fifty replicas of the same watches his ancestors made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> imperial family were made and sold at US$30,000 each. Bure presented three of the gold replicas to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.|$|E
5|$|The family {{resented the}} Russian government's Russification policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend Russian Orthodox Church service and left school with an aversion not only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Tsar and the Russian Empire, {{but for the}} culture, which he knew well.|$|E
5|$|Apologists for the OCA's autocephaly {{claim that}} the decree did not need the {{approval}} of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, as it was an internal matter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Orthodox Church to decide. Many autocephalous churches, the Russian Church included, were not recognized as such for many years, albeit their autocephaly was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.|$|E

5|$|Darejan and {{her party}} were resolutely opposed to George XII's renewed quest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> protection. In 1800, one of Darejan's sons, Alexander, openly broke with his {{half-brother}} and attempted a coup {{with the help}} of his Avar and Iranian allies. The relations in the royal family hit the nadir in July 1800, when George XII forced Queen Dowager Darejan into confinement at her palace in Avlabari, prompting Darejan's sons to mobilize their loyal forces around Tbilisi.|$|E
5|$|His next {{assignment}} was in Yekaterinburg in the Urals, {{where he was}} appointed second in command of a training school for non-commissioned officers attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade. He found this post frustrating, having to dismiss {{nearly a third of}} his initial cadre on medical grounds, and struggling to get supplies and support from the White Army authorities. Despite this, he developed a rapport with his men and an admiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> soldier.|$|E

5|$|Leopold I was crowned on 21 July 1831, {{replacing}} Baron Surlet de Chokier, who {{had served}} as regent since February.

5|$|Some Russian nationalists, such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, {{stated that}} they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008.

5|$|After {{his release}} he {{returned}} to Dorothea's Courland court, where {{he served as a}} tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E

According to Prit Buttar, the Austro-Hungarian army lost 324,000 men in Galicia, including 130,000 as prisoners, while <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> lost 225,000 men, of which 40,000 were captured.

5|$|Born in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, {{the real-life}} Münchhausen fought <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. Upon {{retiring}} in 1760, {{he became a}} minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous tall tales based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which {{was first published in}} Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Bürger. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E

They were off Percola Point on 7 July when a flotilla of eight Russian gunboats was sighted. A boat party led by Lieutenant Hawkey of Implacable made an attempt to cut-out the vessels that evening. Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but Bellerophons Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing stores <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Army also being taken.

5|$|Following the 1911 exhibition, at the {{personal}} request of Sir George White, Coandă {{moved to the}} United Kingdom {{to take a position}} as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a few years. In the next four decades Coandă worked on a great variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like the one made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production. Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Commonwealth forces {{after a long}} siege stormed {{and took}} Smolensk in 1611. At the Kremlin the {{situation}} of the Poles had been worsening despite occasional reinforcements, and the massive national and religious uprising was spreading all over Russia. Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin effectively led the Russians, a new rescue operation attempted by Hetman Chodkiewicz had failed and a capitulation of the Polish and Lithuanian forces at the Kremlin terminated in 1612 their involvement there. Mikhail Romanov, son of the imprisoned in Poland (since his rejection of Sigismund III's demand <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> throne) Patriarch Filaret, became the new tsar in 1613.|$|E

Hvidøre and some of Marie's {{jewellery}} were sold. With Olga's inheritance, Kulikovsky {{and his family were}} able to purchase Knudsminde Farm, several miles outside of Copenhagen. Kulikovsky was appointed to the board of a Russian insurance company based in Copenhagen, and oversaw the running of the farm.

In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at Sofiero Castle, Sweden, with Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and his wife, Louise. Olga began to sell her own paintings, of Russian and Danish scenes, with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin. Some of the proceeds were donated to the charities she supported.|$|E

And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, they {{were designed}} to resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.|$|E
