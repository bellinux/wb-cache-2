40|$|This study explores ways {{to support}} job {{matching}} in Canada. Many individuals experience difficulty in finding work {{related to their}} skills and training; likewise many Canadian employers are experiencing difficulty finding skilled workers. This mismatch is attributed to an inadequate labour market information system. An examination of three jurisdictions is used to identify the specific inadequacies that hinder job matching in Canada. To address these inadequacies, three policy options are assessed {{on their ability to}} meet four criteria. Results indicate that a comprehensive survey on job vacancies and career <b>information</b> <b>seminars</b> in secondary schools can help mitigate the mismatch in the labour market. I recommend immediately implementing a new job vacancy survey and career <b>information</b> <b>seminars</b> in secondary schools. The government should also give future consideration for establishing an independent agency responsible for labour market information...|$|R

40|$|Promotion of {{self-sufficiency}} {{in patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis in selected daily activities at the home environment The topic of my bachelor thesis is promotion of self-sufficiency {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease the main symptom of which is damage of mainly small joints, muscles, ligaments, {{but it may also}} manifest itself in internal organs of the body. This leads to significant motion limitation and thus greatly deteriorates the quality of life and self-sufficiency of affected people. Since it is women who suffer from this disease most, we concentrated on the area of cooking, eating and personal hygiene. The role of nurses is to lead patients to self-sufficiency. There are more possibilities how to provide the patients with limited self-sufficiency with support, but the thesis is focused on the aids to promote self-sufficiency in cooking, eating and personal hygiene. To carry out the research survey we stated six goals. The first goal was to find out what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis have at their disposition for cooking food and eating. The second objective was to determine what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis have at their disposition in the area of personal hygiene. The third objective was to determine what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis miss in the area of cooking and eating. The fourth goal was to find out what aids to promote self-sufficiency the patients with rheumatoid arthritis miss in the area of personal hygiene. The fifth objective was to create a brochure to promote self-sufficiency of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in cooking, eating and personal hygiene. The sixth goal was to apply the booklet on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The goals of the thesis were met. At the turn of February and March 2011 the qualitative research survey was conducted. For data collection the method of questioning, the non-standardized interview technique was used. Using pre-prepared questions we interviewed the respondents with rheumatoid arthritis who are treated on an outpatient basis. Based on information and available aids mapping, a booklet to promote self-sufficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was created and subsequently tested. The research group consisted of six respondents suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The respondents were selected according to predetermined criteria, which were the suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, disease stages II., III., IV, when self-sufficiency is strongly influenced and monocyclic, polycyclic and progressive course of rheumatoid arthritis is present. The research sample for an inquiry was selected by the same criteria, and it consisted of 10 respondents. The thesis revealed which specific aids are available to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and which are missing. Based on obtained information and the aids mapped, a booklet to promote self-sufficiency of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the area of cooking, eating and personal hygiene was created. We believe that steps to improve self-sufficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the areas of cooking, eating and personal hygiene at home environment involve the booklet provision to outpatient and inpatient departments of rheumatology. To address the widest possible population of rheumatics with damaged self-sufficiency and on the basis of positive responses to the booklet, we accepted the offer to publish a series article about promotion of self-sufficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the magazine ?REVMATIK?. In our opinion, positive contribution could also be organization of an <b>information</b> <b>seminar</b> on aids to promote self-sufficiency for patients and nurses in rheumatology units and for members of the Rheumatism - league and students of ZSF...|$|E
