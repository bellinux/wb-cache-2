40|$|We {{present a}} model to predict the {{luminosity}} function for radio galaxies and their linear size distribution at any redshift. The model takes a black hole mass function and Eddington ratio distribution as input and tracks the evolution of radio sources, taking into account synchrotron, adiabatic and <b>inverse</b> Compton energy <b>losses.</b> We first test the model at z = 2 where plenty of radio data are available and show that the radio luminosity function (RLF) is consistent with observations. We are able to reproduce the break in luminosity function that separates locally the Fanaroff-Riley class I and Fanaroff-Riley class I radio sources. Our prediction for linear size distribution at z = 2 matches the observed distribution too. We then use our model to predict an RLF and linear size distribution at z = 6, as this is the epoch when radio galaxies {{can be used as}} probes of reionization. We demonstrate that higher <b>inverse</b> Compton <b>losses</b> lead to shorter source lifetimes and smaller sizes at high redshifts. The predicted sizes are consistent with the generally observed trend with redshift. We evolve the z = 2 RLF based on observed quasar space densities at high redshifts, and show that our RLF prediction at z = 6 is consistent. Finally, we predict the detection of 0. 63, 0. 092 and 0. 0025 z ≥ 6 sources deg 2 at flux density limits of 0. 1, 0. 5 and 3. 5 mJy.

The proportional differentiated admission control (PDAC) provides a predictable and controllable network service for real-time traffic in terms of blocking probability. To define the mentioned service, proportional differentiated service equality has been considered and the PDAC problem has been formulated. The PDAC solution is defined by the <b>inverse</b> Erlang <b>loss</b> function. It requires complicated calculations. To reduce the complexity of the problem, an asymptotic approximation of the Erlang B formula [4] has been applied. However, even in this case, the simplified PDAC problem remains unsolved.|$|R

Our monitoring of radio-quiet quasars has for the first time clearly detected such intranight variability, with peak-to-peak amplitudes ~ 1 %, occurring with a duty cycle of ~ 1 / 6. The matched BL Lacs have both higher variability amplitudes and duty cycles when observed in the same fashion. We show that the much less pronounced intranight variability of the radio-quiet quasars relative to BL Lacs can be understood in terms of a modest misalignment of the jets in radio-quiet quasars from the line-of-sight. We thus infer that relativistic particle jets may well also emerge from radio-quiet quasars, but while traversing the short optical-emitting distances, they could be snuffed out, possibly through <b>inverse</b> Compton <b>losses</b> in the nuclear region.

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} fully selfconsistent SSC model with {{particle}} acceleration due to shock and stochastic acceleration (Fermi-I and Fermi-II-Processes re-spectively) to model the quiescent spectral energy distribu-tion (SED) observed from PKS 2155. The simultaneous August/September 2008 multiwavelength data of H. E. S. S., Fermi, RXTE/SWIFT and ATOM give new constraints to the high-energy peak in the SED concerning its curvature. We find that, in our model, a monoenergetic injection of electrons at γ 0 = 910 into the model region, which are ac-celerated by Fermi-I- and Fermi-II-processes while suffering synchrotron and <b>inverse</b> Compton <b>losses,</b> finally leads to the observed SED of PKS 2155 - 30. 4 shown in H.

Further, these advancing overpressured lobes could compress the denser interstellar gas clouds of the galaxies engulfed by them and thus trigger starbursts. This can probably account for much of the intense star-formation activity witnessed beyond z ~ 1. 5. Also, the sweeping up of the ISM of the gas-rich galaxies by the rapidly advancing radio lobes may well be responsible for the widespread metal pollution of the IGM and proto-galaxies at high redshifts.

40|$|The {{re-establishment}} {{of conscious}} awareness after discontinuing general anesthesia {{has often been}} assumed to be the <b>inverse</b> of <b>loss</b> of consciousness. This is despite the obvious asymmetry in the initiation and termination of natural sleep. In order to characterize the restoration of consciousness after surgery, we recorded frontal electroencephalograph (EEG) from 100 patients {{in the operating room}} during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. We have defined, for the first time, 4 steady-state patterns of anesthetic maintenance based on the relative EEG power in the slow-wave (, 14 Hz) frequency bands that dominate sleep and anesthesia. Unlike single-drug experiments performed in healthy volunteers, we found that surgical patients exhibited greater electroencephalographic heterogeneity while re-establishing conscious awareness after drug discontinuation. Moreover, these emergence patterns could be broadly grouped according to the duration and rapidity of transitions amongst these slow-wave dominated brain states that precede awakening. Most patients progressed gradually from a pattern characterized by strong peaks of delta (0. 5 – 4 Hz) and alpha/spindle (8 – 14 Hz) power (‘Slow-Wave Anesthesia’) to a state marked by low delta-spindle power (‘Non Slow-Wave Anesthesia’) before awakening. However, 31 % of patients transitioned abruptly from Slow-Wave Anesthesia to waking; they {{were also more likely to}} express pain in the post-operative period. Our results, based on sleep-staging classification, provide the first systematized nomenclature for tracking brain states under general anesthesia from maintenance to emergence, an...|$|R
