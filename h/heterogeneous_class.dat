40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a new method to {{construct}} fuzzy prototypes of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>classes,</b> in a supervised learning context. <b>Heterogeneous</b> <b>classes</b> are classes where the coexistence of far behaviours can be observed. Our approach consists in two stages. The first one enables to discover, in an original method, the different behaviours within a class by decomposing it in subclasses. In the second stage, we construct a fuzzy prototype for each subclass by using typicality degrees. Thanks to this decomposition of a class and to this characterization of typical behaviours, we propose an intuitive summarization of a class. We illustrate the advantages of our method on both artificial and real dataset...|$|R

As a result, they were a relatively <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>class</b> incorporating many wartime advances, but ultimately based on a hull that was too small and with an armament too light to be true first-rate vessels equivalent of their contemporaries.

For example, a meta-analysis published by Francisco Ruiz in 2012 looked at 16 studies comparing ACT to standard CBT.

The author did find separation between ACT and CBT on the [...] "primary outcome" [...] - a <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>class</b> of 14 separate outcome measures that were aggregated into the effect size analysis. This analysis however {{is limited by the}} highly heterogeneous nature of the outcome variables used in the analysis, which has the tendency to increase the number needed to treat (NNT) to replicate the effect size reported. More limited measures, such as depression, anxiety and quality of life decrease the NNT, making the analysis more clinically relevant, and on these measures ACT did not outperform CBT.|$|E
