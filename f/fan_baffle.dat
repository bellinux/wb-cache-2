5000|$|Corvair Powerglide is a fully {{automatic}}, two-speed, rwd aluminum-cased {{automatic transmission}} mounted {{directly to the}} forward face of the cast iron differential housing. It uses a three-element, welded assembly 10 in diameter torque converter mounted remotely on the rear face of the differential, (that also incorporates the starter ring gear, and a centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>baffle</b> for cooling, via slots in the engine bellhousing) and is driven directly from the engine crankshaft by a flexplate inside the engine bellhousing. The selector quadrant is arranged R-N-D-L, or Reverse, Neutral, Drive and Low, with no [...] "Park" [...] (except in Pontiac's 1963 version, redesigned to handle the increased torque of a new V8 engine in Tempest and LeMans, added {{by means of a}} separate lever). Range selection is via dash-mounted selector lever operating a sheathed cable that moves a spool valve range selector in the transmission valve body.|$|E
5000|$|... "Jesus Says" [...] {{introduced}} {{the world to}} Ash's second full-length album, and left some <b>fans</b> <b>baffled</b> by its more raw sound. Nevertheless, it was a hit for the band and is considered somewhat of a fan favourite. Tim said of the song: 'This was written {{at the height of}} our touring madness. It's about being hung over and homesick in New York City - 'a million lightyears from home'. The song may have also originally been called [...] "Ditto". Tim Wheeler has stated the song has no religious meaning, although that did not stop some controversy being built over it. A promo poster showing a cartoon Jesus saying [...] "Ash" [...] was heavily criticised.|$|R
60|$|The {{attitude}} of the servants had not changed towards her, the cook continuing to observe a kind of neutrality which was scarcely benevolent, while the housemaid's animosity was still active; but it had ceased to trouble her very much. Since the evening on which <b>Fan</b> had <b>baffled</b> her by blowing out the candle, Rosie had not attempted to inflict corporal punishment beyond an occasional pinch or slap, but contented herself by mocking and jeering, and sometimes spitting at her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} intended a song titled, [...] "Promise the Moon" [...] {{to be on}} the album, but it was replaced by [...] "I'll Be There For You" [...] because the record company thought that nothing could be pulled as a single. However, keyboard credits were given in the cassette and {{on the back of the}} LP to John Purdell for [...] "Promise the Moon" [...] and [...] "Kiss of Death." [...] <b>Fans</b> were <b>baffled</b> by this until liner notes in the 2003 re-master explained it.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} keys to 10 Ft. Ganja Plant's legacy is their {{consistent}} shroud of mystery, considering that, for the most part, <b>fans</b> are <b>baffled</b> as to whom the unfamiliar guest artists are in particular as there are often no personnel credits featured on any of their albums. Their key vocalists however are Jay Champany, Craig Akira Fujita, Nate Silas Richardson, and up until 2015, Kevin Kinsella [...] While their music today has {{a wide range of}} styles, most of their music often has a more traditional 1970s Jamaican sound to it.|$|R
5000|$|On September 16, 2010, {{members of}} Hey Girl {{performed}} {{at an event}} in Nanchang which did not include Yeun Fei. Instead, {{it was a new}} member who was emerged from the event's promotional poster and the Hey Girl members' blogs. Ya Tou later confirmed in her Sina blog that Yeun Fei is no long a member of Hey Girl, but will continue to appear on the [...] "Black Lollipop" [...] show. The newest member, Chi Ting (子庭), has not yet appeared on any of the Channel V related shows and many <b>fans</b> seemed <b>baffled</b> and upset about the departure of Yeun Fei. Further speculations have suggested that the switch maybe due to Yeun Fei's high-profile relationship with one of the Didi [...] "EDD", which the management frowns upon.|$|R
5000|$|On September 15, 1986 {{their second}} studio album titled Pateando piedras was {{released}} under the EMI label, [...] Highlights from this album are [...] "¿Por qué no se van?", [...] "Muevan las industrias" [...] and especially [...] "El Baile de los que sobran" [...] considered, a classic of the genre, remembered {{in much of}} Latin America, almost worth the whole album as a rock anthem. [...] "...Under our shoes, mud plus concrete, The future is nothing like what was promised during those twelve games (referencing grades 1 thru 12 of education).Others learned secrets we weren't told. Others were truly given that thing we call education. They asked us for effort, They asked us for dedication And for what?! So that we could end up dancing and kicking stones!...English translation of Baile De Los Que Sobran"(Dance Of The Ones Left Behind.) The album sold five thousand copies in the first ten days of release. A first by a young band in Chile, and in two months and {{two days after the}} album's release it achieved platinum status. Two months after the launch of its second album in November 1986, the band played at Estadio Chile in front of eleven thousand people. They were considered [...] "The hope in Viña" [...] by the public at the National Stadium Chile. At the International Song Festival of Vina del Mar, 1987, the band was not in the official program of the Festival of Viña del Mar, something that <b>baffled</b> <b>fans</b> and the media. instead other groups such as: 24 Upa!, plus Cinema, plus Argentine rock group Soda Stereo, GIT the latter band being the most popular at the event. The trio from San Miguel expressed their rejection of Soda Stereo during interviews.|$|R
