30|$|To date, {{very few}} studies have tried to solve the {{multicast}} recipient maximization problem in wireless relay networks containing selfish nodes. In [23], the authors propose a truthful multicast routing scheme for selfish wireless networks. By reporting the cost of each link, each node decides independently the route that will maximize its benefit. Since this study tries to solve the MEM problem, it differs from our approach. Wei and Gilin[24] presented a cooperative relay scheme for a WWAN/WLAN two-hop relay network. A selfish <b>dual-mode</b> <b>terminal</b> can be encouraged to relay data by payment from other nodes. However, under this scheme, each node, including each mobile user, can work as a relay node, and {{the scale of the}} network is limited to only two hops. Most importantly, none of the above studies consider AMC. Therefore, they let each sender transmit a stream separately to each receiver instead of multicasting it only once. In contrast, under our model, a transmitted stream can be received simultaneously by several subscribers as long as the channel conditions allow. Lee et al. [25] proposed an incentive-based transmission framework to maintain fairness in multi-hop wireless backhaul networks with selfish Transit Access Points. It is not suitable for our multicast scenario because the mechanism is designed for maintaining fairness between unicast traffic.|$|E

Recently, researchers {{have begun to}} study such non-cooperative communication systems within a game theory framework and strive to engineer the system to prevent performance degradation under non-cooperative behaviors. The WWAN/WLAN two-hop-relay system described in [1] integrates two types of wireless technologies to improve wireless access throughput and coverage. The relay nodes in the two-hop-relay system can be wireless relay routers deployed by wireless service providers, or dual-mode users who voluntarily relay traffic for other users. However, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that all <b>dual-mode</b> <b>terminals</b> are selfish and are not willing to relay for other users without an incentive. In this paper, we will use the basic concepts of game theory, especially the concept of the Nash Equilibrium, to design our scheduling algorithms. Several scheduling algorithms, including the maximum rate C/I scheduler, the proportional fair scheduler, and the round robin scheduler, are examined to understand performance while operating under the assumption that all users are selfish. Under the C/I scheduler or the proportional fair scheduler, Nash Equilibriums exist at the operating points where no user will relay for other users—an undesirable situation. Under the round robin scheduler, selfish users are indifferent on relaying voluntarily or not relaying. Therefore, we are inspired to design a novel incentive scheduler.

Several scheduling algorithms, including the maximum rate C/I scheduler, the proportional fair scheduler, and the round robin scheduler, are examined to understand performance while operating under the assumption that all users are selfish. Under the C/I scheduler or the proportional fair scheduler, Nash Equilibriums exist at the operating points where no user will relay for other users [...] -an undesirable situation. Under the round robin scheduler, selfish users are indifferent on relaying voluntarily or not relaying. Therefore, we are inspired to design a novel incentive scheduling algorithm to encourage relay. By applying the proposed incentive scheduler at the base station, all selfish users relay cooperatively at the Nash Equilibrium. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{integration}} of 3 rd generation (3 G) cellular networks and the IEEE 802. 11 Wireless Local Area Networks has drawn considerable {{attention from the}} research and commercial communities. Emerging <b>dual-mode</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> could provide flexibility and system performance enhancement by providing seamless roaming between 3 G WWANs and 802. 11 WLANs. In this paper, we proposed a novel integrated WWAN/WLAN two-hop-relay architecture that both enhances the system capacity of 3 G cellular systems and extends the system coverage area of 802. 11 terminals. The proposed two-hop-relay architecture utilizes temporal channel quality variation to achieve increased system capacity. Typically, the system throughput is increased by 200 - 400 % in a HDR system.

On the other hand, IEEE 802. 11 (WLAN) offers much higher data rates, comparable to 3 G and other wireless local area networks, to users with low mobility characteristics in smaller cell environments. Where UMTS/WLAN networks overlap, a <b>dual-mode</b> UMTS/WLAN <b>terminal</b> could access high bandwidth data services where WLAN coverage is offered and use UMTS services elsewhere. This leads to fundamental questions on how UMTS and WLAN can be integrated, It were build two different scenarios, one for loose coupling scheme {{and the other}} one for open coupling scheme. In loose coupling scheme both billing and authentication is common for UMTS and WLAN networks while in case of open coupling scheme only billing is common for WLAN and UMTS where as they use there own separate authentication servers. The OPNET simulated results reveal that the loose coupling architecture performance is better than the open coupling architecture for all the applied applications and measurement parameters during the Mobility between WLAN and UMTS...|$|R

The raise of such new convergent services {{is due to}} the expansion of IP networks based on the availability of innovative advanced coding formats such as H. 264, which reduce network bandwidth requirements providing good video quality, and the rapid growth in the supply of <b>dual-mode</b> WiFi cellular <b>terminals.</b> This paper presents a new and simple dimensioning model of conversational video over wireless LAN. WLAN is addressed under the optimal network throughput and the perspective of video quality. The maximum number of simultaneous users resulting from throughput is limited by the collisions taking place in the shared medium with the statistical contention protocol. The video quality is conditioned by the packet loss in the contention protocol. Both approaches are analyzed within the scope of the advanced video codecs used in conversational video over IP, to conclude that conversational video dimensioning based on network throughput is not enough to ensure a satisfactory user experience, and video quality has to be taken also into account.|$|R
