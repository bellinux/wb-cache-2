40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} flame-retardant binding agents {{for the production}} of base material (laminates) of high quality for printed circuit boards. The binding agents represent a single-component system consisting of a mixture of diandicyanate prepolymers (binding time 4 to 8 hours), dianepoxy resin (<b>epoxide</b> <b>equivalent</b> 170 to 400), a mixture (<b>epoxide</b> <b>equivalent</b> 300 to 400, bromine content 37 to 49 percent by weight) consisting of novolak epoxy resin and tetrabromine dianepoxy resin and their conversion products comprising tetrabromodiane, and diane and/or tetrabromodiane, {{in the form of a}} solution, comprising a solids content of 20 to 80 percent by weight, in an organic solvent or solvent mixture, such as aliphatic ketones and/or aromatic hydrocarbons. These flame-retardant binding agents ensure good copper adhesion at 533 K, high storage stability and, high dimensional stability due to the height of their glass transition temperatures and low solvent absorption or swelling in solvent...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis {{of a novel}} conformationally rigid dimer 106 {{containing}} a cyclopropyl-phosphonate linkage is described. A novel 3 '-phosphonate building block 105 is synthesized and characterized. During the synthesis of the common precursor 86, unusual base-promoted desilylation of epoxide 80 and vinylselenides 85 and 87 are reported. The instability of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) and the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) protecting groups {{may be attributed to}} the participation of the uracil C 2 -oxygen anion. The synthesis of a number of novel bicyclic phosphonate analogs 92 b to 95 b is described. In search of alternate cyclopropanation methods, dimesylate 113 was synthesized and characterized. Dimethyl methyl phosphonate anion treatment produced 2 '-keto nucleoside derivative 114. The synthesis of a novel reactive <b>epoxide</b> <b>equivalent,</b> the 2 ', 3 '-cyclic sulfate 119, is described. Dimethyl methylphosphonate anion treatment produced a furane derivative 120 in trace amounts. Reaction of azide anion with cyclic sulfate proceeded regioselectively and gave only 3 '-azido nucleoside 122. The observed regioselectivity is novel and may be of great interest to nucleic acid chemists. *A novel class of galactose and lactose-based glycoconjugates 23 and 24 has been synthesized and fully characterized. During the preparation of these glycoconjugates, novel N-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and N-carboxybenzyl (Cbz) -protected galatosylated and lactosylated linker intermediates 7, 8, 11 and 12 have been synthesized and characterized. The synthesis of a new active cholane intermediates 19 and 26 is also described. **Please refer to dissertation for diagrams...|$|E
40|$|New nanocomposites {{composed}} of cellulose nanofibers or “whiskers” and an epoxy resin were prepared. Cellulose whiskers with aspect ratios of ∼ 10 and ∼ 84 were isolated from cotton and sea animals called tunicates, respectively. Suspensions of these whiskers in dimethylformamide were {{combined with an}} oligomeric difunctional diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with an <b>epoxide</b> <b>equivalent</b> weight of 185 − 192 and a diethyl toluenediamine-based curing agent. Thin films were produced by casting these mixtures and subsequent curing. The whisker content was systematically varied between 4 and 24 % v/v. Electron microscopy {{studies suggest that the}} whiskers are evenly dispersed within the epoxy matrix. Dynamic mechanical thermoanalysis revealed that the glass transition temperature (T g) of the materials was not significantly influenced by the incorporation of the cellulose filler. Between room temperature and 150 °C, i. e., below T g, the tensile storage moduli (E ′) of the nanocomposites increased modestly, for example from 1. 6 GPa for the neat polymer to 4. 9 and 3. 6 GPa for nanocomposites comprising 16 % v/v tunicate or cotton whiskers. The relative reinforcement was more significant at 185 °C (i. e., above T g), where E ′ was increased from ∼ 16 MPa (neat polymer) to ∼ 1. 6 GPa (tunicate) or ∼ 215 MPa (cotton). The mechanical properties of the new materials are well-described by the percolation model and are the result of the formation of a percolating whisker network in which stress transfer is facilitated by strong interactions between the whiskers...|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{criterion for}} epoxy resins is the epoxide content. This is commonly expressed as the epoxy equivalent weight, {{which is the}} number of <b>epoxide</b> <b>equivalents</b> in 1 kg of resin (Eq./kg), or as the equivalent weight, which is the weight in grammes of resin containing 1 mole <b>equivalent</b> of <b>epoxide</b> (g/mol).

5000|$|It is {{prepared}} by O-alkylation of bisphenol A with epichlorohydrin. This reaction mainly affords bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, {{as well as}} some oligomer. The degree of polymerization may be as low as 0.1. [...] The epoxide content of such epoxy resins is of interest. This parameter is commonly expressed as the epoxide number, which is the number of <b>epoxide</b> <b>equivalents</b> in 1 kg of resin (Eq./kg), or as the equivalent weight, which is the weight in grams of resin containing 1 mole <b>equivalent</b> of <b>epoxide</b> (g/mol).|$|R
40|$|An unusual cascade {{rearrangement}} {{has been}} noticed as a competitive reaction during {{the treatment of}} norbornyl appended cyclopentanediols with a Lewis acid (LA) : a BF 3 -Et 2 O mediated pinacol–pinacolone rearrangement. Deketalization and pinacolone rearrangement occur at two different sites in the molecule and {{are responsible for the}} observed cascade rearrangement product. However, deketalization appears to be triggering the cascade steps. The kinetically more stable pinacolone product with an exo-Me group was observed {{in the case of the}} bromo analogue, whereas, the thermodynamically more stable pinacolone product with an endo-Me group was observed in the case of the chloro analogue. Epimerization via tautomerization of one diastereomer to the other diastereomer under Lewis acid reflux conditions is possible. On the contrary, the diol <b>equivalent</b> <b>epoxides</b> provide only the diastereomeric mixture of pinacolone products under similar LA reaction conditions. The lower yields observed in the case of the epoxides are due to unwanted side reactions taking place between the two competitive reactive centers, namely, ketal and epoxide. Further, a sequence of elimination, nucleophilic substitution and Ritter type hydrolysis reactions of the epoxides resulted in unexpected elimination products. This transformation not only facilitates a regioselective epoxide opening, but also provides a new route for the preparation of allylic amides of the norbornyl appended cyclopentane ring system...|$|R
40|$|Biosynthesis of the {{leukotriene}} A (LTA) {{class of}} epoxide is a lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformation requiring a fatty acid hydroperoxide substrate containing {{at least three}} double bonds. Here, we report on biosynthesis of a dienoic analog of LTA epoxides via a different enzymatic mechanism. Beginning with homolytic cleavage of the hydroperoxide moiety, a catalase/peroxidase-related hemoprotein from Anabaena PCC 7120, which occurs in a fusion protein with a linoleic acid 9 R-lipoxygenase, dehydrates 9 R-hydroperoxylinoleate to a highly unstable epoxide. Using methods we developed for isolating extremely labile compounds, we prepared and purified the epoxide and characterized its structure as 9 R, 10 R-epoxy-octadeca- 11 E, 13 E-dienoate. This epoxide hydrolyzes to stable 9, 14 -diols that were reported before in linoleate autoxidation (Hamberg, M. 1983. Autoxidation of linoleic acid: Isolation and structure of four dihydroxy octadecadienoic acids. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 752 : 353 – 356) and in incubations with the Anabaena enzyme (Lang, I., C. Göbel, A. Porzel, I. Heilmann, and I. Feussner. 2008. A lipoxygenase with linoleate diol synthase activity from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120. Biochem. J. 410 : 347 – 357). We also prepared an <b>equivalent</b> <b>epoxide</b> from 13 S-hydroperoxylinoleate using a “biomimetic” chemical method originally described for LTA 4 synthesis and showed that like LTA 4, the C 18. 2 epoxide conjugates readily with glutathione, a potential metabolic fate in vivo. We compare and contrast the mechanisms of LTA-type allylic epoxide synthesis by lipoxygenase, catalase/peroxidase, and chemical transformations. These findings provide {{new insights into the}} reactions of linoleic acid hydroperoxides and extend the known range of catalytic activities of catalase-related hemoproteins...|$|R
