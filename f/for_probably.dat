5|$|The {{technical}} investigations Butler {{conducted during}} her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications. The {{culmination of the}} research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition was small, {{with a handful of}} paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the Annunciation, which came from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and Saint Barbara, loaned from Antwerp. Two Saint Christophers, one in Philadelphia and the other from the Louvre, are considered to be by workshop members. From Cleveland came a John the Baptist in the Landscape, thought to be by van Eyck followers. The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> {{the first time since the}} 15th century.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the accusations}} and his {{becoming}} a monk, John {{seems to have}} retained Romanos' confidence, <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> in 929 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Bulgaria. Officially his mission was to reconcile Tsar Peter (r. 927–969) with his younger brother Ivan, who had unsuccessfully revolted against him and {{had been forced to}} become a monk, but in reality he was to bring Ivan to Constantinople. As soon as Ivan was in Constantinople, he abandoned his monastic habit and married a Byzantine noblewoman. John and Romanos' eldest son and co-emperor Christopher Lekapenos (r. 921–931) were witnesses at the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|The English {{had found}} the Antwerp money market short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of Cologne and Augsburg as well, but as events {{unfolded}} in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed <b>for,</b> <b>probably</b> as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower. The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River Scheldt leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.|$|E

With Ben-Hur, the two men have given most of the fortunes to the church of Antioch.

Learning that the Christians in Rome are suffering {{at the hands of}} Emperor Nero, Ben-Hur and his friends decide to help. Ben-Hur, Esther and Malluch sail to Rome, where they decided to build an underground church. It will survive through the ages and comes {{to be known as the}} Catacomb of Callixtus.|$|E

In the Kardomah Café, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins. The group of writers, musicians and artists became known as [...] "The Kardomah Gang". In 1933, Thomas visited London <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> the first time.|$|E

Failing to locate the vehicle, he spotted five Italian Breda Ba.65 ground-attack aircraft south of Sidi Barrani and immediately engaged them, gaining credit <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> destroying one, although the Italians reported all aircraft as returning to base. No.80 Squadron redeployed to Greece the following month, to assist in resisting the Italian invasion. There Cullen achieved his first confirmed victory, over a Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 three-engined bomber near the Kassandra Peninsula on 30December. He was promoted to flight lieutenant the next day.|$|E

The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as {{successful}} as Amy Grant. At the age of 15, she heard Queen's [...] "Killer Queen," [...] which inspired her to pursue a career in music. She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the [...] "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" [...] inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: [...] "Pet Sounds {{is one of my favorite}} records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds." [...] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as [...] "the only things I listened to <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> two years straight." ...|$|E

500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E

2500|$|The Executive Committee of the National Security Council (commonly {{referred}} to as simply the Executive Committee or ExComm) was a body of United States government officials that convened to advise President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. It was composed of the regular members of the National Security Council, along with other men whose advice the President deemed useful during the crisis. EXCOMM was formally established by National Security Action Memorandum 196 on October 22, 1962. [...] It {{was made up of}} twelve full members in addition to the president. [...] Advisers frequently sat in on the meetings, which were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House's West Wing and secretly recorded by tape machines activated by Kennedy. None of the other committee members knew the meetings were being recorded, save <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> the president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.|$|E

2500|$|His {{ability to}} {{correctly}} identify the biggest goats {{of a game}} is also widely admired, particularly when contrasted to archrival Russell Hantz's inability to not only keep the respect of a jury as Rob can, but to accurately judge the weakest opponents {{to bring to the}} end as Rob does. [...] However, many fans criticize Rob for his huge advantage in being a four-time player and having no real competition the entire season, giving him perhaps the easiest win in Survivor history. His tribemates were criticized for being too starstruck to act against Rob. Some fans also criticize him <b>for</b> <b>probably</b> having been unable to beat anyone other than his 2 ultimate goats (based upon cast interviews, amongst other indicators). [...] The jury has even indicated Phillip Sheppard could have beaten him had he followed through with his plan to [...] "own his game" [...] and reveal that he had purposely played the villain role to get taken to the end by Rob, and in doing so had duped Rob and his entire alliance. Instead Sheppard was rude, lashed out at Julie Wolfe after she had asked him if his son would be proud of the way he played the game, and gave all the credit to Rob, thus receiving only 1 vote (from Ralph Kiser, the one jury member Phillip showed respect towards at Final Tribal and throughout the game) and giving Rob the easy finish glove side.|$|E
