5000|$|Perennial {{water body}} usually refers to mainly liquid fresh water, {{as opposed to}} sea and glaciers or other ice. Most {{frequently}} the term refers to running water (lotic ecosystems) as in perennial streams and large rivers, but the distinction between perennial and non-perennial water is of equal importance in lentic aquatic ecosystems, those {{that are associated with}} relatively still terrestrial waters such as lakes and ponds. Simplistically a perennial water body is one that keeps full or flowing throughout the year for all or most years, but in practice there are degrees and kinds of distinction. The definition is not precise, because most water bodies vary in fullness according to the season, and according to the heaviness of precipitation and other factors during any given year. Also, the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in many such water bodies as do not actually dry out, may nonetheless drop so drastically that their surface area is greatly reduced. They even may be split into several separate water bodies with dry land between, either arid or covered with vegetation. The internal ecology of such water may differ drastically between periods of drought and deep water. In some cases the seasonal cycle is ecologically important, whereas in other examples <b>exceptional</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> are too rare to be taken routinely into account. There also may be effectively permanent changes; increasingly frequently even large rivers have lost their perennial status under the burden of the human demand for fresh water for purposes of agriculture, industry or the needs of the populations of large cities. The Colorado River for instance has run dry for extended periods in most years since 1960 without reaching the sea. Intermittent or ephemeral streams are those that run dry repeatedly, either seasonally or soon after rain stops. Some definitions of perennial water bodies specifically include those that only are perennial except in years of severe or unusual drought.|$|R

30|$|The Mw 9.3 great Sumatra-Andaman {{earthquake}} of December 26, 2004 induced <b>water</b> <b>level</b> {{changes in}} Fairbanks, Alaska, at an epicentral distance of 10, 800 km. Spike like <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes {{followed by a}} step of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rise were observed in at least four wells. We modeled the timing and magnitude of the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rise {{using a combination of}} a linear trend and a step function. We calculated the misfit between the observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises and our model by systematically shifting the timing of occurrence of step in <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The minimum value of cumulative misfit suggested the timing of occurrence of steps. A previous study showed persistent <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises in all these wells from the 2002 Denali fault earthquake and it’s major aftershocks. From those observations, we developed an empirical relationship between <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes, epicentral distances and earthquake magnitude.

The estimated average <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes due to the Sumatra earthquake using that relationship was in agreement with the observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes.

This issue differs from the large regional drawdown issues {{in the northeast and}} southeast, where <b>water</b> <b>level</b> declines are mainly in the confined or semi-confined systems not well connected to surface waters. The problem has been well documented in the central sands region of the state (parts of Portage, Waushara, Waupaca, Adams, and Marquette Counties), where 20 % of the state’s groundwater is pumped from over 3000 high capacity wells, dominantly for irrigation (Buchwald 2009). Dozens of lakes and potentially hundreds of stream miles may be affected. Some lakes have completely dried, most notably Long Lake near Plainfield.
