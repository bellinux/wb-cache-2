It is typically used in mats, brushes and sacking. Mature brown coir fibres contain more lignin and less cellulose than fibres such as flax and cotton, so are stronger but less flexible. White coir fibres harvested from coconuts before they are ripe are white or light brown in color and are smoother and finer, but also weaker. They are generally spun to make yarn used in mats or rope.|$|E

Unidirectional Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (UD CFRP) and Unidirectional Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (UD GFRP) composite specimens were fabricated and tested in tension. The morphology of fractured surfaces was studied at various locations to identify failure mechanism and characteristic fractographic features. CFRP composites displayed transverse crack propagation and the fracture surface showed three distinct regions, viz., crack origin, propagation and final failure. Significant {{variations in the}} fractographic features were noticed in crack propagation and final failure regions. Crack propagation region exhibited brittle fracture with chevron lines emanating from the crack origin. The entire crack propagation region exhibited radial marks on the <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> broken ends. On the other hand, the final fracture region revealed longitudinal matrix splitting and radial marks in majority of locations, and chop marks at some locations. The change in fracture mode in the final fracture was attributed to superimposition of bending loads.

40|$|Dietary fibre {{has been}} {{consumed}} for centuries with known health benefits, but defining dietary fibre {{is a real}} challenge. From a functional perspective, dietary fibre is described as supporting laxation, attenuating blood glucose responses and assisting with cholesterol lowering. The problem is different types of dietary fibre have different effects, and new effects are increasingly observed, such as the influence on gut microbiota. Thus, a single definition {{may need to be}} described in more generic terms. Rather than being bound by a few functional definitions, we may need to embrace the possibilities of new horizons, and derive a working definition of dietary fibre based on a set of conceptual principles, rather than the limited definitions we have to date. To begin this process, a review of <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> types and their physiological effects would be helpful. Dietary fibre is a complex group of substances, and there is a growing interest in specific effects linked to fibre type. Different fractions of dietary fibre have different physiological properties, yet there is a paucity of literature covering the effects of all fibres.

50|$|In {{order to}} be effective, a layer of porous, {{absorbent}} material has {{to be of the}} order of a quarter-wavelength thick if placed on a wall, which at low frequencies with their long wavelengths requires very thick absorbers. Absorption occurs through friction of the air motion against <b>individual</b> <b>fibres,</b> with kinetic energy converted to heat, and so the material must be of just the right 'density' in terms of fibre packing. Too loose, and sound will pass through, but too firm and reflection will occur. Technically {{it is a matter of}} impedance matching between air motion and the <b>individual</b> <b>fibres.</b> Glass fibre, as used for thermal insulation, is very effective, but needs to be very thick (perhaps four to six inches) if the result is not to be a room that sounds unnaturally 'dead' at high frequencies but remains 'boomy' at lower frequencies, so that it provides absorption across a broad range of frequencies.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{measurement}} of fibre bundle cross section and its variability in flax and sisal fibres are presented. Cross section values obtained from “diameter” measurements were more than double the values obtained from actual observation of cross sections of the same <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles. The overall conclusion is that “diameter” measurement is not an attractive method for accurate estimation of cross sectional area of these natural fibre bundles. This conclusion is significant for researchers engaged in micromechanical investigation of natural fibre composites since differences in fibre cross section translate directly into differences of the same magnitude in the values obtained for the fibre modulus and strength. The error in fibre bundle cross section introduced by the “diameter” method scales with the average fibre bundle “diameter” which may also result in erroneous observations of fibre modulus and strength which scale inversely with natural fibre bundle “diameter”. The difference in average cross section observed from fibre bundle to fibre bundle was significantly greater than the variation along the length of each <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> bundle. The minimum to maximum cross section variability of individual flax fibre bundles was found to be approximately twice that observed for sisal fibre bundles. A simple model based on a non-circular fibre bundle cross section is introduced and shown to explain these observations...|$|E

40|$|The {{contractile}} characteristics, fatiguability, and ultrastructure {{were examined}} in individual twitch skeletal muscle fibres dissected from the iliofibularis muscle of frog Rana temporaria in order to define if an explicit correspondence exists between physiological and morphological features in different types of muscle fibres. Three groups of twitch fibres were distinguished in the study according to their fatiguability: fatigue resistant (FR), moderately fatigued (MF) and easily fatigued (EF). The ultrastructural features such as regularity of striation, the density of myofibrils, Z-band morphology, mitochondrial and lipid droplet contents, which are commonly used to distinguish skeletal muscle fibre types, are shown to correlate with physiological properties verifying FR, MF and EF fibre groups only in a statistical way. In <b>individual</b> <b>fibres,</b> however, there is no strong correlation between contraction speeds, fatiguability, and ultrastructural features.

The subjects' biles were initially unsaturated with cholesterol and no significant changes in the lithogenic indices or mean percentages of cholesterol, phospholipid, or total bile acids after any of the supplements were observed. After pectin, the mean (+/- SD) percentage of cholic acid decreased significantly from 42. 8 (+/- 10. 8) to 39. 0 (+/- 11. 2), the mean (+/- SD) percentage of deoxycholic acid increased significantly from 18. 2 (+/- 13. 7) to 25. 4 (+/- 13. 5) and C 14 -deoxycholate metabolites were raised significantly by 65 %. After cellulose, the mean (+/- SD) percentage of chenodeoxycholic acid was increased significantly from 33. 6 (+/- 6. 3) to 35. 4 (+/- 7. 0), the mean (+/- SD) percentage of deoxycholic acid decreased significantly from 18. 6 (+/- 9. 6) to 14. 2 (+/- 8. 3) and C 14 -deoxycholate metabolites halved. Lignin did not exert any significant effects. Though these results show that <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> components are associated with quite different effects on bile acid metabolism, in the short term no significant effect on biliary cholesterol saturation was observed in bile initially unsaturated with cholesterol.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} stress-strain behaviour of <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced cement}} composites is reviewed. Based on the multiple cracking {{concept of the}} existing theory, analytical expressions are developed to describe the tensile stress-strain behaviour of a fibre-cement hybrid composite consisting of three components, i. e. two reinforcing fibres with different moduli, strengths and strains to failure and a common cement binder. The model predicts that the tensile stress-strain curve of the hybrid composites consists of five stages, instead of three stages of the existing models for <b>individual</b> <b>fibre</b> cements, and relates the tensile behaviour of each stage to the component properties of the components and the test system parameters. A description is given of the physical and mechanical properties of four types of reinforcing fibres used in the study. These were fibrillated polypropylene film, alkali-resistant glass, polyvinyl alcohol fibres and carbon fibres. A small number of direct tensile tests on continuous glass, carbon and polyvinyl alcohol were performed. The tensile stress-strain behaviour of four types of fibre-cement hybrid composites was studied with particular emphasis on that of the glass- polypropylene hybrids for which the flexural load-deflection behaviour was also examined. It is shown that the fibre-cement hybrid composites yield superior engineering properties over their parent composites and the improvements are sensitive to volume fractions {{of each of the}} two fibres. The measured tensile stress-strain curves of the hybrids were compared with the theoretical predictions and satisfactory agreement in general is obtained.
