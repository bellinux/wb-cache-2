Six aged people of high middle class, who have health insurance, were interviewed. Specific software to analyze the answers was used. The social representation that emerged of the study shows that look for information improves the quality of life, this means, the knowledge helps <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>cares</b> of the health. However, the majority of the interviewed people get these information throught magazines, TV and family doctor, probably because of the easy access.

By November 1916 he was in Iași, Western Moldavia; a month later, he began a long journey to Paris, arriving there in 1917. In the French capital, he reunited with his writer friend Eftimiu, as another member of the isolated Romanian cell. In his 1965 recollections, Eftimiu claims that, while he had trouble making ends meet, Theodorian [...] "knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of himself, though not by hard work, nor by mental concentration." [...] According to Theodorian, however, his was [...] "no easy life". By 1918, living in the Latin Quarter with his family, he was working as a typist for the agency recording prisoners of war, and also making shells in a factory. Other sources indicate that he was also the press agent for the Romanian military attaché in France. He proposed to Eftimiu that they work together on a screenplay about the legendary Romanian ancestors of Pierre de Ronsard. The project was aborted when Eftimiu discovered that the necessitous Gaumont would not even hire him as an extra.|$|E

Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.

The lead brother told his younger brothers, [...] "You better take your {{grandfather}} outside", which they did while the oldest brother stayed with X̱i7lánexw 's wife. Not long after, they heard a baby's cry. He fixed the baby up and taught the woman <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of it, and told him about the medicine. He told the man that when he came him, that he had a baby boy. The first baby was a boy, and the next a girl. These two grew up together and married each other.

However, even after she went through training <b>to</b> teach her <b>how</b> <b>to</b> nurse, the calves continued to die.

Corky had to continually push her calves away from the walls and could not properly present her mammaries to the calves so that they could nurse.

The Alert, Evacuate and Shelter (AES) program identified and trained youth/adult teams to use geospatial technology to map shelter locations and evacuation routes. Training began with team building activities to strengthen and build youth/adult preparedness partnerships. Program evaluations revealed a major shift in thinking about the positive potential level of involvement of youth in emergencies.
