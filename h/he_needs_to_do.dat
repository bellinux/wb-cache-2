25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E

Normally, each podgram {{begins with an}} update from Fry about what he has been doing recently, his {{activities}} since the last podgram, and any housekeeping that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> concerning his website, www.stephenfry.com. Fry then continues to discuss his recent activities; although in other editions the introduction leads into the main subject. The text of the podgrams is sometimes published as part of Fry's web logs, or [...] "Blessays".|$|E
500|$|Vincent Kartheiser {{called the}} storyline {{an example of}} an [...] "amoral" [...] {{business}} tactic. Kartheiser described Pete as doing [...] "what he thinks <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to get the account. I don't know if that's always such a good thing, but it's common in business. And I think in that situation, Pete represents that type of businessman." [...] Matthew Weiner and Jared Harris both characterized Lane's decision as two-fold—he gave Joan the best advice for her and for himself.|$|E

50|$|Dave Wottle {{was born}} in Canton, Ohio. During his {{childhood}} he was very slim and feeble. His family doctor told him that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something, such as running, to strengthen himself. The young boy took this advice and started to run.|$|R
50|$|On New Year's Eve 2004, his son {{presented}} him with the docu-film This Old Cub, based on Santo's experience as a diabetic player in MLB. After watching the film seven times {{before going to bed}} that morning, Holden became inspired and convinced that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>to</b> help find a cure for diabetes.|$|R
500|$|Baum {{continues}} to study Mabuse's writings {{and seems to}} confer with the ghostly Dr. Mabuse. The spirit of Mabuse speaks about an [...] "unlimited reign of crime" [...] and merges with the Professor's silhouette. During the same night, a hidden figure confers with sections of his organisation, preparing various crimes such as {{an attack on a}} chemical plant, robbing a bank, counterfeiting, poisoning water and destroying harvests. One of the gang members, Thomas Kent (Gustav Diesel), is conflicted between his criminal work, which <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for money, and his affection for a young woman named Lilli (Wera Liessem). Lilli, devoted to Kent, begs him to confide in her. Kent confesses his past and his current situation to her. The two decide to inform the police but are abducted and locked in the strange meeting room with the curtain. The hidden figure announces their death when they discover that the curtained alcove contains only a loudspeaker {{and that there is a}} time-bomb. After several escape attempts have failed, they flood the place to lessen the impact of the explosion and break free when the time-bomb goes off.|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he knows what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them." [...] Additionally, DC began focusing on films [...] "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" [...] DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the Joker.|$|E
2500|$|Duke's rise {{garnered}} {{national media}} attention. While he gained {{the backing of}} the quixotic former Alexandria Mayor John K. Snyder, Duke won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands of dollars to former Governor Edwin Edwards' campaign. Referencing Edwards' long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: [...] "Vote for the Crook. It's Important", and [...] "Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard." [...] When a reporter asked Edwards what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> triumph over Duke, Edwards replied with a smile: [...] "Stay alive." ...|$|R

This became such an international issue that US President Dwight Eisenhower sent his own doctor {{to make sure that}} the famous composer was being taken care of. The doctor proclaimed that Dr. Passalacqua had <b>done</b> precisely what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> save his life.|$|R
50|$|Sung in Lithuanian and English, the opera's {{themes are}} {{resilience}} and renewal - qualities that enabled Truchanas {{to rise from}} deprivation to find an inner strength and clarity, which <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> several times during his life. In addition {{to the loss of}} Lake Pedder, Truchanas suffered through World War II in Lithuania; several years later he lost his home (and his photographic work) in the devastating 1967 Tasmanian fires.|$|R

Former surgeon general Joycelyn Elders also {{supported}} Gupta's nomination, saying: [...] "He has enough well-trained, well-qualified public health people to teach him the things <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the job."

2500|$|On November 22, 2013, Carter filed a {{bankruptcy}} petition to shed more than $3.5 million in debt, mostly taxes owed from the money {{made at the}} height of his popularity. [...] "This is not a negative thing," [...] Carter publicist Steve Honig told CNN. [...] "It's actually very positive. It's him doing what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to move forward."

Mora spent {{ten years in}} baseball, while playing from 1954 to 1963 for several teams in the Minor Leagues, Mexican Baseball and the Venezuela League. Although he never appeared in a Major League game, Mora teamed with major league figures and earned their respect by <b>doing</b> what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> win a game.|$|R
50|$|Adams {{said that}} he then {{developed}} a siddhi whereby whenever he wanted something, from a candy bar to a violin, all <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was say 'God' three times and the desired object would appear from somewhere, or be {{given to him by}} someone. If there was a test at school Adams would simply say 'God, God, God,' and the answers would immediately come to him; no prior study was necessary.|$|R
2500|$|It {{stands in}} a unique {{position}} between medieval chivalric romance and the modern novel. The former consist of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through [...] "having read his adventures", and so, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more [...] "Alonso Quixano the Good".|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Tennessee with new {{wife and their}} child, Ant bought a portastudio, {{as a first step}} towards a home studio. Interviewed in 2000, Ant's then manager Bryan Stanton claimed that, since the Blend session, a second set of songs had been demoed and that Adam {{intended}} to compile a new album from the highlights of both sets. [...] Stanton reported of Blend that [...] "there's loads of legal nonsense behind it. It was set up with two other people, and one of those people is causing a few problems. So what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is leave that and set up another one".|$|E
2500|$|Suffering from {{rheumatoid}} arthritis, it was {{too painful}} for Bowden to signal a batsman out in the conventional fashion, with a straight index finger raised above the head, and {{this led to the}} [...] "crooked finger of doom". He has also put his own slant on several other signals, including a [...] "crumb-sweeping" [...] wave of the arm to signal four, and the [...] "double crooked finger six-phase hop" [...] to signal a six. His signals are sedate in Tests, more flashy in ODIs and decidedly flamboyant in Twenty20. His behavior has attracted him both fans and critics almost equally. Martin Crowe referred to him as Bozo the Clown, and at least one commentator has said he should remember that cricket is for the players and fans, not for the umpires. However, there was a suggestion that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the signals in the way he does because of his arthritis, as he needs to keep his body fluid.|$|E
50|$|After all he {{went through}} that summer, Billy decided <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more with his life than go to college, so he left for Louisiana to help Mac's father, Brock, build houses for the poor. He and his mother, Jill, shared a tearful parting, {{although}} Jill felt {{he was making a}} mistake. Mac and Billy parted tearfully, as well, declaring their love and promising each other that it was not the end of them.|$|R
5000|$|He {{moved to}} Japan by himself, {{where he was}} befriended by Ōkuma Shigenobu, Futabatei Shimei, Torii Ryūzō, Katayama Sen, and others, and helped an {{organisation}} of anti-imperial Russian refugees. Among them Futabatei Shimei became Bronisław's very close friend. He affectionately describes Bronisław as [...] "an 'odd ball' who was so kind-hearted and innocent like a child that he would always insist in a very excited tone that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>to</b> help Ainus {{and that it was}} his destiny <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that {{despite the fact that he}} was always a 'complete broke' then".|$|R
5000|$|The {{saying was}} a {{response}} to a young rich man who had asked Jesus what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order <b>to</b> inherit eternal life. Jesus replied that he should keep the commandments, to which the man stated he had done. Jesus responded, [...] "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." [...] The young man became sad and was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this. Jesus then spoke this response, leaving his disciples astonished.|$|R
2500|$|Souders and Peterson {{revealed}} that the theme for season ten will be [...] "facing the ghosts of your past and how [...] helps you move on in the future"; as such, the return of previous cast members will play into this. Souders and Peterson also chose not to erase Lois's memory of Clark's secret, something she discovered in the season nine finale. Instead, Lois helped Clark do what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to get away and fulfill his destiny without telling him that she knows. The producers explained {{that there would be}} [...] "some twists and turns" [...] before Lois tells Clark that she knows. Initially helping Clark and Oliver at Watchtower, a secret from her past will define whether Tess ultimately ends on the side of good or bad. Chloe's ending will also be told [...] "in a way that's fitting for Chloe." [...] She will [...] "sacrifice" [...] herself for Oliver, who has been informed that she was killed. As a result, Oliver will spend much of the season looking for Chloe, trying to find who is behind her murder. In addition, Oliver is [...] "literally and figuratively stripped down to his bare essence" [...] early on this season.|$|E
