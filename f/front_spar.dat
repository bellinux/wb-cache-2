25|$|The wings were {{fitted with}} slotted flaps and full length {{leading edge slats}} and could be folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a {{variable}} angle of incidence, pivoting at the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> and actuated by an electrically driven jackscrew attached to the rear spar. This arrangement reduced stalling speed and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{aftermarket}} modifications and upgrades {{are available}} for 200 and 300 Series King Airs. One company offers a Wing <b>Front</b> <b>Spar</b> Reinforcement Kit for 200 Series aircraft and a modification to replace the electro-mechanical landing gear retraction system of early-build aircraft with an electro-hydraulic system. Raisbeck Engineering out of Seattle, WA offers Enhanced Performance Leading Edges, Nacelle Wing Lockers, Ram Air Recovery System, Quiet Turbofan Propellers, High Flotation Gear Doors and Dual Aft Body Strakes.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{numerous}} airframe modifications available: a cargo conversion for the 90 model, the CargoLiner, which replaces {{the rear door}} with a large pallet accessible cargo door, a heavy duty floor structure and cabin cargo liner, also a crew hatch for cockpit access for the crew in the 90, 100, and 200; a Wing <b>Front</b> <b>Spar</b> Reinforcement Kit for both 90 and 100 Series aircraft,; a modification for the entire King Air line that entails reworking and extending the nose to house a baggage compartment {{as well as the}} avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft. Modifications available for the King Air 100 include a belly cargo pod similar to those fitted to the Beech 99 and the Model 1300 version of the King Air 200 series.|$|E
50|$|A brake chain {{under the}} {{downhill}} end controls speed in steep terrain when pressure {{is applied to}} the <b>front</b> <b>spars</b> which proportionally affects the location and length of the chain to regulate the braking effect. A line attached to the toboggan secures it to a rescuer.|$|R
50|$|The AM-69's fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage borrowed {{heavily from}} other designs. The main legs and wheels, mounted onto the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar,</b> {{were from a}} Robin DR.220 and the tailwheel was a modified Stampe SV.4 component.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is welded 4130 steel tubing. The <b>front</b> wing <b>spars</b> are 2.5 {{in aluminum}} tubing, with aluminum ribs and aircraft fabric covering. If {{equipped with a}} Rotax 277 engine, the aircraft meets American FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicle standards, by weighing less than 254 lb. The wing area of the ultralight version {{is larger than the}} heavier Mong Sport it replicates, {{in order to keep the}} stall speed low.|$|R
25|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage of two main frames – one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (alclad) – to take the loads from the wing spars and six more alclad frames; and alclad skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the upper fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The Margarete was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, braced, two spar wing with ply covering {{from the}} <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> to {{the leading edge}} and fabric covered aft. The wing had a thick and cambered profile inboard of the tips, which had a thinner and more symmetric profile. [...] Initially the wing plan was rectangular, with triangular ailerons mounted on straight hinges which were attached to the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> at the tips, reaching the trailing edge inboard. [...] Later, the aileron area was reduced, partly by cropping them inboard and also by tapering their trailing edges and rounding their tips. [...] Each wing was braced from the lower fuselage with an asymmetric, V-form, streamlined strut to the two spars at about one-third span.|$|E
2500|$|The Pander D had {{a single}} piece, two spar wing which was {{attached}} to the upper fuselage longerons with pairs of yoked U-bolts. [...] The spars were of the box type with spruce flanges and plywood webs, the front one forming a narrow chord D-box with ply covering around the wing leading edge. Aft of the <b>front</b> <b>spar,</b> the wing and ailerons, the latter mounted on false spars, were fabric covered. [...] Similar methods were used in the tail structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{tricycle}} undercarriage, unusual at the time, had short main legs {{made possible}} by the combination of lower fuselage depth and hence lower wing position, together with the offset propeller. These legs were joined to the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar</b> close to the fuselage, cross braced and splayed outwards to increase the track. The front leg, mounted just behind the engine, was much longer; all three legs were faired and carried wheels enclosed in spats.|$|R
5000|$|Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. ("Spirit"), {{based in}} Wichita, Kansas, is the world's largest first-tier aerostructures manufacturer. The company builds several {{important}} pieces of Boeing aircraft, including the fuselage of the 737, {{portions of the}} 787 fuselage, and the cockpit section of the fuselage (referred to as [...] "Section 41" [...] by Boeing) of nearly all of its airliners. Spirit also produces fuselage sections and <b>front</b> wing <b>spars</b> for the Airbus A350. Spirit's main competition comes from Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division, UTC Aerospace Systems, Alenia, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.|$|R
5000|$|The Wibault 220 was {{powered by}} two [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Ac Jupiter nine-cylinder radial engines, each wing-mounted under the outer centre-section. They were {{attached}} at three {{points on the}} <b>front</b> and rear <b>spars</b> by a system of duralumin plates and steel tubes and were enclosed in teardrop cowlings with their cylinder heads exposed for cooling.|$|R
2500|$|The Harrow {{had to have}} a clear space {{below the}} {{fuselage}} to allow torpedo dropping. The main legs were attached to the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> at the ends of the centre section, and pairs of bracing struts ran from the stub axles to the lower fuselage longerons. [...] Snap link hooks were fitted to the inner ends of the axles to engage with the longitudinal arrester wires of the time. The specification required that the land undercarriage could be replaced rapidly with floats. [...] These were long, single stepped and fitted with water rudders, built by Short Brothers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{specification}} {{required the}} Pike to fly with wheels or floats. [...] As a landplane the Pike had a single-axle undercarriage, {{with a pair}} of oleo legs mounted at the wing root <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> and with rearward bracing. [...] The axle carried arrester hooks, which engaged on landing with the longitudinal arrestor wires of those days. [...] The floats were long, with marked chine and two steps, the second close to the tip where there was also a water rudder. [...] They used the same oleo legs as the landplane, augmented by a pair of forward-reaching struts to the fuselage behind the lower radiator, and another pair aft.|$|E
2500|$|The Goral was an {{all-metal}} framed, fabric-covered biplane using DH9A {{wings of}} two-bay construction and of slight stagger, with parallel interplane struts. [...] There were ailerons on all wings. [...] The fuselage was oval {{in cross section}} and quite slim. [...] The wire-braced, round-tipped tailplane carried unbalanced elevators but the small fin carried a square-topped horn-balanced rudder. [...] The pilot sat under the wing trailing edge cutout, with the gunner behind him, his gun on a ring, mounted on the raised rear decking. [...] The undercarriage had a single axle strutted to the fuselage near the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> and forward to the engine firewall.|$|E
50|$|The round nosed, {{single seat}} cabin is formed from six bonded pieces and {{mounted on the}} boom with its {{windscreen}} at the wing leading edge, placing the pilot below the wing at about one quarter chord. The sides are normally open though complete enclosure is an option. On each side a forward leaning bracing strut runs from the lower rear cabin to the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar.</b> The Sländan has a short, fixed, tricycle undercarriage with a steerable nosewheel; the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, are mounted on straight steel cantilever legs from the lower fuselage. There is a protective tailskid {{on the tip of}} the underfin.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936 the {{well-established}} Potez company {{became part}} of the Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautique du Nord (S.N.C.A.N.), under the Law for the Nationalisation of Military Industries. [...] In 1937 they produced their first four-engined aircraft, the Type 661. This was a commercial machine with seating for up to twelve passengers. It was a low wing cantilever, almost all-metal monoplane. The wing tapered with a nearly straight trailing edge that carried outboard balanced ailerons and split trailing edge flaps over the whole of the centre section. The four 220 hp (164 kW) Renault 6Q inverted inline engines were conventionally mounted of the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar</b> and drove variable-pitch twin-bladed propellers.|$|R
5000|$|The Helikite {{design is}} {{intended}} for all-weather, high-altitude operation. The round, stubby shape allows it to be flown in any weather or for altitudes up to 7000 ft. In wind, both the main aerodynamic lift and the aerostatic lift are at the <b>front,</b> while the <b>spar</b> weight and keel are at the stern. Therefore, a Helikite remains stable in relatively high winds ...|$|R
2500|$|Two 125hp (93kW) Menasco Pirate C.4 four-cylinder {{air-cooled}} inline engines driving two-bladed propellers were mounted {{against the}} underside of the wing in steel cradles, at the points where the wing thickness increased. [...] There was a wooden fairing behind, through which ran, to the <b>front</b> <b>spar,</b> the cantilever fixed main undercarriage legs, faired and spatted. The tailplane joined the rearmost inner edges of the side wings, carrying the tailwheel at its centre, and a broad elevator hinged clear {{of the rest of the}} structure. [...] Small fins mounted over the tailplane carried balanced rudders, their overall profile almost triangular. [...] The fins were externally braced to the tailplane.|$|E
2500|$|The Gabardini {{monoplane}} {{was designed}} with a steel tube structure, which was unusual. [...] Its shoulder mounted monoplane wings were built around two tubular steel spars, with wooden ribs and canvas covering. In plan view the low aspect ratio wings were barely straight, tapered to generously rounded tips. [...] Roll control was by wing warping, with conventional control column input. [...] The wings were wire-braced to the fuselage from above {{as well as}} from below. [...] The three upper wires on each side, one from the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> and two from the rear at about mid-span, ran {{to the top of a}} three-legged pylon over the cockpit. [...] The lower wires were attached to the frame that also carried the landing wheels and skids.|$|E
2500|$|All metal with fabric covering, the G.4/31 {{was a large}} single-engined single-bay biplane, with unswept, unequal-span {{wings of}} marked stagger. [...] Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slots; both wings were cut back to the rear spar at the centre section for visibility. [...] A pair of struts braced the two lower wing spars to the upper fuselage, from where another pair braced the upper rear spars; a {{separate}} pair of struts linked the forward spars of the upper wings to the forward fuselage. [...] There was a split axle undercarriage, necessary for torpedo launching, [...] with its main legs connected to the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> below the fuselage struts and braced for and aft to the lower fuselage. [...] Main wheel brakes were fitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{wings are}} {{constructed}} of tubular <b>front</b> and rear <b>spars.</b> The wings and flying control surfaces {{are covered in}} Kevlar/Mylar/Polyester laminate. The wings can be removed or folded (if an optional folding kit is installed) for storage and transportation. The wing tips are of composite construction which reduces drag and improves low speed handling. Access to the cabin is provided by two gull-wing doors.|$|R

2500|$|The 662 was a {{commercial}} machine with seating {{for up to}} twelve passengers. [...] It was a low wing cantilever, almost all-metal monoplane. [...] The wing tapered with a nearly straight trailing edge that carried outboard balanced ailerons and split trailing edge flaps over {{the whole of the}} centre section. [...] The four Mars small diameter (950mm or 3ft 1½ in) 14-cylinder radials [...] were conventionally mounted of the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar,</b> neatly enclosed with wide chord cowlings and large spinners. [...] These drove three bladed variable propellers. [...] Internally the wing was strengthened to accommodate the greater power and the fuel tank capacity was increased by 37% to provide for the higher consumption.|$|R
2500|$|The {{designer}} of the Pirate was the experienced Harold Boultbee, who had recently produced the Civilian Coupé, and construction began early in 1935. The high wings were straight edged, but tapered, slightly swept {{on the leading edge}} and fully slotted. [...] The trailing edge carried differential ailerons and interacting flaps. A pair of V shaped lift struts ran from the two wing spars down to the lower fuselage side where there was a universal joint to facilitate wing folding. [...] The folding mechanism was unusual: unlocked, the wings slid forward and tipped leading edge down, so that when the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> was released from its fitting the wings could fold rearwards and downwards about the rear spar. [...] Because of the initial forward movement, the folded length was less {{than it would have been}} with conventional geometries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first two}} Boxkites, {{assigned}} works numbers 7 and 8, differed in detail from the later production aircraft; the front outrigger booms were braced {{by a pair}} of vertical struts and were attached {{to the ends of the}} interplane struts. [...] This arrangement was inherited from the Zodiac, being necessary in that aircraft because the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> of the wing did not also form the leading edge. [...] Additionally the rear elevator had a straight trailing edge. [...] No.8 also had double-surfaced wings; the wings of No.7 were single-surfaced with the ribs enclosed in pockets, like production aircraft. [...] No. 7 was initially fitted with a 50hp (37kW) Grégoire, but for its first flight this was replaced by a Gnome, although the Grégoire was later refitted for trial purposes: No. 8 had a 50hp (37kW) E.N.V.|$|E
2500|$|The Trainer's {{undercarriage}} {{was unusual}} and possibly vulnerable. [...] Each wheel was {{mounted on a}} stub axle, independent of the other and swung on a V member formed from heavy duty square tubing, with its ends hinged to front and rear spar towards the outer end of the centre section, so the assembly could swing laterally. [...] Each V plus wheel was restrained by a radius arm hinged on the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> near the fuselage, allowing {{a small amount of}} upwards and outward travel for the wheel. [...] The radius arms were sprung inside the fuselage. [...] In order to get the very wide track of 93 in (2.36 m), both the V and radius arms were heavily splayed and the angle between them was much smaller than normal, a cause for some concern. [...] The tailskid was mounted without a fuselage aperture, to avoid the trapping of grass and dirt.|$|E
50|$|The Avro York is a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{using an}} all-metal construction, bearing many similarities to the Lancaster {{from which it}} was derived. The wings use a two-spar structure, which internally housed seven fuel tanks contained 2,478 gallons between the spars. The outboard panels of the wings are tapered on both edges and are furnished with detachable tips. The wings feature all-metal hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps and carry the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in four underslung nacelles attached to the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar.</b> Each engine drives a three-bladed constant-speed fully feathering metal propeller, manufactured by de Havilland Hydromatic. The fuselage is of a semi-monocoque construction complete with a flush-rivetted skin, and was built in five separate sections.|$|R
5000|$|The 662 was a {{commercial}} machine with seating {{for up to}} twelve passengers. It was a low wing cantilever, almost all-metal monoplane.

[...] Internally the wing was strengthened to accommodate the greater power and the fuel tank capacity was increased by 37% to provide for the higher consumption.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{fuselage}} {{was destroyed in}} the fire. Exceptions included the nose and {{the underside of the}} cockpit. The tips of the wings and ailerons were nearly undamaged. The <b>front</b> wing <b>spar</b> was sufficiently intact that it was able to keep the wings together. The inner parts of the wing, including the spoilers, were destroyed, but two of the spoiler actuators were salvageable. The tail was largely intact. Most light alloy components in the engines were destroyed, although the compressor blades were intact and showed no sign of damage prior to impact. Three components – the left main landing gear, an engine cowling and the outer right engine – were found between the runway and the wreckage, and had not been consumed in fire.|$|R
2500|$|The Vickers Type 253 used a Pegasus IIM3 engine, {{enclosed}} by a drag-reducing Townend ring, to power a two-bay, unstaggered biplane, {{with a lower}} wing smaller in span and chord. [...] Both wings were of constant chord, but the centre sections were mildly forward-swept and the lower centre section carried anhedral out to the inner interplane struts. Both sets of interplane struts leaned outwards, the outer ones more so. Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slats. [...] The wings joined the fuselage top and bottom with no gap, the pilot sitting {{just ahead of the}} leading edge in an open cockpit and the observer sitting well behind the trailing edge. A conventional tail carried balanced rudder and elevators. The split-axle fixed undercarriage was neatly mounted, the main legs fixed to the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> under the inner interplane struts and braced rearwards to the wing roots.|$|E
2500|$|The Renegades's wings have a {{positive}} stagger and incorporate a single faired interplane strut and cabane struts as well as wire-bracing. The top wing has a span of [...] and incorporates a 10 degree sweep to improve visibility from the pilot's back seat, accessibility for the front seat passenger and reduces adverse yaw. The lower wing has 3 degrees of dihedral. Ailerons are of the Friese type, with two ailerons on the lower wing standard and four ailerons optional. The front wing spar was initially a [...] aluminum tube and the rear spar is [...] "C" [...] channel. Starting 1 January 1989 the <b>front</b> <b>spar</b> was changed to a rectangular spar and an outboard drag brace was added, increasing wing rigidity. The ribs are stamped aluminum and mate with an aluminium sheet leading edge. All surfaces are covered with aircraft fabric. Controls are via torque tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Fokker's {{own account}} of the D.VIII places the blame on officious German Air Force {{inspectors}} requiring an ill-conceived design change. [...] "When the first D-8 was submitted to the engineering division to be sandload tested, the wings proved to be sufficiently strong, but the regulations called for a proportionate strength in the rear spar compared to the <b>front</b> <b>spar...</b> Compyling with the government's edict, we strengthened the rear spar and started to produce in quantity..." [...] The D.VIII's immediately ran into trouble with the wing collapsing at high speed. [...] Fokker recalled the aircraft for further testing, and successfully demonstrated that the reinforced rear spar caused the wings to flex unevenly at speed, increasing the angle of attack at the wing tips and causing the wing to shear apart under the increased loads. [...] The problem was resolved by restoring the rear spar to its original specifications.|$|E
25|$|The Meteor F.1 was {{powered by}} two Rolls-Royce Welland {{turbojet}} engines, Britain's first production jet engines, which were built under license from Whittle's designs. The Meteor embodied {{the advent of}} practical jet propulsion; in the type's service life, both military and civil aviation manufacturers would rapidly integrate turbine engines into their designs, favouring its advantages such as smoother running and greater power output. The Meteor's engines were considerably more practical {{than those of the}} German Me 262, having both a longer service life and being more efficient; unlike the Me 262, the engines were embedded into the wing in nacelles between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>spars</b> rather than underslung.|$|R
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Type E had a {{strongly}} curved leading edge and a straight but swept back trailing edge. Towards the tip, the trailing edge was extended rearwards {{to make it more}} flexible for wing warping. [...] The wings were built around two spars and wire-braced, both above and below to points on the <b>front</b> and rear <b>spars</b> from a pair of fuselage-mounted inverted-V struts, one just forward of each cockpit and joined by a horizontal tie rod. [...] A kingpost was fixed to the rear spar toward the tip where the outer bracing wires were fixed. [...] When this post was moved fore and aft by separate control wires, the wing was warped for lateral control.|$|R
50|$|The Type 98 Vagabond was Vickers' entry. It was a single-bay, wire-braced biplane {{with wings}} of {{constant}} chord except towards the rounded trailing tips. The wings had equal span and carried marked stagger. There were ailerons on both {{upper and lower}} wings, with flaps inboard on the lower wings which could be folded to assist wing-folding. The pilot and passenger sat in open cockpits, the latter under the upper wing. The pilot's upward view was enhanced by a small cutout in {{the trailing edge of}} the top wing. The fuselage had a more rounded cross-section than that of the earlier Viget, Vickers' single-seat entry to the 1923 competition, extending a little below the lower wing. The 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub III flat twin engine was mounted in a smooth nose with the finned cylinders exposed for air cooling. The horizontal tail was {{similar to that of the}} Viget, but the fin and rudder were much more rounded. Because of the stagger, the mainwheels were in front of the lower wing, braced to the lower fuselage logeron aft to the <b>front</b> wing <b>spar</b> and forward to a point roughly below the upper wing leading edge.|$|R
