40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} first five years of {{experience}} with the working of the EMU framework for fiscal policy in EMU. It is argued that the balance with the fiscal framework of EMU so far is mixed. The EMU framework has contributed to avoid large fiscal imbalances in EU Member States and has evolved continuously to deal with a number of budgetary challenges connected to the conduct of fiscal policy and the assessment of budgetary developments in the short, medium and long run. However, problems with the implementations of the rules have emerged, and the ownership of the framework should be re-established. We argue in favour of further improvements within the framework of the Treaty along the following directions:Â increased focus on debt and sustainability; better account of country-specific factors in the definition of medium-term targets; better enforcement of the rules; improved implementation of the excessive deficit procedure; greater account of the Lisbon goals in applying the EMU framework for economic policy co-ordination and budgetary surveillance.

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that fiscal rules and independent fiscal institutions other than governments and parliaments {{can make a}} major contribution to sound fiscal policy. The main arguments put forward by the specialist literature on political economy in favour of such rules and institutions are the tendency shown by governments to record excessive budget deficits (deficit bias) and {{the characteristics of a}} monetary union. Such rules and institutions should restore the balance in the incentives of politicians, impose limits on the fiscal policy pursued and introduce fiscal coordination mechanisms. Fiscal rules can be extremely useful within the scope of a sound fiscal policy. There are clear indications that such rules can facilitate the maintenance of budget discipline and encourage consolidation efforts, where necessary. In order to attain that objective, however, it is essential for the fiscal rules to conform to the principal properties inherent in any ideal fiscal rule. Certain current or former fiscal rules applied in Belgium are strictly complied with, whereas in other cases there appears to be virtually no connection between the rule and what actually happens. There is therefore still room for improvement in some of Belgium’s fiscal rules. Independent fiscal institutions can also {{play a key role in}} fiscal policy. For instance, making such institutions responsible for the economic growth forecasts used in drawing up the government budget is an effective way of curbing excess optimism in those forecasts. Moreover, institutions issuing normative budgetary recommendations have fostered fiscal discipline in the countries where such institutions exist. Belgian independent fiscal institutions – namely the National Accounts Institute and the “Public Sector Borrowing Requirements” Section of the High Council of Finance – are often cited as good examples. fiscal rules, independent <b>fiscal</b> institutions, budgetary <b>surveillance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Why is the Euro area economy laboring {{under the}} burden of fiscal {{austerity}}? Critics argue that an ideological bias towards austerity has been institutionalized in the EU’s fiscal rules. We examine this claim by contrasting a ‘disciplinarian’ account of <b>fiscal</b> <b>surveillance</b> with a welfare-maximising approach and using this to review how <b>fiscal</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the European Commission has been practiced since the financial crisis. While we find that Eurostat’s practices bear some marks of disciplinarianism, particularly in bringing the fiscal consequences of reckless behavior by banks into the beam of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>surveillance</b> lamp, the Commission’s welfare maximising orientation is reflected {{in its efforts to}} identify and partition out financial, macroeconomic and budgetary contributions to fiscal outturns and thereby avoid an excessively disciplinarian orientation.

The analysis implies that the revision of the Pact in March 2005 cannot simply be dismissed as a watering down of its fiscal rules. However, there are limitations to regulatory expansion. One limitation is the inherent tension between the requirements of control and the economic justification of fiscal rules, another that economic justifications remain ambiguous and contentious...|$|E

The estimation of potential output involves a decomposition of actual output into a cyclical and a structural component based on arbitrary assumptions about the statistical properties of the two unobserved components. With a very high degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be temporary, as are the ensuing changes in the budget deficit. Conversely, with a low degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be permanent, leading to different policy conclusions. Our paper examines whether and how different potential output estimates would have supported different decisions in the EU budgetary surveillance in terms of both timing and substance. The results show that only a very high degree of smoothing of potential output would significantly reduce the reliability of the surveillance indicators.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse how {{austerity}} has impacted to date upon European Union (EU) financial reporting developments and how this might influence future reforms. It considers how a critical juncture in EU financial reporting might be recognized and factors which might prevent or delay such a juncture being realized. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the theoretical conceptualization of the territorializing, mediating, adjudicating and subjectivizing roles of accounting (Miller and Power, 2013), linked to document analysis and interviews with members of the relevant policy communities. In technical terms, austerity makes accounting subject to greater demands for consistency and uniformity. In political terms, accounting is implicated in increasing external <b>fiscal</b> <b>surveillance</b> of sovereign states. Findings – The authors have shown how the Miller-Power framework illuminates these developments. The territorializing role of accounting in sovereign states creates an environment which facilitates the mediating, adjudicating and subjectivizing roles. Austerity promotes re-territorializing, yet also creates incentives for governments to hide risks and guarantees: the comparability of financial reports and national accounts may be achieved only at a rhetorical level. Evidence for a critical juncture would be termination of national traditions of financial reporting, greater harmonization of accounting across tiers of government, weakening of the linkages to private sector accounting, and stronger alignment of government financial reporting with statistical accounting. Originality/value – The paper provides a theoretically based analysis of how austerity influences government financial reporting and statistical accounting and brings them into closer contact.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the various concepts of government debt in the euro area with {{particular emphasis on}} its size and composition. In terms of size, the paper focuses on different definitions that are in use, in particular the concept of gross general government debt used in the surveillance of the euro area countries, the total liabilities from the government balance sheet approach, and the net debt concept which subtracts government fi nancial assets from the liability side. In addition, it discusses “hidden debt” {{in the form of}} implicit and contingent liabilities. In terms of composition, the paper provides information about euro area government debt broken down by maturity, holder or the currency of issue. All these indicators illustrate a sharp increase in government debt in most euro area countries {{as a result of the}} crisis. This in turn has several policy implications: (i) the growing government debt ratios need to be stabilised and put on a downward path which improves market confidence; (ii) <b>fiscal</b> <b>surveillance</b> needs to put more emphasis on government debt indicators than in the past; (iii) government financial assets could play a role when analysing solvency issues; (iv) implicit and other off-balance-sheet government liabilities need to be carefully monitored and reported; (v) the gross debt concept should remain the key basis for <b>fiscal</b> <b>surveillance</b> in the EU and for the Excessive Deficit Procedure in particular; (vi) beyond the size of government debt its composition is also a key factor behind public finance vulnerabilities.
