5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see <b>if</b> <b>making</b> artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

25|$|Full {{retirement}} age spouses and divorced spouses (married over 10 years before divorce) {{are entitled to}} the higher of 50% of the wage earners benefits or their own earned benefits. A low salary worker and his full {{retirement age}} spouse making {{less than or equal}} to $791/month with 40 quarters of employment credit and at full retirement age (65 if born before 1938, 66 if born from 1938 to 1954 and 67 if born after 1960) could retire with 135% of his indexed average salary. A full retirement age worker and his full retirement age spouse making the ceiling income or more would be eligible for 43% of the ceiling FICA salary (29% if single) and even less <b>if</b> <b>making</b> more than the ceiling income.|$|E

[...] In an interview with Rolling Stone about what the future holds, Joe Perry admitted that, [...] "I don't even know <b>if</b> <b>making</b> new albums makes sense anymore.

The dance features Mai and Mii swinging their hips sideways while holding their hands near {{the sides of}} their heads and flapping them, as <b>if</b> <b>making</b> a [...] "goodbye" [...] motion representing cat ears Internet users set the dance to a sped-up chorus of the song Caramelldansen by Caramell. The scene's popularity helped the Popotan franchise and Caramell attain a cult following. The dance is performed by individuals (especially in Japan) at anime conventions, and in advertising, video games and other unrelated anime. The popularity of Popotan in Japan brought Momoi Haruko and her band Under17 to prominence.|$|E
500|$|Lord Hope {{disagreed}} with the principles and analogies relied upon by the majority. [...] Of the principle that [...] "where there is a wrong {{there must be a}} remedy", he said that the policy decision to protect witnesses from litigation had been taken some time ago, without anything being said to cast doubt on the policy choice. [...] He also asked how the rule could be altered to allow negligence claims but not defamation claims, since if there was a well-founded defamation claim barred by witness immunity then a wrong would have been done without remedy in that instance. He said that advocates and experts performed different functions and so it could not be assumed that the fact that advocates' immunity had been removed without difficulty would mean that immunity could be removed from experts without any problems. [...] He was more impressed with the difficulties about where to draw the line if the claim was allowed to proceed than the argument {{that there would be a}} [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the availability of witnesses, wondering what the impact would be for experts involved in criminal proceedings or family cases involving children. He wondered whether a company director, owing a duty of care to the company, would face removal of the immunity <b>if</b> <b>making</b> an [...] "inexcusable error" [...] when giving evidence on the company's behalf. [...] Overall, he considered that the matter was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission. He furthermore noted that the decision in Watson remained binding in Scots law, in preference to the decision in Jones (since Jones only concerned the law of England and Wales), adding that the issue ought also to be considered by the Scottish Law Commission.|$|E

2500|$|In {{rural areas}} with magneto crank {{telephones}} connected to party lines, the local phone number {{consisted of the}} line number plus the ringing pattern of the subscriber. To dial a number such as [...] "3R122" [...] meant making a request to the operator the third party line (<b>if</b> <b>making</b> a call off your own local one), followed by turning the telephone's crank once, a short pause, then twice and twice again. Also common was a code of long and short rings, so one party's call might be signaled by two longs and another's by two longs followed by a short. [...] It was not uncommon to have over a dozen ring cadences (and subscribers) on one line.|$|E
2500|$|The symbolist's {{flights of}} {{imagination}} and grotesque passions foreign to him, Bunin made nature his field of artistic research and here carved his art to perfection. [...] "Few people {{are capable of}} loving nature as Bunin does. And it's this love that makes his scope wide, his vision deep, his colour and aural impressions so rich," [...] wrote Aleksander Blok, a poet from a literary camp Bunin treated as hostile. It was for his books of poetry (the most notable of which is Falling Leaves, 1901) and his poetic translations that Bunin became a three time Pushkin Prize laureate. His verse was praised by Aleksander Kuprin while Blok regarded Bunin as among {{the first in the}} hierarchy of Russian poets. One great admirer of Bunin's verse was Vladimir Nabokov, who (even <b>if</b> <b>making</b> scornful remarks about Bunin's prose) compared him to Blok. Some see Bunin as a direct follower of Gogol, who was the first in Russian literature to discover the art of fusing poetry and prose together.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an operation of inserting contexts {{in a word}} controlled by a contextual scheme X which provides a selection criterion for contextual insertion. We say that a language L is k-stable w. r. t. a contextual scheme X <b>if</b> by <b>making</b> any k context insertions in a word of L we still obtain a word of L; L is k-anti-stable w. r. t. X <b>if</b> by <b>making</b> any k context insertions in a word of L we get a word not in L; L is called k-error-correctable w. r. t. X <b>if</b> by <b>making</b> any k context insertions in a word x of L we get either a word in L or a word not in L which cannot be also obtained by making k context insertions in a word z of L different from x. We prove that all these properties are decidable for regular languages. We then define a distance between two words that measures the minimal number of context insertions {{in one of the}} words in order to obtain the other. Some properties of this distance, which is actually a semimetric, are investigated. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
