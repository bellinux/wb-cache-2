5|$|Jason Wilkes (portrayed by Reggie Austin) is a {{scientist}} for Isodyne, {{the only company}} willing to hire him as a black man, who informs Carter of the company's Zero Matter discovery. He is rendered <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> intangible following exposure to the substance, and under its influence he attempts to take drastic steps to gain power. He expresses remorse for his actions after the Zero Matter is eventually purged from his body and he regains tangibility.|$|E
5|$|Periyar openly {{suggested}} {{to those who}} were marginalised within the Hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as Islam, Christianity, or Buddhism. On Islam, he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.|$|E
5|$|Reptile's Fatalities in Mortal Kombat II {{consist of}} {{revealing}} his reptilian face {{in order to}} devour the opponent's head, or turning <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> severing the opponent's torso. Later finishing moves expand upon the concept, ranging from regurgitating acid upon the opponent to leaping upon their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls. In a series retrospective, the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost <b>invisible,</b> <b>and</b> thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be <b>invisible,</b> <b>and</b> to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
5|$|The game world {{consists}} {{of a number of}} rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives; the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location.|$|E

50|$|Grant Morrison, MBE (born 31 January 1960) is a Scottish {{comic book}} writer, playwright, and occultist. He {{is known for}} his {{nonlinear}} narratives and countercultural leanings in his runs on titles including DC Comics's Animal Man, Batman, JLA, Action Comics, All-Star Superman, Vertigo's The <b>Invisibles,</b> <b>and</b> Fleetway's 2000 AD.|$|R
50|$|In Latveria, Wasp <b>and</b> <b>Invisible</b> Woman {{have been}} imprisoned in pods in Doom's castle. Lucia sees the Avengers' Quinjet {{approaching}} and fires missiles at it. Doom discovers Iron Man has already infiltrated the castle using <b>invisible</b> armor <b>and</b> attacks him. The other heroes soon join the scuffle. Black Panther defeats von Bardas while Iron Man, Human Torch, Mr. Fantastic, and the Thing destroy {{a trio of}} giant Doombots. The heroes try to take on Doom but are no match for him. To the group's surprise, Doom frees Wasp <b>and</b> <b>Invisible</b> Woman <b>and</b> dismisses the group with a cryptic warning that they don't see what is happening.|$|R
5|$|The {{karyotype}} of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost <b>invisible)</b> <b>and</b> one small pair is metacentric (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. Telomeric sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with {{a high number of}} mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus. Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in Nectomys palmipes, although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.|$|E
5|$|The story opens {{when the}} Providers, the <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> {{unidentified}} rulers {{of all the}} Zones, order Al•Ith, queen of the peaceful paradise of Zone Three, to marry Ben Ata, king of the militarised and repressive Zone Four. Al•Ith is repulsed {{by the idea of}} consorting with a barbarian, and Ben Ata does not want a righteous queen disturbing his military campaigns. Nevertheless, Al•Ith descends to Zone Four and they reluctantly marry. Ben Ata is not used to the company of women he cannot control, and Al•Ith has difficulty relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept was}} {{the topic of}} {{considerable}} debate throughout its history, as it required {{the existence of an}} <b>invisible</b> <b>and</b> infinite material with no interaction with physical objects.

By the late 1800s, the existence of the aether was being questioned, although there was no physical theory to replace it.|$|E
