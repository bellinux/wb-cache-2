25|$|Recently, it {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that late Holocene, 3,000 calendar years ago to present, sea level was nearly stable prior to an acceleration of rate of rise that is variously dated between 1850 and 1900 AD. Late Holocene rates of sea level rise have been estimated using evidence from archaeological sites and late Holocene tidal marsh sediments, combined with tide gauge and satellite records and geophysical modeling. For example, this research included studies of Roman wells in Caesarea and of Roman piscinae in Italy. These methods in combination suggest a mean <b>eustatic</b> component of 0.07mm/yr for the last 2000 years.|$|E
25|$|Various factors {{affect the}} volume or {{mass of the}} ocean, leading to {{long-term}} changes in <b>eustatic</b> sea level. The two primary influences are temperature (because the density of water depends on temperature), and the mass of water locked up on land and sea as fresh water in rivers, lakes, glaciers and polar ice caps. Over much longer geological timescales, changes {{in the shape of}} oceanic basins and in land–sea distribution affect sea level. Since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, sea level has risen by more than 125 m, with rates varying from tenths of a mm/yr to 10+mm/year, as a result of melting of major ice sheets.|$|E
25|$|During the Cretaceous, {{the late}} Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea {{completed}} its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin orogenies {{that had begun}} during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera, as the Nevadan orogeny {{was followed by the}} Sevier and Laramide orogenies. Though Gondwana was still intact {{in the beginning of the}} Cretaceous, Gondwana itself broke up as South America, Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa (though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising <b>eustatic</b> sea levels worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Shallow epi{{continental}} seas {{like the}} current North Sea have since long existed on the European continental shelf. The rifting {{that formed the}} northern part of the Atlantic Ocean during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, from about , caused tectonic uplift in the British Isles. Since then, a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the uplands of the Fennoscandian Shield and the British Isles. This precursor of the current North Sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the <b>eustatic</b> sea level during geologic time. Sometimes it was connected with other shallow seas, such as the sea above the Paris Basin to the south-west, the Paratethys Sea to the south-east, or the Tethys Ocean to the south.|$|E
25|$|During the Late Cretaceous, about , all {{of modern}} {{mainland}} Europe except for Scandinavia was {{a scattering of}} islands. By the Early Oligocene, , the emergence of Western and Central Europe had almost completely separated the North Sea from the Tethys Ocean, which gradually shrank to become the Mediterranean as Southern Europe and South West Asia became dry land. The North Sea was {{cut off from the}} English Channel by a narrow land bridge until that was breached by at least two catastrophic floods between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago. Since the start of the Quaternary period about , the <b>eustatic</b> sea level has fallen during each glacial period and then risen again. Every time the ice sheet reached its greatest extent, the North Sea became almost completely dry. The present-day coastline formed after the Last Glacial Maximum when the sea began to flood the European continental shelf.|$|E
2500|$|During the Wisconsin Glaciation, varying {{portions}} of the Earth's water were stored as glacier ice. [...] As water accumulated in glaciers, the volume {{of water in the}} oceans correspondingly decreased, resulting in lowering of the <b>eustatic</b> sea level. [...] The variation of the <b>eustatic</b> sea level with time has been reconstructed using oxygen isotope analysis of deep sea cores, the dating of marine terraces, and high resolution oxygen isotope sampling from ocean basins and modern ice caps. A drop of <b>eustatic</b> sea level by about 60m to 120m lower than present-day levels, commencing around 30,000 years BP, caused the revealing of Beringia as a durable and extensive geographic feature connecting Siberia with Alaska.

Most of the smaller islands are unglaciated.|$|E
2500|$|Pollen data {{indicate}} a warm period culminating between 14k and 11k 14C years BP (17k-13k cal years BP) followed by cooling between 11k-10k 14C years BP (13k-11.5k cal years BP). Coastal areas deglaciated rapidly as coastal alpine glaciers, then lobes of Cordilleran ice, retreated. The retreat was accelerated as sea levels rose and floated glacial termini. [...] Estimates of a fully ice-free coast range between 16k and 15k cal years BP. [...] Littoral marine organisms colonized shorelines as ocean water replaced glacial meltwater. Replacement of herb/shrub tundra by coniferous forests was underway by 12.4k 14C years BP (15k cal years BP) north of Haida Gwaii. <b>Eustatic</b> sea level rise caused flooding, which accelerated as the rate grew more rapid.|$|E
2500|$|The Cretaceous (...) {{had much}} of the same insect fauna as the Jurassic until much later on. During the Cretaceous, the late-Paleozoic-to-early-Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea {{completed}} its tectonic breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera, as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies.

Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising <b>eustatic</b> sea levels worldwide. To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Berriasian epoch showed a cooling trend that had been seen in the last epoch of the Jurassic. There is evidence that snowfalls were common in the higher latitudes and the tropics became wetter than during the Triassic and Jurassic. Glaciation was however restricted to alpine glaciers on some high-latitude mountains, though seasonal snow may have existed farther south. Rafting by ice of stones into marine environments occurred during much of the Cretaceous but evidence of deposition directly from glaciers is limited to the Early Cretaceous of the Eromanga Basin in southern Australia.|$|E
5000|$|The Older Peron was {{the name}} for a period {{identified}} in 1961 as an episode of a global sea-level (i.e. <b>eustatic)</b> high-stand during the Holocene Epoch. [...] Modern understanding of the various factors involved in quantifying <b>eustatic</b> sea level, particularly processes relating to ocean siphoning and glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustment, claim that such previous instances of purported high-stands were not globally coherent, and do not constitute episodes of <b>eustatic</b> sea level higher than present.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the <b>eustatic</b> sea level for each dated terrace {{it is assumed that}} the <b>eustatic</b> sea-level position corresponding to at least one marine terrace is known and that the uplift rate has remained essentially constant in each section.|$|E

50|$|A second {{significant}} {{cause of}} <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise is thermal expansion of sea water when Earth's mean temperature increases. Current estimates of global <b>eustatic</b> rise from tide gauge records and satellite altimetry is about +3 mm/a (see 2007 IPCC report). Global sea level is also affected by vertical crustal movements, changes in Earth's rotation rate, large-scale changes in continental margins {{and changes in}} the spreading rate of the ocean floor.|$|E
50|$|The reconstructed {{demographic}} history {{over the}} last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the <b>eustatic</b> sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and <b>eustatic</b> sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>eustatic</b> marine {{terraces}} {{were formed}} during separate sea level highstands of interglacial stages {{and can be}} correlated to marine oxygene isotopic stages (MIS). Glacioisostatic marine terraces were mainly created during stillstands of the isostatic uplift. When eustasy was the main factor {{for the formation of}} marine terraces, derived sea level fluctuations can indicate former climate changes. This conclusion has to be treated with care, as isostatic adjustments and tectonic activities can be extensively overcompensated by a <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise. Thus, in areas of both <b>eustatic</b> and isostatic or tectonic influences, the course of the relative sea level curve can be complicated. Hence, most of today's marine terrace sequences were formed by a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and Quaternary sea level fluctuations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Eustatic</b> {{sea level}} is the sea level with {{reference}} to a fixed point, {{the centre of the}} Earth. Relative sea level is measured {{with reference to}} the base level, above which erosion can occur and below which deposition can occur. Both <b>eustatic</b> sea level changes and subsidence rates tend to be longer cycles. Sediment supply is largely thought to be controlled by local climatic conditions and can vary rapidly. These variations in local sediment supply affect the local and relative sea level which causes local sedimentary cycles.|$|E
50|$|Eustasy {{is another}} cause of {{relative}} sea level change {{quite different from}} isostatic causes. The term eustasy or <b>eustatic</b> refers {{to changes in the}} amount of water in the oceans, usually due to global climate change. When Earth's climate cools, a greater proportion of water is stored on land masses in the form of glaciers, snow, etc. This results in falling global sea levels (relative to a stable land mass). The refilling of ocean basins by glacial meltwater at the end of ice ages is an example of <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise.|$|E
50|$|In 1987-1988 {{a revised}} <b>eustatic</b> sea-level curve for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras was published, {{now known as}} the Haq sea-level curve, in {{reference}} to the Pakistani-American Oceanographer Bilal Haq.|$|E
50|$|Global or <b>eustatic</b> {{sea level}} has fluctuated {{significantly}} over the Earth's history. The main factors affecting sea level are {{the amount and}} volume of available water and the shape and volume of the ocean basins. The primary influences on water volume are {{the temperature of the}} seawater, which affects density, and the amounts of water retained in other reservoirs like rivers, aquifers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice caps and sea ice. Over geological timescales, changes {{in the shape of the}} oceanic basins and in land/sea distribution affect sea level. In addition to <b>eustatic</b> changes, local changes in sea level are caused by tectonic uplift and subsidence.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{feedback}} processes {{may also}} potentially occur, as land ice melts and causes <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise, and also potentially induces earthquakes {{as a result}} of isostatic rebound, which further acts to disrupt glaciers, ice shelves, etc.|$|E
50|$|The total {{displacement}} of the shoreline relative {{to the age of}} the associated interglacial stage allows calculation of a mean uplift rate or the calculation of <b>eustatic</b> level at a particular time if the uplift is known.|$|E
50|$|The late Anisian saw a major rise of {{the global}} (<b>eustatic)</b> sea level. A {{tropical}} sea filled the Germanic Basin then, stopping the deposition of the Buntsandstein and marking {{the beginning of the}} deposition of the Muschelkalk.|$|E
50|$|On {{top of the}} Wealden Group is the Lower Greensand Group. The {{difference}} between these two groups has been formed by a major <b>eustatic</b> (global) transgression of the sea. The Greensand (Aptian/Albian in age) consists of marine deposits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eustatic</b> change (as {{opposed to}} local change) {{results in an}} {{alteration}} to the global sea levels due to changes in either the volume {{of water in the}} world's oceans or net changes in the volume of the ocean basins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eustatic</b> {{rejuvenation}} relocates {{the mouth}} of the stream. Regrading of a stream toward a new lower base level will proceed upvalley. The result may be an interrupted profile with the point of intersection of the old and new base levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} meltwaters for meltwater pulse 1A {{and the path}} they took remains a matter of {{continuing}} controversy. The technique of sea-level fingerprinting {{has been used to}} argue that major contribution to this meltwater pulse came from Antarctica. On the other hand, other studies have argued for the Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America being the dominate source of this meltwater pulse. The magnitude of <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise during meltwater pulse 1A is a significant indicator of its sources. A <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise around 10 m could plausibly be solely explained by a North American source. On the other hand, if the <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise was larger and closer to 20 m, a significant fraction of the meltwater that caused it likely came from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Ice sheet modelling work suggests that the abrupt onset of the Bølling-Allerød (B-A) may have triggered the separation of the Cordilleran ice sheet and Laurentide Ice Sheet (and the opening of the ice-free corridor) producing a major contribution to meltwater pulse 1A from the North American ice sheet. A contribution of around 2 m in 350 years to meltwater pulse 1A from the Antarctic Ice Sheet could have been caused by Southern Ocean warming.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of marine terraces {{is controlled by}} changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to <b>eustatic</b> sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth’s crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods.|$|E
50|$|Earthquakes arise {{and result}} from {{the release of the}} force along the growth fault plane. The depocenter's exact {{location}} continuously changes because <b>eustatic</b> and relative sea level are continuously changing as well. As a result, many different growth faults are created as sediment loads shift basinward and landward.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{with the}} {{knowledge}} of <b>eustatic</b> sea level fluctuations the speed of isostatic uplift can be estimated and eventually the change of relative sea levels for certain regions can be reconstructed. Thus marine terraces also provide information for the research on climate change and trends in future sea level changes.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th Century it was {{generally}} accepted that the cause of folding and faults was lateral compression that resulted from a shrinking Earth caused by its gradual cooling. In the late 19th Century, Eduard Suess proposed his <b>eustatic</b> theory that provided the underpinnings for Chamberlin's explanation of diastrophism.|$|E
50|$|Ice loss {{may have}} {{internal}} feedback processes, as melting of ice over land can cause <b>eustatic</b> sea level rise, potentially causing instability of ice shelves and inundating coastal ice masses, such as glacier tongues. Further, a potential feedback cycle exists due to earthquakes caused by isostatic rebound further destabilising ice shelves, glaciers and ice caps.|$|E
50|$|Rejuvenation {{may result}} from causes which are dynamic, <b>eustatic</b> or {{isostatic}} in nature. All of these cause the river to erode its bed vertically (downcutting) faster as it gains gravitational potential energy. That causes effects such as incised meanders, steps where the river suddenly starts flowing faster, and fluvial terraces derived from old floodplains.|$|E
50|$|The {{debate about}} the causes of cyclic {{sedimentation}} has been contentious in the past, and it remains unresolved. Sequence stratigraphy, the study of sea level change through the examination of sedimentary deposits, was developed from the centuries-old controversy over the origin of cyclic sedimentation and the relative importance of <b>eustatic</b> and tectonic factors on sea level change.|$|E
