40|$|One {{hundred and}} {{eighteen}} consecutive cases of childhood acute diarrhoea (mean age: 10. 5 months) were studied after admission to our Pediatric Unit in Naples over a 13 -month period. A diagnosis {{was established in}} 92 patients (78 %) : 55 % of patients {{were found to have}} an infectious enteritis (among them, 5 had ETEC infections and 1 had an ST-producing Klebsiella infection), 12 % a parenteral infection, 11 % cow's milk intolerance.

To {{the best of}} our knowledge, we report the first documented case in the medical literature of a Salmonella -induced mycotic aneurysm involving an artery supplying the gluteal region. Case presentation A 37 -year-old black, Kenyan man, infected with human immunodeficiency virus with a CD 4 count of 132 cells per microliter presented with a pulsatile gluteal mass and debilitating pain progressing over one week. He was receiving prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Aspiration of the mass yielded <b>gross</b> <b>blood.</b> An ultrasound examination revealed a 37 ml vascular structure with an intra-luminal clot. Upon exploration, a true aneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery was identified and successfully resected. A culture of the aspirate grew a non-typhi Salmonellae species. Following resection, he was treated with oral ciprofloxacin for 10 weeks. He later began anti-retroviral therapy. Forty-two months after the initial diagnosis, he remained alive and well. Conclusions Clinicians caring for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus in Africa and other resource-limited settings {{should be aware of the}} invasive nature of Salmonella infections and the potential for aneurysm formation in unlikely anatomical locations. Rapid initiation of appropriate anti-microbial chemotherapy and surgical referral is needed. Use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis does not routinely prevent invasive Salmonella infections. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the parameters associated with significant gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), and construct a scoring {{system for the}} identification of patients {{at high risk of}} <b>gross</b> <b>blood</b> in stools. Study design: Data for HSP patients hospitalized at each of seven institutes were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into four groups according to the consequent severity of GI involvement. Identification of laboratory parameters at the time of admission were then used to differentiate the groups, and a scoring system to predict gross intestinal bleeding was constructed. Prognostic efficiency, correlation with the subsequent duration of abdominal pain, and association with manifestations excluding abdominal pain were also analyzed. Results: An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed significant intergroup differences in white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, serum albumin, potassium, plasma D-dimer and coagulation factor XIII activity. A scoring system consisting of these parameters showed a good prognostic value for gross intestinal bleeding in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and a cut-off value of 4 points showed a sensitivity of 90. 0 % and specificity of 80. 6 %. The score was also correlated with the duration of abdominal pain after admission. A significantly higher score (s) was observed in patients presenting with nephritis, although the predictive value was poor.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{analyzed}} the pathogenetic sequence of renal cyst and aneurysm formation in PKD mouse models. Cyst {{formation in the}} mouse model, Pkd 1 nl/nl with reduced Pkd 1 transcripts was studied by analyzing tubular cell proliferation, apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the expression the Na+K+ 2 Cl- co-transporter. These mice presented with a rapidly progressive phenotype and, in time, cyst formation was nephron segment-dependent. Interestingly, the expression of Na+K+ 2 Cl- co-transporters was also segment-dependent. TGF signaling, the most important cytokine involved in fibrosis, is activated at the progressive stages {{of the disease and}} coincides with mild fibrosis and increased expression of TGF target genes. These results suggest that the TGF signaling pathway is probably not implicated in initial steps of cyst formation, but indicate an important role during cyst progression and in fibrogenesis of progressive ADPKD. Aneurysm formation was found in the Pkd 1 nl/nl, indicating a direct association between Pkd 1 and vessel wall integrity. But, selective disruption of Pkd 1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (SM 22 -Pkd 1 del/de micel) did not induce any <b>gross</b> structural <b>blood</b> vessel abnormalities. However, SM 22 -Pkd 1 del/del mice significantly showed reduced decrease in heart rate upon Angiotensin II-induced hypertension.

There were 3 replications in each treatment. Jatropha curcas meal was fermented with lactid acid bacteria (L. acidophilus and Bifidobacter spp) for 12 x 24 hour in 37 oC. The objective of the research was to evaluate growth, feed consumption, nutrient digestibility (crude protein and <b>gross</b> energy), <b>blood</b> metabolites (glucose, cholesterol and trgliseride).

40|$|ENLARGEMENT of {{the left}} atrium is well {{known as one of}} the {{earliest}} mani-festations of rheumatic mitral valvular dys-function. On rare occasions this chamber may become enormous, expanding to the right and posteriorly to form a huge sac that encroaches upon adjacent structures and may eventually rest against the right chest wall. The clinical course of patients who develop such extreme left atrial enlargement is remarkably uniform, and the diagnosis can be suspected from the presence of a number of characteristic symp-toms and signs. Although Hewett in 18491 is generally credited with the original description of aneurysmal dilatation {{of the left}} atrium in rheumatic mitral disease, the chamber in the case which he reported was actually only the size of "a large orange. " The first instance of truly extreme left atrial enlargement was that of Owen and Fenton in 1901. 2 They described a 40 -year-old woman with an 18 -year history of progressive dyspnea.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the descriptive epidemiology of persistent diarrhoea in rural northern India, a cohort of 963 children aged 0 - 71 months was followed prospectively for 12 months through weekly household visits. The incidence of persistent diarrhoea was 6. 3 per 100 child-years among those aged 0 - 71 months, and was highest (31 per 100 child-years) among those aged 0 - 11 months. There were no significant sex-related differences in the incidence of the disease, and the overall seasonal distribution of acute and persistent diarrhoea was similar. The persistence of diarrhoeal symptoms was significantly correlated with a higher initial mean stool frequency (P less than 0. 01) and passage of <b>gross</b> <b>blood</b> with stools (P less than 0. 001). Persistent diarrhoea was an important problem among children during the first 2 years of life. Established enteric pathogens were isolated during the initial illness in 46. 4 % of persistent and 55. 4 % of acute episodes. Pathogens isolated during persistent episodes included enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC 9. 3 %), Salmonella spp. (4. 7 %), as well as campylobacter (4. 7 %), Shigella spp. (2. 3 %), Entamoeba histolytica (2. 3 %), and rotavirus (2. 3 %).

MethodsBased on different sampling sources of 19 {{intradermal tuberculin test}} (ITT) Sambar, mycobacterial infection and/or species were detected by acid-fast stain, duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex nested PCR (mnPCR) methods, traditional mycobacterial culture and <b>gross</b> lesion. <b>Blood</b> samples of 167 Sambar deer and 147 Sika deer were then tested by duplex PCR and mnPCR methods to investigate the prevalence of mycobacterial infection. Sequence variations of these mycobacterial species were analyzed as well. ResultsDuplex PCR and mnPCR assays could differentiate between MTBC (M. bovis and M. tuberculosis) and M. avium, {{as well as between}} M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, respectively. These PCR methods showed a higher detection rate than traditional culture and matched the gross lesions examined in 19 ITT-examined Sambar. Therefore, the mycobacterial infection in blood samples of 314 deer samples was detected using these PCR methods. Duplex PCR and mnPCR showed an identical prevalence of 16. 1 % in Sambar and 8. 2 % in Sika and a significant difference in prevalence between these two deer species. M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were the species detected in feedlot Sambar and Sika. M. tuberculosis was found only and first in Sambar fed in central Taiwan. Sequence analysis revealed diverse genetic variations in M. bovis and M. tuberculosis associated with deer subspecies. ConclusionMultiplex PCR methods were established, and M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were identified in feedlot deer in Taiwan. Sequence variations indicated diverse sources of both mycobacterial species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAutosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) is a multisystem disorder characterized by renal, hepatic and pancreatic cyst formation and cardiovascular complications. The condition is caused by mutations in the PKD 1 or PKD 2 gene. In mice with reduced expression of Pkd 1, dissecting aneurysms with prominent media thickening have been seen. To study the effect of selective disruption of Pkd 1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), we have generated mice in which a floxed part of the Pkd 1 gene was deleted by Cre {{under the control of}} the SM 22 promotor (SM 22 -Pkd 1 (del/del) mice). Cre activity was confirmed by X-gal staining using lacZ expressing Cre reporter mice (R 26 R), and quantitative PCR indicated that in the aorta Pkd 1 gene expression was strongly reduced, whereas Pkd 2 levels remained unaltered. Histopathological analysis revealed cyst formation in pancreas, liver and kidneys as the result of extravascular Cre activity in pancreatic ducts, bile ducts and in the glomerular Bowman's capsule. Remarkably, we did not find any spontaneous <b>gross</b> structural <b>blood</b> vessel abnormalities in mice with somatic Pkd 1 gene disruption in SMCs or simultaneous disruption of Pkd 1 in SMCs and endothelial cells (ECs). Extensive isometric myographic analysis of the aorta did not reveal differences in response to KCl, acetylcholine, phenylephrin or serotonin, except for a significant increase in contractility induced by phenylephrin on arteries from 40 weeks old Pkd 1 (del/+) germ-line mice. However, SM 22 -Pkd 1 (del/del) mice showed significantly reduced decrease in heart rate on angiotensin II-induced hypertension. The present findings further demonstrate in vivo, that adaptation to hypertension is altered in SM 22 -Pkd 1 (del/del) mice...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the therapeutic effects of Bawei Xilei San (BWXLS), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on mice with oxazolone-induced colitis {{and to explore}} the mechanisms. Methods: Thirty-two BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (8 for each) : normal control group, untreated group, hydrocortisone group and BWXLS group. Except for the mice in the normal control group, all mice were intrarectally administered with 3. 0 % oxazolone to induce colitis. Then the mice in the normal control group and untreated group were administered with 0. 9 % carboxymethyl cellulose sodium solution. Mice in the BWXLS group were intrarectally administered with 0. 2 mg/g BWXLS and hydrocortisone group with 0. 02 mg/g respectively for 5 days. The body weight and stool consistency and occult or <b>gross</b> <b>blood</b> were recorded to calculate the disease activity index (DAI). The mice were sacrificed at the 6 th day. The macroscopic and histological changes of the colon were evaluated. The expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and epithelial tight junction protein occludin were assessed by immunohistochemical method. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in colonic mucosa was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The DAI, and macroscopic and histological changes in the BWXLS group were improved as compared {{with those in the}} untreated group (P< 0. 05) but were similar to those in the hydrocortisone group. The expression of occludin was significantly increased (P< 0. 05) while the expressions of TLR 4, NF-κB and TNF-α were significantly decreased in the BWXLS group as compared with the untreated group, and were similar to those in the hydrocortisone group (P＞ 0. 05). Conclusion: Up-regulating the expression of occludin and down-regulating the expressions of TLR 4 and NF-κB, and hence inhibiting TNF-α expression and improving the mucosa barrier function may be part of the mechanisms of BWXLS in treating oxazolone-induced colitis in mice...|$|E
40|$|Background: Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) {{compared}} to general anesthesia has some pits and falls. Many drugs have been employed for this anesthesia. Propofol is accounted {{as the last}} advent anesthetic drug. It belongs to alkyl phenol families and has been accounted {{one of the best}} choices for the continuous infusion. Invention of midazolam as the first water soluble benzodiazepine was also an important event in anesthesia and it can be used as continuous infusion for the anesthesia. Materials and Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, alfentanyl plus propofol or midazolam were used for TIVA anesthesia in 60 female patients undergoing Dilatation and Curettage (D&C) in Dr. Shariati hospital in March 2002 till March 2003. They were allocated reandomly in two group of alfentanyl plus propofol (propofol group) or alfentanyl plus midazolam (midazolam group) Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} mean of age between propofol group and midazolam group (P> 0. 05), also There was no significant difference in preanesthesia condition such as blood pressure and heart rate between propofol group and midazolam group (p> 0. 05). After induction of anesthesia there was a <b>gross</b> <b>blood</b> pressure decrease in both group that it was greater in midazolam group (85 mmHg versus 73 mmHg, P 0. 05) also there was just one naloxane injection in midazolam group that have no significant difference between groups (P> 0. 05). Recovery room stay was significantly lower in propofol group (25 minutes versus 39 minutes, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results of this study was similar to Vuyk et. al. In their study there was a significant lower recovery time estimated by psychomotor reflexes and there was significant lower drowsiness, place and time orientation time {{compared to}} midazolam group. Finally according to the results of this study it can be resulted that TIVA with propofol is more suitable than midazolam and it can lower hospitalization time and cost. In future studies using other narcotics and other narcotics-anesthetic compounds with various dose can be mentioned...|$|E
30|$|Patients with a {{functioning}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract who are malnourished or {{at risk for}} the development of stress ulcer are candidates for feeding tube placement. There are several choices of access route and device, which must be tailored to the individual by considering the disease process and how long the patient will probably require nutritional support. NG tubes are used widely and are easily placed, and allow gastric residuals to be checked to assess GI tolerance and pH. Gastric pH monitoring is essential to stress ulcer prophylaxis (Bradley et al. 1998). Some authors believe that the early initiation of enteral nutrition accounts for the low incidence of bleeding from stress ulceration (Faisy et al. 2003). However, the traditional 16 - or 18 -F NG tube (intended for gastric drainage) is uncomfortable and may promote relatively greater gastroesophageal reflux by holding the lower esophageal sphincter open more than occurs with a narrower tube. Smaller-caliber nasointestinal feeding tubes (e.g., the Dobhoff tube, 8 – 10 French) are more comfortable and less erosive to the nasopharynx and esophagus, but they can clog when not carefully maintained, and also collapse easily. Generally, there are two methods of intestinal tube placement: one is under gastroscopy, and the other with the aid of contrast agents under X-ray, which requires transporting patients to a radiology department. This is time-consuming and contraindicated for critically ill patients (Heyland et al. 2004). A spiral self-propelling nasointestinal tube can be managed at the bedside, and is a simple alternative for tube placement with high success rates (Wan et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2009). For patients with traumatic brain injury associated with skull base fracture, nasointestinal tubes can be placed together with NG tubes via the patient’s mouth. The combined procedure offers a neat solution for simultaneous pH monitoring and enteral nutrition feeding. Since pulmonary infection is a major complication in seriously ill neurosurgical patients and gastric residual volume is an important factor affecting pulmonary infection, we continue to apply enteral feeding via nasointestinal tubes after ulcer healing. Nasointestinal-tube enteral feeding can effectively reduce gastric residual volume and decrease the incidence of pulmonary infection (Lu 2009). In our study, stress ulcer bleeding in all 30 patients resolved with this treatment in an average of 4.5  days, with no <b>gross</b> <b>blood</b> observed in the NG tube. Meanwhile, these patients were totally dependent on parenteral nutrition for nutritional needs. However, treatment of stress ulcer via NG tubes precludes the administration of enteral nutrition via NG tube, and patients must receive parenteral nutrition.|$|E
40|$|It is {{essential}} to start enteral nutrition early to preterm infants by giving small amounts of milk (preferably human milk) to ensure that metabolic homeostasis is kept stable and to limit postnatal growth retardation. Increasing feeding volumes to reach "full enteral feeding" is limited by individual feeding tolerance. Feeding intolerance is extremely common in premature infants. The most frequent signs of a suspect feeding intolerance are the presence of gastric residuals, abdominal distension and the onset of crises of apnea/bradycardia. Gastric residuals are probably a benign consequence of delayed gut maturation and motility in VLBW infants {{and there are no}} established normal standards. When gastric aspirates occur isolated they should not immediately induce the neonatologist to withhold feeding. Gastric residual becomes more important when accompanied by other warning signs, such as bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal wall erythema or ecchymosis, <b>gross</b> or occult <b>blood</b> in the stool, apnoea, bradycardia and temperature instability. Nutrition protocols in preterm infants must take caution when starting and increasing enteral feeding, and pay proper, but not excessive, attention to early signs of food intolerance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{interest}} in autotransfusion dwindled during World War II, {{when there was}} a large pool of donors. After the war, blood testing, typing, and crossmatching techniques were improved making blood banks the answer to the increased demand for blood. In the 1960s, {{interest in}} autotransfusion revived. With the advances in all fields of surgery, new companies developed autotransfusion devices. Problems still arose, however, with air embolism, coagulopathy, and hemolysis. [...] The devices used during the Korean and Vietnam War collected and provided <b>gross</b> filtration of <b>blood</b> before it was reinfused. With the introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass in 1952, autotransfusion became an area of study. Klebanoff began a new era of autotransfusion by developing the first commercially available autotransfusion unit in 1968. His system, the Bentley Autotransfusion System aspirated, collected, filtered and reinfused autologous whole blood shed from the operative field. The problems with the Bentley system included the requirement of systemic anticoagulation of the patient, introduction of air embolism, and renal failure resulting from unfiltered particulate in the reinfused blood.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Melanoma is a {{malignant}} tumor {{that can affect}} any area of the anatomical economy. Its occurance in the female urethra is extremely rare. We report a case of primary malignant urethral melanoma developed in an elderly female patient. Presentation of case: A 70 years old female presented with dysuria, poor stream, <b>gross</b> haematuria, intermittent <b>blood</b> spots, and a painful mass. On physical examination, there were no suspicious lesions on the skin. On external genital examination, a lesion {{at the level of}} the urethral meatus was observed. The mass was removed by wide local excision under spinal anaesthesia. The pathological diagnosis was malignant melanoma of the urethra. Discussion: The common presentations include bleeding and/or discharge per urethra, voiding dysfunction and the presence of tumor mass. Survival depends on the stage, location and size of the neoplasm at the time of diagnosis. Despite major surgery, radiotherapy or immunotherapy; malignant melanoma usually has a poor prognosis. Conclusion: Melanoma of the female urethra is an extremely uncommon pathology leading to paucity of literature and any definite recommendations regarding management. The histological and immunohistochemical findings can be helpful in making an early and accurate diagnosis of malignant melanoma in the urogenital region...|$|R
