This study examined the markets facilities level and locational effects on adjoining neighbourhoods in Akure Township. Both primary and secondary data types were employed in the study primary data were collected through the administration of questionnaire on traders and patronsbuyers in the markets and residents of adjoining neighbourhoods and personal observation. Secondary data were collected from government publications. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistical methods which included frequency counts and Likerts scale to analyse the satisfaction of traders and patrons on the facilities in the markets and severity of locational effects on residents of adjoining neighbourhoods. Findings from the study showed that facilities such as parking spaces fire extinguishers circulation spaces within the markets trading spaces safe area for children perimeter fencing and loading and off-loading bay were inadequately provided. While on-street display of goods traffic congestion air pollution on-street parking due to inadequate parking spaces were the severely perceived locational effects.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{empirical}} investigation {{on the role}} of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Group through its foreign aid activities in contributing to the economic growth of African countries, especially the African Muslim Countries (AMCs). The AMCs, which is serving as the sample countries for this study constitute more than two-third of the IDB member countries from Africa. Therefore, this study provides empirical evidences from AMCs like Algeria, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Senegal, Niger, Morocco and Tunisia among others, on the impact of its development assistance (DA) on the economic growth of these countries using balanced panel data of six years average from 1987 - 2010. In order to accomplish the objectives of this paper, Simultaneous Equations Model (SEM) was adopted and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions Estimate (SURE) method was utilized for its estimation. In view of this, the findings from this study revealed that the DA of IDB has positive impact on the economic growth of AMCs through investment as the major transmission mechanism. Moreover, the impacts of the DA on human capital were more than that of investment and growth. This paper <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> the IDB should give more attention to these important transmission mechanisms, since they are among the expected gains of foreign aid to LDCs as theoretically advanced in the literature and empirically established. Evidently, this study is perhaps the first of its kind to empirically investigate the impact of the foreign aid activities of IDB in Africa, especially in AMCs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Violence {{against women}} is a {{universal}} phenomenon that persists in all communities and in all {{countries of the world}} and the perpetrator of that violence is often well-known to the victim. Domestic violence in particular continues to be frighteningly common and well-accepted as "normal" within too many societies. Objectives: (1) The primary aim of this study is to find out the extent of different type of domestic violence and to identify various risk factors for domestic violence against married women. (2) The secondary aim is to identify the various protective factors of domestic violence against married women. Materials and Methods: The present study was a population based cross-sectional study carried out in the urban area of Gwalior city for a period of one year. Stratified random sampling technique was used for the selection of the samples. The study participants were interviewed using a pretested semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. Proportion, Pearson′s, chi-square test and odds ratio were calculated for the analysis of the study. Result: Of the 144 study participants, 68 participants reported some form of domestic violence, which was either physical, sexual or emotional. The most common type of violence reported was physical violence. The most important risk factor for domestic violence was alcoholism followed by literacy status. Majority of the abused women were dependent on their husbands for money, material assets and expenditure. Conclusion: The study <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> to prevent domestic violence government has to take stringent action for making women more self-reliant especially by making the women more literate and more financially independent...|$|E

40|$|In {{the report}} of late 2001 Safe, What is Safe?, SWOV {{indicated}} how the annual number of traffic casualties could be reduced considerably. These proposals were {{to be regarded as}} an addition to the proposals as were developed in the then National Traffic and Transport Plan of the Ministry of Transport. In Safe, What is Safe?, besides a speeding-up of the construction of a sustainably-safe infrastrucure, a qualitatively better implementation was advocated. During the last few years, the introduction of Sustainably-Safe has become widespread. What the layout of a sustainably-safe road infrastructure should preferably look like has, in the meantime, become generally well known; it can be found in various publications about this subject. Apart from this, it should be noted that, for by no means all layout elements, is known precisely a) how they influence the accident chance, and b) the extent to which this chance would change if a preferable layout was deviated from. A second problem yet to be solved is that not all Sustainably-Safe principles have been transformed into design requirements. In particular, requirements for being able to plan sustainably-safe road networks are missing. A third problem refers to the realisation of a sustainably-safe infrastructure. In practice it seems that it is not always so simple to meet the requirements and to decide whether the actual, practical experiences already indicate the need to modify the requirements. The underlying question in this is whether a greater road safety improvement in the Netherlands can be achieved if a higher quality implementation of a sustainably-safe infrastructure was achieved. This study attempts to investigate {{the extent to which the}} current and planned road infrastructures meet the Sustainably-Safe requirements. To do this, both the network features (road categorizing) and the road segment and crossroads features have been tested. This testing was carried out in a region in the Netherlands (part of the southern province of Limburg). Based on this sample, there is, at the most, an indication for the situation in the whole country; there is no reason to suppose that the situation in that part of Limburg differs widely. SWOV has formulated new draft requirements for network features. These additional requirements concern the function of a connection in an area, the crossroads type, the detour factor, and the route choice. SWOV recommends including these requirements in the next review. Our study shows that, to a large extent, the tested network meets the requirements made. However, it is striking that only a limited number of intersections of two distributor roads now meet the current requirement, namely a roundabout. In this study, an extensive addition to the layout requirements was also drawn up for crossroads and road sections. Most of these requirements can be traced back to the requirement that certain conflicts on a Sustainably-Safe road category should not occur and, if a conflict cannot be avoided, only small speed differences are permitted. SWOV <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> these extra features be added to the existing requirements. Our study shows that the tested road network sometimes scores well, whereas other features score less well. That is why SWOV recommends examining why there is such a large spread in the results. In this situation, SWOV further recommends, for a limited number of requirements (namely those for which there are strong indications that they have a relation with severe accidents), that such agreements be made that they will always be met. The present study indicates that there is a need for such agreements...|$|E

40|$|Several social audits {{conducted}} on Ga-traditional areas of Ghana, showed prevalence of disputes among the people, {{a situation that}} hinders accelerated socio-economic development. This constitutes a huge challenge. This study explores the role playedby queen mothersin conflict resolution among the Ga people. Philosophically, the interpretivists' perspectives of what constitutes an acceptable knowledge were adopted, using the qualitative approach. Data wereanalysed using thematic analysis techniqueto generate the results. The results confirmed universality and endemic nature of conflict. Types of conflict identified include; individual conflicts, group conflicts and sometimes communal conflicts. Causes of traditional conflicts were land related, chieftaincy and marital especially in polygamous homes. The study established that traditional conflicts affect socio-economic development, and conflicts bothering on marital and divorce lead to high incidence of single parents, a phenomenon that affect women and children badly. Majority of the conflict resolution roles were performed by the queen mothers. This justifies the significant and centrality of women in mediating conflict due to their good human relations. The work showed that the alternative dispute resolution method (ADR) was widely used and adopted in resolving traditional conflicts in the area.

40|$|Background: Microsporidial stromal {{keratitis}} poses several diagnostic challenges. Patients {{may present}} with corneal ulceration, marked stromal thinning, {{or even as}} a quite corneal scar. The presentation of microsporidial stromal keratitis commonly mimics viral keratitis. Microbiology scrapings are usually helpful; however, scraping and culture-negative cases pose a significant diagnostic dilemma. Histopathological examination is diagnostic but shows varying degree of inflammation, predominantly composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Granulomatous inflammation, in microsporidial stromal keratitis, is never well described, and the authors in this article aim to describe the presence of granulomatous inflammation in microsporidial stromal keratitis, in patients with associated herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. Methods: This was a retrospective and observational study conducted at a tertiary eye care center. Results: Of 263 patients who underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty for infectious keratitis, during 2011 – 2013, seven patients were diagnosed as microsporidial stromal keratitis. Microsporidial spores could be demonstrated on microbiological scrapings in 5 / 7 (71 %) of cases, but identified on histopathological examination and also confirmed on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for microsporidium in 100 % of cases. There was evidence of diffuse stromal necrosis with markedly severe degree of polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrates, with granulomatous inflammation in 42 % of cases. Interestingly, these were positive for HSV- 1 DNA on PCR. Review of medical records revealed much severe clinical presentations in patients with granulomatous inflammation, in comparison to cases without granulomatous inflammation. Conclusions: The authors <b>hereby</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> severe clinical presentation in patients with microsporidial stromal keratitis, markedly dense polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrates or the presence of granulomatous inflammation on the histopathological examination, should be investigated further {{for the presence of}} HSV- 1 DNA for better patient management and good visual outcome...|$|R

All birds in the group including the controls were bled at 7, 14 and 21 days post vaccination to determine the presence and level of antibody response in each of the groups. Results obtained showed that prevaccination haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre was less than two (log 2) in 18 % of the birds used in this experiment, however 14 % of the birds had an HI titre of ≤ 4. The post vaccination antibody titre showed that birds vaccinated with vaccine coated maize gave a post vaccination HI antibody titre of between Log 2 (6 - 8). when the coated maize samples were soaked in water at room temperature and assessed after 24 hours, the treated maize parts gave > 6. 3 log 10 EID 50 and above while the untreated parts gave 10 EID 50. The experiment showed that whole maize and husks, which were not treated, may contain agents which are virus inhibitory.

A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was utilized and data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews. These were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the Tesch’s method of qualitative data analysis by the researcher in conjunction with an independent coder. The research findings revealed that the study participants experienced gender-based violence as a common and recurrent public health issue. Participants indicated {{that the majority of the}} victims presented with a wide range of physical injuries as well as significant emotional trauma. With further exploration, it emerged that participants identified alcohol abuse, low socioeconomic status and several relationship problems as prevalent factors associated with gender-based violence. They also recognized that the current programme managing gender-based violence provides a measure of safety for victims by making emergency services available. In addition, these services could be accessed free of charge and victims identified as ‘high-risk’ were offered sanctuary in the ward to prevent further harm. Study participants further observed that the presence of a multi-disciplinary team of care-givers also contribute positively to the management of gender-based violence victims. However, participants experienced several challenges that impair their role in the management of gender-based violence victims.

However, {{increase}} in demand for forest products has resulted in over exploitation and extinction of some forest trees. Therefore, there is an urgent need of supplying improved seeds for afforestation and forest regeneration in various forestry establishments. Nursery experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of provenance and soil type on the growth of Tectona grandis. Seeds were collected from different locations in three different states namely: Ekiti, Osun and Oyo State. Seeds were collected from Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State; Iwo, Osun State and Ibadan, Oyo State. The seeds were pre-treated by soaking in the stream for two weeks before planting. The seeds were broadcasted on a germination bed at the college nursery and later, were transplanted into polythene pots containing the different soil types. The parameters assessed include total height, stem diameter and leaf production. Tectona grandis seeds collected from Oyo State and grown on loamy soil (T 6) gave the best result in both total height and stem diameter (10. 22 cm and 0. 20 cm respectively) while Teak seeds collected from Oyo State and raised on sandy soil gave the best result for leaf count (8. 17). The seeds collected from Oyo State performed better on sandy soil, best on loamy soil and less on clay soil. Seeds collected from Ekiti performed well in total height on loamy soil (9. 48 cm), in stem diameter on sandy soil (0. 17 cm) and in number of leaves both in sandy and clay soil (7. 25).

A total of 100 lecturers, students, and senior labour officers of companies were purposively sampled for the study. Primary and secondary data were engaged and analyzed using SPSS model to calculate the correlation coefficient index. The findings show competencies, commitment, innovation, motivation that HRM practices can engender for sustainable and effective development of personnel in our tertiary institutions. Based on the findings, it is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended,</b> among others, <b>that</b> lecturers/HR should review their models, curricular and strategies in developing personnel for the labour market as urgently as possible {{in order to make}} the products of our tertiary education/ institution capable of facing the chalenges of the contemporary socioeconomic environmen...|$|R
40|$|Background : Serum lipid profile assay forms one of {{the special}} {{investigations}} in most chemical pathology laboratories worldwide. Several studies in children from different countries have shown that serum lipids exhibit age and geographical pattern of variation prior to puberty. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate serum lipid profile in Nigerian children aged 6 to 36 months. Methods : A total of 115 randomly selected apparently healthy children were studied. These consisted of 38, 40 and 37 children in groups I (6 to 12 months), II (13 to 24 months) and III (25 to 36 months) respectively. There were 60 male and 55 female children. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) were measured by enzymatic colorimetric method using reagent kits supplied by Human, Gesel F&# 252;r Biochemica Und Diagnostica mbH (Wiesbaden, Germany). Serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) were subsequently estimated using Friedewald formula. Results : The reference ranges and (Mean &# 177; SEM) of serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, VLDL-C and TC/HDL-C for the total group of children were 1. 55 - 5. 42 (2. 89 &# 177; 0. 12), 0. 50 - 3. 29 (1. 28 &# 177; 0. 15), 0. 45 - 2. 77 (1. 12 &# 177; 0. 14), 0. 93 - 3. 43 (0. 79 &# 177; 0. 14), 0. 17 - 0. 72 (0. 35 &# 177; 0. 14) mmol/L and 1. 01 - 4. 74 (2. 19 &# 177; 0. 13) respectively. There were no sex differences in all these parameters. Serum levels of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TC/HDL-C in the 3 age groups were also statistically similar (p> 0. 05). Concentrations of TG and VLDL-C were lower (p&# 60; 0. 001) in group II than in I. These values were also significantly lower (p&# 60; 0. 02) in group III than in I. Serum TG and VLDL-C in groups II and III were statistically comparable (p> 0. 05). Conclusion : Serum concentrations of TC, TG and VLDL-C decrease with advancing age, with more marked decrease between first and second years of life. We <b>hereby</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> the reference values established in this study be utilized for the interpretation of serum lipid results in pre-school children in Nigerian hospitals and possibly elsewhere in Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics and related {{aspects of the}} biology of 'sinarapan' Mistichthys luzonensis Smith, the world's smallest commercial fish, are used as basis in formulating management strategies for this goby in Lake Buhi, Camarines Sur. Mesh size limit (4. 1 mm) and catch limit, estimated through length-based analytic fishery methods, are proposed. Yield-per-recruit analysis using length-frequency data for 11 months provided the quantitative indices used in estimating fishing limits. Closed season for 'sinarapan' was established from temporal pattern of recruitment and the reproductive biology of the species. Much of the data on 'sinarapan' came from studies in Lake Manapao. To improve the recruitment success of 'sinarapan', a habitat enhancement scheme in Lake Buhi is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended...</b>|$|R

40|$|Soybean was sown after sunflower, sesame and maize between 2008 and 2012 {{to assess}} its agronomic {{performance}} under continuous, rotational and conventional cropping systems. The experiment {{was laid out}} in a randomized complete block design and replicated four times. Soybean grown under rotational cropping system produced significantly (p< 0. 05, F-test) higher number of branches, seeds and pods per plant than the soybean under continuous and conventional cropping systems in 2012. Similar trend was recorded in 2011 and 2012 for grain yield. On average the grain yield performance of soybean under rotational cropping system (2, 445. 0 – 2758. 3 kg. ha- 1) was superior to the yield of soybean under continuous and conventional cropping systems (1343. 8 – 2556. 3 kg. ha- 1) as the rotation scheme became stable from 2010 to 2012.
