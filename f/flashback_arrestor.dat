50|$|A <b>flashback</b> <b>{{arrestor}}</b> or flash arrestor is {{a special}} gas safety device most commonly used in oxy-fuel welding and cutting to stop the flame or reverse flow of gas back up into the equipment or supply line and it prevents the user and equipment from damage or explosions. These devices are mainly used in different industrial processes where oxy-fuel gas mixures are handled and used. Flashback arrestors as safety products are essential to secure the workplaces and working environment. In former times there were also wet flashback arrestors used. Today the industry standard is to use dry flashback arrestors {{with at least two}} safety elements.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays in many {{attitude}} and orbital control systems a propellants based on hydrazine are used. Due {{to the high}} toxicity and the associated high costs for storage and transport, the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) in Lampoldshausen is conducting in new and less toxics fuels. The so called “Green Propellants” should offer a lower toxicity and a better performance than hydrazine. A promising variant represents a so called premixed propellant consisting of nitrous oxide and ethylene. In this case, the oxidizer and the fuel are premixed and liquefied stored in a tank. Due to the premixed condition of the propellant flashback into the tank during the engine operation is possible. Preventing flashback is the essential safety factor for an engine working with a premixed propellant. Porous materials such as sintered metals could be suitable to prevent flashback. The pressure drop of the <b>flashback</b> <b>arrestor</b> is similar to injectors a crucial element for the later mass flow, design and performance of the engine. The pressure drop of various porous sintered metals is investigated experimentally in this thesis. Following the experiments, the measurement data will {{be compared to the}} results of the classical pressure drop formulas for porous media from Forchheimer and Ergun. The test engine for nitrous oxide/ ethylene mixtures (HyNOx) of DLR is recently operating with gaseous propellant. Thus the investigation of the pressure drop across porous media is analysed by using several gases. Due to the compressibility and the high speeds of a gaseous flow differences between the theoretical predictions and the actual pressure drop measurement occur. Furthermore in this thesis the introduction of a design tool for porous materials will be made. With this design tool accurate prediction of the pressure drop will be possible. Finally, a check is made whether a flashback arrester of sintered metals can be generally used with the selected propellant combination to prevent flashback...|$|E
40|$|Upward {{flame spread}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} a thin fabric cloth consisting of 75 % cotton and 25 % fiberglass. The sample is sandwiched symmetrically with stainless steel plates with the exposed width varying between 2 to 8. 8 cm from test to test and > 1. 5 m tall. The bottom edge was ignited resulting in a symmetric two sided flame. For the narrower samples (. 5 cm), two sided flame growth would proceed until reaching some limiting value (15 - 30 cm depending on sample width). Fluctuation or instability of the flame base on one side would initially become visible and then the flame base would retreat downstream and cause extinguishment on one side. Detailed examination of the still images shows that the fuel continues to vaporize from the extinguished side due to the thermally thin nature of the fuel. But, due to the remaining inert fiberglass mesh, which acts as a <b>flashback</b> <b>arrestor,</b> the extinguished side {{was not able to}} be reignited by the remaining flame. The remaining flame would then shrink in length due to the reduced heat transfer to the solid to a shorter length. The one-sided flame will spread stably with a constant speed and a constant flame length {{to the end of the}} sample. A constant length flame implies that the pyrolysis front and the burnt out fronts move at the same speed. For the wider samples (. 7 cm), no one-sided extinction is observed. Two-sided flames spread all the way to the top of the sample. For these wider widths, the flames are still growing and have not reached their limiting length if it exists. Care was taken to minimize the amount of non-symmetries in the experimental configuration. Repeated tests show that blow-off can occur on either side of the sample. The flame growth is observed to be very symmetric during the growth phase and grew to significant length (> 10 cm) before extinction of the flame on one side. Our proposed explanation of this unusual phenomenon (i. e. stronger two]sided flame cannot exist but weaker one-sided flame can) is as follows: The observed one-sided extinction is a blow- off induced by buoyant entrainment. It is known that the flammable diffusion flame regime is bounded by quenching and blow]off limits when varying incoming air velocity. The narrowest samples tested (between 2 and 5 cm) begin within the flammable range, but as the flame grows, the buoyancy driven air velocity increases at the neighborhood of the flame base. The initially stable flame crosses the extinguishment boundary resulting in a flame blow-off. When one-side of the flame extinguishes, the remaining side shrinks due to the reduced heat transfer to the solid. This reduces the induced velocity and the flame becomes stable. It is proposed that this may have implications to upward flame growth beyond this experiment...|$|E
