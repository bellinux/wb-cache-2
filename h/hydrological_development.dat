5000|$|Owing to its {{geological}} history, this estuary {{is one of}} {{the most}} instructive examples of limestone <b>hydrological</b> <b>development.</b> The Lim stream used to flow through the valley but dried up regularly, and was really only present after the heavy rain. The Lim estuary has the appearance of a canyon. The side rises to 150 m, sinking to 20 m when they reach the sea; they are overgrown with maquis and have some special characteristics. The southern bank, facing the north, is covered with deciduous trees (oak and ash), while the north bank, facing the sun, has more evergreen flora. The vegetation has recently suffered a great deal from fires. The estuary is rich in fish, and high quality oysters and mussels. Because of the special conditions of the sea water in the channel (less salt content, a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen and well-researched temperature gradients) sea flora and fauna are particularly well developed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVariations in climate, land-use {{and water}} {{consumption}} can have profound effects on river runoff. There {{is an increasing}} demand to study these factors at the regional to river basin-scale since these effects will particularly affect water resources management at this level. This paper presents a method that can help to differentiate between the effects of man-made <b>hydrological</b> <b>developments</b> and climate variability (including both natural variability and anthropogenic climate change) at the basin scale. We show and explain the relation between climate, water consumption and changes in runoff for the Krishna river basin in central India. River runoff variability due to observed climate variability and increased water consumption for irrigation and hydropower is simulated for the last 100 years (1901 ? 2000) using the STREAM water balance model. Annual runoff under climate variability is shown to vary only by about 14 ? 34 millimetres (6 ? 15 %). It appears that reservoir construction after 1960 and increasing water consumption has caused a persistent decrease in annual river runoff of up to approximately 123 mm (61 %). Variation in runoff under climate variability only would have decreased over the period under study, but we estimate that increasing water consumption has caused runoff variability that is three times higher...|$|R
40|$|Taken together, the Bahlui basin held a high {{potential}} hydrological risk, as attested by the numerous floods {{that have occurred}} over time, even in the recent history, such as the events which occurred here in 1932, when {{a part of the}} city of Iasi was under waters. After the extensive projects of <b>hydrological</b> <b>development,</b> the hydrological activity of the river was monitored continuously and thus under control. Today, thanks to these efforts to stop water threats, and after designing a comprehensive program of <b>hydrological</b> <b>development,</b> the Bahlui basin is 70 - 75 % anthropic, being a model for the entire country and beyond. However, despite the high degree of river planning and development, there are areas where hydrological threat is still present, especially in small tributaries that have a hydrological system obsolete or missing. Thus, the applicability of formulas for determining maximum flows with different occurrence probabilities have found purpose by identifying the potential hydrological risk in case of very small pools and areas with a more torrential character. The existence of a digital database of the land related with debts results revealed a fact apparently known only by the affected population, namely that the negative events associated with the maximum flow occur and threat human society, agricultural land, households, and annexes. Therefore, on the assumption that flooding and high water runoffs should not get to a catastrophic level in order to start planning; it should be enough that there are sites under direct hydrological threat (bridges, roads, houses, agricultural land, etc.), the present analysis aims to constitute an evaluation model for better management and planning...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} viscous model of plate bending {{suitable}} for studying ice-sheet flexure due to subglacial lake filling and draining, and apply this model {{to determine the}} area of ice-sheet uplift surrounding a subglacial lake. The choice of a viscous model reflects our interest in Antarctic subglacial lakes, which can fill and drain on time scales of months to decades. Experiments with idealized lake shapes show {{that the size of}} the uplift area relative to lake area depends on subglacial water pressure and ice-sheet thickness, with the viscous material parameters scaling the magnitude of uplift rate within this area. The water pressure therefore has a strong control on the evolution of the lake shape and related subglacial <b>hydrological</b> <b>development,</b> but is not yet well constrained by observations. Due to the likelihood that ice flexure will affect subglacial lake filling and draining, we suggest that the insights of this study should be applied to development of a realistic ice sheet-hydrological coupled model...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka, {{a country}} with {{abundant}} water resources, has a predominantly agriculture oriented economy. Hence, <b>hydrological</b> <b>development</b> plays an important role, {{not only in the}} vast irrigation development efforts, but also in meeting the energy requirements of the country through hydro-power. Many hydrologic design problems require simply an estimation of the peak flow rate generated by a river system under specific conditions. Several methods are available for the estimation of peak flow rate, but many of these are quite inadequate to produce results which are consistent within the accuracy required for hydrologic analysis and design. In this study several different flood estimation methods have been considered for sixteen catchments to determine their applicability to Sri Lankan catchments. A frequency analysis is also carried out for each of the catchments and their flood peaks are compared with the design floods obtained by different methods. It is observed that the findings of this thesis lead to various research areas, for further detailed studies with regard to some of the methods of analysis...|$|E

The proposal articulates x) a site-specific exploration of design solutions for improving water service in one neighborhood of lztapalapa, 2) a template for coupled social and <b>hydrological</b> <b>development</b> that can be replicated elsewhere in the borough, and 3) a broad argument for multi-performative infrastructure that incorporates, and strengthens, existing reserves {{of social and political}} capital.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{drainage}} of active subglacial lakes in Antarctica {{has previously been}} inferred from analysis of ice surface altimetry data. We use a subglacial hydrology model applied to a synthetic Antarctic ice stream to examine internal controls on the filling and drainage of subglacial lakes. Our model outputs suggest that the highly constricted subglacial environment of our idealized ice stream, combined with relatively high rates of water flow funneled from a large catchment, can combine to create a system exhibiting slow-moving pressure waves. Over a period of years, the accumulation {{of water in the}} ice stream onset region results in a buildup of pressure creating temporary channels, which then evacuate the excess water. This increased flux of water beneath the ice stream drives lake growth. As the water body builds up, it steepens the hydraulic gradient out of the overdeepened lake basin and allows greater flux. Eventually this flux is large enough to melt channels that cause the lake to drain. Lake drainage also depends on the internal <b>hydrological</b> <b>development</b> in the wider system and therefore does not directly correspond to a particular water volume or depth. This creates a highly temporally and spatially variable system, which is of interest for assessing the importance of subglacial lakes in ice stream hydrology and dynamics...|$|E
40|$|China has a {{long history}} of <b>hydrological</b> <b>development.</b> According to Chinese legends, famous {{projects}} of flood water diversion were developed by the Great Yu as early as the year two thousand B. C. The earliest hydrological record appeared in 256 B. C., when Mr. Lipin and his son constructed the Dujiangyan irrigation system in the upper reach of the Mingjiang River in Sichuan Province. At Baopingkao, the water intake point of the Dujiangyan irrigation system, a water staff gage was carved on a stone for the measurement of water levels. Although hydrological studies in China started early, hydrology and water resources as modern sciences have been developed only in the last several decades, particularly rapidly in the last 30 years. For instance, the number of hydrological stations has increased 45 times, from about 350 to more than 16, 000. Of these, about 3300 stations also take flow velocity measurements. The average density of the hydrological stations is about one per 530 km 2 and that of discharge measurement stations about one in 3, 000 km 2. These stations are highly concentrated in eastern China. The longest records of precipitation are maintained in the large cities in eastern China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjing. Beijing has 140 years of precipitation records. The Hankao hydrological station on the Changjiang (Yangtze) River has the longest discharge record spanning 117 years (1865 - 1982) ...|$|E

40|$|Organic matter {{deposited}} in ancient, ice-rich permafrost sediments {{is vulnerable to}} climate change and {{may contribute to the}} future release of greenhouse gases; it is thus important to get a better characterization of the plant organic matter within such sediments. From a Late Quaternary permafrost sediment core from the Buor Khaya Peninsula, we analysed plant-derived sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) to identify the taxonomic composition of plant organic matter, and undertook palynological analysis to assess the environmental conditions during deposition. Using sedaDNA, we identified 154 taxa and from pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs we identified 83 taxa. In the deposits dated between 54 and 51  kyr BP, sedaDNA records a diverse low-centred polygon plant community including recurring aquatic pond vegetation while from the pollen record we infer terrestrial open-land vegetation with relatively dry environmental conditions at a regional scale. A fluctuating dominance of either terrestrial or swamp and aquatic taxa in both proxies allowed the local <b>hydrological</b> <b>development</b> of the polygon to be traced. In deposits dated between 11. 4 and 9. 7  kyr BP (13. 4 – 11. 1  cal kyr BP), sedaDNA shows a taxonomic turnover to moist shrub tundra and a lower taxonomic richness compared to the older samples. Pollen also records a shrub tundra community, mostly seen as changes in relative proportions of the most dominant taxa, while a decrease in taxonomic richness was less pronounced compared to sedaDNA. Our results show the advantages of using sedaDNA in combination with palynological analyses when macrofossils are rarely preserved. The high resolution of the sedaDNA record provides a detailed picture of the taxonomic composition of plant-derived organic matter throughout the core, and palynological analyses prove valuable by allowing for inferences of regional environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} growing volume of online {{political}} commentary being produced by Internet users in Mainland China and South Korea, analysing the qualities {{and characteristics of}} these discourses through adaptation of the argument provided by German sociologist Jürgen Habermas about {{the workings of the}} public sphere. In evaluating the gap between the idealised qualities of the public sphere and real-life communication, the study uses the concept of the public sphere as a heuristic device. This study asks two questions: first, to what extent does the political communication hosted on the online discussion boards, blogs, webpages, Tweets, microblogs and other forms of online media in both countries resemble a public sphere and, second, what sort of political change do these forms of exchange encourage. To explore these questions, this study incorporates analysis of online discussion related to four case studies that span the cyberspheres of both nations: the coverage provided by online news services, online nationalism and the conflict over the history of the Goguryeo Kingdom, Internet-based environmental activism and opposition to <b>hydrological</b> <b>development</b> and, finally, debates surrounding the social and legal status of gays and lesbians in Korean and Chinese society. Based on qualitative analysis, subject interviews and background research related to these four areas, this study argues that while the public sphere concept is inadequate for assessing the characteristics of Internet-mediated political discourse, online media are nonetheless helping to pluralise public political communication in Korean and Chinese society. The thesis finds that while such pluralisation is promoting incremental political change, it is nonetheless doing so in largely unpredictable ways. The study concludes that online political communications may not produce the expected outcomes of institutionalised democracy in China, or the consolidation of democracy in South Korea...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates {{climate change}} impacts on water {{resources}} using an ensemble of six regional climate models (RCMs) –global climate models (GCMs) in the Dano catchment (Burkina Faso). The applied climate datasets were {{performed in the}} framework of the CO ordinated R egional climate D ownscaling Ex periment (CORDEX-Africa) project. After evaluation of the historical runs of the climate models' ensemble, a statistical bias correction (empirical quantile mapping) was applied to daily precipitation. Temperature and bias corrected precipitation data from the ensemble of RCMs–GCMs was then used as input for the Wa ter flow and balance Si mulation M odel (WaSiM) to simulate water balance components. The mean hydrological and climate variables for two periods (1971 – 2000 and 2021 – 2050) were compared to assess the potential impact of climate change on water resources up {{to the middle of the}} 21 st century under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)   4. 5 and  8. 5. The results indicate (i)  a clear signal of temperature increase of about 0. 1  to 2. 6  °C for all members of the RCM–GCM ensemble; (ii)  high uncertainty about how the catchment precipitation will evolve over the period  2021 – 2050; (iii)  the applied bias correction method only affected the magnitude of the climate change signal; (iv)  individual climate models results lead to opposite discharge change signals; and (v)  the results for the RCM–GCM ensemble are too uncertain to give any clear direction for future <b>hydrological</b> <b>development.</b> Therefore, potential increase and decrease in future discharge have to be considered in climate change adaptation strategies in the catchment. The results further underline on the one hand the need for a larger ensemble of projections to properly estimate the impacts of climate change on water resources in the catchment and on the other hand the high uncertainty associated with climate projections for the West African region. A water-energy budget analysis provides further insight into the behavior of the catchment. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{simulations}} {{with the}} Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model are performed {{to quantify the}} spatial variability of both potential and actual evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture content (SMC) caused by topography-induced spatial wind and radiation differences. To obtain the spatially distributed ET/SMC patterns, the field scale SWAP model is applied in a distributed way for both pointwise and catchment wide simulations. An adapted radiation model from r. sun and the physically-based meso-scale wind model METRAS PC are applied to obtain the spatial radiation and wind patterns respectively, which show significant spatial variation and correlation with aspect and elevation respectively. Such topographic dependences and spatial variations further propagate to ET/SMC. A strong spatial, seasonal-dependent, scale-relevant intra-catchment variability in daily/annual ET and less variability in SMC can be observed from the numerical experiments. The study concludes that topography has {{a significant effect on}} ET/SMC in the humid region where ET is a energy limited rather than water availability limited process.

40|$|We {{normally}} see hydrological drought as {{a period}} of low streamflow and/or groundwater levels caused by a long lack of rainfall in the summer period, combined with high temperatures and high evaporation. But there are more mechanisms underlying <b>hydrological</b> drought <b>development,</b> which encouraged Van Loon and Van Lanen (2012) to define six hydrological drought types. In some of these types low temperatures {{play an important role}} in the <b>development</b> of <b>hydrological</b> drought through the lack of recharge to the groundwater system due to the accumulation of snow. From studying time series of hydrometeorological variables of catchments in cold climates and monsoon climates, we now found evidence for hydrological drought types that were not studied before. Analysis of drought events in selected catchments in Ethiopia showed that variability in the start of the monsoon leads to hydrological droughts that can last throughout the wet season. Analysis of drought events in rivers in high Northern latitudes showed that a lack of snowfall in the winter season leads to a drought during the snow melt period. This is crucial for water resources management, because the snow melt period is needed to fill up reservoirs. From recent climate research there is some confidence that global warming will lead to a regime change in both hydroclimatic regions. Snowmelt peaks are expected to be earlier and lower and the variability of the start of the monsoon will increase in the future. The consequence is that the hydrological drought types mentioned above will occur more often. This might cause serious problems as societies have adjusted to the occurrence of peak flow of a certain magnitude in a certain perio...|$|R
40|$|Water {{scarcity}} severely impairs {{food security}} and economic prosperity {{in many countries}} today. Expected future population changes will, in many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources {{will be affected by}} projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a global warming of 2 °C above present (approximately 2. 7 °C above preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15 % of the global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity (< 500 m 3 per capita per year) by another 40 % (according to some models, more than 100 %) compared with the effect of population growth alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase is seen between the present day and 2 °C, whereas indicators of very severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 °C. At the same time, the study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates, with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread. GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved water resource projections through <b>hydrological</b> model <b>development...</b>|$|R

A 3 · 5 -kHz profiling suggests a lowering of the water level by at least 30 m at Manaus. During that phase, the slope of the Amazon valley must have increased, resulting in an increase in bed load transport capacity. The subsequent sea level rise caused a backwater effect far upstream, with silting up of the Amazon valley and the tributary inflows. Former river systems changed into Ria lakes.

We analysed the hydrographs of these specific events and conducted three types of statistical analyses on the entire time series: cumulative discharges, empirical extreme value distribution of the peak flows and flow duration curves for low flows. The results illustrate the relevance of including a very quick flow reservoir preceding the root zone storage to model peaks during low flows and including a slow reservoir in parallel with the fast reservoir to model the recession for the studied catchments. This intercomparison enhanced the understanding of the hydrological functioning of the catchment, in particular for low flows, and enabled to identify present knowledge gaps for other parts of the hydrograph. Above all, it helped to evaluate each model against a set of alternative models...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the {{economic}} assessment of large projects is sensitive to assumptions about discounting future costs and benefits. Projects that require high upfront investments and take years to begin producing economic benefits can be difficult to justify with the discount rates typically used for project appraisal. While most economists argue that social discount rates should be below 4 %, many international development banks and government planning agencies responsible for project appraisal can be found using rates of 7 - 12 % or more. These agencies justify choosing higher discount rates to account for the opportunity cost of capital. Meanwhile, a new and robust debate has begun in economics over whether social discount rates of even 3 - 4 % are too high in the context of climate change. This paper reviews the recent discounting controversy and examines its implications for the appraisal of an illustrative hydropower project in Ethiopia. The analysis uses an integrated hydro-economic model that accounts for how the dam’s transboundary impacts vary with climate change. The real value of the dam is found to be highly sensitive to assumptions about future economic growth. The argument for investment is weakest under conditions of robust global economic growth, particularly if these coincide with unfavourable <b>hydrological</b> or <b>development</b> factors related to the project. If however long-term growth is reduced, the value of the dam tends to increase. There may also be distributional or local arguments favouring investment, if growth in the investment region lags behind that {{of the rest of the}} globe. In such circumstances, a large dam can be seen as a form of insurance that protects future vulnerable generations against the possibility of macroeconomic instability or climate shocks...|$|R
30|$|Drainage basins, {{catchments}} and sub-catchments are {{the fundamental}} units {{for the management}} of land and water resources (Moore et al. 1994). Morphometric analysis in a drainage basin is important for <b>hydrological</b> investigation and <b>development</b> and management of drainage basin (Rekha et al. 2011). Morphometric parameters and climatic conditions are the key determinants of running water ecosystems functioning at the basin scale (Lotspeich and Platts 1982; Frissel et al. 1986). The quantitative analysis of morphometric parameters is found to have immense utility in river basin evaluation, watershed prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resource management at watershed level (Malik et al. 2011). The morphometric characteristics of the watershed control all surface runoff, and due to this condition, the watershed is considered an ideal territorial unit (Lima et al. 2011). Evaluation of morphometric parameters could be calculated from the analysis of various drainage parameters such as ordering of the various streams and basin area, perimeter and length of drainage channels, drainage density, stream frequency, bifurcation ratio, texture ratio, basin relief, ruggedness number, and time of concentration (Kumar et al. 2000; Nag and Chakraborthy 2003).|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{hydrological}} drought {{studies have}} demonstrated spatial and temporal patterns in observed trends and considerable difference exists among global hydrological models {{in their ability to}} reproduce these patterns. A controlled modeling experiment has been set up to systematically explore the role of climate and physical catchment structure (soils and groundwater systems) to better understand underlying drought-generating mechanisms. Daily climate data (1958 – 2001) of 1495 grid cells across the world were selected that represent Köppen-Geiger major climate types. These data were fed into a hydrological model. Nine realizations of physical catchment structure were defined for each grid cell, i. e. three soils with different soil moisture supply capacity and three groundwater systems (quickly-, intermediary- and slowly-responding). Hydrological drought characteristics (number, duration and standardized deficit volume) were identified from time series of daily discharge. Summary statistics showed that the equatorial and temperate climate types (A- and C-climates) had about twice as many drought events as the arid and polar types (B- and E-climates) and the duration of more extreme droughts were about half the length. Soils were found to have a minor effect on hydrological drought characteristics, whereas groundwater systems had major impact. Groundwater systems strongly controlled the hydrological drought characteristics of all climate types, but particularly those of the wetter A-, C- and D-climates because of higher recharge. The median number of drought for quickly-responding groundwater systems was about three times higher than for slowly-responding systems, which substantially affected the duration, particularly of the more extreme drought events. Bivariate probability distributions of drought duration and standardized deficit for combinations of Köppen-Geiger climate, soil and groundwater system showed that responsiveness of groundwater systems is as important as climate for <b>hydrological</b> drought <b>development.</b> This urges for an improvement of subsurface modules in global hydrological models to be more useful for water resources assessments. A foreseen higher spatial resolution would enable a better hydrogeological parameterization and inclusion of lateral flow...|$|R
