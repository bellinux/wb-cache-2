500|$|Murphy created Burt as [...] "a working-class dude who's {{not okay}} {{with his son}} being gay, a guy who's <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time." [...] The {{character}} is loosely based on his own father. He had O'Malley in mind when casting the role, and felt confident about his capability: [...] "It's a real tour de force role and I knew what Mike could do. This isn't an after-school special. ... It's heavy and Mike {{has the ability to}} cut through the sentiment." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Mike's talent is deep. I will always write for Mike O'Malley." [...] The actor did not have to audition, and was invited to read for the part by Murphy personally. The two men, along with Falchuk, had previously worked together on the television movie Pretty/Handsome. While reading the first twenty pages of script, O'Malley was not initially enthusiastic about playing the role, as the character appeared to be an intolerant stereotype. He changed his mind, however, after realizing that Burt was to be portrayed as a more accepting man, with [...] "grace and love that comes first for his son." ...|$|E

He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the plans}} to make the film with Jessel would fall through, for {{multiple}} reasons. Jessel's contract with Warner Bros. had not anticipated that the movie they had particularly signed him for would be made with sound (he'd made a modestly budgeted, silent comedy in the interim). When Warners had hits with two Vitaphone, though dialogue-less, features in late 1926, The Jazz Singer production had been reconceived. Jessel asked for a bonus or a new contract, but was rebuffed. According to Jessel's description in his autobiography, Harry Warner [...] "was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time with the financing of the company.... He talked about taking care of me if the picture was a success. I {{did not feel that}} was enough." [...] In fact, around the beginning of 1927, Harry Warner—the eldest of the brothers who ran the eponymous studio—had sold $4 million (US$ in [...] dollars) of his personal stock to keep the studio solvent. Then came another major issue. According to Jessel, a first read of screenwriter Alfred A. Cohn's adaptation [...] "threw me into a fit. Instead of the boy's leaving the theatre and following the traditions of his father by singing in the synagogue, as in the play, the picture scenario had him return to the Winter Garden as a blackface comedian, with his mother wildly applauding in the box. I raised hell. Money or no money, I would not do this." ...|$|E
