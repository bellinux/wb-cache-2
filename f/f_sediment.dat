Eight chemostratigraphic suites and 14 palaeo-environments have been recognized. Sediment types, environments of deposition and provenance change in response to rising sea-level, showing a range from freshwater fluvial deposition of locally derived terrestrial sediment to inter-tidal and subtidal deposition <b>f</b> <b>sediments</b> from marine sources. The methods used are illustrated with reference to sediment cores from inner and outer estuary locations.

40|$|Minnesota’s 3. 6 million ha of {{wetlands}} have been impacted {{by a variety}} of human activities, including agricultural drainage, urbanization, water control, and nonpoint source pollution. More than half of Minnesota's wetlands have been destroyed since the first European settlers arrived, an average loss of about 35, 600 ha/yr. Drainage for agriculture is the major cause of wetland loss in Minnesota, particularly in southern Minnesota and the Red River Valley. In addition to impacting wetlands directly, wetland drainage affects downstream areas by increasing flood flows, and releasing sediment and nutrients. Urban development and highway construction affect a smaller proportion of Minnesota’s wetlands, but substantially alter their physical, chemical, and biological properties. Hydrology has a major influence on the structure and function {{of wetlands}}, so changes in the frequency, duration, depth, and timing o f wetland flooding can severely impact wetlands. While wetlands can assimilate low levels o <b>f</b> <b>sediment</b> and nutrient enrichment, excessive inputs can be detrimental.

The presence of large numbers ofpropagules in the surface layers is adaptive, facilitating reception of germination cues and attainment of the soil surface by young shoots. However this strategy also exposes propagules to predation as well as to high temperatures during the dry season.

An active autotomy promotion was observed in three studied sediments at different time points and reproduction impairment could be inferred in T. tubifex exposed to two of the tested sites after 28 days. The present study showed that sediment metal concentration and tissue residues followed significant regression models for four essential metals (Cu, Co, Ni and Zn) and one non-essential metal (Pb). Organic content normalization for As also showed a significant relationship with As tissue residue. Porewater was also revealed to be an important source of metal uptake for essential metals (e. g.

The large volume of liter-ature devoted to turbidite systems in particular shows the importance of detailed descriptions of their characteristics and overall geomorphological vari bility, primarily through the distribution of sediment facies. These descriptions ely mainly on acoustic measurements, which are notoriously difficult o interpret. Textural analyses quantify the second-order statistics ofsonar imagery, detect-ing and quantifying details invisible to the human eye. We show the potential (and limitations) of this approach using high-resolution (6 m) towed ocean bottom instrument (TOBI) sidescan sonar imagery acquired in the Albor~in Sea, south ofAlmerfa, Spain, during the high resolution imaging of Tsunamigenic structures (HITS) 2001 programme.

Prior to its closure in 1994, Northam Burrows landfill site in the Southwest UK, received up to 60, 000 t of household and industial waste per annum. No leachate containment system is installed at the site, and leachate drains freely to the Torridge estuary via the protected Skern mudflats. Initial assessment of the estuarine sediments receiving drainage from the landfill was conducted using bioassay exposures with the amphipod Corophium volutator, early life stages of the bivalve mussel Mytilus edulis, and the green flagellate Dunaliella primolecta. The results demonstrate elevated toxicity in sediment samples taken from stations adjacent to the landfill site compared to samples obtained from a reference location, on the opposite bank of the estuary. Toxicity is demonstrated in whole sediment exposures and in elutriates, produced from fresh sediment samples. The elutriate toxicity suggests that sediments may act {{as a source of}} water column contamination in the estuary, which may occur following resuspension of sediments due to erosion of the local area. This study provides an initial assessment of the sediment quality in the Skern mudflats and demonstrates the use of bioassays in assessment of small-scale variation in toxicity due to a complex pollution source. This thesis also provides information which suggests that toxicity is not associated with elevated metal concentrations, and discusses the use of the selected bioassays in assessment o <b>f</b> <b>sediment</b> samples.

It is shown that CBS can be modelled as a viscous fluid, and that the entrainment rates quantitatively match relations described in the literature on salt-fresh water induced stratified systems. Numerical simulations with one-dimensional vertical models using k-E and Prandtl mixing length turbulence closures were carried out for hypothetical open channel flows to study the behaviour o f CBS through sensitivity analyses. It is shown that high-concentrated mud suspensions may become saturated, generating a CBS-layer prior to the formation o f fluid mud.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 596 on 27. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) The Mersey Estuary has received significant quantities of industrial wastes and sewage over several decades. Although contaminant loads are reducing and the estuary is {{showing signs of}} recovery, the sediment reservoir remains a repository of historical contamination and still contains high concentrations of trace metals and organic compounds. A combination of hydrodynamic, sedimentary and geochemical processes are responsible for maintaining trace metal concentrations at present-day levels. The distributions of trace metals in bed sediments reflect changes in granulometry, differences in POC content and the magnitude of past inputs rather than the locations of point sources in the estuary. The association of contaminant metals with SPM varies not only with axial changes in salinity and particle concentration but also {{in response to the}} relative magnitudes of freshwater and tidal inflows and cyclic variations in water and particulate chemistry that occur on intratidal, intertidal and seasonal timescales. The most influential of these arise from axial changes in dissolved oxygen and the delivery of organic carbon from both external and internal sources which modify the relative degree of sorptive control exerted by Fe, Mn and organic C at different locations in the estuary and at different times. These factors, combined with the efficient trapping o <b>f</b> <b>sediments</b> and possible salting out of neutral metal-organic complexes, assist in the retention and internal recycling of particles and associated metals between the bed and water column. Geochemical reactivity is suppressed in Mersey SPM and metal decontamination is not predicted to occur through the loss of particulate metals to the surrounding coastal zone. Rather, it is envisaged that sediment resuspension and the desorption of metals into fresh and low salinity waters, supplemented by the release of metals from tidally stirred diagenetically modified sediments, {{are more likely to be}} important long term cleansing mechanisms, with the latter occurring particularly during the summer months when bacterial numbers and the degradation of accumulated organic detritus becomes more pronounced. Future declines in metals from bed sediments have been estimated using two methods and two independent data sets. Resulting values are not only metal-dependent but also vary with sediment location. Losses of Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni and Zn are predicted to take up to 40 years, whilst removal of substantially elevated concentrations of Pb in sediments in the upper estuary could span hundreds of years.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{different}} origins {{are proposed}} for fossil silcretes in continental Cenozoic sedimentary ocks of Western Portugal. These soils developed in {{more or less}} the same parent materials. The lower silcrete, l to l 0 m thick, is a consistent indicator at the top of an upward-fining member and shows clear evidence of weathering processes: the decay of illite and its replacement by kaolinite, the redistribution and concentration of iron oxides, the impregnation <b>f</b> the <b>sediment</b> by silica minerals (opal-CT with the optical properties ofquartzine under the petrographic microscope), and a late concentration of alunite rhombs along cracks in the upper part of the silcrete. This silcrete resulted from prolonged exposure of sediment to soil processes in a well-drained environment. The silcretes interbedded in a younger member are locally silicified layers at the top of upward-fining units. Silica minerals (opal-CT) precipitated where palygorskite also formed in abundance. Alkaline ponds are postulated by the numerous slickensides, due to shrinkage and swelling of clay minerals, indicate temporary subaerial exposure of the sediments and later silicification. Many rhombic boxworks in these silcretes could be the expression of a previous alunite precipitation, similar to alunite concretions at the top of this member. These silcretes in the younger member formed by repetitive processes acting in local swampy environments under a relatively dry climate. Alunite, which is abundant at the top of the lower silerete, must not be considered as a final product of weathering. It is probably a later mineral phase introduced when the overlying beds were laid down...|$|R

This conclusion {{is based on the}} observation that covalently closed circular (CCC) plasmid DNA can cosediment with undegraded host chromosome in a neutral sucrose gradient. When F plus bacteria are lysed under conditions that preserve chromosome, approximately 90 % of CCC F sex factor plasmid (about 1 % of the total DNA) is found in folded chromosomes sedimenting at rates between 1, 500 and 4, 000 s.

Reconstruction experiments in which 80 S, CCC F DNA is added to F plus or F minus bacteria before cell lysis show that exogenous F DNA does not associate with folded chromosomes. In F plus bacteria, F plasmid is harbored at a level of one or two copies per chromosomal equivalent. In bacteria producing colicin E 1, the genetic determinant of this colicin, the Col E 1 plasmid, is harbored at levels of 10 to 13 copies per chromosomal equivalent; yet, greater than 90 % of these plasmids do not cosediment with the 1, 800 S species of folded chromosome.

The cytotoxicity and AhR-mediated activity of sediments from the Yangtze River estuary ranged from low level to moderate level compared with the ecotoxicity of sediments from other river systems. However, Yangtze River releases approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared with Rhine, a major river in Europe. Thus, the absolute pollution mass transfer of Yangtze River may be detrimental to the environmental quality of estuary and East China Sea. Effect-directed analysis was applied to identify substances causing high dioxin-like activities. To identify unknown substances contributing to dioxin-like potencies of whole extracts, we fractionated crude extracts by open column chromatography. Non-polar paraffinic components (F 1), weakly and moderately polar components (F 2), and highly polar substances (F 3) were separated from each crude extract of <b>sediments.</b> <b>F</b> 2 showed the highest dioxin-like activities. Based {{on the results of}} mass balance calculation of chemical toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQs), our conclusion is that priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons indicated a low portion of bio-TEQs ranging from 1 % to 10 % of crude extracts. Further studies should be conducted to identify unknown pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Addition of nitrapyrin, allylthiourea, C(inf 2) H(inf 2), and CH(inf 3) <b>F</b> to {{freshwater}} <b>sediment</b> slurries inhibited CH(inf 4) oxidation and nitrification {{to similar}} extents. Dicyandiamide and allylsulfide were less inhibitory for CH(inf 4) oxidation than for nitrification. Allylsulfide {{was the most}} potent inhibitor of nitrification, and the estimated 50 % inhibitory concentrations for this process and CH(inf 4) oxidation were 0. 2 and 121 (mu) M, respectively. At a concentration of 2 (mu) M allylsulfide, growth and CH(inf 4) oxidation activity of Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b were not inhibited. Allylsulfide at 200 (mu) M inhibited the growth of M. trichosporium by approximately 50 % but did not inhibit CH(inf 4) oxidation activity. Nitrite production by cells of M. trichosporium was not significantly affected by allylsulfide, except at a concentration of 2 mM, when growth and CH(inf 4) oxidation were also inhibited by about 50 %. Methane monooxygenase activity present in soluble fractions of M. trichosporium was not inhibited significantly by allylsulfide at either 200 (mu) M or 2 mM. These {{results suggest that the}} partial inhibition of CH(inf 4) oxidation in sediment slurries by high allylsulfide concentrations may be caused by an inhibition of the growth of methanotrophs rather than an inhibition of methane monooxygenase activity specifically. We conclude that allylsulfide is a promising tool for the study of interactions of methanotrophs and nitrifiers in N cycling and CH(inf 4) turnover in natural systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Batch {{data for}} the {{sorption}} of Eu and Th on pelagic sediments may be represented by equations of the form: In M = A in Cs + B/T + D, where M = concentration <b>f</b> sorbate on <b>sediment,</b> Cs = concen-tration of sorbate in solution, T = absolute temperature, and A, B, and D = constants. Thermodynamic interpretation f this equation leads to an expression for the true thermodynamic equilibrium constant of K = m/Cs A and for the enthalpy change, AH, of d ln(M/CsA) /d(1 /T) =-AH/R, where R = universal gas constant. Experimentally, the sorption of Eu onto clay-rich sediments was very rapid {{in the first few}} seconds and slowed over an interval of minutes to hours. Rate curves were similar in shape to those of a-iron hydroxide, rather than of the oxalate-extracted r sidual sediment, indicating the importance of oxyhydroxide-like phases in the uptake of Eu onto red-clay sediments. For day-rich sediments, numerical modeling repro-duced the general features of a series of diffusion experiments. To a first approximation, the penetration of Eu into a sediment proceeded by saturation ofthe sediment to the depth of penetration a d produced a sharp drop-offin sorbed + dissolved Eu concentration at the diffusion front. Higher partition coefficients (Kv) resulted in greater sorbed + dissolved concentrations, but reduced penetration. For calcareous sed-iments, however, Eu concentrations at the surface were much higher than at depth, presumably due to the formation of an insoluble carbonate...|$|R

Site U 1337 is on a plateau between high topography {{to the south of}} the site, a gentle but pockmarked ridge to the north, and a deep to the east (Fig. <b>F</b> 1). <b>Sediment</b> cover is thick on the plateau (300 – 600 ms two-way traveltime [TWT]; ~ 200 – 500 m) (Fig. F 2) but highly variable along the edges. Nevertheless, the seafloor is relatively flat because the sediment has filled in the basement topography, with a relief of ~ 200 ms TWT. To the north, along seismic Line 6, the seafloor is dissected by a series of karstlike holes that cut through the seismic layering (Fig. F 1). Based on correlation to the central equatorial Pacific seismic stratigraphy of Mayer et al. (1985), middle Miocene sediment has been exposed. Site U 1337 is now north of the equatorial high-productivity zone but should have been within ± 2 ° of the Equator between 8 and 24 Ma. The north–south grain of abyssal hill topography in the vicinity of Site U 1337 is typically covered by 300 – 500 ms TWT of sediment (~ 250 – 400 m) but is often interrupted by areas of significant erosion, as in the east of the PEAT- 7 survey area (Fig. F 1). Based on stage-pole reconstructions of Pacific plate motion and observations of basement age from previous drilling sites, an aeromagnetic line south of the proposed site (Horner-Johnson and Gordon, 2003), and magnetic anomaly maps (Cande et al., 1989), we estimate that Site U 1337 is on 24 Ma crust. The best control on age is information from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 79, ~ 180 km (1. 6 °) east and 1. 3 ° south of Site U 1337, apparently on the same ridge segment. The base of Site 79 reaches the Miocene/Oligocene boundary, or 23 Ma on the PEAT timescale...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Middle to Late Eocene Chumstick Formation {{represents}} a thick sequence offluvial and lacustrine rocks that filled a tectonically active basin under humid-tropical paleoclimatic conditions. Four facies associations are {{recognized in the}} Chumstick Formation: gravel-bedload, sand-bedload, and mixed-load stream deposits and lacustrine deposits. The depositional system is interpreted asa humid-tropical al uvial-fan system. Five sets of basinal characteristics arebelieved to result from the combination ofhumid-tropical paleoclimate, active basin-margin faulting, and high (0. 2 to 1. 2 m/k. y.) basin subsidence rates. 1) Fluvial architecture was strongly affected by basin-margin faulting. Proximal regions of the fan consist of broadly lenticular, laterally stacked (i. e., omapping ribbons), gravel-bedload stream deposits representing fanbead channels. Distal regions of the fan consist of gravel- and sand-bedload stream deposits with a sheet-like geometry. The basin-fill is dominated by multistory, vertically stacked, sand-bedload nd mixed-load stream deposils and lacustrine deposits. 2) Rapid subsidence has resulted inthe preservation <b>f</b> compositionally immature <b>sediments</b> (sublithic, feldspathic arenites) with thin, shallow paleosols. 3) Paleohydraulic reconstructions i dicate that streams carried coarse-grained bedload through channel reaches with paleoslopes < 5 m/km. 4) Rapid vegetation growth resulted in the bank stabilization ofsandy sediments, development of paleosols, leaf-litter layers on emergent bar-tops, {{and the introduction of}} woody debris into channels. Even coarse-grained, proximal f uvial deposits have a significant overbank component and show evidence for bank stability, cutbanks, and cohesive bank failures. 5) Debris-flow deposits are relatively minor, except for local talus-cone deposits. The rarity of debris flows throughout the basin may be due to hillslope stability imparted by vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The Geochemical Atlas of Italy {{addresses}} {{the need for}} a large scale geochemical mapping based on FOREGS procedures. The aim of the Geochemical Atlas of Italy is to define background/baseline chemical element values on a national scale and it will help government decision makers in defining trigger and action limits on a local scale, bearing in mind the complex spatial variability of Italian geology. As regards the Geochemical Atlas of Italy, data of Italian topsoil (T), subsoil (C), stream water (W), stream sediment (S) and floodplain <b>sediment</b> (<b>F),</b> have been extracted from the FOREGS database and supplemented with new sampling data from 8 additional sites. The italian territory has been divided into 27 sampling cells (Fig. 1. 1) {{on the basis of the}} Global Terrestrial Network (GTN), a sampling grid of 160 km x 160 km cells which covers the entire surface of the Earth, according to the establishments of the Global Geochemical Baseline project (IGCP 360) (Darnley et al., 1995). During field activities and sample preparation, FOREGS procedures (Salminen et al., 1998) were strictly followed. The geochemical data used for the FOREGS project and the new data from subcells of southern Italy have been processed using ArcView GIS™ and a new Multifractal IDW method available in the software GeoDAS™ (Cheng et al., 2003; Lima et al., 2003). Interpolated maps have been overlayed by dots and have been classified by statistic graphs, for a total production of 348 maps.

40|$|Rock, {{sediment}} {{and water}} samples from areas characterised by hydrothermal alterations in the Sabatini and Vico Volcanic Districts, near Rome {{and the large}} city of Viterbo, respectively, were collected and analysed to determine the total fluorine (F) content and to understand the F geochemical back-ground level in the volcanic districts of central Italy. Leaching and alteration processes controlling the high concentration of F in water were also investigated. Fluorine concentrations were directly determined (potentiometrically) by an F selective electrode in water samples, while the procedure for rock samples included preliminary F dissolution through alkaline fusion. F concentrations higher than 800 mg kg− 1 were commonly found in the analysed rocks and sediments; the concentration depended on the lithology and on {{the distance from the}} alteration areas. A specific successive sampling campaign was con ducted in three areas where the <b>F</b> content in <b>sediments</b> was particularly high; in the same areas, measurements of CO 2 flux were also performed to investigate the possible deep origin of F. To verify the relation ship among the high F contents in rocks and sediments, the leaching processes involved and the presence of F in the aquifer, we also collected water samples in the western sector of the Sabatini Volcanic District, where hydrothermal manifestations and mineral springs are common. The data were processed 40 using a GIS system in which the F distribution was combined with morphological and geological observations. The main results of our study are that (1) F concentrations are higher in volcanic and recently formed travertine (especially in hydrothermally altered sediments) than in sedimentary rocks and decrease with distance from hydrothermal alteration areas, (2) F is more easily leached from hydrother- mally altered rocks and from travertine and (3) <b>sediments</b> enriched with <b>F</b> may indicate the presence of deep regional fractures that represent direct path- ways of hydrothermal fluids from the crust to the surface...|$|R
