5|$|Let us {{bring up}} women, not {{to aspire to}} {{advantages}} which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|Tini {{discovers that}} Tono has been having an affair, and is furious. She then goes to meet Yah. However, {{after a long}} talk she decides that Yah <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> Tono and tells the former prostitute to marry him; Tini then moves back to Surabaya, leaving Tono in Batavia. However, Yah feels that she would only ruin Tono's {{respected}} status as a doctor because of her history. She decides to move to New Caledonia, leaving a note for Tono {{as well as a}} record with a song recorded especially for him as a way of saying goodbye. On the way to New Caledonia, Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice calling from afar, giving a speech on the radio. Tono, now alone, dedicates himself to his work in an attempt to fill the void left in his heart.|$|E
25|$|In general, chopped mode <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> slower sweeps. It is {{possible}} for the internal chopping rate to be a multiple of the sweep repetition rate, creating blanks in the traces, but in practice this is rarely a problem; the gaps in one trace are overwritten by traces of the following sweep. A few oscilloscopes had a modulated chopping rate to avoid this occasional problem. Alternate mode, however, <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> faster sweeps.|$|E

25|$|Pellets {{are fine}} for larger snails, but mash <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> younger ones. Pellets should be {{partially}} crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.|$|E
25|$|April 28 was the {{beginning}} of the team's Open Cup campaign. Schmid asserted that the competition was important and won the first of two qualifying rounds 4 – 1 against Real Salt Lake. The Sounders have played home games at the Starfire Sports Complex in Tukwila. The facility is older and smaller than Qwest Field but the Sounders say the atmosphere <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> smaller cup matches.|$|E

25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea that it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the children to suffer want in this world than that their parents should be damned in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial {{in the case of}} sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8-10).|$|E
25|$|After the NZRU {{announced}} the resting of 22 leading players, Pat Wilson, Australian High Performance Manager, revealed that leading Wallabies {{would only be}} rested for one match, {{which was to be}} chosen by their state's union. This decision has drawn criticism from former Wallabies coach and current Queensland Reds coach Eddie Jones, who said that while resting the older players could be beneficial, it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> younger players, such as his own Rodney Blake, to receive game time.|$|E
25|$|This upsets Max, {{and when}} Charlie tries to {{convince}} him that living without him <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> Max, Max says he always wanted Charlie to fight for him and be there as a father. After Max leaves, Charlie returns to Bailey. While talking with her about the events, the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. Persuaded by Bailey, Charlie arranges the challenge offered by Max and convinces Debra to allow Max to witness the fight.|$|E

25|$|The lamps used in {{phototherapy}} {{contain a}} phosphor that emits only UVB ultraviolet light. There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306nm, and narrowband UVB that gives 311–313 nanometer. Due to its longer wavelength the narrowband UVB requires a 10 times higher dose to the skin, {{compared to the}} broadband. The narrowband is good for psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), vitiligo, lichen planus, and some other skin diseases. The broadband <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> increasing Vitamin D3 in the body.|$|E
25|$|Cheater {{recognition}} {{is closely related}} to the recognition of specific emotions. Bell et al. argue for the existence of an emotional incongruity effect. Memory <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the face of a smiling cheater than of a smiling cooperator, because the incongruity captures the attention of the participant. If the emotion violates the expectancy then it is much better remembered. Furthermore, negative information is much better remembered whether it violates expectancies or not. Negative emotions have a strong effect on source memory due to the presence of threatening stimuli.|$|E
25|$|This type of assistive {{technology}} {{allows users to}} amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls {{so that they can}} easily partake in this medium of communication. There are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from, with different degrees of amplification. For example, a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> more severe hearing loss.|$|E

25|$|If {{there is}} more than one roller available, the captain of the batting side shall have the choice. Detailed rules exist to make sure that, where possible, rolling takes place without delaying the game but the game is delayed if {{necessary}} to allow the batting captain to have up to 7 minutes rolling if he so wishes. Rolling the pitch can take a long time but will be very effective once done, rolling of the pitch is crucial to whether it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> a batsmen or a bowler.|$|E
25|$|Silica {{exhibits}} {{fairly good}} optical transmission {{over a wide}} range of wavelengths. In the near-infrared (near IR) portion of the spectrum, particularly around 1.5 μm, silica can have extremely low absorption and scattering losses of the order of 0.2dB/km. Such remarkably low losses are possible only because ultra-pure silicon is available, it being essential for manufacturing integrated circuits and discrete transistors. A high transparency in the 1.4-μm region is achieved by maintaining a low concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH). Alternatively, a high OH concentration <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) region.|$|E
25|$|Open wire {{test leads}} (flying leads) {{are likely to}} pick up interference, so they are not {{suitable}} for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,coaxial cable) <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50ohm cable has about 90pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe will load a circuit with a capacitance of about 110pF and a resistance of 1megohm.|$|E

25|$|While {{the loss}} of skilled labor {{represents}} a potential cost for countries of origin, it can also at times be beneficial. For instance, {{if there is no}} room in the economy of the home country to use the skilled labor, then it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the workers to migrate and send back remittances. When these remittances are greater than what the migrant would have made in the home country, it is also beneficial. Another example is when the migrants return with new skills, knowledge, and capacities. Lastly, the movement of skilled labor is beneficial for the country of origin when migrants forge strong economic connections between the home and host country.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease described by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or L-DOPA. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or in-vitro, some still believe that the long-term use of dopamine agonists <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the patient.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) uses high-frequency {{radio waves}} to destroy tumor by local heating. The electrodes are {{inserted into the}} liver tumor under ultrasound image guidance using percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgical approach. It is suitable for small tumors (<5nbsp&cm). RFA has the best outcomes in patients with a solitary tumor less than 4nbsp&mm. Since it is a local treatment and has minimal effect on normal healthy tissue, it can be repeated multiple times. Survival <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> those with smaller tumors. In one study, In one series of 302 patients, the three-year survival rates for lesions >5nbsp&cm, 2.1 to 5nbsp&cm, and ≤2nbsp&cm were 59, 74, and 91 percent, respectively. A large randomized trial comparing surgical resection and RFA for small HCC showed similar 4 year survival and less morbidities for patients treated with RFA.|$|E
