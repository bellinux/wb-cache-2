30|$|Still, all the {{measurement}} {{locations in the}} National military museum {{were found to be}} similar or better than typical European “historic house museums”. The observed reduction in the photo-oxidizing load and risk inside the enclosures in the Warehouse for foreign uniforms (1) and the contemporary history room in the main museum building (3) was an expected protective effect of the enclosures. The higher measured photo-oxidizing impact inside the wooden chest in the probative storage room (2) than in this room itself was thus surprising. This could be due to some unidentified oxidation impact, but probably more likely due to dust accumulation on the <b>dosimeter</b> <b>glass,</b> as the dosimeter was positioned horizontally besides rough textile materials (see Fig.  1, position 2 b). Although dust accumulation was probably not a risk for the objects in this case, this points to the possible damage risks that may occur when co-locating sensitive objects with objects or materials which off-gas or release harmful substances. The slightly higher acidic impact measured inside all the enclosures than in the respective rooms in the National military museum is typical. It is well known that the levels of gaseous organic compounds are usually higher inside than outside of enclosures [9, 12, 38]. This is due to the larger emitting surfaces as compared to the volumes and usually lower ventilation rates of enclosures as compared to rooms. The small differences between the measured acidic impact in the enclosures and the rooms in the National military museum indicated little risk related to organic acid off gassing in the enclosures. This may be due to relatively low emitting materials and/or ventilation effects in the enclosures. The emission from materials is typically reduced as they age, and the aging of enclosures contribute to lower internal off gassing.|$|E

40|$|Recent silver-activated <b>glass</b> <b>dosimeters</b> are {{superior}} to photographic film and thermoluminescent dosimeters for many reasons described briefly, especially in high-level accident dosimetry, because fast dose evaluation {{and the possibility of}} remeasuring doubtful values are necessary. A main disadvantage of <b>glass</b> <b>dosimeters</b> is possible changes in the fluorimetric or in the photometric dose reading between exposure and evaluation. These changes have to be considered if exact dose readings are desired, UV irradiation can induce or destroy radiation-induced fluorescence and colour centres in the glass, depending on the quantum energy of the UV light. More important, in practice, is the increase of the measured RPL immediately after exposure, superimposed later by the fading process. Increase and decrease rates depend strongly on the storage temperature and the composition of the glass. For instance, the increase after exposure decreases with increasing si!ver concentration in a glass with constant basic composition, and fading occurs earlier. At constant silver concentration there is also an effect of different glass base compositions. There are no observable differences in the kinetics of X-ray, γ-ray and thermal neutron effects in the glass. In the 10 ^- 4 to ^ 3 r γ dose range (fluorimetric dose reading) the kinetic behaviour of the RPL centres determines this effect, while in the 10 ^ 3 to 10 ^ 7 r dose range the somewhat different stability of the absorption centres is important if absorption measurements are taken (the fading depends on the wavelength of the photometric measurement and is lowest at the 320 nm absorption band), If fluorimetric measurements are also taken, the superimposing effects determine the dose reading because of the UV absorption in the glass at the fluorimetric: reading. A brief theoretical interpretation of the kinetics in irradiated glass is given by means of a simplified band model of the physical processes involved. A general expression, for the possible radiation effect alterations is given, After a high-dose exposure the glass can be regenerated by a special heat treatmem. Too extended heating or too high temperatures may increase the predose, In practice the possible inaccuracies in the dose measurement can be overcome by: (a) A short heat treatment of the glass stabilization or "development" of the radiation effect); or (b) The use of the correction curves given in the paper.

Those originating from the outdoors enter rooms and subsequently mc-frames at a rate depending on the ventilation rates (air exchange rates) of the mc-frames. The concentration of gaseous pollutants emitted within the mc-frames will depend on net emission rates of the materials used to make the mc-frames, their design, and their ventilation rates.

This consists of two small dosimeter samples; one dosimeter is covered with a thin synthetic polymer film and sensitive to oxidizing gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3), and with UV light, while the other is a potassium-rich glass sensitive to acidic gases. X-ray fluorescence has been used to monitor CH objects in the Czech Republic by Trojek et al. [10]. This uses non-contact determination of elemental composition and has been able to increase the sensitivity and extended the range of lighter elements to be determined in the examination of artworks. Tempera dosimeters have been used as dosimeters by Odlyha et al. [3] and can rank the sites and act as early warning devices or damage assessment tools. Automatic corrosion loggers have been developed Prosek et al. [11]. Resin mastic varnish-coated piezoelectric dosimeters have been developed by Odlyha et al. [12, 13] for monitoring the indoor microclimate or in specific sites such as organ pipes and microclimate frames for paintings. EWO dosimeters have been developed by Lopez-Aparicio et al. [14]. <b>Glass</b> <b>Dosimeters</b> have been developed by Leissner [15, 16]. Dosimetry has been developed by Grøntoft et al. [17] in the special application to paintings in microclimate frames with early warning from a synthetic polymer and the Resin Mastic coated piezo electric quartz, however, they ran passive diffusion samplers alongside for individual gases.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{investigate}} how glass filtered UV irradiances vary with glass thickness, lamination of the glass {{and the effect of}} SZA, and to measure the glass filtered UV exposures to different receiving planes with a newly developed UVA dosimeter. Spectroradiometric and dosimetric techniques were employed in the experimental approach. The percentage of the glass filtered solar UV compared to the unfiltered UV ranged from 59 % to 70 % and was influenced to a small extent by the glass thickness and the solar zenith angle (SZA). The laminated glass transmitted 11 to 12 % and the windscreen glass transmitted 2. 5 to 2. 6 %. The influence of the SZA was less for the thicker glass than it was for the thinner glass. The change in transmission was less than 14 % for the SZA between 48 ° and 71 °. There was negligible influence due to the SZA on the glass transmitted UV of the laminated and windscreen glass. The influence of the glass thickness in the range of 2 mm to 6 mm on the percentage transmission was less than 16 %. The influences of the glass thickness and the SZA on the glass transmitted UV have been incorporated in the use of a UVA <b>dosimeter</b> for the <b>glass</b> transmitted UV exposures. The UVA dosimeter was employed in the field to measure the glass filtered UV exposures to different receiving planes. The UVA dosimeter reported has the potential for personal solar UVA exposure measurements...|$|R
40|$|The delta-ray {{theory of}} track structure, applied earlier to such 1 -or-more hit {{detection}} systems as the inactivation of dry enzymes and viruses, the NaI(Tl) scintillation counter, and nuclear emulsion, is {{extended to the}} silver activated phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>dosimeter,</b> the LiF thermoluminescent dosimeter, the creation of free radicals in solid biological substances, solid and liquid organic scintillators, and the ferrous sulfate (Fricke) dosimeter. The response of these systems to both gamma-rays and heavy ions is characterized by two parameters: 1) Dγ 37, the dose of gamma-rays at which 37 % of the sensitive elements remain unaffected by the radiation, and 2) a 0, the physical radius (or the exciton diffusion length, or the range of short-range order) of the sensitive element. The decline of detector response with increase in the stopping power of the bombarding ion, and the non-linearity of the detector response are characteristic properties of 1 -hit detectors, and are most pronounced for the most sensitive detectors. Explicit information about the cross-sectional area of the sensitive target cannot be gained from measurement of the activation cross-section {{as a function of}} the stopping power of the incident ion, for there is no saturation cross-section for 1 -hit detectors. Since parameters describing the incident ion and those describing the detector are not separable variables, the response of a detector cannot be described through a product of two factors, one containing only ion parameters and representing “radiation quality,” and the other containing only detector parameters and representing “ detector quality. ...|$|R
