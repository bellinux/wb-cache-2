25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's excess charge heat.|$|E
25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E

25|$|T-72AG: Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau (KMDB) {{modernization}} package {{aimed at}} improving the automotive and firepower capabilities of the tank with components mostly derived from the T-80UD program, including an improved 6TD-1 engine rated at 1,000hp or 1,200hp (881kW) 6TD-2, new drivetrain components from the T-80UD, an improved <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> turbocharger and air filter. These upgrades improve upon the T-72B tank's mobility and bring the upgraded vehicle up to par with the high performance T-80UD. Further improvements {{were made to the}} fire control system, which is now an adaptation of the 1A45 Irtysh system, with 1G46 day sight, TKN-4S, TPN-4 or TPN-4 Buran-Catherine nights sights (the latter equipped with thermal viewer) which also enables firing 9M119M Invar laser-guided missiles launched from the main gun. The tank turret was covered in Kontakt-5 ERA tiles and the main gun was upgraded to the newer 2A46M1 variant, and coupled with a significantly more precise 2E42M main gun stabilization system. However, with most of the tank's components reliant upon the T-80UD—which is not in service anywhere outside of Russia and Ukraine—this variant has not had any export success.|$|E
2500|$|Factory No. 1 {{produced}} the first pre-production BB-22 in December 1939, {{although it did}} not make its first flight until the following February. It was submitted for its service evaluation in March–April 1940 and {{proved to be a}} disappointment. Gross weight had increased [...] despite the reduction in fuel from [...] and the maximum speed had declined to [...] at [...] The <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> was still unsatisfactory and the undercarriage too weak. Longitudinal and lateral stability were also unsatisfactory which made it suitable only for well-trained pilots. The test programme report concluded that it was not combat-capable and reliable and that flights with a [...] bomb load could be dangerous to the crew.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} thermostat technology in use today is the internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature {{is determined by the}} composition of the wax. [...] Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.|$|E
50|$|Otto engines use {{a flowing}} water jacket around the {{cylinder}} wall, similar to modern <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> The stationary Otto engines {{on display at}} the Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion all share a single large heat radiator outside the building.

40|$|For {{the last}} decades, {{internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> have evolved from simple cooling to thermal management. New legislations set demands for lower exhaust emissions. Higher engine temperatures have shown to reduce fuel consumption. Today’s <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> layouts have low precision, bringing problems {{in form of}} thermal fluctuations due to long circuit periods. On the way to increased precision in an <b>engine’s</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> predictive tools for analyzing thermal behavior might play an important role. A simulation model has been improved to give accurate results in simulating a normal drive cycle in cold climate. The model {{is supposed to be}} a template for testing new layout concepts. A number of layout concepts have been tested and compared with the current layout by some different methods. It is found that there are possibilities to improve the performance in <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> by developing the thermostatic valve, but first a definition of which criterions designate a good <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is needed.

2500|$|As {{production}} continued, the Typhoon's role {{changed from}} a low-level interceptor fighter to a fighter bomber. Racks capable of carrying [...] bombs were fitted to the wings from October 1942 and were first used operationally by 181 Squadron. By mid-1943, all Typhoons off the production line were capable of carrying bombs. Bigger, solid rubber, grooved [...] "anti-shimmy" [...] tail wheel tyres were introduced in March 1943 on all Typhoons from the 1,001st production aircraft, EK238. The new tyres helped to make heavier, bomb-laden Typhoons more manageable during ground manoeuvres. With {{the introduction of the}} bomb racks, small extensions were added to the cannon shell case ejector slots. These allowed the casings to drop clear of bombs or drop tanks suspended from the wing racks. Because of the vulnerability of the Typhoon's liquid-cooled <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> to ground fire, some [...] of armour was added, lining the sides and bottom of the cockpit and engine compartments, as well as the radiator bath.|$|E
2500|$|Vapour-compression {{distillers}} {{were installed}} on US submarines shortly before World War 2. Early attempts {{had been made}} with evaporators running from diesel engine exhaust heat, but these could only be used when the submarine was running at speed on the surface. A further difficulty with submarines was the need to produce high-quality water for topping up their large storage batteries. Typical consumption on a war patrol was around [...] per day for hotel services, drinking, cooking, washing etc. and also for replenishing the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> A further 500gallons per week was required for the batteries. The standard Badger model X-1 for diesel submarines could produce 1,000gallons per day. Tank capacity of 5,600gallons (1,200 of which was battery water) was provided, around 10 days reserve. With the appearance of nuclear submarines and their plentiful electricity supply, even larger plant could be installed. The X-1 plant was designed {{so that it could}} be operated when snorkelling, or even when completely submerged. As the ambient pressure increased when submerged, and thus the boiling point, additional heat was required in these submarine distillers and so they were designed to run with electric heat continuously.|$|E
