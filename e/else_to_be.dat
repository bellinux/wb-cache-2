This discovery was confirmed, and is {{generally considered to be}} the first definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the remaining rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the Robinson Hill {{case was}} the subject of Murder in Texas, a {{television}} film featuring Farrah Fawcett as Robinson Hill. It concurs with Kurth's theory that Hill may have faked his death, suggesting that he arranged for someone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed in his place. The journalist Jerry Buck noted in an article preceding the film's debut on NBC that the face of the shooting victim had been battered and that there were anomalies in the autopsy report, notably that Hill had a different eye color from that recorded for the dead person. Buck also wrote that Hill was in financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service in 1972 and facing a murder case against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and New York City.|$|E

Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like: [...] "What happened had no form. It was timeless, unbounded, ineffable, beyond language." [...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone <b>else,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{different from the way}} that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph {{combines}} [...] "structured melodic {{pieces and}} free-form ambient compositions", which [...] "departs dramatically {{from the previous}} more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture". [...] Binkelman writes, [...] "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." [...] For instance, the song [...] "Dance of Life" [...] was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, [...] "Rusalka". [...] It {{is a bit more}} straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. [...] Then the album closes with its title track, [...] "One Deep Breath", that [...] "floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is [...] "far and away the most ambient of everything <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found here", [...] and is [...] "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".|$|E
500|$|The Hutchinsons became {{members of}} the Boston church, the most {{important}} church in the colony. [...] With its location and harbour, Boston was New England's centre of commerce, and its church was characterised by Winthrop as [...] "the most publick, where Seamen and all Strangers came." [...] The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton's first four months there. [...] In his journal, Winthrop proclaimed, [...] "more were converted & added to that Churche, than {{to all the other}} Churches in the Baye." [...] Historian Michael Winship noted in 2005 that the church seemed to approach the Puritan ideal of a Christian community. [...] Early Massachusetts historian William Hubbard found the church to be [...] "in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any where <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paralleled." [...] Winship considers it an exceptional twist of fate that the colony's most important church also had the most unconventional minister in John Cotton. The more extreme religious views of Hutchinson and Henry Vane, the colony's young governor, did not much stand out because of Cotton's divergence from the theology of his fellow ministers.|$|E

500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror.

2500|$|In 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon {{established}} {{a set of}} organic laws, including a ban on slavery: [...] "There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." [...] Enforcement of the law was left unclear. After a vote on June 26, 1844, the first Black Exclusion law reiterated a ban on all slavery in Oregon territory, while also forcing blacks and mulatto settlers to leave Oregon territory within three years (two years for men), or <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> whipped [...] "no more than 39 times." [...] This section was amended in December 1844 to permit a free slave to be resold {{on the condition that}} the slave owner agree to remove them from the territory {{at the end of the}} contract, which was held with the provisional government. In effect, this re-established slavery on a temporary basis for three years. The law was repealed in 1845, having never been invoked.|$|E

[...] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that [...] "Android was originally designed, above all <b>else,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption. [...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such, security has become a big issue. Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work". Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, [...] "instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models.

2500|$|From Josiah Gregg's journal, Commerce of the Prairies: [...] "Of all {{the prairie}} animals, {{by far the}} most curious, and by no means the least celebrated, is the little prairie dog. ...The flesh, though often eaten by travelers, is not esteemed savory. It was {{denominated}} the 'barking squirrel', the 'prairie ground-squirrel', etc., by early explorers, with much more apparent propriety than the present established name. Its yelp, which resembles that of the little toy-dog, seems its only canine attribute. It rather appears to occupy a middle ground betwixt the rabbit and squirrel—like the former in feeding and burrowing — like the latter in frisking, flirting, sitting erect, and somewhat so in its barking. The prairie dog has been reckoned by some naturalists a species of the marmot (arctomys ludoviciana); yet it seems to possess scarce any other quality in common with this animal except that of burrowing. ...I have the concurrent testimony of several persons, who have been upon the Prairies in winter, that, like rabbits and squirrels, they issue from their holes every soft day; and therefore lay up no doubt a hoard of 'hay' (as there is rarely anything <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found in the vicinity of their towns) for winter's use. A collection of their burrows has been termed by travelers a 'dog town,' which comprises from a dozen or so, to some thousands in the same vicinity; often covering an area of several square miles. They generally locate upon firm dry plains, coated with fine short grass, upon which they feed; for they are no doubt exclusively herbivorous. But even when tall coarse grass surrounds, they seem commonly to destroy this within their 'streets,' which are nearly always found 'paved' with a fine species suited to their palates. They must need but little water, if any at all, as their 'towns' are often, indeed generally, found {{in the midst of the}} most arid plains—unless we suppose they dig down to subterranean fountains. At least they evidently burrow remarkably deep. Attempts either to dig or drown them out of their holes have generally proved unsuccessful. Approaching a 'village,' the little dogs may be observed frisking about the 'streets'—passing from dwelling to dwelling apparently on visits—sometimes a few clustered together as though in council—here feeding upon the tender herbage—there cleansing their 'houses,' or brushing the little hillock about the door—yet all quiet. Upon seeing a stranger, however, each streaks it to its home, but is apt to stop at the entrance, and spread the general alarm by a succession of shrill yelps, usually sitting erect. Yet at the report of a gun or the too near approach of the visitor, they dart down and are seen no more till the cause of alarm seems to have disappeared.|$|E
