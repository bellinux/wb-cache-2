60|$|The {{two boys}} on shore were {{to hold the}} <b>head</b> <b>rope,</b> to prevent her being dashed towards the land by the next wave, while Larry worked with the oars to get {{her away from the}} ridge. The moment the wave had passed under them, the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> was to be thrown off.|$|E

60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour after it {{commenced}} the heavy downpour of rain ceased, or rather changed into a driving sleet. It was still extremely dark, a thick lead colored cloud overspread the sky. Already the white horses showed how fast the sea was rising, and the wind showed no signs of falling with the cessation of the rain storm. The boat was laboring at her <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> and dipping her nose heavily into the waves.|$|E
60|$|Vincent {{carefully}} payed out {{the rope}} till some fifteen yards were over, then he fastened {{it to the}} ring of the <b>head</b> <b>rope,</b> and had the satisfaction of finding that the boat rode easily to the floating anchor, rising lightly over the waves, and not shipping a drop of water. He then took the baler and {{got rid of the}} water that had found its way on board, Dan, after getting down the sail, having collapsed utterly.|$|E
60|$|They {{found that}} {{three or four}} boats were lying by the bank. Leigh chose the {{smallest}} of these and, loosening the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> from the post to which it was fastened, took his place in her with the others. Accustomed as he was to rowing, from his childhood, he soon reached the opposite bank. Here he fastened the boat up, and struck across country {{until he reached the}} road. Then he sent one of his followers westward.|$|E
50|$|The images {{found on}} Celtic coins include giants {{trailing}} severed <b>heads</b> on <b>rope,</b> horsemen charging into battle, gods and goddesses, skulls and chariot wheels, thunderbolts and lightning, {{the sun and}} the moon. They are miniature masterpieces of surreal art.|$|R
50|$|While {{relatively}} new, rope dart {{is becoming}} increasingly popular in {{being used in the}} object manipulation scene due to its impressive performances. Because of this, there have been modifications to the original design. Some rope darts have been created to be set alight. A section of fireproof chain between the dart or meteor <b>head</b> and the <b>rope</b> attaches it securely and Kevlar wicks form the flammable <b>head.</b> Other <b>rope</b> darts have <b>heads</b> filled with LED lights. Both of these can be performed in the dark, adding excitement and mystery.|$|R
60|$|Leading {{their own}} horses {{and those of}} Field and Peters they {{walked down to the}} spot Chris had chosen, and there threw the reins over the horses' heads as usual, unfastened the <b>head</b> <b>ropes,</b> and tied them to the bushes. Chris had already {{explained}} the situation to the troop, and had told off six of them to go down to join Peters. He now advanced cautiously with these till he could point out to them exactly the spot where the two scouts were lying. Then he returned to the others, and they walked along fast until they came upon the break in the hill, which lower down developed into a depression, and was during the rains a water-course. Down this they made their way. On reaching the bottom they found it was some twelve feet below the level of the surrounding ground.|$|R
60|$|Vincent {{had read}} that the best plan, when caught in an open boat in a gale, was to tie the oars and mast, if she had one, together, and to throw them {{overboard}} with the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> tied to them, as by this means the boat would ride head to sea. The oars, sculls, mast, and sail were firmly tied together and launched overboard, the rope being first taken off the anchor and tied round {{the middle of the}} clump of spars.|$|E
60|$|The {{driver had}} run {{at once to}} the horses, and had muffled them, by {{throwing}} his coat {{over the head of}} one, and a rug over the head of the other, and, though snorting and trembling in every limb, they stood quiet until he had thrown a <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> round each of their necks, and fastened them to the heaviest of the branches. Then he seized a handful of fallen leaves, which were exposed by the melting of the snow above them, and threw them into the fire, whence a dense smoke poured out.|$|E
60|$|Ned {{turned and}} rushed down the steps. The {{governor}} {{was already in}} the boat. Ned leaped on board, and with a stroke of his sword severed the <b>head</b> <b>rope.</b> Before the leading Spaniards reached the bottom of the steps the boat was a length away. Ned seated himself, and seizing the oars rowed down the river. Several shots were fired at them from the bridge and wharves as they went, but they passed on uninjured. Ned rowed to the admiral's ship and left the governor there, and then rowed to that of Captain Enkin.|$|E

60|$|Several {{small boats}} were drawn {{up on the}} shore. One of these they launched, put out the oars, and rowed quietly to a large barge, fifty yards from the bank, on which a light was burning. Taking pains to prevent the boat {{striking}} her side, they stepped on board, fastened the <b>head</b> <b>rope,</b> and proceeded aft. A light was burning in the cabin and, looking through a little round window in the door, they saw three boatmen sitting there, smoking and playing cards. They opened their knives, slid back the door, and stepped in.|$|E

60|$|Just before daybreak he {{made his}} way down to the quays, ascertained the exact {{position}} of the fleet, and determined how he had best get on board. He chose a small boat from among those lying at the quay, and removed it to the foot of some stairs by a bridge. He fastened the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> to a ring and pushed the boat off, so that it lay under the bridge, concealed from the sight of any who might pass along the wharves. Having thus prepared for his own safety, he was making his way to rejoin the governor when a woman came out from a house in a quiet street. As she met him he started.|$|E

60|$|As {{the party}} rode {{through the town}} they were struck with the narrowness and {{straightness}} of the streets, and at the generally European look of everything; and Mr. Thompson told them that nearly half the population of Buenos Ayres are European. The number of people upon horseback also surprised our young travelers; but horses cost only thirty shillings or two pounds, and grass is so abundant that the expense of their food is next to nothing; consequently every one rides--even shepherds look after their sheep on horseback. The horses seemed very quiet, for in front {{of most of the}} offices the horses of the merchants could be seen fastened by a <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> to a ring, grooms not being considered a necessity.|$|E
60|$|For a moment, {{the boat}} towered {{on the top}} of a wave, which raced in towards the shore. The next, as it came, took her stern, and she was in the act of {{swinging}} round, when the strain of the rope came upon her, and brought her straight again. Higher and higher the wave rose, and then crashed down, and the boat shot forward, like an arrow, in the foam. The fishermen rushed forward and caught it, those on board leapt out waist-deep; all were taken off their feet by the backward rush, but they clung to the sides of the boat, while the men at the <b>head</b> <b>rope,</b> with their heels dug deeply into the sand, withstood the strain, and kept her from being swept out again.|$|E
60|$|Terence and Ryan slept as soundly {{as usual}} until aroused by Jules. Then {{they put on}} their sea boots again, loaded {{themselves}} with the nets and the bags with the provisions and wine, while Jules took the water barrel and after saying goodbye to Marie, started. There was not a soul on the wharf and, putting the stores down {{at the top of}} the steps, they watched Jules who, after taking off his boots, went across a plank to the ship, made his way noiselessly out on to the bow, swinging himself down into the boat, loosening the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> before he did so. A push with the oar against the ship's bow sent the boat alongside the quay, and he then worked her along, with his hands against the wall, until he reached the steps.|$|E
50|$|A lead, lead line, lead <b>rope</b> (USA) or <b>head</b> collar <b>rope</b> (UK), {{is used to}} lead {{an animal}} such as a horse. Usually, it is {{attached}} to a halter. The lead may be integral to the halter or, more often, separate. When separate, it is attached to the halter with a heavy clip or snap {{so that it can be}} added or removed as needed. A related term, lead shank or lead chain refers to a lead line with a chain attached that is used in a variety of ways to safely control possibly difficult or dangerous horses if they will not respond to a regular lead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was," [...] he said, [...] "as my lord knows, uneasy when I {{found that}} they had {{recognized}} you, {{and when we were}} within a day's sail of Carthage I resolved to keep a lookout--therefore, although I wrapped myself in my cloak and lay down, I did not go to sleep. After a while I thought I heard the sound of oars, and, standing up, went to the bulwark to listen. Suddenly some of the sailors, who must have been watching me, sprang upon me from behind, a cloak was thrown over my <b>head,</b> a <b>rope</b> was twisted round my arms, and in a moment I was lifted and flung overboard.|$|R

Additionally there are pneumatic and hydraulic fixtures for tensile testing that allow very fast clamping procedures and very high clamping forces.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{ordered them}} {{at once to}} hand up all their firelocks and other arms through the hatchway, which was again lifted for the purpose. When those on deck had armed {{themselves}} with those weapons, the prisoners were ordered to come up, bringing their wounded with them. As they reached the deck they were passed down into the barge, from which all the oars save four had been removed. Six of the soldiers had been killed, and the remainder having entered the barge, where they were stowed as thickly as they could pack, the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> was dropped, and {{they were allowed to}} row away. Besides the eighty muskets of the guard, a store of firelocks, sufficient to arm all on board, was found; these having been intended {{for the use of the}} garrison. A gentle breeze had by this time sprung up from the land, and the ship's head was turned seaward.|$|E
60|$|He had no {{difficulty}} in climbing on board, and after dressing {{himself in the}} clothes he had worn at Tripoli, and had kept on underneath the Arab attire, he pulled the <b>head</b> <b>rope</b> until the craft was nearly over the anchor. He then loosened the line that brailed up the sail, got the stone that served as an anchor on board, hauled the sheet aft, and took his place at the tiller. The wind had dropped a good deal with the sun, {{but there was still}} sufficient air to send the light craft fast through the water. He steered out for a time, and then, when he thought himself a good mile from the shore, headed east. By the appearance of the water as it glanced past, he thought that he must be making from five to six miles an hour, and when the sun rose at five o'clock, believed that he was nearly forty miles on his way. He now fastened the tiller with a rope and proceeded to overhaul the craft.|$|E

50|$|Rope tension snare {{and bass}} drums are {{tightened}} using tugs or ears that apply {{pressure to the}} rope. That pressure is transferred to the <b>heads</b> when the <b>rope</b> compresses the counter hoops causing them to move slightly closer together. Drum heads can be made of calf skin or modern plastic heads as made by many drum manufacturers. The single tenor drum, through, is not used.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare anaesthetic recoveries without assistance (group NA) to a head and tail rope-assisted technique (group A) after emergency abdominal surgery in horses. Additionally, possible risk factors for the quality of recovery (S: safe, NS: non-safe) were investigated and possible complications associated to the <b>head</b> and tail <b>rope</b> technique recorded. For that purpose 200 anaesthetic protocols (100 NA, 100 A) from horses that all received a standardised medetomidine-isoflurane balanced anaesthesia regime and medetomidine in combination with morphine for recovery were analysed retrospectively. No significant difference regarding recovery score was detected between NA and A horses. Fatalitalities (3 / 100 in each group) were similarly distributed between groups. However, in group NA only one horse died because of trauma during recovery. The other two horses died before attempting to stand up. All 3 horses that died in group A were euthanized because of trauma. Hypoxemia (defined as arterial oxygen partial pressure < 60 mmHg) during anaesthesia was a risk factor for non-safe recoveries. No influence was detected for age, weight, duration of general anaesthesia, reason of colic surgery, recovery technique (A, NA), hypotension during anaesthesia, time in lateral recumbency, time in sternal recumbency and time until standing. Several technical complications (material fail, twisting of ropes, halters slipping off and loss of ropes) were observed using the <b>head</b> and tail <b>ropes,</b> probably being partially responsible for the unexpectedly high number of dangerous and fatal recoveries observed in group A. The present study could not demonstrate that the <b>head</b> and tail <b>rope</b> technique can reduce fatalities or improve anaesthetic recovery scores after emergency abdominal surgery in horses. Hypoxemia during general anaesthesia increases the risk of non-safe recovery...|$|R
5000|$|A tabor has a {{cylindrical}} wood shell, two skin <b>heads</b> tightened by <b>rope</b> tension, {{a leather}} strap, and an adjustable gut snare. Each tabor has a pitch range of about an octave: {{the larger the}} tabor, the lower the pitch. It is played by just one stick, which usually strikes the snare head. The tabor is suspended by a strap from the forearm, somewhere between the elbow and wrist. When played, the shell is virtually parallel with the ground.|$|R
