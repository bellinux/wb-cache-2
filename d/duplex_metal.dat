50|$|Monnot divided {{his time}} between New York, where he was {{consulting}} engineer for the <b>Duplex</b> <b>Metals</b> Co., and Paris and London, where he introduced the manufacture of his metals. In the United States his patents were exploited by the <b>Duplex</b> <b>Metals</b> Co. of New York, {{of which he was}} president from 1905 to 1908, when he resigned to extend his work abroad. Among his lesser achievements were a process of extracting rubber from bark and leaves of trees, and improvements in steam heating and electric lighting systems. He was a director of the <b>Duplex</b> <b>Metals</b> Co. and the Hudson Wire Co., {{and a member of the}} Association of Mining Engineers of Paris and of the Engineers Club of New York. He was married in New York City, December, 1895, to the Comtesse de Laredo, of Bone, Algeria.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Duplex</b> <b>Metals</b> Co. traces its {{beginning}} to John Ferreol Monnot between 1900 and 1905. He {{had been very}} interested in the work of Mr. Martin in Paris, and, as the Handbook says: [...] "After several years devoted to experimenting, organized the <b>Duplex</b> <b>Metals</b> Company. Prior to his discovery of the process under which this company operates in producing its copper clad, probably almost every other possible way of welding copper and steel together had been tried by Mr. Monnot, but found useless for the purpose." ...|$|R
50|$|Known both as Muntz Metal and Yellow Metal, {{the alloy}} must be worked hot {{and is used}} today for {{corrosion}} resistant machine parts. Alpha-beta (also called <b>duplex)</b> <b>metals</b> contain both the α and β phases. The α phase refers to a crystal structure that is face-centered cubic, while the β phase is body-centered cubic.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{attempt to make}} copper clad steel wire {{took place in the}} early 1860s, according to the Copper Clad Handbook, issued by the <b>Duplex</b> <b>Metals</b> Co., Chester, PA {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by electro-plating copper on steel.|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} coating {{systems for}} {{offshore wind power}} constructions were subjected to offshore conditions on a test site in the North Sea. The systems included organic coatings and <b>duplex</b> (spray <b>metal</b> and organic system) coatings. Special exposure specimens were designed and manufactured and exposed to an offshore environment for three years in order to evaluate their protection performance. The adhesion in terms of pull-off strength and fracture mode was measured on coatings in the underwater zone and in the intermediate zone. All samples met the requirements for offshore ageing in terms of adhesion. An adhesion-based “corrosion protection effect” (CE) is introduced and calculated for the coating systems...|$|R
2500|$|Most <b>duplex</b> {{receptacles}} have <b>metal</b> tabs {{connecting the}} top and bottom receptacles. These tabs are pre-scored {{so that they can be}} broken off to allow {{the top and}} bottom receptacles to be wired onto separate circuits. This may allow for one switched receptacle for a lamp, or for two separate supply circuits when heavy loads are anticipated. Two branch circuits may optionally share a common neutral wire terminating on duplex receptacles, a condition sometimes referred to as [...] "split-wiring", [...] "split-receptacle", or [...] "half-split".|$|R
50|$|A classic {{typeface}} {{for body}} text, Sabon's longstanding popularity has transcended its origin as {{a commission to}} fit a tight set of business requirements. Tschichold was commissioned {{by a coalition of}} German printers to create a typeface that could be printed identically on Linotype, Monotype or letterpress equipment, simplifying the process of planning lines and pagination when printing a book. The italic and bold styles were to take up exactly as much space as the roman, a feature that was particularly advantageous with the <b>duplexed</b> hot <b>metal</b> typesetting equipment of the period. Finally, the new font was to be five per cent narrower than their existing Monotype Garamond, in order to save space and money. Sabon's name was therefore appropriate: a Frenchman who had moved to Frankfurt, he had played a role in bringing Garamond's type into use in German printing four hundred years before.|$|R
5000|$|The new Special chassis was {{announced}} 18 April 1932. It had twin carburettors, higher compression (domed pistons) and numerous smaller modifications including a revised exhaust system (triple-piped manifold —2 inch pipe to the straight-through silencer), <b>duplex</b> valve springs, <b>metal</b> universal joints in the propeller shaft, three inches wider front track and specially large 12-inch brake drums. The long flexible gear-lever {{was replaced by}} a remote control and a small short-travel lever. Special front (3 inches wider track at 3" [...] 9") and rear axles were supplied with the saloon's large-hub stud-fixed Magna wire-wheels. Small knock-on hubs in Rudge-Whitworth wheels were optional and usually preferred.|$|R
40|$|Alloying {{concepts}} for lean <b>duplex</b> weld <b>metals</b> {{have been}} explored. Focus was on compositions with 21. 5 - 24 % Cr with {{different levels of}} Ni and Mn in combination with N producing a minimum PREN value of 26. Microstructures and properties of weld metals produced with experimental covered electrodes or metal-cored wires were evaluated. The electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to explore relations between weld metal morphology and crystallographic orientation relationships between ferrite and austenite. A duplex microstructure with Widmanstatten type ferrite characteristic of a ferritic solidification was found throughout most weld metals. Regions with a morphology suggesting a mixed ferritic-austenitic solidification occurred particularly for higher Ni- and N-contents. EBSD studies showed {{that most of the}} austenite formed following a ferritic solidification was near either the Nishiyama-Wasserman (NW) or Kurjdumov-Sachs (KS) relationships with adjacent ferrite. More phase boundaries in the mixed mode solidification regions had a random orientation relationship. Strength, ductility and PREN requirements were readily matched but the combined Mn, Ni and N alloying levels and the ferrite morphology affected toughness significantly. Both a fully ferritic solidification and a sufficient Ni-content were necessary to produce acceptable and reproducible impact toughness at room and sub-zero temperatures. It was concluded that a composition of 23 - 24 % Cr, 7 - 8 % Ni and 0. 12 - 0. 16 % N was well suited to fulfil requirements...|$|R
40|$|Northwest Africa (NWA) 428 is an L chondrite {{that was}} {{successively}} thermally metamorphosed to petrologic type- 6, shocked to stage S 4 -S 5, brecciated, and annealed to approximately petrologic type- 4. Its thermal and shock history {{resembles that of}} the previously studied LL 6 chondrite, Miller Range (MIL) 99301, which formed on a different asteroid. The petrologic type- 6 classification of NWA 428 is based on its highly recrystallized texture, coarse metal (150 +/- 150 micron), troilite (100 +/- 170 micron), and plagioclase (20 - 60 micron) grains, and relatively homogeneous olivine (Fa(sub 24. 4 +/- 0. 6)), low-Ca pyroxene (FS(sub 2. 5 +/- 0 ~, 4), and plagioclase (Ab(sub 84. 2 +/- 0. 4) compositions. The petrographic criteria that indicate shock stage S 4 -S 5 include the presence of chromite veinlets, chromite-plagioclase assemblages, numerous occurrences of metallic Cu, irregular troilite grains within metallic Fe-Ni, polycrystalline troilite, <b>duplex</b> plessite, <b>metal</b> and troilite veins, large troilite nodules, and low-Ca clinopyroxene with polysynthetic twins. If the rock had been shocked before thermal metamorphism, low-Ca clinopyroxene produced by the shock event would have transformed into orthopyroxene. Post-shock brecciation is indicated {{by the presence of}} recrystallized clasts and highly shocked clasts that form sharp boundaries with the host. Post-shock annealing is indicated by the sharp optical extinction of the olivine grains; during annealing, the damaged olivine crystal lattices healed. If temperatures exceeded those approximating petrologic type- 4 (approximately 600 - 700 C) during annealing, the low-Ca clinopyroxene would have transformed into orthopyroxene. The other shock indicators, likewise, survived the mild annealing. An impact event is the most plausible source of post-metamorphic, post-shock annealing because any A 1 - 26 that may have been present when the asteroid accreted would have decayed away by the time NWA 428 was annealed. The similar inferred histories of NWA 428 (L 6) and MIL 99301 (LL 6) indicate that impact heating affected more than 1 ordinary chondrite parent body...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} on pulsed-fiber laser welding on an austenitic-duplex {{stainless}} steel butt joint configuration was investigated. The influence of various welding parameters, such as beam diameter, peak power, pulse repetition rate, and pulse width on the weld beads geometry was studied by checking the width {{and depth of}} the welds after each round of welding parameters combination. The weld bead dimensions and microstructural progression of the weld joints were observed microscopically. Finally, the full penetration specimens were subjected to tensile tests, which were coupled with {{the analysis of the}} fracture surfaces. From the results, combination of the selected weld parameters resulted in robust weldments with similar features to those of duplex and austenitic weld metals. The weld depth and width were found to increase proportionally to the laser power. Furthermore, the weld bead geometry was found to be positively affected by the pulse width. Microstructural studies revealed the presence of dendritic and fine grain structures within the weld zone at low peak power, while ferritic microstructures were found {{on the sides of the}} weld metal near the SS 304 and austenitic-ferritic microstructure beside the duplex 2205 boundary. Regarding the micro-hardness tests, there was an improvement when compared to the hardness of duplex and austenitic stainless steels base metals. Additionally, the tensile strength of the fiber laser welded joints was found to be higher when compared to the tensile strength of the base <b>metals</b> (<b>duplex</b> and austenitic) in all of the joints...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the current}} study is to reveal the {{influence}} of welding conditions on structure and stresscorrosion cracking resistance of dissimilar stainless steels butt welded joints. Design/methodology/approach: Butt joints between duplex 2205 and austenitic 316 L steels were performedwith the use of submerged arc welding (SAW) method. The plates 15 mm in thickness were welded with heatinput in the range of 1. 15 – 3. 2 kJ/mm using <b>duplex</b> steel filler <b>metal.</b> Microstructure examinations and corrosiontests were carried out. Slow strain rate tests (SSRT) were performed in inert (glycerin) and aggressive (boiling 35 % MgCl 2 solution) environments. Findings: It was shown that place of the lowest resistance to stress corrosion cracking is heat affected zone atduplex steel side of dissimilar joins. That phenomenon was connected with undesirable structure of that zoneconsisted of great amount of coarse ferrite grains and acicular austenite precipitates. High welding inputs do notdeteriorate stress corrosion cracking resistance of welds. Research limitations/implications: High welding heat inputs should enhance the precipitation process ofintermetallic phases in the HAZ. It is necessary to continue the research to determine the relationship betweenwelding parameters, obtained structures, and corrosion resistance of dissimilar stainless steels welded joints. Practical implications: Application of more productive joining process for dissimilar welds like submerged arcwelding instead of currently employed gas metal arc welding (GMAW) method will be profitable in terms ofreduction the welding costs. Originality/value: The stress corrosion cracking resistance of dissimilar stainless steel welded joints wasdetermined. The zone of the weaker resistance to stress corrosion cracking was pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Using 1 H NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{and molecular}} modelling, the DNA binding of a chiral dinuclear ruthenium(ii) complex {Δ,Δ-[{Ru(phen) 2 } 2 (μ-bb 7) ] 4 +; phen = 1, 10 -phenanthroline, bb 7 = 1, 7 -bis[4 (4 ′-methyl- 2, 2 ′-bipyridyl) ]-heptane} involving a bridging ligand containing a flexible aliphatic chain has been studied. The binding of the ruthenium(ii) complex was examined with the non-self-complementary duplexes d(CCGAGAATCGGCC) :d(GGCCGATTCCGG) (containing a single adenine bulge: designated SB) and d(CCGAGCCGTGCC) :d(GGCACGAGCCGG) (containing two adenine bulge sites separated by two base-pairs: designated DB). The NMR {{data indicated that}} the ruthenium(ii) complex bound at the bulge site of SB, with one ruthenium centre located at the bulge site with the second metal centre binding with lower affinity and selectivity in the duplex region adjacent to the bulge site. Less specific binding is inferred from chemical shift changes of nucleotide protons two to five base pairs from the single adenine bulge. The ruthenium(ii) complex selectively bound the DB <b>duplex</b> with one <b>metal</b> centre located at each bulge site. The NMR results also suggested that the metal complex binding induced greater changes {{to the structure of}} the SB duplex, compared with the DB duplex. Modelling indicates the bridging ligand allowed each ruthenium(ii) metal centre to bind one adenine bulge of the doubly-bulged duplex without disrupting the DNA structure, using the additional torsional flexibility conferred by the aliphatic bridging ligand. However, the second ruthenium(ii) metal centre is not able to bind in the minor groove of the singly-bulged duplex without disrupting the structure, as the metal centre is too bulky. The {{results of this study suggest}} dinuclear ruthenium(ii) complexes have considerable potential as probes for DNA and RNA sequences that contain two bulge sites separated by a small number of base-pairs.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{can be very}} attractive alternatives to austenitic grades due to their almost double strength at equal pitting corrosion resistance. When welding, the duplex alloys normally require addition of filler metal, while the commodity austenitic grades can often be welded autogenously. Over-alloyed consumables are used to counteract segregation of important alloying elements and to balance the two phases, ferrite and austenite, in the <b>duplex</b> weld <b>metal.</b> This work focuses on the weldability of the recently-developed lean duplex stainless steel LDX 2101 ® (EN 1. 4162, UNS S 32101). The pitting corrosion resistance of this grade is better than that of austenitic AISI 304 (EN 1. 4307) and can reach the level of AISI 316 L (EN 1. 4404). The austenite formation is rapid in LDX 2101 compared to older duplex grades. Pitting resistance tests performed show that 1 - 2. 5 mm thick laser and gas tungsten arc (GTA) welded LDX 2101 can have good corrosion properties even when welding autogenously. Additions of filler metal, nitrogen in the shielding gas, nitrogen-based backing gas and use of laser hybrid welding methods, however, increase the austenite formation. The pitting resistance may also be increased by suppressing formation of chromium nitrides in the weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ). After thorough post-weld cleaning (pickling), pitting primarily occurred 1 - 3 mm from the fusion line, in the parent metal {{rather than in the}} HAZ. Neither the chromium nitride precipitates found in the HAZ, nor the element depletion along the fusion line that was revealed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) were found to locally decrease the pitting resistance. The preferential pitting location is suggested to be controlled by the residual weld oxide composition that varies over the surface. The composition and thickness of weld oxide formed on LDX 2101 and 2304 (EN 1. 4362, UNS S 32304) were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The heat tint on these lean duplex grades proved to contain significantly more manganese than what has been reported for standard austenitic {{stainless steels}} in the AISI 300 series. A new approach to heat tint formation is presented; whereby evaporation of material from the weld metal and subsequent deposition on the already-formed weld oxide are suggested to contribute to weld oxide formation. This is consistent with manganese loss from the weld metal, and nitrogen additions to the GTA shielding gas enhance the evaporation. The segregation of all elements apart from nitrogen is low in autogenously welded LDX 2101. This means that filler wire additions may not be required as for other duplex grades assuming that there is no large nitrogen loss that could cause excessive ferrite contents. As the nitrogen appears to be controlling the austenite formation, it becomes essential to avoid losing nitrogen during welding by choosing nitrogen-containing shielding and backing gas.
