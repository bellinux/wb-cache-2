2500|$|Ellis {{thoroughly}} {{analyzed the}} topology and the geodesics of the Ellis <b>drainhole,</b> showing {{it to be}} geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions. [...] The <b>drainhole</b> is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive). [...] (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.) [...] The solution depends on two parameters: , which fixes {{the strength of its}} gravitational field, and , which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections. [...] When [...] is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes. [...] What is left is the Ellis wormhole, a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.|$|E

I'm sorry to say, however," [...] he added after a pause, [...] "that I have been forced to cut down a good many myself. Queer place this, isn't it?" [...] he continued, {{dropping}} the subject of the trees, which was evidently a painful one to him. [...] "Dead Man's Mount is what the people about here call it, and that is what they called it {{at the time of the}} Conquest, as I can prove to you from ancient writings. I always believed that it was a tumulus, but of late years a lot of these clever people have been taking their oath that it is an ancient British dwelling, as though Ancient Britons, or any one else for that matter, could live in a kind of <b>drainhole.</b> But they got on the soft side of your old aunt-- who, by the way, begging your pardon, was a wonderfully obstinate old lady when once she hammered an idea into her head--and so she set to work and built this slate mushroom over the place, and one way and another it cost her two hundred and fifty pounds. Dear me! I shall never forget her face when she saw the bill," [...] and the old gentleman burst out into a Titanic laugh, such as Harold Quaritch had not heard for many a long day.|$|E

Afler the analysis of the peculiarities of horizontal wells and <b>drainholes</b> drilling techniques, advantages and disadvantages of the application of both roller cone and fixed cutters drill bits have been discussed. Also, a review of the potential specific featuries useful for a correct drill bit selection in horizontal small diameter holes has been highlighted. Drill bits for these special applications, whose importance is quickly increasing nowadays, should be characterised by a design capable to deliver a good penetration rate low WOB, and, at the same time, be able to withstand high RPM without premature cutting structure failure and undergauge. Formation properties will also determine the cutting structure type and the eventual specific features for additional gauge and shoulder protection...|$|R
40|$|Pre-mining {{depressurising}} {{of a deep}} {{ore body}} at the McArthur River mine in northern Saskatchewan was considered to decrease the risk associated with mining near 5 MPa water pressure and {{increasing the amount of}} ore that can be extracted. Based on a limited amount of field data, a three-dimensional finite element ground-water flow model was developed to predict the amount of water {{that would have to be}} pumped from surface wells or extracted with underground <b>drainholes</b> to meet this goal and the associated magnitude and extent of drawdown that would propagate to the surface over the life of the operation and its impact on surface-water resources. In addition, the results from the preliminary model were used to design a prototype depressurising well and a 30 -day pumping test. Because of the predicted large volume of water that would have to be discharged, another still on-going investigation has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of localized depressurisation in improving mine tunnel stability in conjunction with ground freezing and cementaceous grouting...|$|R
40|$|In {{creating}} his {{gravitational field}} equations Einstein unjustifiedly assumed that inertial mass, and its energy equivalent, {{is a source}} of gravity. Denying this assumption allows modifying the field equations to a form in which a positive cosmological constant appears as a uniform density of gravitationally repulsive matter. Field equations with both positive and negative active gravitational mass densities incorporated along with a scalar field coupled to geometry with nostandard polarity yield cosmological solutions that exhibit acceleration, inflation, coasting, and a 'big bounce' instead of a 'big bang'. The repulsive matter is identified as the back sides of the 'drainholes' (called by some 'traversable wormholes') introduced by the author in 1973, solutions of the same field equations, which attract on their high, front sides and repel more strongly on their low, back sides. The front sides serve as the unseen particles of 'dark matter' needed to hold together the large scale structures seen in the universe. Formation of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and nodes are attributed to separation of the back sides of the <b>drainholes</b> from the front, driven by their mutual attractive-repulsive interactions. One can assert that all of these cosmological entities have been found wrapped in one neat package, namely, the field equations and the variational principle from which they are derived...|$|R

5000|$|To {{learn the}} repulsive {{mass of the}} <b>drainhole</b> {{requires}} finding an isometry of the <b>drainhole</b> manifold that exchanges {{the upper and lower}} regions. Such an isometry can be described as follows: Let [...] denote the <b>drainhole</b> manifold whose parameters are [...] and [...] and [...] denote the <b>drainhole</b> manifold whose parameters are [...] and [...] where [...] The isometry identifies the point of [...] having coordinates [...] with the point of [...] having coordinates [...] One infers from it that [...] and [...] are in fact the same manifold, and that the lower region where [...] now disguised as the upper region where [...] has [...] as its gravitational mass, thus gravitationally repels test particles more strongly than the true upper region attracts them, in the ratio ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is clear}} from the radial {{equation}} of motion that test particles starting from any point in the upper region with no radial velocity (...) will, without sufficient angular velocity [...] fall down through the <b>drainhole</b> and into the lowerregion. Not so clear but nonetheless true is that a test particle starting from a point in the lower region can with sufficient upward velocity pass through the <b>drainhole</b> and into the upper region. Thus the <b>drainhole</b> is 'traversable' by test particles in both directions. The same holds for photons.|$|E
40|$|Heavy Oil is {{abundant}} in California. It {{is a very}} viscous fluid, which must be thinned in order to flow from wells at economical rates. The best method of oil viscosity reduction is by cyclic steam injection into the oil-containing rock formations. Making steam in conventional generators fueled with Natural Gas is, however, a costly process. The main objective of this Project {{is to reduce the}} cost of the required steam, per Barrel of Oil produced. This is made possible by a combination of Patented new technologies with several known methods. The best known method for increasing the production rate from oil wells is to use horizontal <b>drainholes,</b> which provide a much greater flow area from the oil zone into the well. A recent statistic based on 344 horizontal wells in 21 Canadian Oil fields containing Heavy Oil shows that these are, on the average six times more prolific than vertical wells. The cost of horizontal wells, however, is generally two to three times that of a vertical well, in the same field, so our second goal is to reduce the net cost of horizontal wells by connecting two of them to the same vertical casing, well head and pumping system. With such a well configuration, it is possible to get two horizontal wells for the price of about one and a half times the price of a single vertical well...|$|R

The field equations with a scalar field added produce cosmological models that 'bounce' off a positive minimum of the scale factor and accelerate throughout history. The 'dark drainholes' that radiate nothing visible are hypothesized to constitute the 'dark matter' inferred from observation, their excess of negative active mass over positive active mass driving the accelerating expansion. For a universe with spatial curvature zero, and the ratio of scale factor now to scale factor at bounce equal to the Hubble radius over the Planck length, the model gives an elapsed time since the bounce of two trillion years. The solutions for negative spatial curvature exhibit early stage inflation of great magnitude in short times.

Modern archaeological surveys have proven that the eastern wall was 6,000 m long, the {{southern}} wall was 7,600 m long, the western wall was 4,900 m long, and the northern wall was 7,200 (23,622 ft) long. Overall the total length of walls equalled 25,700 m, and formed a roughly square layout (although the southern and northern walls had sections which zigzagged due to topographical concerns: rough terrain existed along the southern wall and {{the course of the}} Wei River obstructed the straight path of the northern wall). The city's moat was 8 m wide and 3 m deep; the remains of what were wooden bridges have been discovered along the moat. Chang'an had twelve gatehouses leading into the city, three for each side of the wall, and acted as terminus points for the main avenues.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a vision of how the {{processes}} and materials used to extract hydrocarbons from underground reservoirs might evolve over the next decade or so, in order to stimulate and provide signposts for the research and development which is needed to meet the industry’s future needs. The target is to double the recovery of hydrocarbon in place from today’s typical values of 30 - 40 %. This will require real-time reservoir management, for which the ability to simulate, monitor and control all the key processes that take place within the reservoir and production system is a fundamental requirement. A particular emphasis is placed on the role to be played by chemical and process engineering. Existing exploration and production practices are summarized and possible scenarios described for the way in which the enabling technology and engineering might evolve. This is done by presenting a series of technology roadmaps and cartoon future scenarios for four technology packages that together have the potential to enable a new era in productivity. Oil and gas wells can be likened to high pressure, high temperature tubular reactors, whose geometry and sophistication is becoming increasingly complex. It is envisaged that the oil reservoir of the future will evolve towards a subterranean factory of interconnecting <b>drainholes,</b> whose overall efficiency in producing saleable products will be determined by the way that its individual production units are deployed and coupled in the light of market needs. Linked to improved understanding of the regional geology, optimising the downhole factory productivity will enable the operators to reduce significantly their investment risks and substantially increase worldwide recovery rates...|$|R
40|$|Slot-cutting {{tests were}} made in a 3. 5 in. OD steel pipe {{representative}} of the proposed liner of the twin gravel-packed horizontal <b>drainholes</b> used in this Method, for the following purposes: (1) To determine the force required to punch through the liner wall {{in order to achieve}} its full penetration with a cutting wheel, (2) To select the most effective profile for the cutting wheel. The results of these tests, made at UC-Berkeley indicated that, with four cutting wheels, as included in the tool design presented in the Fourth Quarterly Report, the total force required was nearly 60, 000 lb. In view of the limited tool diameter, the creation of such a large force with a single piston required a hydraulic pressure which would exceed the capability of the Triplex pump, most commonly available in the oil fields. A re-design of the 4 -wheel slot-cutting tool with two tandem pistons was done, but revealed a high degree of complexity, related to the difficulty of providing a high-pressure fluid path in the thin housing wall from the hydraulic cylinder above the first pair of arms to a cylinder for the tandem piston located below the first pair of cutter arms and operating the second pair of arms. By reducing the number of cutting wheels from 4 to 3 a single piston driver was sufficient and could result in a tool much simpler to build and to maintain in the Field. The re-designed 3 -wheel slot-cutting tool is presented here. It is currently under construction at UC-Berkeley. A second test program will follow, when this simplified modular tool has been assembled. The objective of this second series of tests is to determine the required characteristics of the opposing spring, or Belleville rings stack which, in the new design, is used for retraction of the cutters, rather than for their extension...|$|R

[...] In these equations there are two scalar fields minimally coupled to the space-time geometry with opposite polarities. The 'cosmological constant' [...] is replaced by a net repulsive density of gravitating matter owed to the presence of primordial <b>drainhole</b> 'tunnels' and continuous creation of new tunnels, each with its excess of repulsion over attraction. Those <b>drainhole</b> tunnels associated with particles of visible matter provide their gravity; those not tied to visible matter are the unseen 'dark matter'. 'Dark energy' is the net repulsive density of all the <b>drainhole</b> tunnels. The cosmological model has a 'big bounce' instead of a 'big bang', inflationary acceleration out of the bounce, and a smooth transition to an era of decelerative coasting, followed ultimately by a return to de Sitter-like exponential expansion.|$|E
