25|$|Upon leaving Ace, {{he and his}} wife, Elsie Balter Wollheim, founded DAW Books, {{named for}} his initials. DAW can {{claim to be the}} first mass market {{specialist}} science fiction and fantasy fiction publishing house. DAW issued its first four titles in April 1972. Most of the writers whom he had developed at Ace went with him to DAW: Marion Zimmer Bradley, Andre Norton, Philip K. Dick, John Brunner, A. Bertram Chandler, Kenneth Bulmer, Gordon R. Dickson, A. E. van Vogt, and Jack Vance. In later years, when his distributor, New American Library, threatened to withhold Thomas Burnett Swann's Biblical fantasy <b>How</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> Mighty Fallen (1974) because of its homosexual content, Wollheim fought vigorously against their decision and they relented.|$|E

25|$|His Holiness Sree Narayana Guru, {{the spiritual}} leader of the Thiyyas is {{reported}} to have disapproved of the present methods of Satyagraha at Vaikom. He suggests that volunteers should advance along barricaded roads and scale the barricades. They should enter temples and sit with others to dine. Now the action proposed is not Satyagraha. For scaling barricades is open violence. If you may scale barricades, why not break open temple doors and even pierce temple walls? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> volunteers pierce through a row of policemen except by using force?. If the Thiyyas are strong and willing to die in sufficient numbers, they can gain their point. All I submit is that they will have gained it by some thing the reverse of Satyagraha. And then too, they would not have converted the orthodox to their views, but would have imposed it on them by force.|$|E
