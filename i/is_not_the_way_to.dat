She called both plot and acting [...] "ridiculous" [...] and commented {{that while she}} often felt sorry for the serial being snubbed at the National Soap Awards, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> raise the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown opposes a {{proposed}} multibillion-dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, {{said that he}} is [...] "opposed to higher taxes, especially {{in the midst of a}} severe recession". He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get our economy moving again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{moved to}} London and {{enrolled}} at William Shipley's drawing school in November 1761. Despite attending the life class at St Martin's Lane Academy, he remained unconfident {{of his ability}} to draw figures convincingly, and in 1763 he persuaded the leading landscape painter of the day (and fellow Welshman) Richard Wilson to take him on as a pupil. A high-spirited youth, Jones recorded in his journal that he and two rowdy fellow pupils were once rebuked by their master with the words, [...] "Gentlemen, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> rival Claude".|$|E
50|$|Although schools {{only have}} to be {{compliant}} with one of the three prongs, many schools have not managed to achieve equality. Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> OCR wanted compliance achieved. Equity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only <b>way</b> to <b>be</b> compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.|$|R

500|$|Public {{authorities}} given discretion under statute to {{make certain}} decisions often adopt non-statutory policies to guide them in their exercise of such discretionary powers. In Lines International, Justice Judith Prakash noted that were it the case that statutory bodies could not formulate policies or guidelines except through duly promulgated regulations, [...] "then everything would come to a grinding halt while policy decisions had to be communicated to the Attorney-General's Chambers, then drafted into regulations and then the drafts approved by the organisation concerned before being sent on to Parliament and effected by gazette notification.
