5|$|The Scottish Football Union (SFU), the {{governing}} body for rugby union in Scotland, {{did not give}} the New Zealanders an official welcome, and sent only one official to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh. In addition, the SFU refused a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the match, promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead; {{this meant that the}} NZRFU had to take on all monetary responsibilities for the match. One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell-Sivright, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a {{financial}} {{success for the}} NZRFU. The NZRFU had asked for a £500 <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> from the SRU for the game, but because of their poor finances, the SRU offered instead to give the entire gate (minus expenses). Due to a big attendance, the NZRFU received a fee of over £1700 for the game. Although the SRU were very happy with this (they offered the same terms to the Springboks when they toured in 1906), there were also concerns about the three shillings a day each All Black received whilst on tour. After {{they found that the}} Rugby Football Union had approved the payments, a Calcutta Cup match was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|When the UCI {{released}} {{its list of}} teams graded according to their hierarchy that decided who would receive a World Tour license, this team's signees put them at the top, making them world number one before they even existed. This did not guarantee the team a top-level license, it simply qualified them for it, but they were later announced as having received a four-year World Tour license. Whether intentionally or incidentally, this corresponded to the initial <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> Becca put up for the team. Nygaard hailed the license acquisition as the fruition of many months of hard work. This afforded the team automatic invitations to all World Tour events, including the season's three Grand Tours.|$|E
40|$|A {{few years}} since {{the worst of the}} Euro {{sovereign}} debt crisis, many nations, from Cyprus to Ireland, including South Africa are re-visiting their public debt management to avert or lessen the impact of similar such happenings in the future. There are a number of studies on risk assessments of fiscal sustainability; however, few focus on contingent liabilities and even fewer on <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees.</b> In South Africa, <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> have consistently comprised just above or below 50 % of all contingent liabilities {{since the early days of}} majoritarian rule. In lieu of this, the paper analyses the risks posed by <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> to fiscal sustainability in South Africa. We estimate the effect of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> on public debt in South Africa via the Engle Granger and causality model with quarterly time series data obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) as well as the National Treasury. The data covers the April 1997 to December 2011 period. All econometric methods were executed using the statistical software package E-Views 7. We found that no long run relationship exists between national net loan debt and <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> in South Africa. The pass rate of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> significantly affects its present value. The pass rate of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> has a predicting ability in determining the present value of national net loan debt. These findings may be contrary to what would be expected in the case of South Africa considering that the country is managing the issuance of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> prudently and that at present levels, there is no need for a radical policy shift. The study therefore offers a lesson to similar merging economies on the good governance of contingent liabilities...|$|R

25|$|Total {{investment}} {{costs for the}} project were SEK6 billion, of which SEK2 billion was financed through state grants to the Swedish Rail Administration who built the quadruple track along the East Coast Line. The public–private partnership {{part of the project}} involved two new tracks at StockholmC and the Arlanda Line, costing SEK4.1 billion. Of this, SEK2.4 billion was financed by the state. In addition, the state held a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> to Nordea for the X3 trains, should A-Train fail to meets its financial obligations to the bank. A-Train was also granted an interest-free deferral on the payment of the fees at StockholmC and Arlanda, costing the state SEK90 million. Of A-Train's capital loan for SEK2.2 billion, SEK1.8 billion was borrowed from three state-owned financial institutions: the Swedish National Debt Office, the Swedish Export Credit Corporation and the Nordic Investment Bank. In addition, 20% of the share capital was secured through Vattenfall's equity in the company.|$|E
500|$|Mayor Daley said on May 10, 2006 {{that the}} Olympics [...] "cannot become a {{financial}} burden {{to the taxpayers}} of Chicago and Illinois." [...] "The {{goal is to have}} the Olympics be totally privately funded and we have unparalleled support from the business community," [...] a mayoral spokeswoman said in July 2006. Daley insisted that no tax money would be used to pay for the city to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and said funding from the private sector and federal dollars for security and infrastructure would cover the costs. [...] "Tax money isn't paying for it," [...] Daley said on February 7, 2009. [...] "The federal government pays for security, which is the highest cost of the Olympics ... The other thing they pay for is infrastructure ... There's no city tax money whatsoever ... We are very strong in that position ... in the regard to having that be sponsored by the private sector and others." [...] In previous years, Daley opposed possible bids for the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games owing to former international committee financial-guarantee requirements. The 2016 <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> requirements were not initially formalized.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{time it was}} {{believed}} that this view was supported by documents from the Episcopal Register at Worcester, which records in Latin the issuing of a wedding licence to [...] "Wm Shaxpere" [...] and one [...] "Annam Whateley" [...] of Temple Grafton. The following day, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from Stratford, signed a surety of £40 as a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the wedding of [...] "William Shagspere and Anne Hathwey". Frank Harris, in The Man Shakespeare (1909), argued that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two women. He had chosen to marry one, Anne Whateley, but when this became known he was immediately forced by Hathaway's family to marry their pregnant relative. Harris believed that [...] "Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless" [...] because of his entrapment by her and that this was the spur to his decision to leave Stratford and pursue a career in the theatre.|$|E

Unfortunately for the beneficiary, {{who had served}} the club for eight years and was [...] "generally admitted {{to be the most}} consistent player the club possesses", fears that the attendance would be a low one were realised. The Darts [...] "What We Hear" [...] column suggested that the match raised only £30, [...] "that he deserved far more, and it is a pity that the committee do not see their way to make it up to a respectable sum". Without a fixture for the following Saturday, Small Heath attempted to arrange another friendly in the south of England, but after their previous performances in such matches, no potential opponent were prepared to offer a sufficient <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> for them to agree to travel. Perhaps the free weekend motivated the players, for in wintry weather they won the replayed Birmingham Cup-tie against Burton Swifts by seven goals to one.|$|E

A few blocks away from the Mille Collines, there was a church, l' Eglise St. Famille, with more than 5000 refugees. Every night militia were killing people there. We did nothing to evacuate them and I guess it was because they didn't have visas".|$|E
