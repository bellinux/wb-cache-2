5|$|The Uncle Grandpa short that Browngardt had {{produced}} was eventually adapted {{as a full}} series of the same name, which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> a more lighthearted adaptation for children.|$|E
5|$|Tommy {{secured the}} Who's future, {{and made them}} millionaires. The group reacted in {{different}} ways—Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> at odds with Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{pressing}} of 1,000 {{copies of}} the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo {{to ask for the}} remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and in clubs, which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 {{copies of the}} recording were produced in total.|$|E
50|$|Nagel {{would start}} with a {{photograph}} and work down, always simplifying and removing elements which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> unnecessary. The resulting image would look flat, but emphasized those elements which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> most important.|$|R

5|$|Aciu Widjaja, now President-Director of Air Asia, {{described}} Chrisye as {{a simple}} man and said that one time, when he, Chrisye, and several others had gone overseas Chrisye {{was the only one}} who did not look for brand-name clothing or world-class restaurants; instead he ate at a food court and bought what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> comfortable. In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|Como's final Christmas special {{was filmed}} in January 1994 in Dublin's Point Theatre before an {{audience}} of 4,500 people, including Irish President Mary Robinson and Como's friend, the actress Maureen O'Hara. Perry Como's Irish Christmas was a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) production, made by an Irish independent production company in association with RTÉ. Como, appearing aged and unwell, had the flu during the show which took four hours to record. At the show's conclusion, Como apologized to his Dublin audience for a performance <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> not up to his usual standards.|$|E
50|$|Buchman {{would share}} the {{thoughts}} which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> guided by God, but whether others pursued those thoughts {{was up to}} them.|$|R
50|$|Van Mander also {{described}} contemporary painters whom <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> of note. The {{following is a}} list of all of these painters.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, the Duke sued his {{stepmother}} Elizabeth, who {{he believed}} had possession of several family heirlooms that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> rightfully his.|$|R
5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million. The deal {{was considered to be}} worth less than he could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> {{too much}} individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey {{in favour of}} taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He {{had a change of}} heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
50|$|He {{believed}} in a puritan, evangelistic Christianity, but was hostile to {{other aspects of}} European culture which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> not suitable to Africa.|$|R

50|$|This {{manifesto}} echoes {{an earlier}} one that Vertov wrote in 1922, {{in which he}} disavowed popular films <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> indebted to literature and theater.|$|R
5|$|Jack Brabham used BT19 {{again at}} the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, another high speed circuit. A second BT20 was {{completed}} at the Italian track and Brabham tried it in practice for the race, but decided to race his Old Nail, which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> fitted with a stronger engine. As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early on, but an oil leakage stopped the car after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{returned}} to Indiana and continued his training. He competed at the 1979 U.S. National Championships at Fort Lauderdale, setting Australian {{records in the}} 100m and 200m backstroke in times of 56.50s and 2m 2.61s respectively. Over time, Kerry became increasingly discontented with Counsilman, who <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> losing focus and becoming preoccupied with various business commitments and an attempt to swim across the English Channel. Kerry transferred to the University of Southern California, which was coached by Naber's mentor Peter Daland.|$|E
5|$|Mottola {{had assumed}} the top {{position}} at Sony, the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through {{various stages of}} change. One <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> {{very important for the}} label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival Whitney Houston from Arista Records, or a pop star to match Madonna, who was signed to Sire Records at the time. He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.|$|E
50|$|Narseh, {{surprised}} by what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> moderate demands, agreed to all but the fifth condition of the treaty and it was subsequently withdrawn by Sicorius Probus.|$|R

5|$|Shoup {{was unable}} to {{directly}} influence the Johnson administration, which expanded U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He became increasingly wary of what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> undue influence by the CIA and big businesses on foreign policy. In 1964 during {{the debate over the}} Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Senator Wayne Morse wanted to call Shoup to testify against the measure, but was blocked by Senator J. William Fulbright. On 14 May 1966, Shoup began publicly attacking the policy in a speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, for their World Affairs Day.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{would lose}} 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, but were bounced {{in the first}} round. During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season {{that would result in}} the Lakers failing to make the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former {{teammate}} Michael Cooper as his lead assistant. Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
50|$|The film {{received}} an A (Adults only) rating by the Central Board of Film Certification when Bhandarkar refused to cut several scenes <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> {{integral to the}} film.|$|R
50|$|Reduction of {{the amount}} of recitative. Voltaire found recitative boring and reduced it in favour of a greater number of {{ensembles}} and choruses, things <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> Rameaus strong suit.|$|R
50|$|Imad-ud Din Lahiz {{wrote his}} {{autobiography}} in 1866. After becoming a Christian, Lahiz {{wrote a book}} entitled Tahqiq ul-Iman criticizing those Maulvis who <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>were</b> unnecessarily putting faith in Islam.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} less {{critique}} of Bray’s musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, {{he points out that}} the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{retirement}} as a player, Selke offered Richard {{a job as}} a team ambassador and promised to pay him his full playing salary in the first year. After serving in the position for three years, Richard was named a vice-president of the Canadiens in 1964. He became disgruntled with a role <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> powerless and only honorary, and resigned one year later. Richard grew estranged from the organization as his desire {{to be involved in the}} team's operations was ignored, and the split deepened when the Canadiens forced Frank Selke to retire in 1965. He eventually refused to allow his name to be associated with the team.|$|E
5|$|While Miller was a {{reluctant}} bowler, Bradman used him heavily {{because of his}} desire to have every possible spin option. Miller thus played as a middle-order batsman batting at No. 5 ahead of the wicket-keeper and the other bowlers, and an opening fast bowler, partnering Lindwall. For Victoria, Miller often batted higher at No. 3 or No. 4 and bowled less. For his state, Miller averaged more with the bat, which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> because {{he was able to}} concentrate more on his batting, as Hassett gave him a smaller workload with the ball.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting fanciful. He {{shook his}} {{shoulders}} and told his horse to get on. He listened, and heard nothing.|$|R
