5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E
