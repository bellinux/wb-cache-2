40|$|AbstractControlled low {{strength}} materials (CLSM), is a self-flowing cementitious backfill material, {{most suitable}} for sustainability objectives since it makes use of wastes in large quantities. Wasted gypsum wall boards (<b>drywalls),</b> a construction & demolition waste, are known to pollute atmosphere by releasing harmful H 2 S gas when dumped at landfills. Use of waste <b>drywalls</b> with flyash, as cement replacement in concrete and CLSM, have resulted in low strength mixes at initial & later ages, respectively. In this paper powdered <b>drywalls</b> with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), was used as secondary cementitious material along with stone dust as fine aggregates, to produce sustainable CLSM mixtures with varying binder ratios and water contents. Reduction in compressive strength at later ages was not observed for mixes with low water contents, hence use of GGBS instead of flyash with lesser water contents, is effective in resisting detrimental effects of sulfates present in <b>drywalls...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{more subtle}} {{advantage}} of post-tensioned construction is the resulting flatness of the slabs, {{making it easier}} for the finishing trades to install <b>drywalls,</b> shower bases, bathtubs and tiles, kitchen cabinets, and to align trims and moldings. Also, the crack-free exterior spandrel system is to a great extent to be credited to the compression introduced by the pre-stressing tendons.|$|R
30|$|However, for the De Vijvers building, an {{environment}} mainly consisting of concrete walls (versus the lighter layered <b>drywalls</b> in the Zuiderpoort building), the loss when propagating around corners {{appeared to be}} higher than for the Zuiderpoort building. The interaction loss for this environment was tuned to a value of 0.1946 dB/° or 17.5 dB/ 90 ° for concrete walls (see Figure 6, 'concrete'). In fact, it was only tuned for one of the twelve trajectories (T 5, a trajectory where the dominant path made a propagation direction change), so all other measured trajectories in this building can be considered as validation trajectories as well (see Table 1, column 'goal').|$|R
5|$|In Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, {{the storm}} surge {{surrounded}} many of the buildings at the United States Naval Academy, resulting in about $116million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD) The Annapolis Maritime Museum suffered severe damage as well, though volunteers moved artifacts to a safer location. There, {{the storm surge}} flooded the building in 6feet (1.8m) of water, causing great damage to the floor, <b>drywall,</b> and electricity. About 93% of the 211,000 power customers in the county were left without electricity after the storm. FEMA estimated a damage total of up to $500million (2003USD, ($ USD) in the county.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 35 power crews, along with outside contractors, worked to restore power. By {{two days after}} the storm, 2,000 {{remained}} without power in scattered areas. Various locations in the city of Dover were without power for about 30hours. There, the removal of debris exceeded the capacity of the local landfall, resulting in officials temporarily storing it elsewhere. Over 200volunteers donated time, food and money to provide hot meals for individuals and families affected by the storm. Support teams provided by county officials transported over 300 tons of ruined accessories from the storm, such as appliances, carpets, and <b>drywall,</b> to local landfills.

50|$|Besides the {{exploitation}} of the metals for the massive production of weapons {{and to some extent}} the working tools for agriculture, the Iron Age evidenced in Kosovo is well presented with lowland settlements but also with upland fortresses, often protected by traverses and ditches or <b>drywalls.</b> Regarding the fortifications, the Iron Age is characteristic for the erected fortresses {{on the top of the}} hills, with good Geo-strategic positions, partially protected by nature. Nevertheless, the identification ‘stamp’ of the Iron Age as documented, recorded and studied in Kosovo, are the burial mounds, or locally known as the tumulus graves, and quite dispersed all around Kosovo, counting maybe hundreds and either set in groups or even as solitary tumulus.|$|R
5000|$|This waste {{arises when}} already {{installed}} plasterboards (<b>drywalls,</b> wallboards or gyprock boards), that usually have been installed many years ago, are taken out {{in connection with}} that the building is demolished or renovated. For this reason some refer to this waste as “old gypsum waste”, whereas the trade usually refer to this waste as “demolition waste”. Different from the two other types of gypsum waste described above, this type of gypsum waste from renovation, refurbishment and demolition works {{is more likely to}} present a certain degree of contamination, which can be in the form of nails, screws, wood, insulation, wall coverings etc. For this waste to be recyclable it is required that the equipment processing the waste is capable of separating such contamination from the gypsum to arrive at a pure recycled gypsum. New construction and demolition gypsum waste is both arising after the gypsum products have left the manufacturing sites, and together these two waste types are referred to as post consumer gypsum waste.|$|R

40|$|Past {{earthquakes}} {{have shown}} that the damage to non-structural elements can severely limit the functionality of most affected buildings and cause substantial economic losses. Among the non-structural building components, the ceiling-partition systems represent a large economic investment in construction sector. Nevertheless, their seismic performance is poorly understood, because information and specific guidance are very limited. In the last years, international studies have been conducted on the seismic behaviour of light gage steel stud partition walls (Lee et al. [1], Restrepo and Bersofsky [2], Tasligedik et al. [3], Retamales et al. [4], Magliulo at al. [5]), suspended ceilings (Badillo et al. [6], Magliulo et al. [7], Gilani et al. [8], Soroushian et al. [9],) and partition walls - ceiling systems (Filiatrault et al. [10], McCormick at al. [11]). Since the behaviour of these systems cannot be easily simulated with traditional structural analysis, experimentation is the main way to assess the seismic response. For these reasons, an experimental campaign has been planned at the University of Naples Federico II with the main aim to characterize the seismic response of different Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) partition <b>drywalls</b> and suspended continuous plasterboard ceilings. The current paper presents the research project, in terms of experimental program, prototypes and specifically designed set-up...|$|R
30|$|A. second {{measurement}} {{campaign has}} been performed in an office environment at the Universitè Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). A floor plan of the measurement environment is given in Figure 2. It consists of a main hall, surrounded by offices. The rooms are filled with tables and furniture, and the walls are composed partly of <b>drywalls</b> and partly of brick walls. The labs and offices are also surrounded by several windows. The door between Tx and Rx remained closed for all the measurements in the hall to avoid line-of-sight conditions. At each measurement location, a 2 -level virtual uniform planar array (2 L-VUPA) was realized using an automatic positioning device, yielding a 10 × 10 × 2 virtual array. The elements of the planar array were spaced by λ/ 3, and the two levels of the 2 L-VUPA were spaced by 1.2 λ. The Rx antenna was a tri-pole antenna, composed of three perpendicularly polarized short linear antennas. The θ-and ϕ-radiation patterns of the three antennas of the tri-pole have been measured in an anechoic chamber [24], and the 3 D plots are shown in [25]. The Tx antennas consisted of two log-periodic antennas, one vertically polarized and one horizontally polarized, that were spaced a few wavelengths apart. The crosspolar discrimination of these antennas is larger than 15 dB.|$|R

40|$|Autorica donosi istraživanja kasnoantičke vile na Mirju kod Postira u kojoj u VI. stoljeću nastaje sakralni sklop vjerojatno vezan za predbenediktinsku monašku zajednicu. Posebice se obrađuju ostaci monumentalnog kamenog portika ubrani u antičkim kamenolomima obližnjeg Škripa. Mirje takes {{a special}} place among late antique localities {{on the island of}} Brač. It is {{situated}} high on Mali Brig above the village of Postira, in a cultivated agrarian landscape and on an excellent strategic position in the climate of Salona, the capital of the province of Dalmatia. Actually, it was built among the two important centers on the Adriatic part of the province: Diocletian’s palace in Split and imperial quarries near Škrip, from which architectural stone for building the monumental palace was cut. Numerous fragments of stone furniture scattered all over field <b>drywalls,</b> confirmed the existence of a sacral building from the 6 th century, hidden within the complex, which hasn’t been recognized up to present day. Through protection works, for the past two decades, the architectural complex has been defined in its whole range. The analysis of the discovered walls suggests that the complex was not built for the convent’s community, but that was in fact a later adaptation of the late antique villa. The array of square bases with overturned monolithic stone pillars was found in the interior of the complex, among the two big projections of the western façade. The pillars with square cross-section have been knocked down towards the middle of the yard within the complex. At the ends, there were six pillars and two semi-pillars in a row, with a somewhat wider middle intercolumniation. We recognize the pattern for this kind of »rhythm« between pillars on the south façade of the imperial palace in Split, which for sure was the model and inspiration for the builders of this small residential building. Pillar surfaces were treated by marteline with a hole at the bottom. The monumental distinctive wreath is turned upside-down and re-carved into smaller pieces which served as pillar bases. By disintegrating the wreath that was intended for a public building or a temple, the bases of the portico were formed, and they, on their inner side, don’t have the same shape, but are only treated obliquely, like a truncated pyramid. The upper surface has square hole with a small canal for pouring lead. Monolithic pillars with a square cross-section are rare in other late antique localities in Dalmatia. The continuity of the quarrying tradition in Roman quarries around Škrip has created the base for the making of such blocks. Namely, cubic capitals and semi-capitals are decorated with leafs of acanthus, tendrils and plastic vegetative volutes. Traces of quarrying skills have been preserved in the stones of Roman quarries close to Škrip (Rasohe, Plate, Zastražišće), where deposits of blocks could be seen. We must not exclude the assumption that owner of the villa on Mirje was the imperial quarry manager and that he was in charge for supervision of the valuable state property near Škrip...|$|R

25|$|Shipped by {{railroad}} boxcar, {{and then}} usually trucked {{to a home}} site, the average Sears Modern Home kit had approximately 25 tons of materials, with over 30,000 parts.

The Modern Homes features of central heating, indoor plumbing, and electrical wiring were the first steps for many families to modern HVAC systems, kitchens, and bathrooms. During the Modern Homes program, large quantities of asphalt shingles became available. Asphalt shingles were cheap to manufacture and ship, and easy and inexpensive to install. A later feature was the use of <b>drywall</b> instead of the plaster and lath wall-building techniques which required skilled carpenters and plasterers. <b>Drywall</b> offered the advantages of low price, ease of installation, and added fire protection. Local building requirements sometimes dictated that certain elements of the house construction be done professionally and varied to meet requirements of each area of the country. For example, requirements for the depth of the foundation varied by climate and terrain and whether the house was being financed by Sears.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{practice}} is {{to investigate the}} applicability of porous bass trap absorbers before investigating resonant or hybridized bass trap absorbers.
