5|$|The {{aircraft}} serving Flight 3054 was an Airbus A320-233, {{serial number}} 789, registration PR-MBK; it was powered by two IAE V2500-533 engines.

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September10, the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar (28.38inHg) but sustained winds did not exceed 90mph (140km/h) according to the NHC. Luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland early on September11. While tracking over Newfoundland, cold, dry air became entrenched in Luis's circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough. The NHC issued their final advisory on Hurricane Luis at 0900UTC on September11 as it tracked nearly 65mph (100km/h) to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants persisted for 30more <b>hours</b> <b>over</b> the North Atlantic Ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of Greenland late on September12.|$|E

5|$|Although Southern California and Mexico were {{considered}} for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected {{for the majority of}} the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 <b>hours</b> <b>over</b> 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 <b>hours</b> <b>over</b> three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E
5|$|Continued {{weakened}} led to {{the storm}} being downgraded to a severe tropical storm early on February11 as it tracked towards the southeast. After spending several <b>hours</b> <b>over</b> cold waters, most of the convection associated with Hondo dissipated {{due to the lack}} of energy and the storm was further downgraded to a moderate tropical storm. Later that day, no convection remained around the storm as it weakened to a tropical depression. The JTWC issued their final advisory on February12 as the storm showed no signs of convective activity. Hondo degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area as Météo-France issued their final advisory at 1200UTC. For the next week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwestward direction with little or no development. On February20, about 2,780km (1,725mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the low began to develop weak convection around the northern edge of the center of circulation.|$|E

She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the Cambria, a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen <b>hours.</b> <b>Over</b> {{the next four years}} she provided the Tribune with thirty-seven reports. She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlylewhom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few <b>hours.</b> <b>Over</b> the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E
5|$|The {{center of}} {{circulation}} emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that morning. Passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation, {{and it had}} weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h). However, several <b>hours</b> <b>over</b> the warm waters of the western Gulf provided the energy needed for Emily to regenerate, and by midnight wind speeds were increasing. The increase in wind speed stalled, but the storm continued to become better organized. Emily started to show very symmetrical outflow, but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center. However, the outer wind radii subsided in the end, and the inner core prevailed. The result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core {{on the evening of}} July19. The pressure dropped about 30millibars and the winds went from 90mph (145km/h) to more than 125mph (200km/h), all within a few hours.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, {{the tower}} for Falcon's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections, {{arriving}} at the park {{near the end of}} October; the ride's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries. Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night, with the last piece in place by New Year's Eve. Construction was done by the Adena Corporation, and on November 18 the first piece was installed. The ride's second piece was installed on December 2, and two more were installed by December 6. The fifth section was placed by December 21, and the sixth was erected by New Year's Day. The seventh tower piece was installed by January 3, 2014, and the eighth by January 5, reaching a height of about , and Falcon's Fury's gondola was seen at the park on January 12. The ride's counterweight was installed on January 22, and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1. Work on the ride's electrical components then began. Assembly of the gondola was completed by the end of March. Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February, but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15. Tower painting began in June, with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 <b>hours</b> <b>over</b> a three-week period.|$|E
