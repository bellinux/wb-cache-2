5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} <b>glucose</b> <b>metabolism</b> by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E

40|$|Long-term memory formation, {{the ability}} to retain {{information}} over time about an experience, is a complex function that affects multiple behaviors, and {{is an integral part}} of an individual’s identity. In the last 50 years many scientists have focused their work on understanding the biological mechanisms underlying memory formation and processing. Molecular studies over the last three decades have mostly investigated, or given attention to, neuronal mechanisms. However, the brain is composed of different cell types that, by concerted actions, cooperate to mediate brain functions. Here we consider some new insights that emerged from recent studies implicating astrocytic glycogen and <b>glucose</b> <b>metabolisms,</b> and particularly their coupling to neuronal functions via lactate, as an essential mechanism for long-term memory formation...|$|R

To examine the relation between diabetes, pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome and its components and the levels of fasting glucose, HbA 1 c and HOMA-IR with the prevalence of glaucoma in the general U. S. population. Cross-sectional study of 3, 299 adult men and women from the 2005 - 2008 National Health and NutritionExamination Survey (NHANES). The presence of diabetes, prediabetes, the metabolic syndrome and its individual components and biomarkers of <b>glucose</b> <b>metabolisms</b> were based on standardized questionnaire and physical exam data and laboratory tests. The history of glaucoma was assessed through questionnaire during the home interview. Diabetes was strongly associated with prevalent glaucoma. In fully adjusted models, the odds ratiofor glaucoma comparing participants with diabetes with participants in the reference group with neither pre-diabetes nor diabetes was 2. 12 (95 % CI: 1. 23, 3. 67). The corresponding odd ratio comparing participants with pre-diabetes to those in the reference group was 1. 01 (95 % CI: 0. 57, 1. 82). Patients with 5 or more years of diabetes duration hadan OR for glaucoma of 3. 90 (95 % CI: 1. 63, 9. 32) compared with patients with < 5 years of diabetes duration. We also found a hockey-stick shaped associations between biomarkers of <b>glucose</b> <b>metabolisms</b> and the prevalence of glaucoma. Diabetes was associated with higher risk of glaucoma.

40|$|Skeletal muscle plays a {{major role}} in <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism.</b> Active {{hepatocyte}} growth factor (HGF) is present in the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle. However, the effects of HGF on <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> in skeletal muscle are completely unknown. We therefore examined the effects of HGF on deoxyglucose uptake (DOGU), glucose utilization, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in skeletal muscle cells. HGF significantly enhanced DOGU in mouse soleus muscles in vitro. Furthermore, HGF significantly increased: (i) DOGU in a time- and dose-dependent manner; (ii) glucose utilization; and (iii) plasma membrane expression of Glut- 1 and Glut- 4 in the rat skeletal muscle model of L 6 myotubes. HGF-mediated effect on DOGU was dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling pathway. On the other hand, HGF markedly and significantly decreased FAO in L 6 myotubes without affecting the activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II. Collectively, these results indicate that HGF is a potent activator of <b>glucose</b> transport and <b>metabolism</b> and also a strong inhibitor of FAO in rodent myotubes. HGF, through its ability to stimulate <b>glucose</b> transport and <b>metabolism</b> and to impair FAO, may participate in the regulation of glucose disposal in skeletal muscle...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} disease in which {{glycogen}} metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted.

40|$|<b>Glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> {{disorder}} in diabetes mellitus often causes damage to multiple tissues and organs. Diabetes mellitus is beneficially affected by quercetin. However, its concrete mechanisms {{are yet to}} be fully elucidated. In our study, diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by STZ injection. The rats were randomly divided into normal control, diabetic model, low-dose quercetin treatment, high-dose quercetin treatment, and pioglitazone treatment groups. Fasting blood glucose was collected to evaluate diabetes. Immunohistochemistry and fluorometric assay were performed to explore SIRT 1. Akt levels were measured through immunoprecipitation and Western blot. After 12 weeks of quercetin treatment, the biochemical parameters of <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> improved to varying degrees. Hepatic histomorphological injury was alleviated, and hepatic glycogen content was increased. The expression and activity of hepatic SIRT 1 were enhanced, and Akt was activated by phosphorylation and deacetylation. These results suggested that the beneficial effects of quercetin on <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> disorder are probably associated with the upregulated activity and protein level of SIRT 1 and its influence on Akt signaling pathway. Hence, quercetin shows potential {{for the treatment of}} <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> {{disorder in}} diabetes mellitus...|$|R

Methods: The sample consisted of 131  Chinese patients with schizophrenia, including 70  first-episode, drug-naïve patients; 33  patients who had received continuous antipsychotic drug treatment for ≥ 1  year prior to the beginning of the study; and 28  patients who had discontinued antipsychotic drug treatment for ≥ 3  months prior to the beginning of study. We compared the glucose and lipid metabolic parameter levels among the three groups of patients with schizophrenia. All assessments were performed upon hospital admission. Results: The characteristics of <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> disorders in Chinese patients with schizophrenia who are taking antipsychotic drugs included significant augmentation of the body mass index and waist circumference, significantly higher levels of fasting plasma insulin and insulin resistance, and significantly lower plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Antipsychotic discontinuation appeared to not significantly improve any plasma glucose and lipid metabolic parameter levels. Conclusion: The results suggest that antipsychotic drugs aggravate <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> disorders and that antipsychotic discontinuation is generally not associated with improvements in the parameters that indicate <b>glucose</b> and lipid <b>metabolism</b> disorders in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.
