40|$|The {{glycolipid}} {{content of}} human non-seminomatous germ cell tumour cell lines correlates with their differentiation lineage. To analyse whether this reflects {{the situation in}} primary tumours, we studied five <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> five yolk sac tumours and nine (mixed) non-seminomas, using thin-layer chromatography and carbohydrate immunostaining. We also analysed the glycolipid content of 19 seminomas to reveal their relationship with non-seminomas. Lactosylceramide (CDH) was detected in all <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> but in {{fewer than half of}} the seminomas. Seminomas and <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> contained globoseries glycolipids, including globotriosylceramide (Gb 3), globoside (Gb 4), galactosy globoside (Gb 5) and sialy 1 galactosyl globoside (GL 7). The lacto-series glycolipid Le(x) was found in all <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> but only in one seminoma. Gangliosides GD 3 and GT 3 were detected in many seminomas, but rarely in <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Yolk sac tumours displayed a heterogeneous glycolipid profile. Compared with seminomas and pure <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> differentiated non-seminomas had reduced levels of globo-series glycolipids, especially Gb 3 and Gb 5, whereas CDH, Le(x), GD 3 and GT 3 were found in the majority of cases. Thus, the glycolipid content of non-seminoma cell lines reflects the situation in primary tumours. Globo-series glycolipids are similarly expressed in seminomas and <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The expression of Gb 3 and Gb 5 is reduced in non-seminomas upon differentiation. Le(x) expression in non-seminomas, including <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> allows discrimination from seminomas. Expression of gangliosides in seminomas might indicate their maturation from ganglioside-negative precursor cells.

40|$|Testicular {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} cancer in young men. The large majority of patients has a good prognosis, but in {{a small group of}} tumours the current treatments are not effective. Radioiodine is routinely used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and is currently investigated as a potential therapeutic tool even for extra-thyroid tumours able to concentrate this radioisotope. Expression of Na+/I- symporter (NIS), the glycoprotein responsible for iodide transport, has been demonstrated in normal testicular tissue. In this study, we analyzed NIS expression in a large series of testicular carcinomas. Our retrospective series included 107 patients operated for testicular tumours: 98 typical seminomas, 6 <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 1 mixed embryonal-choriocarcinoma and 2 Leydig cells tumours. Expression and regulation of NIS mRNA and protein levels were also investigated in human <b>embryonal</b> testicular <b>carcinoma</b> cells (NTERA) by real time RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed presence of NIS in the large majority of seminomas (90 / 98) and <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (5 / 7) of the testis, but not in Leydig cell carcinomas. Expression of NIS protein was significantly associated to the lymphovascular invasion. In NTERA cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitors SAHA and valproic acid, a significant increase of NIS mRNA (about 60 and 30 fold vs control, p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01 respectively) and protein levels, resulting in enhanced ability to uptake radioiodine, was observed. Finally, NIS expression in testicular tumours with the more aggressive behavior is of interest for the potential use of targeting NIS to deliver radioiodine in malignant cells...|$|R

Dysadherin is a recently described cell membrane glycoprotein, which has an anticell–cell adhesion function and downregulates E-cadherin. In this study, we examined immunohistochemically the expression of E-cadherin and dysadherin in 120 testicular neoplasms (37 seminomas- 26 classic, five spermatocytic and six anaplastic-, 45 <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 10 mixed germ cell tumours, two yolk sac tumours, 10 mature and eight immature teratomas and eight non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas), clinical stage I. The intensity, the expression pattern and the percentage of neoplastic cell staining was recorded and correlated with the histologic type and vascular/lymphatic invasion. Dysadherin was not expressed in non-neoplastic germ cells, neither in CIS/ITGCNU, but it was highly expressed in all types of germ cell tumours, that demonstrated either embryonic phenotype or somatic differentiation, in most terminally differentiated neoplasms, and in all lymphomas. Dysadherin expression did not correlate with vascular invasion. Increased dysadherin expression was correlated with aberrant E-cadherin expression in most tumours. In 17 % of <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> colocalisation of dysadherin and membranous E-cadherin staining was noted. This is the first report on dysadherin expression and its association with E-cadherin in testicular tumours.

40|$|Glypican 3 (GPC 3), a membrane-bound heparin sulfate proteoglycan, {{may play}} a role in {{promoting}} embryonic cell growth and differentiation. GPC 3 is mutated in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, characterized by tissue overgrowth and an increased risk of embryonal malignancies. Recently, GPC 3 was reported to be one of the over-expressed genes in testicular yolk sac tumors by gene expression microarray analysis. However, the presence of the GPC 3 protein in germ cell tumors has never been investigated. The purpose of the study was to investigate the GPC 3 expression in various histologic components of testicular germ cell tumors using immunohistochemistry and to assess its possible utility as a diagnostic marker. Tumors from 71 patients were examined, including components of 42 seminomas, 37 <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 24 yolk sac tumors, 20 teratomas with mature elements, 16 teratomas with immature elements, and 7 choriocarcinomas. Cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively evaluated. All yolk sac tumor (24 / 24) and choriocarcinoma (7 / 7) components were immunoreactive for GPC 3, whereas only 38 % of teratomas with immature elements and 8 % of <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> expressed GPC 3. There was no immunoreactivity in benign testicular tissue, intratubular germ cell neoplasia, seminomas (0 / 42), or teratomas with mature elements (0 / 20). We conclude that the oncofetal protein GPC 3 is a novel immunohistochemical marker in testicular germ cell tumors with differential expression in defined histologic subtypes. Our findings suggest a possible role of GPC 3 in tumor cell differentiation. Furthermore, GPC immunostaining may be useful in the pathologic diagnosis of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, particularly yolk sac tumor, and choriocarcinoma...|$|R

This study was designed to determine whether GGT activity is necessary for the therapeutic effect of the drug. The relationship between GGT expression and clinical response to platinum-based chemotherapy was examined in 41 human germ cell tumours. Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumours were immunohistochemically stained with an antibody directed against human GGT. There was no expression of GGT in any of the 17 seminomas or four dysgerminomas; whereas, 12 / 12 ovarian yolk sac tumours and 4 / 4 <b>embryonal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the testis were GGT-positive. In stage I tumours fewer tumour cells expressed GGT than in later stage tumours. In four germ cell tumours of mixed histology, the seminomatous and dysgerminoma areas were GGT-negative while the areas of the tumour with yolk sac or embryonal histology contained GGT-positive tumour cells. The patients with seminomas or dysgerminomas who were treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, all had a complete response despite the absence of GGT expression in these tumours.
