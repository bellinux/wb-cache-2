40|$|The {{growth of}} the European {{financial}} markets, together with the new, stricter regulations on the US financial markets, has spurred a debate over the competitiveness of the US financial markets. In this paper, we contribute to this debate by investigating the relative competitiveness of the US bond market over the last 10 years. In the early 1990 s, the gross spread in the US bond market were significantly lower than in the <b>Eurobond</b> market. While this spread continued to decline in the US bond market, it declined at an even faster rate in the <b>Eurobond</b> market, {{to the point of}} eliminating the wide cost differential that existed between the two markets in the early 1990 s. These findings are robust and suggest that the relative costs of bond underwriting declined in the <b>Eurobond</b> market. We also find that US firms are increasingly opting to issue their bonds in the <b>Eurobond</b> market, and that this relocation is partly driven by the decline in the relative gross spreads in the <b>Eurobond</b> market. This finding adds support to our conclusion that the cost of bond underwriting declined faster in the <b>Eurobond</b> market, reinforcing the view that the US bond market is facing a greater challenge from the <b>Eurobond</b> market.

The duty is levied at a rate of 0.15% for domestic securities and 0.3% for foreign securities. However, there are numerous exemptions to the Swiss transfer tax.

25|$|China {{joined a}} number of {{international}} economic organizations, becoming {{a member of the}} World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the Multi-Fiber Agreement. China became an observer of GATT in 1982 and formally applied to participate as a full member in July 1986. China also reversed its aversion to foreign capital, borrowing money from international lending organizations, foreign governments, and foreign commercial banks and consortia and permitting foreign banks to open branches in China. The Chinese government maintained a good credit rating internationally and did not pile up huge foreign debts like many other communist and developing countries. Between 1979 and 1985, China signed loans totaling US$20.3 billion, US$15.6 billion of which it already had used. Most loans went into infrastructure projects, such as energy and transportation, and funded raw materials imports. The Bank of China, the principal foreign exchange bank, established branches overseas and participated in international financial markets in <b>Eurobonds</b> and loan syndication.|$|E

However, he continued to serve as a political advisor to Prince Bandar bin Sultan in 1983. He was implanted as the Saudis' strong man following the collapse of the PLO and the paucity of any viable Sunni leadership in the country as well {{as a response to the}} rising power of the Shiite militia Amal. As a former Saudi diplomatic representative, he played a significant role in constructing the 1990 Taif Agreement that ended Lebanon's sixteen-year civil war. In 1992, Hariri became the first post-civil war prime minister of Lebanon under president Elias Hrawi. Hariri put the country back on the financial map through the issuing of <b>Eurobonds</b> and won plaudits from the World Bank for his plan to borrow reconstruction money as the country's debt grew to become the largest per capita in the world. His first premiership lasted until 1998, and Hariri was replaced by Salim Hoss as prime minister. In fact, as a result of the power struggle between Hariri and newly elected president Émile Lahoud, he left office.|$|E

500|$|On 20 October 2011, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research {{published}} an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which could provide governments with fixed interest rate <b>Eurobonds</b> at a rate slightly below medium-term economic growth (in nominal terms). These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time. Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB, [...] "the EMU would achieve a similarly strong position vis-à-vis financial investors as the US where the Fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent". To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would operate according to strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria.|$|E

While Jacob Funk Kirkegaard believes that the European Union will do "whatever it takes" to save the euro and the eurozone, he argues that powerful political constraints prevent EU leaders from making optimal decisions. Europe can get through the current crisis by producing a compromise among member states {{in the form of}} a permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM) with an option to issue a conditional <b>Eurobond,</b> which would aid eurozone members suffering asymmetric economic shocks in return for taking domestic reforms to return to a sustainable fiscal path.

But implementation might be deficient or lack credibility, and could lead to disputes and carry a significant political risk. Introduction of a <b>Eurobond</b> covering up to 60 percent of member states' GDP would bring about much greater levels of fiscal discipline than any other proposal, would create an attractive <b>Eurobond</b> market, and would deliver a strong message about the irreversible nature of European integration. federalism; redistribution; stabilisation; risk-sharing; crisis; euro-area governance reform; <b>Eurobond...</b>|$|R
