500|$|After the vote, NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern said [...] "if there's {{not a new}} building...I think it's {{certain that}} the team will be relocated." [...] The Houston Sports Authority had not planned {{to meet with the}} Rockets until after the [...] NBA season ended, but after the Rockets began to talk to other cities about relocation, they resumed talks in February 2000. Although the Rockets continued to negotiate with Louisville, Kentucky, a funding plan for the arena in Houston was released in June. A final agreement was proposed on July 6, and both the Rockets and mayor Brown agreed to the terms. After the city council approved the deal, the proposal was placed on the November referendum ballot. Leading up to the vote, the Rockets stressed that there would be [...] "no new taxes of any kind", although opponents said the new arena would raise energy consumption, and also contended that the public would pay for too much of the costs of the arena. Contributions for the campaign for the arena included donations of US$400,000 from Reliant Energy, and a total of $590,000 in loans and contributions from Enron and <b>Ken</b> <b>Lay,</b> who the Rockets said was a [...] "tireless" [...] force in the campaign.

50|$|In 2003 Wyatt {{and other}} {{shareholders}} sued the El Paso Corporation for allegedly misrepresenting its intentions for Coastal assets {{prior to the}} merger in 2000. After the merger of Coastal and El Paso Corporation, the latter began divesting itself of Coastal assets beginning in 2001. El Paso needed the cash to repay mounting debt it had acquired from following much the same business model as <b>Ken</b> <b>Lay's</b> Enron. El Paso had heavily leveraged itself to fuel sales into new markets for electricity and concealed mounting debt from its balance sheet by writing off the debt to offshore subsidiary companies. In June 2003 Wyatt, with El Paso investor Selim Zilkha, initiated a proxy fight {{to gain control of}} the El Paso Corporation to wrestle control of the remaining assets including natural gas pipelines, exploration, and production assets. Since the merger and disclosure of corporate malfeasance by El Paso management, its stock had fallen 87% from its February 2001 high of $75 a share. El Paso owed $25 billion in debt and was being sued by shareholders and investigated by state and federal regulators.|$|R

40|$|Many {{people would}} doubt <b>Ken</b> <b>Lay’s</b> sincerity as he claimed, during a 2004 {{interview}} on CNN, {{that what he}} valued most about himself was his integrity. Many people, that is, except Lay himself, who likely felt wholeheartedly sincere when he said so. Humans have a deep-seated need to see themselves {{in a positive light}} (Greenwald, 1980), a need that is particularly acute in the moral domain (Blasi, 1984). Nearly everyone believes strongly that they are moral and holds the view that their actions are appropriate, honorable, and fair (Allison, Messick, & Goethals, 1989; Messick, Bloom, Boldizar, & Samuelson, 1985; Van Lange & Sedikides, 1998). In other words, we are the heroes of our own narratives. However, this common belief sits uncomfortably with {{the fact that most of}} us behave, with distressing frequency, in ways that are inappropriate, dishonorable, and unfair (Ariely, 2012; Callahan, 2004; Gabor, 1994). We resolve this common contradiction – that we often in fact behave in ways that we like to think we don’t – through self-deception, “the active misrepresentation of reality to the conscious mind” (Trivers, 2000, p. 114). This chapter is about the way in which self-deception supports our ability to think of ourselves as the hero of our own narratives, when in fact we have been anything but...|$|R
50|$|Two bandits (unrelated {{to those}} found earlier in the comic) find <b>Ken</b> <b>laying</b> {{motionless}} in middle of a small wood outside town. Believing him to be dead, they attempt to steal from him, but soon find that he is quite alive and eager to fight despite their attempts to leave peacefully. The noise alerts Yori who comes {{to the aid of}} the clearly outmatched bandits. Yorikiro accidentally reveals his clan name, Wataro. Ken explains that his own clan had been wiped out by Yorikiro's and he intends to get revenge. The bandits are able to run away in the confusion, leaving Yori to face Ken alone. (The resulting fight {{is one of the first}} obvious parodies of Rurouni Kenshin). As the fight continues, Yorikiro's sword is broken a second time. He is then slammed against a tree and loses consciousness. When Yori recovers, he mentions that his former trainer Genchu would not wish to see him lose here. Ken is shocked to hear that Yori had known Genchu, a man who had saved him from the destruction that met the rest of his clan. In the process, Genchu had fought General Nataku, the man leading the invasion, and had cut off his pinky finger. Yori explains that he hopes to redeem his clan. Ken decides to join Yorikiro in hopes of obtaining his revenge specifically on General Nataku.|$|R
