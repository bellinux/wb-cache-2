Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> gets that, but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the acquittal, {{the broader}} public {{perception}} was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself. The Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who {{was critical of}} Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of unhappiness [...] about the result at the Old Bailey. [...] As far as most people are concerned, the trial ended with a big question mark over the case". Prevented by his party from a return to active politics, in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had never doubted the outcome. Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: [...] "If it happened now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it... It offended their set of values." [...] Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Santos had {{the lead}} role in Kahit Isang Saglit. She portrayed Annie, a budding {{architect}} romantically torn between two best friends (played by Piolo Pascual and Leandro Munoz). The film received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Santos and Pascual. Santos next appearance with Pascual was in the 2001 television series Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka as Patricia Montecillo, an illegitimate daughter in a constant struggle for acceptance and independence, dealing with an alcoholic abusive stepfather. Dez Lucero from Chic commended Santos' breakthrough and innovative portrayal, [...] "Patricia [...] here is a fighter who stands up to anyone bent on demolishing her [...] she is a survivor, she is sarcastic, she is street smart, she is strong." [...] Asked what she hoped to accomplish in the drama series, Santos stated, [...] "After seeing me cry for years, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> now wants me to make them laugh." [...] In the same year, Santos released her second album Bida Ng Buhay Ko. Singles from the album included [...] "Hello Goodbye", [...] "This Song's Dedicated To You", and [...] "Stop! Before You Break My Heart". The album was met with negative reviews. David Gonzales of AllMusic.com gave the album {{one out of five}} stars, stating, [...] "Santos is a popular young film actress, and this must be the reason why she has a recording contract. It isn't because of her singing, which ranges from bad to terrible. She sings in a low, whispery voice and hits many off-key notes throughout the album, which makes a listener cringe. Her voice is often difficult to hear above the backing instrumentation, but at least this spares a listener from more misery." [...] The album achieved moderate success, eventually certified platinum.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} {{excitement}} of the presidential impeachment, our houses instantly went down. After carefully considering the subject, I decided {{to take advantage of}} the fact that next week's four readings here have not yet been announced, and to abolish them altogether. Nothing in this country lasts long, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> may be heartily tired of the President's name by the 9th of March, when I read at a considerable distance from here. So behold me with a whole week's holiday in view! The Boston audiences have come to regard the readings and the reader as their peculiar property; and you would be at once amused and pleased if you could see the curious way in which they seem to plume themselves on both. They have taken to applauding too whenever they laugh or cry, and the result is very inspiriting. I shall remain here until Saturday, the 7th, but shall not read here, after to-morrow night, until the 1st of April, when I begin my Boston farewells, six in number.|$|E
6000|$|The {{arguments}} against Proportional Representation {{that have been}} advanced hitherto are trivial in comparison with its enormous advantages. Implicit in them all is the supposition that public opinion is at bottom a foolish thing, and that electoral methods are to pacify rather than express a people. It is possibly true that notorious windbags, conspicuously advertised adventurers, and the heroes of temporary sensations may run a considerable chance upon the lists. My own estimate of the popular wisdom is against the idea that any vividly prominent figure must needs get in; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> is capable of appreciating, let us say, the charm and interest of Mr. Sandow or Mr. Jack Johnson or Mr. Harry Lauder or Mr. Evan Roberts without wanting to send these gentlemen into Parliament. And I think that the increased power that the Press would have through its facilities in making reputations may also be exaggerated. Reputations are mysterious things and not so easily forced, {{and even if it}} were possible for a section of the Press to limelight a dozen or so figures up to the legislature, they would still have, I think, to be interesting, sympathetic and individualised figures; and at the end they would be only half a dozen among four hundred men of a repute more naturally achieved. A third objection is that this reform would give us group politics and unstable government. It might very possibly give us unstable ministries, but unstable ministries may mean stable government, and such stable ministries as that which governs England at the present time may, by clinging obstinately to office, mean the wildest fluctuations of policy. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald has drawn a picture of the too-representative Parliament of Proportional Representation, split up into groups each pledged to specific measures and making the most extraordinary treaties and sacrifices of the public interest in order to secure the passing of these definite bills. But Mr. Ramsay Macdonald is exclusively a parliamentary man; he knows contemporary parliamentary [...] "shop" [...] as a clerk knows his [...] "guv'nor," [...] and he thinks in the terms of his habitual life; he sees representatives only as politicians financed from party headquarters; it is natural that he should fail to see that the quality and condition of the sanely elected Member of Parliament will be quite different from these scheming climbers into positions of trust with whom he deals to-day. It is the party system based on insane voting that makes governments indivisible wholes and gives the group and the cave their terrors and their effectiveness. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald is as typical a product of existing electoral methods as one could well have, and his peculiarly keen sense of the power of intrigue in legislation is as good evidence as one could wish for of the need for drastic change.|$|E
