A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>conveyor</b> to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E

With these forks the load can be taken from one <b>horizontal</b> <b>conveyor</b> and put down on another <b>horizontal</b> <b>conveyor</b> on a different level.

40|$|Belt {{conveying}} systems {{operating with}} steel cord conveyor belts are used {{extensively in the}} mining and minerals processing industries to transport bulk material. An accurate analysis of the belt tension distribution {{along the length of}} the system is essential to ensure reliable and efficient operation. An important consideration in the tension analysis is the evaluation of the motion resistances of the system. The motion resistances that occur {{along the length of the}} conveyor are known as the main resistances and, for a <b>horizontal</b> <b>conveyor</b> include the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotational resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. Generally, the indentation rolling resistance component is the major contributor to the motion resistance of long horizontal belt conveyors. This paper will discuss the development of a pseudo 3 -dimensional viscoelastic finite element analysis to calculate the indentation rolling resistance of steel cord conveyor belts. A unique aspect of this model is the ability to incorporate into the viscoelastic rolling contact problem the influence of the steel cords and the variable rubber properties throughout the thickness of the belt. These parameters play a significant role in determining the contact pressure distribution at the belt and idler roll interface and the apparent bottom cover thickness, and therefore the indentation rolling resistance...|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} 50 years, {{the flow of}} a {{granular}} material through an aperture has been intensely studied in gravity-driven vertical systems (e. g. silos and hoppers). Nevertheless, in many industrial applications, grains are horizontally transported at constant velocity, lying on conveyor belts or floating {{on the surface of}} flowing liquids. Unlike fluid flows, that are controlled by the pressure, granular flow is not sensitive to the local pressure but rather to the local velocity of the grains at the outlet. We can also expect the flow rate to depend on the local density of the grains. Indeed, vertical systems are packed in dense configurations by gravity but, in contrast, in horizontal systems the density can take a large range of values, potentially very small, which may significantly alter the flow rate. In the present article, we study, for different initial packing fractions, the discharge through an orifice of monodisperse grains driven at constant velocity by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. We report how, during the discharge, the packing fraction is modified by the presence of the outlet and we analyze how changes in the packing fraction induce variations in the flow rate. We observe that variations of packing fraction do not affect the velocity of the grains at the outlet and, therefore, we establish that flow-rate variations are directly related to changes in the packing fraction...|$|E
40|$|The Janssen {{effect is}} a unique {{property}} of confined granular materials experiencing gravitational compaction in which the pressure at the bottom saturates with increasing filling height due to frictional interactions with side walls. In this paper we replace gravitational compaction with frictional compaction. We study friction-compacted 2 D granular materials confined within fixed boundaries on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. We find that even with high friction side walls the Janssen effect completely vanishes. Our results demonstrate that gravity-compacted granular systems are inherently different from friction-compacted systems {{in at least one}} important way: vibrations induced by sliding friction with the driving surface relax away tangential forces on the walls. Remarkably, we find that the Janssen effect can be recovered by replacing the straight side walls with a sawtooth pattern. The mechanical force introduced by varying the sawtooth angle θ can be viewed as equivalent to a tunable friction force. By construction, this mechanical friction force cannot be relaxed away by vibrations in the system. This work is described in Chapter 2 and has been published in Physical Review Letters. We experimentally study quasi- 2 d dilute granular flow around intruders whose shape, size and relative impact speed are systematically varied. Direct measurement of the flow field reveals that three in-principle independent measurements of the non-uniformity of the flow field are in fact all linearly related: 1) granular temperature, 2) flow field divergence and 3) shear-strain rate. The shock front is defined as the local maxima in each of these measurements. The shape of the shock front is well described by an inverted catenary and is driven by the formation of a dynamic arch during steady flow. We find universality in the functional form of the shock front within the range of experimental values probed. Changing the intruder size, concavity and impact speed only results in a scaling and shifting of the shock front. We independently measure the horizontal lift force on the intruder and find that it can be understood {{as a result of the}} interplay between the shock profile and the intruder shape.

The results revealed that for both the conveyors tested, with increasing the screw rotational speed, the conveyor capacity increased and reached to a maximum point and after the point, the volumetric capacity decreased. Increasing the screw speed caused the volumetric efficiency and power requirements of the conveyors to be decreased and increased, respectively.

40|$|Mining {{and mineral}} {{processing}} industries {{throughout the world}} rely on the efficient transportation of bulk solid. Belt conveyors {{have been used for}} the transportation of bulk solid over relatively short distances for many years, but with significant developments in analytical procedures to describe the dynamic properties of belt conveying systems, the utilisation of belt conveyors for long distance overiand transportation is becoming more economically viable. Belt conveyor installations are becoming progressively longer and belt speeds significantly faster, and as these trends continue it becomes increasingly important that the motion resistances associated with the operation of belt conveyors be minimised for optimum performance and efficiency. In the energy conscious world in which we live, no longer is it acceptable for a belt conveyor to simply transport bulk solid from one point to another, the operation must be economically viable, environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The energy consumed in raising bulk solid from one level to another is typically a parameter that cannot be easily changed, and is usually determined by plant constraints or the terrain over which the conveyor is travelling. As a result the primary area of focus in order to minimise power consumption is the resistances associated with the motion of the belt conveyor. The energy consumed during the operation of a long <b>horizontal</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> is primarily due to the frictional resistance that occurs {{along the length of the}} conveyor. This resistance is known as the main resistance and includes the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotating resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. This paper will discuss each component of the main resistance and provide details of methods to calculate the contribution of each component. A finite difference solution that applies orthotropic plate mechanics is described to calculate the deflection of the conveyor belt due to the loading induced from the weight of the belt and bulk solid, and the loading induced from the relative movement of the bulk solid. Given the displacement of the belt and bulk solid the flexure resistance of each component can then be calculated. The rotating resistance of the idler rolls is briefly discussed and an apparatus to measure the resistance is presented. A finite element model is then discussed which calculates the indentation rolling resistance occurring at each idler set from the viscoelastic properties of the bottom cover of the conveyor belt...|$|R
