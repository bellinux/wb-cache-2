5|$|Often, Underwood's {{thoughts}} {{throughout the}} series {{are presented in}} a <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards, Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's Richard III as Richard III of England, a character {{that serves as a}} partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing video games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.|$|E
5|$|Underwood is from Gaffney, South Carolina. He {{graduated}} from The Sentinel (a fictionalized version of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina) in 1981 and, subsequently, Harvard Law School in 1984. Some of Underwood's dialogue throughout {{the series is}} presented in a <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall. The character speaks with a Southern accent. During season 1, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives. In season 2, he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States, before becoming President of the United States in the season finale.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Abbey was the {{dominant}} influence in theatre in Ireland across the 20th century. Beckett's example {{has been almost}} entirely ignored, although his plays are regularly performed on the Irish stage. Behan, in his use of song and <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> to the audience, was influenced by Bertolt Brecht and Denis Johnston used modernist techniques including found texts and collage, but their works had little impact on the dramatists who came after them. In the 1970s and 1980s, {{a number of companies}} emerged to challenge the Abbey's dominance and introduce different styles and approaches. These included Focus Theatre, The Passion Machine, The Children's T Company, the Project Theatre Company, Red Kettle, Druid Theatre, TEAM and Field Day. These companies nurtured a number of writers, actors, and directors who went on to be successful in London, Broadway and Hollywood or in other literary fields. These include Enda Walsh, Joe O Byrne, Peter Sheridan, Brian Friel, Stephen Rea, Garry Hynes, Martin McDonagh, Conor McPherson, Marina Carr, Jimmy Murphy, Billy Roche and Gabriel Byrne. In 1974 Siamsa Tíre, the National Folk Theatre of Ireland, was founded in Tralee, County Kerry, by Pat Ahern.|$|E

500|$|The Make-Up's gospel {{attitude}} {{was related to}} utilization of the audience as a group member, which Svenonius likened {{to the rise of}} the 90s dance music scene: [...] "We're not interested in countering it. It makes sense to me that techno, rave and dance music should go over in the face of rock and roll because it's democratic for everybody to express themselves. [...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy. [...] We want to be at once entertaining and inclusive in terms of using the gospel form to sort of breathe life into the old Frankenstein monster". [...] Svenonius would often interact with the audience in a number of ways, including call and response lyrics, <b>direct</b> <b>address,</b> and leaving the stage and going out into the crowd.|$|E
500|$|Because Méliès {{does not}} use a modern {{cinematic}} vocabulary, some film scholars have created other frameworks of thought with which to assess his films. For example, some recent academicians, while not necessarily denying Méliès's influence on film, have argued that his works are better understood as spectacular theatrical creations rooted in the 19th-century stage tradition of the féerie. Similarly, Tom Gunning has argued that to fault Méliès for not inventing a more intimate and cinematic storytelling style is to misunderstand the purpose of his films; in Gunning's view, {{the first decade of}} film history may be considered a [...] "cinema of attractions," [...] in which filmmakers experimented with a presentational style based on spectacle and <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> rather than on intricate editing. Though the attraction style of filmmaking declined in popularity in favor of a more integrated [...] "story film" [...] approach, it remains an important component of certain types of cinema, including science fiction films, musicals, and avant-garde films.|$|E

The -us becomes an -e in the vocative singular. If it ends in -ius (such as fīlius), the ending is just -ī (filī), as distinct from the nominative plural (filiī) in the vocative singular: [...] "Master!" [...] shouted the slave. [...] "Domine!"

2500|$|The pronouns tu (informal) and você (more formal) fit the T–V pattern nicely, {{except that}} their use varies {{a great deal}} from region to region.

2500|$|In Sonnet 1, {{we begin}} to see the [...] "love story" [...] between the fair youth (beloved) and the speaker (lover) unfold, though not the typical [...] "love story" [...] of the Elizabethan era if read this way. However, each of Shakespeare's sonnets can still be read as {{separate}} from the other sonnets. In this sonnet, the speaker engages in an argument with the beloved/fair youth about procreation: [...] "An agon, a dramatic struggle, develops between the speaker and the youth". Scholar Helen Vendler sums up Sonnet 1: [...] "The different rhetorical moments of this sonnet (generalizing reflection, reproach, injunction, prophecy) are permeable to one another's metaphors, so that the rose of philosophical reflection yields the bud of <b>direct</b> <b>address,</b> and the famine of address yields the glutton who, in epigram, eats the world's due".|$|E

The author {{begins with a}} declaration {{that he will be}} [...] "obsequious" [...] and dutiful to the [...] "Youth". The speaker then asks the [...] "Fair Youth" [...] to accept his [...] "oblation" [...] or offer, which is free of both monetary obligations and underhanded motivations. Line 11 highlights that the promise is [...] "without seconds", or consisting of pure intentions.

2500|$|Victor I. Scherb, {{taking the}} processional staging as read, builds from it an {{interpretation}} that sees the {{play as a}} theatrical triptych that uses framing devices which serve to draw the audience's focus on the central scene, that of Saul's conversion. This station is framed spatially {{not only by the}} procession, but also in terms of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", thanks to scenes involving God, devils and ostlers. Indeed, the ostler with ideas above his station being seen thrown in dung is taken as a reflection of Saul's own pride, for which he is cast down on the road to Damascus. The purpose of these devices is to provide the audience – turned, thanks to the amount of <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> in the play, into a congregation – with a spiritual model of the turning away from worldliness.|$|E

2500|$|The Proslogion ( [...] , [...] "Discourse"), {{originally}} entitled Faith Seeking Understanding (...) {{and then}} An Address on God's Existence (...) , was written {{over the next}} two years (1077–1078). It is written in the form of an extended <b>direct</b> <b>address</b> to God. It grew out of his dissatisfaction with the Monologion's interlinking and contingent arguments. His [...] "single argument that needed nothing but itself alone for proof, that would by itself be enough to show that God really exists" [...] is commonly taken to be merely the second chapter of the work. In it, Anselm reasoned that even atheists can imagine a greatest being, having such attributes that nothing greater could exist (...) [...] However, if such a being's attributes did not include existence, a still greater being could be imagined: one with all of the attributes of the first and existence. Therefore, the truly greatest possible being must necessarily exist. Further, this necessarily-existing greatest being must be God, who therefore necessarily exists. This reasoning was known to the Scholastics as [...] "Anselm's argument" [...] (...) but it became known as the ontological argument for the existence of God following Kant's treatment of it.|$|E
