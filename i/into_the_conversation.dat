500|$|Two {{people on}} the {{aircraft}} made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six persons, and staff and passengers had been moved {{to the rear of}} the airplane. May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking. Between 09:16 and 09:26, passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the airplane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. She reported that the passengers, including the pilots, had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call. A minute <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> the call was cut off. Theodore Olson contacted the command center at the Department of Justice, and tried unsuccessfully to contact Attorney General John Ashcroft. About five minutes later, Barbara Olson called again, told her husband that the [...] "pilot" [...] (possibly Hanjour on the cabin intercom) had announced the flight was hijacked, and asked, [...] "What do I tell the pilot to do?" [...] Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying low over a residential area. He told her of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Soon afterward, the call cut off again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of aristocratic {{organizations and the}} council of elders is evidence of an oligarchic tendency in Ashanti political life. Though older men tend to monopolize political power, Ashanti instituted an organization of young men, the [...] nmerante, that tend to democratize and liberalize the political process. The council of elders undertake actions only after consulting {{a representative of the}} nmerante. Their views must be taken seriously and added <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E

50|$|As a {{text that}} blurs {{the lines between}} memoir, fiction, and autobiography, Conversations enacts {{numerous}} textual aspirations. It is at once a portrait of an Indian ingenue and autodidact making his way, problematically, at times, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inner circle of the Bloomsbury group; a biographical snapshot of the group’s venerated literary figures; {{and the ways in}} which Anand attempts to assert himself, and by extension, India and Indian culture, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> surrounding empire and colonialism in the progressive circle of the Bloomsbury group.|$|R
2500|$|In The Book of the City of Ladies Christine {{created a}} {{symbolic}} {{city in which}} women are appreciated and defended. She constructed three allegorical figures – Reason, Justice, and Rectitude – in the common pattern of literature in that era, when many books and poetry utilized stock allegorical figures to express ideas or emotions. She enters into a dialogue, a movement between question and answer, with these allegorical figures that is from a completely female perspective. [...] Together, they create a forum to speak on issues of consequence to all women. Only female voices, examples and opinions provide evidence within this text. Christine, through Lady Reason in particular, argues that stereotypes of women can be sustained only if women are prevented from entering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Overall, she hoped to establish truths about women that contradicted the negative stereotypes that she had identified in previous literature.|$|E

50|$|The app {{refers to}} live public text conversations as Tawks. These are {{one-on-one}} conversations between two hosts, which are completely public {{from the outset}} of <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Each Tawk discussion has a comments section that allows anyone {{to comment on the}} discussion between the users. There is a mechanism, which allows for the hosts to call out an audience comment by using a feature called Spotlight, threading it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> host <b>conversation.</b> Each Tawk is typically on a specific topic, issue or cause.|$|R
5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|R
