500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E

In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: [...] "It was the best [...] ever, it was some rock star [...] This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> started crying so hard. I finally just got to my bed from the IV [...] and I was just like, 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished [...] at 5pm the day before..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kelis, she {{received}} no support from Jive Records for Kelis Was Here, and the label dropped her in late 2007. Her {{manager at the}} time said that the singer was working with Cee-Lo Green on an alternative dance album and would be shopping a pop album produced by songwriter Guy Chambers, who co-wrote hits such as Robbie Williams's [...] "Angels". Scottish electronica producer Calvin Harris was also said to be collaborating with her. Kelis later said of this period, [...] "I was like, 'I will never put out another record again, I hate this business, I hate all these people.' I was in this race that I didn't even realise that I was in. <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ten years had passed. That was never my plan". She subsequently took a hiatus from music.|$|E
5000|$|Nonviolence, as Awwad sees it, {{transforms}} {{those who}} embody its way of life: “I think nonviolence is {{the celebration of}} my existence. <b>I</b> used to <b>wake</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish that I was not born. Today <b>I</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> celebrate this.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Jankūnas {{made his}} pro debut with the Žalgiris in the 2003–04 season. When asked about playing with European {{basketball}} legend Arvydas Sabonis in his rookie season, Jankūnas responded: [...] "No doubt {{it was the}} most remarkable season. It was fantastic to play with Arvydas Sabonis. I was very young and it was very exciting. In the beginning, I was little bit afraid and uncomfortable, but later things got easy and I learned a lot from him. When I was a kid, I used to watch him playing on TV and never dared to dream that I would be playing with Arvydas Sabonis. One day <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> Sabonis was my teammate. It was great. He had huge experience and gave a lot of advice to me. It was big honor to play with him and I hope I learned something from Sabonis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Growing up, Cho recounted {{that life}} was financially {{difficult}} as an undocumented immigrant, stating, [...] "My parents left for work before <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> came back home after I went to sleep. We had financial difficulties and {{there were times when}} we had no water or electricity for a few days because we weren't able to pay the bills. Other daily activities that others take for granted such as having a drivers’ license was difficult for my father". [...] Due to a display of skill in speed skating, his parents sold their business and spent their savings to move to Salt Lake City to train Cho for the sport after he graduated from junior high school. Simon Cho now resides in Rockville, Maryland and when he is not coaching, he enjoys watching sports, documentaries and attending concerts.|$|E
2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks {{on how long}} she intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, [...] "If I [...] 25, and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too." [...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{as no one}} was in sight, {{wondered}} whether or no I had been dreaming. The upshot of it was that I made up my mind to send Footsack to Pretoria for the oxen, not to go myself.|$|E
