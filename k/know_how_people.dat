Though there are several athletes in her family, she is not {{particularly}} fond of sports. [...] "I was on a football team when I was in third grade. But I {{was so bad that}} I wasn't allowed to play in a match", she recalled. She has stated on several occasions that she wants to continue acting, and has indicated that she would like to try different types of roles to challenge herself. Leandersson was a student at Gruvrisskolan. In an interview, she identified history as her favorite subject, because she finds it [...] "interesting to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> lived and died in the past". She does not see school as a hindrance to continue acting, saying that she [...] "will just have to work harder than everyone else. But school isn't that difficult, it's quite easy." [...] She is a fan of the Twilight film series. In 2011-2014 years she is studying theatre at [...] ,a school for performing arts in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E
500|$|Achieving Darla's {{look was}} a {{struggle}} for Benz. She said: [...] "Taking that makeup off, {{it was like having}} six layers of skin ripped off your face every time. It was miserable and the contact lenses were terrible. I don’t wear contacts and I don’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> do it, sticking things in their eyeballs all the time." [...] The character's sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past. Benz says Darla is [...] "dressed to the nines" [...] in every time period in which she lives, and [...] "she fully goes after a certain look. If she’s going to be living during the Boxer Rebellion time, she’s got the big Gibson Girl hair style and the beautiful kimono-style clothes." [...] Benz points out that in the Buffy pilot episode, Darla—attempting to dress like a high school student—exaggerates it with a [...] "little twist", wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform instead. [...] "I think I influenced Darla fashion-wise in the second season of Angel where she was a little more classic-looking and tailored," [...] Benz says, explaining she collaborated with the costume designer to transition Darla into a [...] "hipper look" [...] when she became a vampire again. Darla shockingly becomes pregnant in the third season of Angel. In an interview with the BBC, Benz admitted: ...|$|E

[...] Bixler-Zavala has also spoken of the album as [...] "acoustic" [...] and [...] "mellow," [...] yet stated: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> can be so linear in their way of thinking, so when they hear the new album, they're going to say, 'This is not an acoustic album! There's electricity throughout it!' But it's our version. That's what our band does -- celebrate mutations. It's our version of what we consider an acoustic album." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Marti, the {{intention}} behind {{the publication of}} [...] "La edad de oro" [...] was [...] "so that American children may <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> used to live, and how they live nowadays, in America and in other countries; how many things are made, such as glass and iron, steam engines and suspension bridges and electric light; so that when a child sees a coloured stone he will know why the stone is coloured....We shall tell them about everything which is done in factories, where things happen which are stranger and {{more interesting than the}} magic in fairy stories. These things are real magic, more marvelous than any....We write for children because it is they who know how to love, because it is children who are the hope for the world".|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{animation}} process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving {{as models for}} the animators in which Walt Disney insisted on because he wanted the characters to appear [...] "as real as possible, near flesh-and-blood." [...] However, Milt Kahl objected to this method, calling it [...] "a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort. Anyone worth his salt in this business ought to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> move." [...] Helene Stanley was the live action reference for Princess Aurora. The only known surviving footage of Stanley as Aurora's live-action reference is a clip from the television program Disneyland, which consists of the artists sketching her dancing with the woodland animals. Stanley previously provided live-action references for Cinderella and later for Anita from 101 Dalmatians, and portrayed Polly Crockett for the TV series Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} written for Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor. [...] An early working {{title for the}} episode was [...] "Return to Sarn", however, this {{was intended to be}} misleading. [...] While briefing Harness on how to write the script, executive producer Steven Moffat told him to [...] "Hinchcliffe [...] the shit out of it for the first half", meaning, essentially, to make it frightening. [...] This was in reference to Philip Hinchcliffe, who produced Doctor Who from 1974–77, a period known as especially frightening during the classic series. [...] Moffat called the script [...] "intense and emotional". [...] Harness has said that the episode will see a large change for the show. [...] "I still don’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> will take it. [...] I’m in this kind of limbo now waiting for people to see it, and I’ve no idea, really I do not know how it is going to go down." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 John and Edward {{formed a}} duo and the {{following}} year they auditioned in Glasgow as a group for the sixth series of The X Factor, under the name John & Edward. Despite being described by judge Simon Cowell as [...] "not very good and incredibly annoying", John & Edward were put through to bootcamp, then made it to judges' houses, where Louis Walsh selected them for the live shows. The twins' inclusion in the final 12 was a controversial decision, due to their lack of experience, but Walsh stood by them, saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> can hate two nice young kids from Ireland. They've been edited really badly and come across as the people everyone loves to hate... but they're just raw, naïve and innocent {{and they have the}} potential to be really good." [...] John & Edward became known for their unpolished but enthusiastic performances, famously including a version of Britney Spears' [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", during which they reenacted the Titanic monologue. After their departure from The X Factor, Jedward were signed to Modest! Management, however it was later announced that Louis Walsh had reached [...] "an amicable agreement", which allowed him to take the twins on.|$|E

It kind of shows us that we do care” (Y- 3).

His heart was very tender, and he answered most of their questions with unusual spirit, fending off, however, any reference to old sweethearts. His talk was all of absorbing interest to the women.

It was so sweet and fine {{to be able to}} return to the East--and Mrs. Reynolds hoped to do so before she died. Cora drew from Mose the information that the lawns were beautifully green in Marmion, and that all kinds of flowers were in blossom, and that the birds were singing in the maples.

60|$|As if she {{had done}} now all that sympathy demanded for Cornelia, the janitress went about some work {{in another part of}} the room and left the girl to herself. But Cornelia knew that she was keeping a {{friendly}} eye on her, and in the shelter of her presence, she tried to gather courage to make that start into the street alone, which she must finally make and which she was so foolish to keep postponing. She had written to the landlady of her boarding house that she should arrive on such a day, at such an hour; and here was the day, and she was letting the hour go by, and very likely the landlady would give her room to some one else. Or, if the expressman who took her check on the train, should get there with her trunk first, the landlady might refuse to take it. Cornelia did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> acted about such things in New York. She ought to go, and she tried to rise; but she was morally so unable that it was as if she were physically unable.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Melmotte was {{attended}} both by Lord Alfred and his son. He {{was standing in}} front of the chair which had been arranged for the Emperor, with his hat on one side of his head, and he was very angry indeed. He had been given to understand when the dinner was first planned, that he was to sit opposite to his august guest;--by which he had conceived that he was to have a seat immediately in face of the Emperor of Emperors, of the Brother of the Sun, of the Celestial One himself. It was now explained to him that this could not be done. In face of the Emperor there must be a wide space, so that his Majesty might be able to look down the hall; and the royal princesses who sat next to the Emperor, and the royal princes who sat next to the princesses, must also be so indulged. And in this way Mr Melmotte's own seat became really quite obscure. Lord Alfred was having a very bad time of it. 'It's that fellow from [...] "The Herald" [...] office did it, not me,' he said, almost in a passion. 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> ought to sit. But that's the reason.' ...|$|E

If Kent's silly son takes his wife from the streets what is that to me? If Adrian Singleton writes his friend's name across a bill, am I his keeper? I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> chatter in England.
