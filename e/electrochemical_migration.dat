Oxygen bulk diffusion and surface exchange processes are critical for catalytic action, and numerous studies of manganites have linked electroresistance to <b>electrochemical</b> oxygen <b>migration.</b> Direct imaging of individual oxygen defects is needed to underpin understanding of these important processes. It is not currently possible to collect the required images in the bulk, but scanning tunnelling microscopy could provide such data for surfaces.

Our experiments also reveal defect dynamics, including oxygen adatom migration, vacancy-adatom recombination and adatom bistability.

In this paper, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> tests on Sn-Pb and lead free solder alloys were conducted under distilled water by applying constant voltages with a power supply. The susceptibility of the solder alloys to ECM {{and the effect of}} the composition on ECM behavior were Studied. It is found that both Sn-Pb and lead free solders investigated in present research have susceptibility on ECM. Dendrites grow from cathode to anode and show different morphologies with the different migration elements involved. In Sn- 37 Pb and Sn- 36 Pb- 2 Ag solders, the main migration element is Pb. While for Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys, Sri leads the migration. For Sn- 8 Zn- 3 Bi, both Sri and Zn can migrate.

40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{are known}} to be susceptible to cracking when subjected to excessive printed circuit board (PCB) flexure, which is called "flex cracking". The bending of the printed circuit board causes stresses to be transmitted through the solder fillets to the surface mount capacitors. These stresses are the highest {{at the bottom of the}} capacitor, where the termination bands end. In order to reduce the amount of stress that is transmitted to the brittle ceramic body of MLCCs through end terminations, a flexible termination system which incorporates a silver-loaded epoxy in end-terminations was developed by some MLCC manufacturers. With the transition to lead-free materials in the electronics industry there is a concern that MLCCs assembled on PCBs with lead-free solder have different susceptibility to flex cracking than those assembled with eutectic tin-lead solder. In this study, the flex cracking of MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder (Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu) was compared with those assembled with eutectic tin-lead (Sn 37 Pb) solder and differences in the results were explained in terms of solder mechanical properties and solder solidification temperature. Tin-silver-copper lead-free solders and eutectic tin-lead solder have different mechanical properties, which affect the stresses that are transmitted to the ceramic body of the capacitor through the solder fillet. The higher solidification temperature for lead-free solder leads to increased residual compressive stresses after the reflow cool-down process for MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder compared with those assembled with tin-lead solder. In this work, the effects of dielectric material, capacitor size, solder assembly process, solder material, and end-termination type on flex cracking of MLCCs were determined for MLCCs from different manufacturers. Since some flexible- and standard-termination MLCCs are made with precious metal electrodes (silver-palladium), there is a possibility of <b>electrochemical</b> silver <b>migration</b> under bias and humidity. In this study, the effects of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of flexible-termination MLCCs were characterized and compared with standard-termination MLCCs.

Results confirmed that the rate controlling step of the steady-state growth of the barrier layer is the charge transport across this layer, which is near solely due to the migration of anions; oxide is produced only in a region adjacent to the Al-Al 2 O 3 interface. Taking into consideration the structural features of the barrier layer oxide and by assuming a uniform oxide nature and one kind of migrating anions or cations, it has become possible to formulate simplified high field ion <b>migration</b> <b>electrochemical</b> kinetic equations. They {{were found to be}} non-satisfactory when applied at low anodization temperatures, but become applicable at high temperatures or low barrier layer thicknesses. Their application postulated that the charge transfer at the Al-Al 2 O 3 interface, Al- 3 e → Al 3 +, takes place rather through successive ""one electron"" transfer elementary steps. Also, the charge transport across the barrier layer oxide bulk takes place through a concomitant migration of the ions O 2 -, OH- and SO 42 -. A model for the ions transport was suggested which gives a physical meaning to the field assisted oxide dissolution at pore bases, explains the incorporation of SO 42 -, SO 3, OH- and H 2 O and predicts the change of their concentration, of the oxide nature and of the values of kinetic parameters across the barrier layer; it also predicts that an H+ migration may take place during oxide growth. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of CO 2 on a Pt(100) electrode in CO 2 saturated 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solutions was studied by in situ FTIR reflection spectroscopy and a programmed potential step technique. Different surface structures of Pt(100) electrode were prepared by different treatments including fast potential cycling (200 V s(- 1)) for a known time. The Pt(100) surface {{was characterized by}} a parameter gamma that designates the relative amplitude of the current peak of hydrogen adsorption on (100) sites distributed on the one-dimensional surface domains to that on the two-dimensional surface domains. The in situ FTIR spectroscopic results demonstrated that the {{reduction of}} CO 2 on the Pt(100) dominated by two-dimensional surface domains produced only bridge-bonded CO (COB) species, which give rise to IR absorption near 1840 cm(- 1). However both bridge- and linear-bonded CO (COL, yielding IR absorption at around 2010 cm(- 1)) species are found for CO 2 reduction on the Pt(100) dominated by one-dimensional surface domains. The small intensity of the COL and COB bands indicates that coverage by reduced CO 2 species (r-CO 2. or COL and COB species) is low. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies confirmed quantitatively the in situ FTIRS results, and revealed that the r-CO 2 species adsorb preferentially on (100) sites distributed on the two-dimensional surface domains. The initial rate of CO 2 reduction upsilon (i), i. e., the rate of CO 2 reduction on a clean Pt(100) surface, has been determined quantitatively from studies using a programmed potential step technique. It has been demonstrated that the maximum values of upsilon (i) (upsilon (m) (i)) measured on Pt(100) electrodes with different surface structures all appeared at - 0. 19 V. From analysis {{of the relationship between}} upsilon (m) (i) and gamma we have determined that the upsilon (m) (i) of CO 2 reduction on (100) sites distributed on the two-dimensional surface domains is 0. 53 x 10 (- 11) mol cm(- 2) s(- 1) and that on (100) sites distributed on the one-dimensional surface domains is approximately 2. 66 x 10 (- 11) Mol cm(- 2) s(- 1).

Plain laminate substrate and SIR PCBs were cleaned or dosed with no-clean flux residues prior to coatings. Performance {{studies were carried out}} by total immersion in deionized water at 60 °C for 10 days followed by microscopic investigations and potentiostatic studies on coated SIR patterns at 12 V potential bias and by measuring the resulting leakage current. Foe both plain laminates and SIR patterns, detailed investigation of the corrosion morphology was carried out. The amount of water intake by the coating was calculated by the weight-gain method. The amount of no-clean flux residue resulting at various temperatures was quantified using ion chromatography by extracting the residue, and sur-face morphology of the residues was investigated using optical microscopy. The flux residue in general consists of both resin and activator components such as carboxylic acids.

40|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> (ECM) is {{the growth}} of {{conductive}} metal filaments on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) through an electrolyte solution under a DC voltage bias. ECM can cause a reduction in surface insulation resistance (SIR) between adjacent conductors and lead to intermittent or catastrophic circuit failures. To evaluate the current leakage and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> behavior on printed circuit boards, IPC B- 24 comb structures were exposed to 65 °C and 88 % relative humidity conditions under direct-current (DC) bias for over 1000 hours {{to determine the effects of}} some key factors to ECM. The key factors include: solder alloy (eutectic tin-lead and lead-free), board finish (organic solderability preservative versus lead-free hot air solder leveling), spacing (25 mil versus 12. 5 mil), and voltage (40 V versus 5 V bias), solder mask (using and not using), flux solids content. In-situ measurements of SIR, energy-dispersive spectroscopy after testing and optical inspection before and after test were used. The relationships between the electrical behavior and electrochemical behavior of solder alloys were established. The long term electrochemical behaviors of tin-lead and lead-free solders were obtained. The morphology and distribution of migrated species, including Sn, Pb, Cu and Ag were investigated. Compared with solder alloy, board finishes played a secondary role in affecting SIR due to their complexation with or dissolution into the solder. The competing effect between electric field and spacing was also investigated. Solder mask was found to stabilize SIR and reduce the chances for ECM to occur due to its "walling effect". Compared to low solids flux, medium solids flux increased the characteristic lives of PCBs due to their encapsulation effects. The prolonged SIR decline of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu soldered boards was simulated by three-dimensional progressive and instantaneous nucleation models, whose predictions were compared with experimental data. The kinetics of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> process between copper traces in deionized water was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.

40|$|Widespread {{adoption}} of lead-free materials and processing for {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) assembly has raised reliability concerns regarding surface insulation resistance (SIR) degradation and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> (ECM). As PCB conductor spacings decrease, electronic products become more susceptible to these failures mechanisms, especially {{in the presence of}} surface contamination and flux residues which might remain after no-clean processing. Moreover, the probability of failure due to SIR degradation and ECM is affected by the interaction between physical factors (such as temperature, relative humidity, electric field) and chemical factors (such as solder alloy, substrate material, no-clean processing). Current industry standards for assessing SIR reliability are designed to serve as short-term qualification tests, typically lasting 72 to 168 hours, and do not provide a prediction of reliability in long-term applications. The risk of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> with lead-free assemblies has not been adequately investigated. Furthermore, the mechanism of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> is not completely understood. For example, the role of path formation has not been discussed in previous studies. Another issue is that there are very few studies on development of rapid assessment methodologies for characterizing materials such as solder flux with respect to their potential for promoting ECM. In this dissertation, the following research accomplishments are described: 1). Long-term temp-humidity-bias (THB) testing over 8, 000 hours assessing the reliability of printed circuit boards processed with a variety of lead-free solder pastes, solder pad finishes, and substrates. 2). Identification of silver migration from Sn 3. 5 Ag and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu lead-free solder, which is a completely new finding compared with previous research. 3). Established the role of path formation as a step in the ECM process, and provided clarification of the sequence of individual steps in the mechanism of ECM: path formation, electrodeposition, ion transport, electrodeposition, and filament formation. 4). Developed appropriate accelerated testing conditions for assessing the no-clean processed PCBs' susceptibility to ECM: a). Conductor spacings in test structures should be reduced in order to reflect the trend of higher density electronics and the effect of path formation, independent of electric field, on the time-to-failure. b). THB testing temperatures should be modified according to the material present on the PCB, since testing at 85 oC can cause the evaporation of weak organic acids (WOAs) in the flux residues, leading one to underestimate the risk of ECM. 5).

Tracks, pads and vias on printed circuit boards can suffer a variety of problems if circuits are contaminated with electrical-conducting substances. <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>migration,</b> especially dendrite growth, {{has long been a}} concern in safety critical and durable systems, and current preventative methods tend to focus on various styles of printed circuit board protective coatings. These measures have a number of disadvantages, mainly process and material costs with extreme scepticism on their overall efficacy. Any design related developments that can minimise the impact of dendrite growth on reliability can lead to a more economic, durable and safer product. The work in this thesis provides a thorough literature search of the field of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> on printed circuit boards. This study then develops a novel circuit-designorientated model, based on a multilevel full-factorial design, to study the effects of temperature, voltage and electrode gap on dendritic growth under saturated conditions. Preparation of several DC-biased copper-comb patterned printed circuit boards placed in temperature-controlled water-filled cuvettes enables the specific monitoring of dendrite activity, and detects a sharp current increase that accompanies a dendritic short circuit condition. A high R 2 polynomial correlation-model is derived and it is noted that increased voltage and temperature and reduced track spacing increases the impact of dendritic growth on reliability. At voltages between 3 and 4 V, gas bubble formation at the electrodes has the effect of increasing reliability by destroying the dendrite fuses. It is shown that dendrites may not grow below 1. 25 V, which coincides with the theoretical onset voltage for the decomposition of water.

40|$|Dust is a {{ubiquitous}} {{component of}} the environments {{in which we live}} and work. It can deposit on printed circuit assembly to act as a source of ionic contamination. Two common consequences of dust contaminations in the printed circuit boards are loss of impedance (i. e., loss of surface insulation resistance) and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> between traces and component leads. Both failure mechanisms involve the contamination forming a current leakage path on a printed circuit board. Based on studies on ionic contaminations, researchers have argued that the impact of dust in these two failure mechanisms is dependent on its pH, its hygroscopic compositions, and the critical relative humidity of the salts in it. However, {{due to the lack of}} experimental results and the complexity of dust compositions, the argument is not substantiated. Very few papers concerning the impact of different natural dusts on these two failure mechanisms can be found in the literature. In practice, mixtures of Arizona dust and salts are used as a substitute for dust in experiments. In this research, natural dusts were collected from four locations: natural outdoor and indoor dust samples from Massachusetts, U. S., natural outdoor dust from Tianjin, China, and the ISO standard test dust (Arizona test dust). Loss of impedance in dust contaminated printed circuit boards was investigated under controlled temperature (20 ºC to 60 ºC) and relative humidity (50 % to 95 %) ranges. The impact of dust on <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> and corrosion was evaluated under temperature-humidity-bias tests (50 ºC, 90 % RH, and 10 VDC). In addition to the conventional DC measurement where only resistive data can be obtained, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were adopted to obtain nonlinear equivalent circuit models of the electrochemical process, which helps to understand the underlying physics-of-failure. The variation of impedance with relative humidity exhibited a transition range. Below the range, the impedance was constant, and above it, the impedance degraded by orders of magnitude. The value of the transition range decreased with an increase of dust deposition density. The equivalent circuit modeling showed that the dominant resistive path gradually shifted from the bulk to the interfacial with the increase of temperature from 20 ºC to 60 ºC. There were big variations among different dusts, which were quantified using the degradation factor introduced in the research, the critical transition range, and time-to-failure. This result demonstrated that a single salt or a mixture of compounds can not be representative of all dusts. It also indicated that using the ISO standard test dust in place of natural dust samples for reliability evaluation could lead to inaccurate results. Dust should be collected from the field in order to evaluate its impact. It is showed in this thesis that some critical characteristics of dust can be used to classify different dusts for the failure mechanisms of interest. Moisture sorption capability of dust can be used to classify different dusts regarding the loss of impedance failure. The dust with the highest moisture sorption capability had the highest degradation factor. Ion species/concentration or conductivity of dust aqueous solution can be used to classify dust regarding the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> related failures. Dust with the highest ion concentration and conductivity had the lowest time-to-failure. The underlying principals behind those critical characteristics were described and discussed based on the physics-of-failure...|$|E
30|$|One of the {{important}} applications of nanomaterials metallic nanoparticles (NPs) is to manufacture fine-pitch electrical line patterns for organic transistors, radio frequency identification (RFID) antennas, or ultra- large- scale integration (ULSI) interconnections {{not only because of}} the high electrical conductivity and flexibility in handling, but also the low processing temperature [1, 2]. The reduced processing temperature is due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of the particles leading to a dramatic lowering of the melting point and sintering transition. Unlike copper NPs which suffer from easy oxidation, the NPs of noble metals, gold and silver, are stable and widely used in the aforementioned interconnect applications [3 – 9]. However, the price of gold is high, while silver tracks are plagued by <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration.</b> Strategies such as alloying and core-shell structure have been proposed to achieve better performance. Nanoalloys of gold and silver metals, which have attracted much attention due to high catalytic activities and unique optical properties [10 – 13], exhibit essentially identical lattice constants and are completely miscible [14], presenting new opportunities for the development of interconnect materials [15 – 17].|$|E
40|$|A {{palladium}} foil cathode, 50 mm in diameter, 100 µm thick {{is placed}} between two anodic palladium foils of same dimensions. A proton conductor layer (poly-ethyleneoxide) (PEO) and phosphoric acid) is deposited between the cathode {{and the two}} anodes. The system is placed in a chamber filled with deuterium gas, at a temperature of 75 °C. At first, deuterium fills the two anodes up to D/Pd = 0. 48 measured by pressure decrease. Then a voltage is applied between cathode and anodes, and the cathode gets loaded by D + <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> through the solid state electrolyte. Correspondingly, the pressure decreases. Loadings of up to 0. 73 have been obtained. When voltages are reversed, the cathode deloads, and the pressure in the chamber increases. This method is well suited to measure over-potentials and absolute loadings. The input power is very low, since the production of D+ ions entering the cathode is close to 100 % whereas in liquid electrolyte cells, {{a small fraction of}} the ions produced is absorbed by the cathode. Therefore excess heat measurement is easily detected. ...|$|E
30|$|MnO 3 (PCMO)[1 – 31]. This effect {{provides}} {{a possibility of}} a next-generation nonvolatile memory, called resistance random access memory (ReRAM). ReRAM is highly expected to replace conventional flash memory due to its low power consumption, small bit cell size, and fast switching speed. The underlying mechanism of the resistance switching behavior is still poorly understood, {{although there have been}} various proposed models of the resistance switching mechanism such as formation and rupture of conductive filament paths[3, 4], field-induced <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> such as oxygen vacancy creation/diffusion[5, 6], alteration of the width and/or height of a Schottky-like barrier by trapped charge carriers in the interface states[7], trap-controlled space-charge-limited current[8 – 12], injecting electrons into and extracting electrons from the interface[13], and oxidation/reduction reaction at the interface[14 – 20]. It was also reported that the resistance switching is significantly dependent on electrode materials in the ReRAM devices[14, 18, 21 – 26]. The precise identity of the switching location where resistance change mainly occurs has not been revealed. The comprehensive understanding for the origin of the resistance switching is required to meet the requirement for the next-generation nonvolatile memory application.|$|E
40|$|Sn and Sn solder alloys in {{microelectronics}} are {{the most}} susceptible to suffer from <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> (ECM) which significantly compromises the reliability of electronics. This topic has attracted more and more attention from researchers since the miniaturization of electronics and the explosive increase in their usage have largely increased the risk of ECM. This article first presents an introductory overview of the ECM basic processes including electrolyte layer formation, dissolution of metal, ion transport and deposition of metal ions. Then, the article provides the major development {{in the field of}} ECM of Sn and Sn solder alloys in recent decades, including the recent advances and discoveries, current debates and significant gaps. The reactions at the anode and cathode, the mechanisms of precipitates formation and dendrites growth are summarized. The influencing factors including alloy elements (Pb, Ag, Cu, Zn, etc.), contaminants (chlorides, sulfates, flux residues, etc.) and electric field (bias voltage and spacing) on the ECM of Sn and Sn alloys are highlighted. In addition, the possible strategies such as alloy elements, inhibitor and pulsed or AC voltage for the inhibition of the ECM of Sn and Sn solder alloys have also been reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} thallium-doped sodium-iodide well-type {{scintillation}} detector for the assay of the low-activity radioisotope 40 K, in open-source potassium chloride aqueous solutions, is described. The hazards, safety concerns and radiowaste generation associated with using open-source radioactive isotopes can present significant difficulties, the use of hot cells and escalated costs in radioanalytical laboratory research. A solution to this {{is the use of}} low-hazard alternatives that mimic the migration and dispersion characteristics of notable fission products (in this case 137 Cs). The use of NaI(Tl) as a detection medium for naturally-abundant levels of 40 K in a range of media is widespread, but the use of 40 K as a radioactive tracer has not been reported. The use of such low-activity sources is often complicated by the ability to detect them efficiently. In this paper a scintillator detector designed to detect the naturally-abundant 40 K present in potassium chloride in tracer applications is described. Examples of the use of potassium chloride as a tracer are given in the context of ion exchange and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> studies, and comparisons in performance are drawn from literature with hyper pure germanium semiconductor detectors, which are more commonly utilised detectors in high-resolution counting applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> (ECM) {{tests and}} rapid whisker growth on Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solder {{candidates}} doped with Zn and Bi on Cu-plated FR- 4 {{printed circuit board}} were conducted by applying constant voltage. The results showed that dendritic shape were different when the doped metals were different. When Zn was doped in SAC solder, dendrites looked like tree trunk, while that of Bi doping looked like rose, which {{was due to the}} different composition of SAC candidates. Comparing the length of dendrites at the same condition, it could be concluded that dendrite growth might be suppressed by Bi addition, which the contrary effect suitable to Zn addition. EDAX results showed that the main content on dendrites was Sn with or without Bi doping, while the main content was Zn, Sn, and Ag with Zn doping and Zn/Bi dopings. Whisker growth test verified that Sn accounted for a majority (larger than 95 wt. %), no difference could be seen on whiskers of SAC solder candidates although the contents of SAC solder candidate were differently. The whisker growth rate were not different although the doped metals were different largely. Both dendrite growth and rapid whisker growth of SAC solder candidates doped with Zn and Bi were harmful to micro/nanoelectronic packaging attributing to bridge short circuit in PWBs industries...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{contaminants}} from Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly processes pose a {{high reliability}} risk because they result in damaged circuits. Therefore, {{it is essential}} to understand the level of ionic species on the electronic circuitry as well as the reliability risks caused by these contaminants. There are a number of approaches available in the industry to assess the reliability risks; for example, the water drop test (WDT) is one of the techniques used to determine the propensity of an ionic contaminant to cause electrical short failures by dendrite formation. The objective of this research is to determine the time to cause the failures, known as <b>electrochemical</b> <b>migration</b> (ECM) failures. A test vehicle was developed for the WDT to obtain the time to cause ECM failure in presence of different anions. The time to form dendritic bridges that cause short circuits was determined {{as a function of the}} different anions and the spacings between PCB pads. The experimental method involved dispensing aqueous solutions containing common inorganic and organic acid anions onto test vehicles, applying electrical bias voltages and measuring the time to form dendrites. Specially designed test structures cells were created to contain the test solutions. At each of the test cells, a cavity held the solution and constant current was applied through different metal geometries. To be representative of popular board finishes, test vehicle boards incorporated both Sn-Pb Hot Air Soldering Level (HASL) and Pb free HASL surface finishes...|$|E
