Three cam-operated fuel-injection pumps, two pumps cams, and an automatic injection valve with two different nozzles were used. Ignition lag was considered to be the interval between the start of injection of the fuel as determined with a Stroborama and the start of effective combustion as determined from the indicator diagram, the latter being the point where 4. 0 x 10 (exp- 6) pound of fuel had been effectively burned. For this particular engine and fuel it was found that: (1) for a constant start and the same rate of fuel injection up the point of cut-off, a variation in fuel quantity from 1. 2 x 10 (exp- 4) to 4. 1 x 10 (exp- 4) pound per cycle has no appreciable effect on the ignition lag; (2) <b>injection</b> <b>advance</b> angle increases or decreases the lag according to whether density, temperature, or turbulence has the controlling influence; (3) increase in valve-opening pressure slightly increases the lag; and (4) increase of inlet-air pressure, compression ratio, and engine speed reduces the lag...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Concern {{over the}} {{environment}} and=or {{the increasing demand}} for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest {{in the development of}} alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect of <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> timing on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and ignition lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion stroke. <b>Advanced</b> <b>injection</b> timing is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard injection timing of 30 before TDC (BTDC). The <b>injection</b> was first <b>advanced</b> by 5 : 5 given injection timing of 35 : 5 BTDC. The engine ran for about 5 minutes at this timing and stopped. The engine failed to start upon subsequent attempts. The <b>injection</b> was then <b>advanced</b> by 3 : 5 (i. e. 33 : 5 BTDC).

This paper describes the preliminary modeling and flow simulation part of a DOE sponsored CO 2 sequestration project. The main objective of the project is to understand the feasibility of long term sequestration of CO 2 in a depleted oil reservoir through a field demonstration experiment. Before the actual CO 2 injection begins, it was necessary to determine feasibility of <b>injection.</b> <b>Advanced</b> geologic modeling and flow simulation techniques were used to develop a model for the proposed target interval.

The reservoir model thus verified was subsequently used to determine feasibility of injecting CO 2 over a period of one month. A number of injection scenarios were tested to determine the response of the reservoir over a wide range of injection rates and regulatory operational constraints. The preliminary injection studies indicate that proposed amount of CO 2 could be injected in the target interval without violating regulatory constraints.
