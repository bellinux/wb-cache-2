5|$|Research <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore {{reducing the risk of}} heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E

Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|Although the 'kātĕpo' was {{reported}} to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as Latrodectus katipo by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), the brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus), and the European black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus). The katipo's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) Latrodectus katipo and L. atritus (black katipo) were previously thought to be two separate species, but research <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> they are a single species, L. katipo, with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean annual temperature. The katipo is so {{closely related to the}} redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name Latrodectus hasseltii katipo. Further research <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the katipo is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains its own species. The katipo's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide and are commonly known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders or comb-footed spiders.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E

5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{matching}} mitochondrial DNA, geneticist Turi King continued {{to pursue a}} link between the paternally-inherited Y-DNA and that of descendants of John of Gaunt. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a false-paternity event had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort; work by Turi King and others <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> historical rates of false paternity are around 1–2% per generation.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{have studied}} the {{dynamics}} and structure of an air discharge propagating in a capillary tube and initiated by a point-ring electrode geometry at atmospheric pressure. We <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the discharge velocity decreases as the discharge propagates in the dielectric tube. To increase the velocity of a given discharge after the cathode ring, we <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> one can either decrease the tube radius or keep the same radius and increase the applied voltage or decrease {{the value of the}} tube permittivity. We <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the discharge becomes more homogeneous in the dielectric tube as the inner tube radius decreases and that the velocity of the discharge is higher if the discharge is more homogeneous.

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> certain mallards {{appear to}} be closer to their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, research <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E

5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate.

Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
