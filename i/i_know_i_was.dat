500|$|Ferguson {{was delighted}} in how his team coped with the pitchside temperatures: [...] "You {{had to be}} down there to {{appreciate}} it. I was told it was 41 degrees on the pitch – <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> roasting just watching them." [...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game. We won the Premiership title with a strong run {{at the end of}} last season." [...] Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – [...] "that's not my decision", though continued [...] "We have four great goalkeepers and we're looking to have a good battle all season long." ...|$|E
500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, [...] "What was that bugger gassing about?"; to which another replied, [...] "Buggered if <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having a kip. Where's the old bugger gone now?".|$|E

Evil companions came early and {{reckless}} deeds followed.... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> losing something, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being drawn downward, but I could not escape. Day and night I called for help, and then--she came--" ...|$|R

2500|$|Following his {{appearance}} in the second season, Dane returned to the series in this episode. According to Dane, he was originally hired by the series producers in order to film one episode, but was ultimately asked to return. [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing one episode. That's what I signed up for. But because of who the character was, {{there was a lot}} of room for him to come back. I got real lucky, they invited me back." [...] When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first {{appearance in the}} third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene has become one of the most iconic of the series. Dane offered his outlook on the scene, [...] "It was a spectacular entrance. It was all about this brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. Every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, my lad, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only wishing I had. And {{take away}} five pounds {{for the wedding}} and things--it leaves twenty-nine pounds. You won't do much on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. Oh yes I was: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Well, if my blessed {{father had}} come in he'd have told me to control myself. As if I was losing my temper on purpose! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{have not}} congratulated me upon my escape," [...] he began, breezily. [...] "But {{you must have}} been dead-tired last night. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> And you had that hard pull on the river besides." ...|$|E
60|$|JULIA (trying her {{theatrical}} {{method in}} a milder form--reasonable and impulsively goodnatured instead of tragic). <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong {{to act as}} I did last night. I beg your pardon. I am sorry. I was mad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't trust me, dear, don't trust what I say," [...] poor Miss Frost ejaculated hurriedly, even wildly. [...] "Don't {{notice what}} I have said. Act for {{yourself}}, dear.
