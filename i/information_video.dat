40|$|In this thesis, A <b>video</b> <b>information</b> {{system uses}} IP camera, which transmits <b>video</b> <b>information</b> to HOST via Streaming Server or ftp server. But there’s problem that HOST cannot {{retrieve}} <b>video</b> <b>information</b> without <b>video</b> <b>information</b> transmitted from IP camera. So in this thesis, host-active application program is developed, which can retrieve <b>video</b> <b>information</b> from HOST with only IP camera’s IP address. By installing cloud server in the HOST, which smartphone can send videos to it regardless of network realms such as Wi-Fi, LTE or AP and transfer smartphone’s <b>video</b> <b>information</b> to cloud server anytime using wired or wireless networks. So by installing a Private Cloud server in HOST, which provides unrestricted environment where user can develop and launch application programs and sync smartphone to it. Smartphone’s <b>video</b> <b>information</b> is synced with Private Cloud ubiquitously using wired or wireless networks such as AP, LTE or WIFI and stored to Private Cloud so smartphone or IP Camera’s <b>video</b> <b>information</b> is always stored in Private Cloud server {{which can be}} used as evidence when there’s crime. Also employees can save materials of meeting which is saved to corporation’s Private Cloud server in real-time and enables remote monitoring for employee in office to cooperate with employee in remote locations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>Video,</b> {{as it is}} {{used for}} data {{collection}} and presentation in research and teaching, is clearly a form of mediated communication. However its existence is not clearly identifiable in the theories and models of communication centred on mass media, home recording and art creation.

40|$|Video-based patient {{information}} supplementing clinician interview {{has been shown}} to reduce anxiety and improve satisfaction in patients undergoing procedures. In Queensland more than 90 % of caesarean sections are performed under regional anaesthesia. We aimed to assess the effect of using an <b>information</b> <b>video</b> about neuraxial blockade in patients having regional anaesthesia for elective caesarean section. Subjects were randomised to undergo usual care (Group C), or to view a video and undergo usual care (Group V). Subjects completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory preoperatively and the Maternal Satisfaction with Caesarean Section Score questionnaire postoperatively. Satisfaction with, and duration of the preoperative anaesthetic interview, were noted. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-squared tests were used in statistical analysis. One-hundred and forty three subjects were randomised and 110 completed the protocol and analysis. Group C and Group V were similar in terms demographic and anaesthesia data. There was no difference in anxiety score (41. 2 versus 39. 8, P= 0. 50), maternal satisfaction score (118. 5 versus 122. 7, P= 0. 22) or interview duration (16. 3 versus 15. 8 min, P= 0. 69) between the two groups. The use of an anaesthesia <b>information</b> <b>video</b> does not reduce preoperative anxiety or increase the duration of the anaesthetic interview.
