5000|$|One of Dove's {{published}} research articles, [...] "Developing <b>Food</b> <b>Acceptance</b> Research", discusses {{many aspects of}} the necessity of developing new methods of food research and the relation to <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> among individuals. The article was written shortly after World War II and the purpose was to examine the causes of food nonacceptance. In order to discuss the topic, Dove refers to the unconscious acceptance 'panels' that families held during their meal times. Some of the factors behavioral factors that influence the acceptance of food include: imitation (when a child imitates those choices of their parents), domination (punishment through taking or privileging food), urging (encouragement to eat food for health advantages), and resistance (refusing to partake in foods that are presented). Other areas of consideration for <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> included all physical attributes like odor, texture, and flavor; the volume of food presented; the quality of the soil the food was grown on; the manner in which food is stored, as well as the quality of that storage. From all of these, the agriculture of the time was formed.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{conclusion of}} Dove's research was that attitudes related to <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> {{were due to}} habits of choosing food made from birth to adulthood, and other factors including climate and socioeconomics and religious characteristics of each region.|$|E
50|$|Dove {{states that}} the {{awareness}} of <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> is brought forth with the change to commercial farming where the best product comes from quantity. Home-grown foods were replaced with standardized products. The requirement for processed foods increased when the armies of WWII began to grow. Dove says that the missing link {{that has not been}} studied is food acceptability between the consumer and the food. He also states that many specialized areas need to be studied in regard to food acceptability, including: grading of food quality, quality control, chemists to study treated foods and biologists to study relativity between food gathering and hunger.|$|E

50|$|The Church of Eilistraee {{works by}} putting their goddess' teachings in practice. Their main {{duty is to}} {{encourage}} the drow {{to return to the}} surface world, reaching to them whether they are fugitives, raiders or inhabitants of the Underdark. They show to the drow that a different kind of life, far from Lolth, is possible, and assist them in making this choice by giving them aid, <b>food,</b> <b>acceptance</b> and safe places to live. Eilistraeeans perform missions underground, looking for those dark elves who are in need of their help and that can be brought on the surface (mostly slaves, commoners, fallen and hunted nobles or drow who are generally unsatisfied with the life that Lolth imposes them), bringing them the Message of Eilistraee. Many of them carry tiny swords to give out to drow in the Underdark, that serve as keys for safe passage to temples, or as identification tokens.Some priestesses of the Dark Maiden live in Lolth-dominated drow settlements, hiding from the clergy of the Spider Queen, even posing as her followers, in order to carry out the above-mentioned missions. These clerics and the Eilistraeen converts who have to hide their faith in order to let it spread and to survive under the thumb of Lolth are known as Secret Moondancers.|$|E
50|$|From infancy, {{the only}} oral motor pattern {{appreciated}} is suck-swallow-breathe. This reflexive way of eating allows infants to feed from birth (from a breast or bottle) while protecting their airway and meeting their nutritional needs (Case-Smith & Humphry, in Case-Smith, 2005). The oral motor patterns required for eating and swallowing solids include tongue lateralization, tongue elevation, and munching/chewing, {{and unlike the}} suck-swallow-breathe sequence, coordination of these oral motor patterns is learned, not reflexive (Morris & Dunn Klein, 2000). When an infant is offered a spoon of puree, the practiced or familiar oral motor pattern is sucking. As purees are thicker than formula or breastmilk, puree is sucked off of a presented spoon and moved in the mouth {{in a similar fashion}} as liquid. This is generally looked at {{as a part of the}} process of introducing solid foods and parents are often encouraged to push past this. Conversely, current research supports that early negative experiences with eating leads to poor <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> in later years (Courtland, Harris, & Emmett,2009). Through playful exploration, BLW provides an opportunity for infants to practice new oral motor patterns. Through this method, infants gradually develop the oral motor patterns required for mature bolus manipulation, chewing, and swallowing, as well as allow the infant to be in charge of what goes in their mouth, how it goes in, and when.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Picky or fussy {{eating is}} common in early {{childhood}} and associated with a decreased preference {{for a variety of}} foods. The aim of the current study was to experimentally test which sensory food feature is associated with <b>food</b> <b>acceptance,</b> which, in turn is an indication for fussy eating, in young children (between 32 and 48 months). In a repeated-measures-design, three sensory features were manipulated separately (i. e., colour, texture and taste) while keeping the other two features constant. The baseline measurement consisted of a well-liked yoghurt, which was presented before each manipulation variant. The number of spoons that children (N = 32) consumed from each variant were registered as behavioural indication for <b>food</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Another aim was to evaluate how the behavioural measurement of <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> would be related to parental reports of their child's fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding styles. In addition, this study explored if children's body-mass index (BMI) was related to the behavioural measurement of <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> and parental reports of fussy eating behaviour. RESULTS: The manipulation of food texture caused a significant decrease in intake. Colour and taste manipulations of the yoghurt did not affect children's intake. Parental reports of children's fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding styles were not related to the behavioural observation of <b>food</b> <b>acceptance.</b> The behavioural measurement of <b>food</b> <b>acceptance</b> and parental accounts of fussy eating were not related to children's BMI. CONCLUSION: Food texture but not taste or colour alternations affected <b>food</b> <b>acceptance,</b> at least when consuming variations of a well-liked yoghurt. This knowledge is important for further research on picky-eating interventions. Parental reports of fussy eating did not concur with the behavioural observation of <b>food</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Further research is warranted to test whether these findings generalize to other food types...|$|E

40|$|Concerns {{about food}} safety and {{environmental}} quality have increased in recent years. Consumers are particularly concerned about the health risks posed by pesticide residues in food and {{the environmental impact of}} agricultural chemicals. These concerns have stimulated a considerable amount of recent research to assess the effects of reduced agricultural chemical use. This paper focuses on the research in the United States which has examined the impact of reduced agricultural chemical use on food, including <b>food</b> prices, consumer <b>acceptance,</b> <b>food</b> quality, and food demand and consumption. This review is divided into three major sections. The first gives an overview of consumer concerns and behavior, using the results of the annual Food Marketing Institute survey of grocery shoppers. The second summarizes two "macro" studies that simulated the impact of reduces chemical use on agriculture in the United States. The third section reviews a number of "micro" studies that analyzed consumer willingness to pay for reduced pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables. These studies primarily rely on either hedonic price models and existing organic food or contingent valuation techniques and consumer surveys of various alternatives not currently available. This paper concludes with a few thoughts that will hopefully add some perspective to the public policy assessment of this issue. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|Managers of {{consumer}} goods companies (i. e., restaurants, grocery stores, and bars) {{have the potential to}} effectively utilize environmental factors to stimulate desired consumer behaviors. Background music has been identified {{as one of the most}} readily manipulated and influential elements to which a shopper or consumer may be exposed to in a service setting. Nevertheless, little is known about the effect of background sound on <b>food</b> perception and <b>acceptance.</b> This research sought whether background music genre and musical components can alter <b>food</b> perception and <b>acceptance,</b> but also to determine how the effect can vary as a function of food type (i. e., emotional vs. non-emotional) and source of music editor (i. e., single vs. multiple). In Experiment 1, single and multiple editors transposed the traditional music piece, 2 ̆ 2 Air on the G String, 2 ̆ 2 into four genres: classical, rock, hip-hop, and jazz. The same music piece was edited into contrasting ends of musical components of tempo, pitch, and volume for Experiment 2. According to a preliminary survey centering on the association between food and emotion, milk chocolate (emotional), and bell pepper (non-emotional) were selected as food stimuli for both experiments. Following consumption, participants rated flavor intensity, flavor pleasantness, texture liking, and overall liking using 15 -cm line scales. In Experiment 1, participants liked food stimuli significantly more with the jazz stimulus as opposed to the hip-hop stimulus. Ratings of flavor pleasantness and overall impression for food stimuli only differed between the single editor genres. In Experiment 2, participants liked bell pepper flavor and texture significantly more with the fast tempo versus the slow tempo stimulus. Ratings of chocolate texture and bell pepper overall impression significantly heightened in the low pitch condition. In the loud volume condition, participants 2 ̆ 7 evaluated flavor pleasantness, texture impression, and overall impression of chocolate significantly higher in comparison to the quiet and silent conditions. In summary, the present thesis presents new empirical evidence that music genre, components, and editor, along with food type can modulate <b>food</b> perception and <b>acceptance.</b> Furthermore, our findings assist food service industries in creating the most appropriate atmosphere by explaining observed consumer behaviors induced by musical stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Few {{children}} {{consume the}} recommended portions of fruit or vegetables. This {{study examined the}} effects of parental physical prompting and parental modelling in children’s acceptance of a novel fruit (NF) and examined the role of children’s food-approach and food-avoidance traits on NF engagement and consumption. A total of 120 caregiver–child dyads (fifty-four girls, sixty-six boys) participated in this study. Dyads were allocated to one of the following three conditions: physical prompting but no modelling, physical prompting and modelling or a modelling only control condition. Dyads ate a standardised meal containing a portion of a fruit new to the child. Parents completed measures of children’s food approach and avoidance. Willingness to try the NF was observed, and the amount of the NF consumed was measured. Physical prompting but no modelling resulted in greater physical refusal of the NF. There were main effects of enjoyment of food and <b>food</b> fussiness on <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Food</b> responsiveness interacted with condition such that children who were more food responsive had greater NF acceptance in the prompting and modelling conditions in comparison with the modelling only condition. In contrast, children with low food responsiveness had greater acceptance in the modelling control condition than in the prompting but no modelling condition. Physical prompting in the absence of modelling is likely to be detrimental to NF acceptance. Parental use of physical prompting strategies, in combination with modelling of NF intake, may facilitate acceptance of NF, but only in food-responsive children.

40|$|Objective: There {{is concern}} {{about the extent to}} which {{consumers}} will accept genetically modified (GM) foods in China. Existing studies are mostly inconsistent and sometimes confusing. Although China produced and consumed the biggest amount of GM crops and other derived products, there were only limited studies about Chinese public <b>acceptance</b> for GM <b>foods.</b> This review was aimed to explore the public <b>acceptance</b> for GM <b>food</b> in China and reasons for acceptance or against for GM food. Methods: Literature were retrieved from Google Scholar, Pubmed and CNKI using key words of "genetically modified food" (OR "GM food" OR "GMO Food" OR "GM foods") combined with "acceptance" (OR “attitude” OR “willingness to buy”). Consumers' knowledge and understanding about GM <b>food,</b> attitudes and <b>acceptance</b> for GM <b>food</b> as well as factors or reasons associated with their attitudes or acceptance were synthesized. Result: Of 1000 literature retrieved from the specified data sources, 20 were eligible to be included in this study. Generally, knowledge and understanding of GM food was limited among Chinese consumers. However, <b>acceptance</b> for GM <b>food</b> were generally positive among the Chinese consumers, around 60 %- 80 % according to the studies included in this review. Factors associated with <b>acceptance</b> for GM <b>food</b> included price of GM food, respondents' demographics, government attitudes and media coverage. Conclusion: The Chinese government should better communicate the risk and benefits associated GM <b>food</b> to improve <b>acceptance</b> of GM <b>food.</b> Communication should target subgroups of consumers to improve their knowledge and perceived benefits of GM food.
