40|$|Abstract [...] Mobile {{communication}} {{technology has evolved}} {{over the years to}} support a wide range of multimedia services, besides the traditional voice service. This evolution has also created new challenges for the mobile industry in the way it does business. Profitable business and pricing models seem to be elusive thus far. In this paper, we emphasise the need for a value-based approach for pricing a service vis-à-vis the volume-based models that are widely in practice today. We highlight the benefits of a value-based pricing model for different types of services, and study the impact of this model on the transport-content interface in a mobile value chain. Ramsey pricing and <b>i-mode’s</b> pricing strategies are revisited in this regard. Role of competition and market uncertainty in our model is also discussed. We also discuss the impact of a value-based pricing model on the future mobile technology evolution (traffic forecast, Quality of service) and other issues that may have {{to be taken care of}} for such a pricing model to be implemented. Index terms [...] multimedia services, value-based pricing model, vertical bundling, mobile value chain, quality of service (QoS) in networks. I...|$|R
5|$|As of January 30, 2007, Square Enix had renewed their {{trademark}} on the Japanese {{name for}} the game, and at Square Enix's 2007 Tokyo Game Show in September made a mobile phone port of the Wonderswan version available for play. Square released the game for download in late 2008 for Japanese <b>i-mode,</b> EZweb compatible phones, and Yahoo! Mobile compatible phones. The port removed the bestiary mode and original Game Boy version of the game, and condensed some of the in-game cutscenes. It added Japanese kanji support and extra shops with new equipment throughout the quest.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger was a {{critical}} and commercial success upon release, and is frequently cited {{as one of the}} best video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics. Chrono Trigger was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PlayStation iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003. The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009. Chrono Trigger was also ported to <b>i-mode</b> mobile phones, Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS devices, and Android devices.|$|E
5|$|Capcom {{released}} a port of Mega Man X onto FOMA and <b>i-mode</b> compatible mobile phones in Japan in 2007. Mega Man X {{has also been}} made available for purchase on the Virtual Console service in Japan and North America in 2011 for the Wii, and later in Europe in 2012, {{as well as for}} the Wii U in 2013 and the New Nintendo 3DS in 2016. The game was ported to the Android operating system in Japan as a free download on November 18, 2011. Another remake of Mega Man X was released on the Apple iOS (iPhone and iPod Touch) on December 21, 2011. This version is based on the mobile phone version of the game and features touch controls, Game Center support, and a challenge mode with 80 levels. However, this version removed extra life power-ups, and separated the levels into chunks by black screen transitions, as opposed to the continuous scrolling of the original. Weapon and armor upgrades could also be purchased with actual money to ease the game's difficulty.|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{previous}} {{results on}} the stability of uniformly and differentially rotating, self-gravitating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric systems to derive a new stability criterion for the appearance of toroidal, m= 2 Intermediate (I) and bar modes. In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar systems and the m= 2 <b>I-modes</b> in gaseous systems have many common physical characteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy of the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in stellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability criterion. The new stability parameter "alpha" is formulated first for uniformly rotating systems {{and is based on}} the angular momentum content rather than on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems "alpha" = 0. 254 - 0. 258, while it is in the range of 0. 341 - 0. 354 for gaseous systems. For uniform rotation, one can write "alpha" {{as a function of the}} total (rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is characteristic of the topology/connectedness and the geometric shape of a system. "Alpha" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of differentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal models whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known. We also estimate "alpha" for gaseous toroidal models and for stellar disk systems embedded in an inert or responsive "halo". We find that the new stability criterion holds equally well for all these previously published axisymmetric models. Comment: 29 pages, postscript, compressed, uuencoded. Accepted by Ap...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{toroidal}} rotation is {{a factor}} important for plasma stability and transport, {{but it is still}} a fairly poorly understood area of physics. This thesis focuses on three aspects of rotation: momentum transport, Ohmic rotation reversals, and LHCD induced rotation. Momentum transport is approached in a semi-empirical method through the development of the "Toy Model. " The "Toy Model" assumes that the toroidal momentum is transported via diffusive and convective profiles, and, using assumptions about the diffusive and convective terms, it can generate the profiles of the residual stress or source as a function of space and time. Several resultant source profile calculations are shown for SSEP sweeps, rotation reversals, H-modes, and <b>I-modes.</b> Generally, it is observed that the convective profiles do not greatly improve the fits to the data, and that source profiles have peaks around the steep core rotation gradient region of the plasma. Rotation reversals, spontaneous reversals of the rotation direction during the Ohmic phase, are also described in this work. It is seen that they are related to the Linear Ohmic Confinement (LOC) to Saturated Ohmic Confinement (SOC) regime changeover. This relation is supported through linear gyrokinetic simulations that show that the co- to counter- reversal coincides with a change from marginally electron to ion diamagnetic direction most unstable modes which is believed {{to play a role in}} the LOC to SOC explanation as well. Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) induced rotation is also described, including the first experimental observations of bi-directional rotation on a single tokamak. These observations help to explain differences in rotation seen among the various devices running lower hybrid. The LHCD rotation reverses direction as a function of plasma current, and this occurs in a similar parameter space as the Ohmic rotation reversal; it also has turbulence changes that are reminiscent of the Ohmic reversal as well. This suggests that LHCD is, in fact, causing the plasma to transition from the ITG dominated regime to the TEM dominated regime, which explains the rotation differences. These experiments and models provide new tools to understand rotation transport and generation in tokamaks. by Yuri Anatoly Podpaly. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The original version was remade again to mobile phones and released on August 16, 2006 for SoftBank's 3G network. It was later ported onto <b>i-Mode</b> distribution service on November 6, 2006 and EZweb distribution service on February 5, 2007. The gameplay of the mobile phone version {{is closer to}} the original game's design, but featuring updated graphics and sound, an improved world map, and other minor changes. The characters have been redesigned several times between each remake. On September 16, 2015 a 3D remake was announced for PlayStation Vita, Android and iOS. A port of the original game for the Nintendo Switch was released with ports of Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 as part of the Seiken Densetsu Collection on June 1, 2017.|$|E

It released for Windows 95 and Windows 98 systems on August 18, 2000; and for Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows 2000 on February 20, 2003. Due to the game's size, these versions were released on multiple CD-ROMs. The CD-ROM version was translated into Russian and published in the region by Akella on January 11, 2006. A DVD-ROM version was released for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista on January 25, 2007.

2500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of {{societal}} mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The SMS feature spawned the [...] "texting" [...] sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer Instant Messenger services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g. NTT DoCoMo's <b>i-mode),</b> offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>i-mode</b> {{service was}} an {{exceptional}} service which positioned DoCoMo {{as the global}} leader in value add services, another key success factor for <b>i-mode</b> was the Japanese smartphone makers who developed {{state of the art}} handsets to support <b>i-mode.</b> As <b>i-mode</b> was exported {{to the rest of the}} world, Nokia and other major handset vendors who controlled the markets at the time, refused at first to support <b>i-mode</b> by developing handsets which support the <b>i-mode</b> service. The operators who decided to launch <b>i-mode</b> had to rely on Japanese vendors who had no experience in international markets. As <b>i-mode</b> showed success in these markets, some vendors started customizing some of their handsets to support <b>i-mode,</b> however, the support was only partial and came late in time.|$|E

50|$|The {{phone was}} one of the first coupled with the launch of {{telecommunication}} company O2's <b>i-mode</b> service, a global system where operators design the compatible handsets, give strong editorial and usability rules to content providers, and propose an open business model to them. <b>i-mode</b> uses open standards as technologies: a light version of HTML is used for producing content, the <b>i-mode</b> mail is interoperable with e-mail, images and sound formats are the ones used on the Web. <b>i-mode</b> users have access to various services such as e-mail, sports results, weather forecast, games, financial services and ticket booking.|$|E
50|$|While {{the service}} was {{successful}} during the first years after launch, the lack of adequate handsets {{and the emergence of}} new handsets from new vendors which supported new Internet services on one hand, and a change of leadership of <b>i-mode</b> in Docomo, lead to a number of operators to migrate or integrate <b>i-mode</b> into new mobile Internet services.
