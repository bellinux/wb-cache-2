These include blogs, RSS, and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the scandal, with Ross Newland's {{identity}} uncovered, and {{the episode}} becoming a major embarrassment for the U.S. and Argentina in the worldwide intelligence community, the CIA removed its Station Chief from Argentina, and {{said they were going to}} permanently move their offices to Montevideo, Uruguay because of their problems working together with SIDE. Also, as a result of this, the head of the SIDE counter-intelligence service, retired Major Alejandro Brousson was expelled because of the American diplomatic pressure to punish the responsible of an act they considered [...] "a violation of game rules" [...] (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>community,</b> that is).|$|E

On September 13, 2004, Powell testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were [...] "wrong" [...] and that it was [...] "unlikely" [...] that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>community,</b> including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that [...] "what one person knew, everyone else knew." ...|$|E
2500|$|The report {{recognized}} that the nation's ability to collect and disseminate scientific intelligence was unsatisfactory. At {{the time of the}} task force’s activities, the responsibility for scientific intelligence was scattered throughout the community. [...] Some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>community</b> such as the State Department and Defense Department were known for their territorialism over the responsibility. Another common problem for the CIA {{and the rest of the}} community was finding quality scientists willing to forgo a higher salary and name recognition to serve the scientific needs of the intelligence community. Due to these problems, the report encouraged the Central Intelligence Agency and the Research and Development Board to assign a specific entity “to collect, collate, and evaluate scientific and medical intelligence, in order that our present glaring deficiencies in this field be promptly eliminated.” This central authority for collecting and disseminating scientific intelligence would have included developing fields such as biological and chemical weapons, electronics, aerodynamics, and missile technology. While medical intelligence was relatively underdeveloped and responsibility was shared among several agencies, cooperation in that area between agencies was expected to increase. These recommendations were deemed necessary due to bureaucratic restraints which prevented the Scientific Branch of the CIA from effectively executing its function.|$|E
2500|$|On November 13, after Nixon's {{landslide}} re-election, Nixon told Kissinger [...] " [...] to {{ruin the}} Foreign Service. I mean ruin it – the old Foreign Service – and {{to build a new}} one." [...] He had similar designs for the CIA, and intended to replace Helms with James Schlesinger. Nixon had told Helms that he was on the way out, and promised that Helms could stay on until his 60th birthday, the mandatory retirement age. On February 2, Nixon broke that promise, carrying through with his intention to [...] "remove the deadwood" [...] from the CIA. [...] "Get rid of the clowns" [...] was his order to the incoming CI. Kissinger had been running the CIA since the beginning of Nixon's presidency, but Nixon impressed on Schlesinger that he must appear to congress to be in charge, averting their suspicion of Kissinger's involvement. Nixon also hoped that Schlesinger could push through broader changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>community</b> that he had been working towards for years, the creation of a Director of National Intelligence, and spinning off the covert action part of the CIA into a separate organ. Before Helms would leave office, he would destroy every tape he had secretly made of meetings in his office, and many of the papers on Project MKUltra. In Schlesinger's 17-week tenure, he would fire more than 1,500 employees. As Watergate threw the spotlight on the CIA, Schlesinger, who had been kept in the dark about the CIA's involvement, decided he needed to know what skeletons were in the closet. He issued a memo to every CIA employee directing them to disclose to him any CIA activity they knew of past or present that could fall outside the scope of the CIA's charter.|$|E
