25|$|Polymers show creep {{basically}} {{in two different}} ways. At typical work loads (5 up to 50%) ultra <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> polyethylene (Spectra, Dyneema) will show time-linear creep, whereas polyester or aramids (Twaron, Kevlar) will show a time-logarithmic creep.|$|E

25|$|Many {{thermoplastic}} {{materials such as}} nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in low friction bearings. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load. For improved wear resistance, very <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene {{consists}} of nonpolar, saturated, <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> hydrocarbons. Therefore, its chemical behavior {{is similar to}} paraffin. The individual macromolecules are not covalently linked. Because of their symmetric molecular structure, they tend to crystallize; overall polyethylene is partially crystalline. Higher crystallinity increases density and mechanical and chemical stability.|$|E

25|$|Gram {{negative}} bacteriocins {{are typically}} classified by size. Microcins {{are less than}} 20 kDa in size, colicin-like bacteriocins are 20 to 90 kDa in size and tailocins or so called <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> bacteriocins which are multi subunit bacteriocins that resemble the tails of bacteriophages.

50|$|At {{constant}} pressure and temperature, the root-mean-square speed {{and therefore the}} effusion rate are inversely proportional to the square root of the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight.</b> Gases with a lower <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> effuse more rapidly than gases with a <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> so {{that the number of}} lighter molecules passing through the hole per unit time is greater. This is why a balloon filled with low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> helium (M = 4) deflates faster than an equivalent balloon full of <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> oxygen (M = 32). However the total mass of the escaping molecules is directly proportional to the square root of the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> and is less for lighter molecules.|$|R
25|$|Polyesters and {{polyamides}} {{are examples}} of condensation polymers formed by step-growth polymerization. Carothers worked out the theory of step-growth polymerization and derived the Carothers equation which relates the average degree of polymerization to the fractional conversion (or yield) of monomer into polymer. This equation shows that for a <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> a very high fractional conversion is needed (for step-growth polymers only).|$|E
25|$|Triticeae {{glutelins}} {{presented by}} DQ2 is some coeliacs. In wheat, the {{low molecular weight}} glutenins often share structural similarity with the prolamins of the similar species of Triticeae. Two motifs, K1-like (46-60), pGH3-like (41-59) and GF1(33-51) have been identified. <b>High</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> glutenin has also {{been identified as a}} potentially toxic protein Some of the HMW glutenins increase response with transglutaminase treatment, indicating the sites might be similar to alpha-gliadin and gamma gliadin T-cell sites.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Dr. Julian W. Hill, {{another member of}} the Carothers team, began work again on {{attempting}} to produce a polyester with a molecular weight of above 4,000. His efforts were soon met with great success when he produced a synthetic polymer with a molecular weight of about 12,000. The <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> allowed the melted polymer to be stretched out into strings of fiber. Thus was created the first synthetic silk, described by the chemists as a superpolyester.|$|E
25|$|PAHs are {{typically}} found as complex mixtures. Lower-temperature combustion, such as tobacco smoking or wood-burning, tends to generate low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> PAHs, whereas high-temperature industrial processes typically generate PAHs with <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Epoxy resins are low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> pre-{{polymers}} or <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> polymers {{which normally}} contain {{at least two}} epoxide groups. The epoxide group is also {{sometimes referred to as}} a glycidyl or oxirane group.|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of initial}} <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> and thermal {{stability}} of polymer samples on horizontal flame spreading behavior and spread rate were studied by comparing results between two polystyrene, PS, samples with different initial <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> and between two poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, samples with different thermal stability and initial <b>molecular</b> <b>weights.</b> The flame spread {{rate of the}} <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> PS sample was about 25 % larger than that for the low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> PS sample and the flame spread rate of the <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> PMMA sample was about four times larger than that for the low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> sample. The sample with <b>high</b> initial <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> does not form molten polymer near the flame front and the flame spreads steadily. However, the sample with low initial <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> forms molten polymer and the opposed slow fluid motion of molten polymer along the inclined vaporizing surface against the traveling flame significantly affects flame spreading behavior and its rate. 1...|$|R
25|$|Another motor protein {{implicated in}} the initial capture of MTs is CENP-E; this is a <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> kinesin {{associated}} with the fibrous corona at mammalian kinetochores from prometaphase until anaphase. In cells {{with low levels of}} CENP-E, chromosomes lack this protein at their kinetochores, which quite often are defective in their ability to congress at the metaphase plate. In this case, some chromosomes may remain chronically mono-oriented (anchored to only one pole), although most chromosomes may congress correctly at the metaphase plate.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{pressure}} {{tends to}} decrease polymerization rates reducing uniformity of deposition since uniformity {{is controlled by}} constant pressure. This is a reason that high-pressure plasma or atmospheric-pressure plasmas are not usually used in favor of low-pressure systems.At pressures greater than 1 torr, oligomers are formed on the electrode surface, and the monomers also on the surface can dissolve them to get a low degree of polymerization forming an oily substance. At low pressures, the reactive surfaces are low in monomer and facilitate growing <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> polymers.|$|E
25|$|While {{inert gas}} reduces {{filament}} evaporation, it also conducts {{heat from the}} filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.|$|E
50|$|Using ethenolysis, <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> {{internal}} alkenes can {{be converted}} to more valuable terminal alkenes. The Shell higher olefin process (SHOP process) uses ethenolysis on an industrial scale. The SHOP α-olefin mixtures are separated by distillation, the <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> fractions are isomerized by alkaline alumina catalysts in the liquid phase. The resulting internal olefins are reacted with ethylene to regenerate α-olefins. The large excess of ethylene moves the reaction equilibrium to the terminal α-olefins. Rhenium(VII) oxide on alumina serves as the metathesis catalyst.|$|R
25|$|In low <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> alcohols, the hydrogen-bonding {{properties}} of their polar hydroxyl group dominate other weaker van der Waals interactions.
