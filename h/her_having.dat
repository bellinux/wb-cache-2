5|$|Dhumavati {{is always}} {{considered}} a widow, and thus, {{is the only}} Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since left <b>her.</b> <b>Having</b> destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Winehouse {{admitted}} to punching a female fan {{in the face}} for criticising <b>her</b> <b>having</b> taken Blake Fielder-Civil as a husband. She then attacked her own spouse as he attempted to calm her down. In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis. The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around £350). Winehouse first appealed the fines, but later dropped the appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Pegasus Books {{published}} The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II, a play by American {{author and}} playwright Noah Lukeman, which endeavoured {{to offer a}} sequel to Macbeth and to resolve its many loose ends, particularly Lady Macbeth’s reference to <b>her</b> <b>having</b> had a child (which, historically, she did - from a previous marriage, having remarried Macbeth after being widowed.) Written in blank verse, the play was published to critical acclaim.|$|E

The casting would reunite her with several of her former General Hospital alumni, including Tristan Rogers, Stephen Nichols, Judith Chapman and Kin Shriner. In a statement on how she received the newly created role, Francis revealed that Maria Arena Bell, the series' executive producer and head writer, called <b>her</b> (<b>having</b> seen her appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show) and offered her a role personally, to which Francis accepted.|$|E

Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer , overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in <b>her</b> <b>having</b> her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

Later, Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews' casket and finds it filled with roots, his body missing. When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her.

5|$|The Queen's Diamond Jubilee {{procession}} on 22 June 1897 {{followed a}} route six miles long through London and included troops {{from all over}} the empire. The procession paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside St Paul's Cathedral, throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage, to avoid <b>her</b> <b>having</b> to climb the steps to enter the building. The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78-year-old Queen.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against <b>her</b> <b>having</b> more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|In Anurag Kashyap's period crime drama Bombay Velvet (2015), (based on the {{historian}} Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables) co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, Sharma {{was cast in}} the role of a jazz singer, Rosie Noronha. Her character was referenced from yesteryear stars like Brigitte Bardot, Helen and Waheeda Rehman. As part of her preparation, Sharma watched a lot of films of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a documentary showing the development of hair and make-up over the years. She also revealed to have used temporary lip enhancers as a part of her make up in the film, citing it as the reason behind her changed appearance on a chat show in 2014, and refuting media speculations about <b>her</b> <b>having</b> undergone plastic surgery. Bombay Velvet was screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals, but critical reviews on it were mixed.|$|E

Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite <b>her</b> <b>having</b> made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E
5|$|Nickell {{continued}} {{to maintain her}} innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A second appeal, beginning in 2001 was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, based on evidence obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about <b>her</b> <b>having</b> purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to <b>her</b> <b>having</b> her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

While the two women clean themselves up, Kator kills and consumes Wally. Jessica tells Jo that she is no longer willing to be controlled and is leaving with Anders. Outraged, Jo knocks Jessica unconscious and runs into the woods to dig a grave for her. On waking, Jessica seduces Kator. As they start to have sex, Kator's predatory instincts are stirred, causing him to revert to his natural form and tear open Jessica's throat, killing <b>her.</b> <b>Having</b> returned to the house, Jo attempts to flee but falls into the open grave and presumably meets a similarly violent end.|$|E

5|$|Vincent first {{appears in}} the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches <b>her</b> <b>having</b> sex with Julian; they engage in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is {{having an affair with}} Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006. Whitney sets up Vincent and Valerie as a couple without knowing they are in fact the same person.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue <b>her.</b> <b>Having</b> the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E
