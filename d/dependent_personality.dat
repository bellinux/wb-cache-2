5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include <b>dependent</b> <b>personality,</b> use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E

25|$|The {{risk factors}} for {{benzodiazepine}} dependence are long-term use beyond four weeks, use of high doses, use of potent short-acting benzodiazepines, <b>dependent</b> <b>personalities,</b> and proclivity for drug abuse. Use of short-acting benzodiazepines leads to repeated withdrawal effects that are alleviated by the next dose, which reinforce in the individual the dependence. A physical dependence develops more quickly with higher potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax) than with lower potency benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium).|$|R
25|$|People {{who have}} high reward <b>dependent</b> <b>personalities</b> but find {{themselves}} in situations where {{they are unable to}} find rewards and approval through family support or other types, will seek reward through other means e.g. substance abuse or over-eating. It is then suggested that individuals with such predispositions should adopt preventive strategies or avoid such situations, where they seek such rewards that could potentially have adverse consequences. Reward dependence drives behavior maintenance systems, and in addictive behaviors, maintenance of behaviors occurs despite adverse consequences.|$|R

30|$|Not {{only will}} the woman damage her husband's 'personal honor', making him an {{undesirable}} man, {{but she will}} damage his 'social honor' among his fellowmen. In addition, unemployed husbands, {{who do not know}} Hebrew, feel that they are being abandoned, left alone in an incomprehensible, alien world (Ben Ezer, 1989; Kacen, 2006). Thus, some Ethiopian murderers act out of rage against the woman who wants to harm them so much. On another psychological level, men with <b>dependent</b> <b>personalities</b> and/or abandonment anxiety will view the woman's will as a major threat to their existence. By murdering their wives, these husbands are trying to prevent them from leaving; some of these murderers will commit suicide. Among Ethiopians, this trigger was responsible for 50 % of IPH cases from 1990 – 2010. In 50 % of these IPH cases, the murderer also attempted or committed suicide (Edelstein, 2011). As the literature shows, fear of abandonment is the most risky trigger for IPH; most husbands who murdered their wives, did so during in the first year after the breakup of their marriage (Kacen, 2006; Sela-Shayovitz, 2010; Kacen and Keidar, 2006; Morash et al. 2007). In my opinion, being reported for wife-abuse to the authorities or spousal infidelity (real or imagined) produce temporary situations; however, the breakup of a marriage or relationship is final, chaotic and results in hopelessness. Its finality is also its lethality.|$|R

40|$|The {{findings}} suggest prevention tactics that {{recognize the importance}} of structuring children's interaction with adults outside the family, rather than fostering informal or private contacts. The study found that offenders who used persuasion to involve their child victims in sexual activity {{were more likely to have}} a prior history of such offending, which suggests that this tactic has worked for them in the past and reduced the risk that their offense would be detected. In many cases, the same victim had been abused repeatedly. In some cases, keeping the victims silent about the abuse involved subtle, manipulative threats such as the withdrawal of love and abandonment. The study also found that offenders who abused older children were more likely to use persuasive rather than forceful tactics. This may mean that older victims, although initially resistant to sexual activity with the offender, may be more responsive to being treated as a sexual partner than are younger children. A third finding was that offenders who acted under the strong influence of deviant sexual fantasies were more likely to use persuasive tactics with their victims. Such offenders tended to have avoidant and <b>dependent</b> <b>personalities,</b> which not only explained their attraction to non-threatening children, but also explained their reluctance to behave aggressively. The study sample consisted of 226 adult males who had been convicted of a sexual offense against a child 13 years old or younger.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the personality characteristics of 104 adults diagnosed with atten-tion {{deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). Personality features were assessed with the MCMI–II (Millon, 1987). Participants were divided into 4 groups based {{on the presence of}} persisting oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or other comorbid diagnoses (ADHD only, ADHD–comorbid, ADHD–ODD, ADHD–ODD–comorbid). Significant differ-ences between these groups were present for 9 of the 13 MCMI–II personality scales, resulting in 4 modal personality styles. ADHD-only adults evidenced mild histrionic traits, whereas the ADHD–comorbid group was more often avoidant and <b>dependent</b> in <b>personality</b> style. ADHD–ODD adults showed histrionic, narcissistic, aggressive–sa-distic, and negativistic traits whereas the ADHD–ODD–comorbid group had a combi-nation of avoidant, narcissistic, antisocial, aggressive–sadistic, negativistic, and self-defeating personality features.

Many clinical investigators have called for a better understanding of adult symptomology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its comorbid disorders (Barkley, 1998; Biederman, Newcorn, & Sprich, 1991; Nadeau, 1995; Robin, Tzelepis, Bedway, Gilroy, & Sparague, 1998).
