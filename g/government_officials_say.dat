In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law. New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage.

25|$|Questions {{related to}} the {{technical}} details {{of the collapse of}} the buildings of the World Trade Center have been debated for years, including rebuttals and ridicule. Controlled demolition conspiracy theories were first suggested in October 2001. Eric Hufschmid's book, Painful Questions: An Analysis of the September 11th Attack, in which the controlled demolition theory is explicitly advocated, was published in September 2002. David Ray Griffin and Steven E. Jones are the two most prominent advocates of the theory. Griffin's book The New Pearl Harbor, published in 2004, has become a reference work for the 9/11 Truth movement. In the same year, Griffin published the book The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions, in which he argues that flaws in the commission's report amounts to a cover-up by <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> and <b>says</b> that the Bush administration was complicit in the 9/11 attacks.

As result, AMISOM felt it had to deploy additional troops along the route in order to resecure it. The force chosen for this purpose was the Ugandan garrison of Leego, a strategically important town and major ANISOM military base. As the international peacekeeping forces were already suffering from manpower shortages, however, the Ugandans could not be replaced by other forces in time. When the UPDF soldiers consequently moved from Leego to Golweyn on 4 July, the former was left completely defenseless.
