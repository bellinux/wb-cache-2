Applying different mouse models, including conditionally proficient Ccr 7 gene-targeted mice, we now show that semimature steady state dendritic cells (sDCs) constitutively trafficking into lymph nodes (LNs) were essential contributors to T cell homeostasis in these organs. sDCs provided vascular endothelial growth factor known to support <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venule</b> formation, thus facilitating enhanced homing of T cells to LNs. The presence of sDCs led to increased CCL 21 production in T-zone fibroblastic reticular cells. CCL 21 is a ligand for CCR 7 known to regulate homing as well as retention of T cells in LNs. In addition, we provide evidence that CCL 21 binds {{to the surface of}} DCs via its heparin-binding domain, further explaining why T cells leave LNs more rapidly in the absence of sDCs.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine {{the relationship between the}} hyaluronate receptor and CD 44 (H-CAM), cell-surface glycoproteins of similar molecular weights that have been implicated in cell adhesion. In initial experiments, a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD 44 were tested for their ability to cross react with the hyaluronate receptor. These antibodies immunoprecipitated [3 H]hyaluronate binding activity from detergent extracts of both mouse and human cells, indicating that the hyaluronate receptor is identical to CD 44. In addition, one of these antibodies (KM- 201 to mouse CD 44) directly blocked the binding of labeled hyaluronate to the receptor and inhibited hyaluronate dependent aggregation of SV- 3 T 3 cells. CD 44 has also been implicated in lymphocyte binding to <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venules</b> during lymphocyte homing. Interestingly, the monoclonal antibody Hermes- 3, which blocks lymphocyte binding to the <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venules</b> of mucosal lymphoid tissue, had no effect on the binding of labeled hyaluronate. Furthermore, the binding of lymphocytes to <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> cells of lymph nodes and mucosal lymphoid tissue was not significantly affected by treatment with agents that block the binding of hyaluronate (hyaluronidase, excess hyaluronate and specific antibodies).

In this study, we have evaluated whether the humoral alloimmune response involved in chronic rejection is elicited within the graft. We used the rat aortic interposition model and microdissected the adventitia of the graft. Over time, the T cell infiltrate shifted toward a B helper phenotype. B lymphocyte clusters were detected and were the site of intense proliferation and apoptosis. Simultaneously, adventitial vascular endothelium acquired a <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venule</b> phenotype. Similar features were evidenced in the interstitium of chronically allografts (hearts and kidneys). Strikingly, ganocultured graft interstitial tissue was found to be the site of production of antibodies directed against donor MHC-I molecules. These findings, therefore, document the appearance of germinal centers in chronically rejected tissues. This lymphoid neogenesis implies that the graft is not only the target of the alloimmune response but also a site where this response actually develops, so as to optimize the communication between the targeted tissue and the immune effectors...|$|E

Consequently, Rap 1 deficiency impairs homing of naive T cells to peripheral lymph nodes, but accelerates homing of TH 17 and TH 1 cells to the colon, resulting in spontaneous colitis with tumours. Rap 1 -GDP associates with and activates lymphocyte-oriented kinase, which phosphorylates ERM (ezrin, radixin and moesin) in resting T cells. Phosphomimetic ezrin reduces the rolling of Rap 1 -deficient cells, and thereby decreases their homing into the colon. On the other hand, chemokines activate Rap 1 at the plasma membrane within seconds, and Rap 1 -GTP binds to filamins, which diminishes its association with the b 2 chain of LFA- 1 and results in LFA- 1 activation.

40|$|Binding of L-selectin to {{the highly}} glycosylated {{peripheral}} lymph node addressins (PNAd) plays {{a central role}} in the normal recirculation of lymphocytes between the bloodstream and the lymph node. This interaction requires correct fucosylation of the PNAd, mediated by the recently identified fucosyltransferase-VII (Fuc-TVII). Here we show that during ontogeny Fuc-TVII is absent at the day of birth, barely detectable on day 1, and clearly present from day 2 onwards. PNAd expression as detected by the MECA- 79 antibody precedes the expression of Fuc-TVII. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in adult mice antigenic stimulation of peripheral lymph nodes leads to a temporary disappearance of Fuc-TVII at days 2 and 3 after stimulation, followed by a complete reappearance by day 4, while expression of MECA- 79 is never completely absent during this period. Finally, occlusion of afferent lymphatics to peripheral lymph nodes resulted in a decreased expression of Fuc-TVII in the <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venules</b> by day 5, and complete disappearance within 8 days. We conclude that the activity of Fuc-TVII in cells of <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venules</b> is directly affected by afferent lymph and activation processes that occur in the lymph node after antigenic stimulation.

We also find that CXCR 4 can contribute to T cell homing. Using intravital microscopy, we find that B cell adhesion to high endothelial venules (HEVs) is disrupted when CCR 7 and CXCR 4 are predesensitized. In Peyer’s patches, B cell entry is dependent on CXCR 5 in addition to CCR 7 /CXCR 4.

In the present study, we have explored the molecular basis of lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium in the synovial membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We established that the very late antigen- 4 [VLA- 4 (CD 49 d) ] and the vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) are important mediators of binding to synovial endothelium of resting and, to a greater extent, of activated T lymphocytes, whereas the leukocyte-function associated antigen- 1 [LFA- 1 (CD 11 a/ 18) ]/intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 [ICAM- 1 (CD 54) ] pathway is less important in this interaction. In contrast to its prominent role in lymphocyte interaction with endothelium in rheumatoid synovium, the VLA- 4 /VCAM- 1 pathway does not significantly contribute to lymphocyte adhesion to peripheral lymph node <b>high</b> <b>endothelial</b> <b>venule.</b> Thus, the VLA- 4 /VCAM- 1 pathway may be of primary importance in mediating lymphocyte adhesion to inflamed endothelium and in lymphocyte homing to rheumatoid synoviu...|$|E

Although the vessels are critical for supplying nutrients and for controlling cell trafficking, the regulation of lymph node vascular growth is not well understood.

Endothelial cell proliferation is dependent on CD 11 c+ dendritic cells (DCs), and the subcutaneous injection of DCs is sufficient to trigger endothelial cell proliferation and growth. Lymph node endothelial cell proliferation is dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and DCs are associated with increased lymph node VEGF levels.

Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that virus-induced PLN and HEV network remodeling required LTalpha(1) beta(2) -expressing B cells, whereas the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-A signaling pathways had no significant effect on PLN expansion.
