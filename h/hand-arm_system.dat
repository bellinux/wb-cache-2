40|$|Prolong and {{intensive}} exposure to hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of disorders in the vascular, neurosensorial, and musculoskeletal structures, which have been collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). From the review of literature, {{it is apparent that}} biodynamic response of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> is one of the important foundations for understanding the causations of HAVS and for developing effective methods for exposure assessment. Although considerable efforts have been made to characterize the biodynamic responses of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> and develop biodynamic models, only little knowledge exists on distribution of biodynamic response and power absorption for assessing health risks to the localized substructures. This dissertation research is concerned with development of an effective hand-arm vibration model that can predict distributed mechanical impedance and power absorption properties various substructures within the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> This dissertation research proposes a new model structure that mimics the basic structures of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> grasping a handle. The proposed model comprises two driving-points as opposed to the single driving-point invariably considered in the reported models. The model thus permits analyses of biodynamic forces developed on the fingers and palm-sides. The model parameters are identified based on the selected experimental data using a curving fitting method. The model structure revealed reasonably good agreements with the reported experimental data acquired under selected hand actions. The model also revealed very good agreements in terms of biodynamic responses distributed in the fingers and the palm in both the impedance magnitudes and phase. The model was applied to predict biodynamic responses of the human <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> exposed to forearm direction of vibration. These were evaluated in terms of mechanical impedance, vibration transmissibility, dynamic force and power absorption. The basic characteristics of distributed biodynamic responses are analyzed to gain insight into relative health risks of vibration posed to various substructures of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> The results showed that the vibration power absorption (VPA) is mainly distributed in the forearm and shoulder structures under low frequency vibration. At higher frequencies, the vibration power is mostly absorbed in the tissues close to the hand-tool contact area, which can be associated with potential disorders of the fingers caused by operation of high frequency tools. This study also suggests that the distributed power absorption may be used as an alternative vibration measure for assessing various risks of the hand-transmitted vibration exposure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare various effects on the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> of {{vibration}} exposure from a chipping hammer and a grinder with the same frequency weighted acceleration. Grip and push forces were measured and monitored during the exposure. The various effects were: muscle activity (measured with surface electrodes), discomfort ratings for different parts of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> (made during and after exposure), and vibration perception threshold (for 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the exposure). RESULTS [...] No increase in muscle activity due to exposure to vibration was found in the hand muscle studied. In the forearm, conversely, there was an increase in both muscle studied. For the upper arm the muscle activity only increased when exposed to impact vibration. Subjective ratings in the hand and shift in vibration perception threshold were effected more by the grinder than the hammer exposure. CONCLUSION [...] These results show that the reaction of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> to vibration varies with frequency quantitatively as well as qualitatively.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges of humanoid robotics is to provide a robotic systems with autonomous and dextrous skills. Dextrous manipulation skills, for personal and service robots in unstructured environments, are of fundamental importance, in order to accomplish manipulation tasks in human-like ways and to realize a proper and safe cooperation between humans and robots. The contributions presented in this thesis are aimed at modeling and controlling multifingered robotic hands with soft covers for manipulation tasks. The control issue of a <b>hand-arm</b> robotic <b>system</b> involved in grasping tasks, which can interact with the environment or a human, is also addressed. A port-Hamiltonian model of a multifingered robotic hand, with soft-pads on the finger tips, grasping an object has been developed. The port-Hamiltonian framework is based on the description of systems in terms of energy variables, and their interconnection in terms of power ports. Any physical systems can be described by a set of elements storing kinetic or potential energy, a set of energy dissipating elements, and a set of power ports interconnected by power preserving interconnections. The viscoelastic behavior of the contact is described in terms of energy storage and dissipation. Using the concept of power ports, the dynamics of the hand, the contact, and the object are described. The algebraic constraints of the in- terconnected systems are represented by a geometric object, called Dirac structure. This provides a powerful way to describe the non-contact to contact transition and contact viscoelasticity, by using the concept of energy flows and power preserving interconnections. Using the port based model, an Intrinsically Passive Controller (IPC) is used to control the internal forces and the motion of the object. In grasping tasks, in the case that also interaction with the environment or a human is involved, the control issue of a <b>hand-arm</b> robotic <b>system,</b> is addressed. Thecontrol law adopted for the arm is a compliance object-level control, which aims to reduce the interaction forces. The control action is based on the reconstruction of the external load applied to the object, using the force sensors measurement at the fingertips. Force sensing is also used to compute in real time the desired contact forces, able to guarantee the stability of the grasp. The regulation of the grasping forces {{is in charge of the}} hand control. In detail, the contents of the thesis are organized as follows. Chapter 1 provides an introduction on grasping and manipulation applications in the context of advanced robotics where the robot has to operate in unstructured environment. Here the relevance of dexterous manipulation skills in performing many di®erent tasks is emphasized. The framework of the research work in this section is introduced, i. e., the activities in the European project DEXMART. A brief description of the research objectives and the key innovations carried out within the DEXMART project are given. Chapter 2 contains an overview on the relations between the designing features of a robotic hand and its anthropomorphism and dexterity. Then the robotic hand built within the DEXMART project is introduced. A detailed description of the mechanical structure and of the actuation system by means of tendons is provided. Moreover, the kinematics, the statics and the dynamics of the hand are derived. The control structure and the control of the interaction in presence of soft contact is analyzed. Chapter 3 presents a port-Hamiltonian model of a multifingered robotic hand, with soft-pads, while grasping and manipulating an object. An introduction to the port-based formulation is provided. For the validation of the model, a simple example modeled in 20 -sim simulation software is considered. Simulation results are presented to validate the model and to show the behavior of the system when an IPC based controller is applied. In Chapter 4 the control issue of a <b>hand-arm</b> robotic <b>system</b> involved in grasping tasks, which can interact with the environment or a human, is addressed. An introduction on the combined control of <b>hand-arm</b> <b>systems</b> is given.

40|$|Clinical and {{epidemiological}} {{studies have shown}} that operators of hand-held power tools are prone to develop peripheral, vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal disorders collectively known as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAYS). The reported biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm to hand-transmitted vibration exhibit considerable differences, which could be partly attributed to the complexity of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, {{the vast majority of the}} hand-arm models offer limited applicability to the tools since these lack consideration of the anthropometric, anatomical and biological properties of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> Experimental and analytical methods are used in this dissertation research to: (i) identify sources of discrepancies in the reported hand-arm biodynamic responses to vibration; (ii) simultaneously characterize localized vibration transmission to different segments of the human hand-arm and the driving-point mechanical impedance (DPMI) response under different hand-arm postures, hand forces, and excitation levels; (iii) develop biomechanical models corresponding to bent- and extended-arm postures on the basis of both the DPMI and vibration transmissibility responses; and (iv) characterize vibration power absorption (VPA) distribution of different components of the hand-arm for potential injury risks assessments. The results show that the discrepancies in the reported biodynamic responses above 500 Hz were due to acceleration measurement location, handle dynamics (handle resonant frequency and deformation) and ineffectiveness of handle inertia correction. The peaks and valleys in the DPMI magnitude correspond to resonant frequencies of the tissues/muscles and the bones/structure, respectively. On the other hand, the peaks in transmissibility magnitudes represent the resonant frequencies of both the tissues/muscles and bones/structure. Furthermore, the DPMI seems to characterize the dynamic response of the entire <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> with emphasis around the driving-point, while the transmissibility responses emphasize the dynamic response of the tissues/muscles of the human <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> The VPA distributions in the forearm and upper-arm were observed to be considerably higher than those of the hand components below 100 Hz, while the VPA distribution in the fingers was greater above 100 Hz.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop models of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> in the three orthogonal directions (xh, yh, and zh) and to enhance the understanding of the hand vibration dynamics. A four-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) model and 5 -DOF model were used in the simulation for each direction. The driving-point mechanical impedances distributed at the fingers and palm of the hand reported in a previous study were used to determine the parameters of the models. The 5 -DOF models were generally superior to the 4 -DOF models for the simulation. Hence, as examples of applications, the 5 -DOF models were used to predict the transmissibility of a vibration-reducing glove and the vibration transmissibility on the major substructures of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> The model-predicted results were also compared with the experimental data reported in two other recent studies. Some reasonable agreements were observed in the comparisons, which provided some validation of the developed models.

40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low vibration tool designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a percussive chipping hammer together with a biomechanical model of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the primary piston and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled hand-tool system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the hand-tool model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> The results further show that the anti-vibration gloves yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|E

In this thesis, a detailed quantitative analysis of the system’s architecture, oscillators, and corresponding achievable precision has been made. Furthermore, other user constraints, such as utilization of communication channels, have been taken into account. The resulting formulas have been applied to calculate practical values for the DLR <b>Hand-Arm</b> <b>system.</b> Also, the choice of the solution has been made according to the taxonomy of clock synchronization methods which was also developed within the scope of this thesis. The extended classification and the results of quantitative analysis can potentially be integrated into the domain model of the Virtual Path of the <b>Hand-Arm</b> <b>System</b> and may be used in the future for automatic generation of synchronization modules for diverse hardware elements, such as FPGAs or CPLDs, depending on user-defined optimality constraints. A constructive approach, starting with pinpointing the underlying system’s properties and the non-functional characteristics of the algorithm, to modular construction of the algorithm and the necessary functional properties has been used. The resulting solution can guarantee high-precision synchrony with some nonzero probability which can be made considerably high, depending on the resulting resource demands. Modules of the algorithm, including the clock controller and communication jitter compensation have been simulated under extreme values of system parameters. Stability and precision have been also demonstrated by means of numerous simulations. Furthermore, the global convergence of the algorithm has been briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{research}} {{performed in}} the domain of human body vibrations revealed their important influence on human health, being the origin of several professional diseases. Consequently, the vibrations influence can be clearly systematized in two distinct categories: whole body vibrations – with significant effects in the entire human body; vibrations on different sections of the body – that transmit significant accelerations and displacements only in some sections, such as the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system.</b> While the first category – registered mainly in the professional driving sector – has been constantly studied and different solutions for vibration attenuation have been proposed, the hand-arm vibration domain is still open for discussions. This paper presents a complex study – both from the medical and engineering point of view – regarding the modelling and testing methods used for <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> vibrations in the view of professional diseases prevention. It aims to evaluating preventive strategies to reduce worker exposures to hand-arm transmitted vibration and to decrease the occurrence of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) in workers.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of some {{laboratory}} and field tests aimed at assessing the acceleration levels transmitted to the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> by electric portable harvesters for olive. Four harvesting heads, different for shape and kinematic system, and five bars, different for diameter, length and material (aluminium and carbon fibre), were used in assembling eleven harvesters. The vibrations were measured in two points, next to the handgrips. The laboratory tests allowed {{the evaluation of the}} acceleration levels in standard controlled conditions, while the field tests allowed the assessing {{of the effects of the}} tree canopy with respect to the no load running. The laboratory tests showed that in reducing the vibration level plays a major role the kinematic system of the harvesting head and then the bar material. The classical flap-type harvester produced accelerations of around 20 m/s 2, while by using a harvesting head with two parts in opposite movement, the accelerations were lowered to about 6 m/s 2. The use of carbon fibres for the bars, besides the reduction in weight, produced also a reduction in acceleration (from 21 to 16 m/s 2). The field tests proved that the tree canopy had a negative effect on the vibrations transmitted to the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system,</b> especially when the aluminium bar of small diameter was used...|$|E

Vibration is a common byproduct of mechanical technology. Construction and contract workers typically are in contact with such technology on a daily basis. This interaction has been found to lead to a disease known as Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS). The disease causes intensive damage to the hand and arm and can be debilitating. Individual machines emit vibration at a specific frequency, and if it is at the natural frequency of the material in the human arm or hand, can cause devastating damage and more quickly lead to the development of HAVS. Therefore {{it is important to know}} accurately the resonance frequencies in the arm and compare them to the individual frequencies emitted by construction technology. Due to the extreme difficulty of gathering data on the human arm from a living subject, models of the arm are a practical solution to the resonance problem. An investigation of the arm modeled and analyzed as two viscoelastic rods is conducted below. Resonance. Resonance is the phenomenon at which an externally forced frequency coincides with the natural frequency, defined by a ratio close to one between the two frequencies. When damping is present, pseudo resonance will occur with the maximum amplitude of the vibrating object. In general, amplitude is not linearly dependent on frequency. An important case of resonance, including the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system,</b> relates amplitude í µí°´o the square of the frequency í µí¼ [1]. The case of resonance in the <b>hand-arm</b> <b>system</b> will be examined later...|$|E
