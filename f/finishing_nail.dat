5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of cheap wire nails, the use of wrought iron for nail making quickly declined, as more slowly did the production of cut nails. In the United States, in 1892 more steel-wire nails were produced than cut nails. In 1913, 90% of manufactured nails were wire nails. Nails went from being rare and precious to being a cheap mass-produced commodity. Today almost all nails are manufactured from wire, but the term [...] "wire nail" [...] has come to refer to smaller nails, often available in a wider, more precise range of gauges than is typical for larger common and <b>finish</b> <b>nails.</b>|$|R
50|$|New designs {{have been}} introduced, {{including}} the Nail Jack and Nail Hunter nail pullers, which take a pliers-like {{approach to the}} old cat's paw design. These tools contain their own built in fulcrum, but can also be struck with a hammer to drive {{the tips of the}} tool into the wood with very little damage, allowing them to dig out nails that have been driven into wood at or below the surface. The Nail Hunter nail pulling design has very precise tips that actually come completely together at the ends, for removing <b>finish</b> <b>nails.</b> The pneumatic-powered Nail Kicker allows large numbers of old nails to be efficiently pulled.|$|R

50|$|Analysis of {{the bomb}} by FBI experts {{determined}} that the explosive device was a pipe bomb with nails wrapped to its surface for shrapnel effect, {{and that it was}} equipped with a timer-armed motion trigger to ensure that it would explode only when the car was driven. The bomb was also placed on the floorboard directly under the driver's seat, not on the floorboard behind the seat as the Oakland Police Department had claimed. That evidence pointed to the bomb being an anti-personnel device placed with the intent of killing the driver of Bari's car. Despite that evidence, the FBI investigation remained focused on the theory that the explosion was an accidental detonation of a device knowingly transported by Bari, with attempts to match roofing nails transported in Bari's car to <b>finishing</b> <b>nails</b> used with the bomb. After seven weeks of continual news stories citing repeated police claims that all evidence pointed to Bari and Cherney as culprits, the Alameda County District Attorney announced that he would not file any formal charges against the pair due to insufficient evidence against them. Law enforcement agencies never followed through on the evidence that the bombing was an attempt on Bari's life and the crime would go unsolved.|$|R
50|$|Chaney {{claimed he}} was forced to sit {{motionless}} for hours as the scenes were shot frame by frame. At times he {{claimed he was}} to remain sitting even while the crew broke for lunch and was not even allowed to use the bathroom. Chaney even went as far as saying special effects men drove tiny <b>finishing</b> <b>nails</b> into the skin on the sides of his hands so they would remain motionless during close ups. However, there may be some exaggeration involved - studio logs indicate during the filming of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) the entire crew, including Chaney took a two-hour break during the filming of a transformation and filmed the rest of the scene later that day (though the makeup for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein had been greatly redesigned and streamlined by Bud Westmore over the original Jack Pierce makeup). What really happened was a plaster mold was made to hold his head absolutely still as his image was photographed and his outline drawn on panes of glass in front of the camera. Chaney then went to makeup man Jack Pierce's department, where Pierce, using grease paint, a rubber snout appliance and a series of wigs, glued layers of yak hair to Chaney's face. Then Chaney would return to the set, line himself up using the panes of glass as reference and several feet of film were shot. Then Chaney would return to the make-up department, a new layer was applied, showing the transformation further along, then returned to the sound stage. This was done about a half-dozen times. Talbot’s lap dissolve transformation on screen only took seconds, while Chaney’s took almost ten hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{break with}} Germany {{meant that the}} Luxembourg steel {{industry}} not only had to reorient itself economically, but also had to restructure itself. The challenge was twofold: firstly, to secure both pre- and post-production markets (that is, on the one hand, the supply of raw materials, minette and coke, and on the other, a demand for the <b>finished</b> products, from <b>nails</b> to grey-beams); secondly, {{to take the place}} of the German firms, which had had to withdraw.|$|R
60|$|Mary Erskine {{accordingly}} {{finished her}} packing, and Albert went to it, to nail the cover on. He drove {{one or two}} nails, and then he put the hammer down, and sat down himself upon the box, saying {{that he could not}} <b>finish</b> the <b>nailing</b> after all. He was too unwell. He went into the room, Mary Erskine leading and supporting him. She conducted him to the bed and opened the curtains so as to let him lie down. She helped him to undress himself, and then left him, a few minutes while she began to get some tea. She moved the box, which she had been packing, away from the stoop door, {{and put it in a}} corner. She drew out the trundle-bed, and made, it ready for Bella. She sat down and gave Bella some supper, and then put her into the trundle-bed, directing her to shut up her eyes and go to sleep. Bella obeyed.|$|R

During this period the Federal style began to yield in popularity to the Greek Revival mode.

40|$|My {{purpose is}} to create a curtain showing the {{changing}} nature of clouds and sky. By enveloping the viewer in luminous veils of color, I hope to evoke a separate moment of time and emotion that will be an expression of the sublime. I would define the sublime as the transformation and exaggeration of natural phenomenon within a contemporary romantic context. Influenced by the works of Joseph Mallord Turner, Caspar David Friedrich and Mark Rothko, I am particularly interested in their diffusion of space, light and color. My concept of this art work as an environment involved isolating a space 28 feet by 22 feet and transforming this space into a unified whole with related contiguous compositions. Starting with primed canvas and oil paint, work progressed toward the goal of creating light and atmospheric effects. After discarding heavy canvas, oil paint and cloud forms, I then experimented with painting on fine linen fabric acrylics and then with various rayon and polyester fabrics. Twenty-six panels of polyester lining fabric, measuring 96 inches in height and 45 inches in width, were used. This fabric was chosen after considerable experimentation because of its transparency and fragile weightless feeling. A wood grain surface under the fabric was used to obtain unique process effects. The acrylic washes, gravity and drying time combine to give random patterns and spontaneity to the panels. The first step of the installation was to staple the panels on one inch dowels that were cut exactly the width of the material. Holes were drilled into each end of the dowel and the fabric was draped over the dowel to float freely with an air space between the wall and the panels. The dowels were supported by two and two-and-a-half inch <b>finishing</b> <b>nails</b> driven into the wall at right angles. The light source was evenly spaced flood lights from above the work. The play of the air blowing through the vents caused the curtain to float gently and added an extra dimension to the work. Essential to this abstract notation of atmospheric elements is an impressionistic time sense and the use of colors ranging from the soft opalescent tones of dawn to the brighter colors of midday and on through the soft blues of evening. A waxed floor reflects the colors of the curtain, as in nature the smooth surface of a lake reflects the sky. The infinite structure of atmosphere, space beyond space, layer behind layer, all constantly changing, and creating luminous environs exerts significant influence upon my concept of painting. In my work, the intensity of natural phenomenon reflects the extremes of human emotion...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] cat's paw or cat's claw is a {{standard}} carpenter's tool, consisting of a round or hexagonal bar that curves at one end to form a pointed, cup-shaped tip with a V-shaped cleft for gripping nailheads. Popular retail outlets currently call these a claw bar {{if it has a}} claw on each end, or a moulding bar if it has a claw on one end and a flat pry bar on the other. It essentially works as a small crowbar. To use the tool the user holds the tool's shank with one hand and drives the claw around a nailhead with a hammer. When the V is firmly seated around the nail's shank, the users pull the bar back to raise the head, then <b>finishes</b> pulling the <b>nail</b> with the hammer's claw. The cat's paw is well designed for demolition work, but because it tears up the wood around the nailhead, it should not be used for finish work.|$|R

Its Italianate brick former factory remains on Mill Pond Road. Of the different styles popular in the late Victorian period, the Queen Anne Style was most in evidence in Monroe. The 1841 Methodist Church on Maple Avenue was renovated along Queen Anne lines in 1885, and over a decade later, in 1896, the Church of the Sacred Heart was built in that style.|$|R
50|$|Even before Mexico {{gained control}} of Alta California the onerous Spanish rules against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet couldn't enforce their no trading policies. The Californios, with {{essentially}} no industries or manufacturing capabilities, were eager to trade for new commodities, glass, hinges, <b>nails,</b> <b>finished</b> goods, luxury goods and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made. The main products of these California Ranchos were cow hides (called California greenbacks), tallow (rendered fat for making candles and soap) and California/Texas longhorn cattle horns that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled for about 200 days in sailing ships about 17000 mi to 18000 mi around Cape Horn to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides, tallow and horns. The cattle and horses that provided the hides, tallow and horns essentially grew wild. The Californios' hides, tallow and horns provided the necessary trade articles for a mutually beneficial trade. The first United States, English and Russian trading ships began showing up in California before 1816. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. written about the period 1834-36, provides a good first hand account of this trade.|$|R

5000|$|After a {{successful}} show opening for The Police, R.E.M. intended to record {{material for a}} demo tape. The group traveled to Drive-In Studios in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to record some songs with producer Mitch Easter, {{who was a member}} of the band Let's Active. The band recorded [...] "Radio Free Europe", [...] "Sitting Still", and the instrumental song [...] "White Tornado", which were placed on a promotional cassette tape. The band sent out 400 copies, one of which was received by Atlanta law student Jonny Hibbert. Hibbert offered to release [...] "Radio Free Europe" [...] and [...] "Sitting Still" [...] as a one-off 7" [...] vinyl single with the understanding that he would own the publishing rights for both songs; the band agreed to his terms. However, Hibbert felt the recording was unsatisfactory, and oversaw a remix. Easter said he found the presence of Hibbert [...] "distracting" [...] and added, [...] "He came into my studio and it was like, now the big city guy is going to do it right. We mixed the song for about 12 hours and really, there wasn't enough equipment to warrant more than 45 minutes." [...] The final mastering of the song disappointed the band. Guitarist Peter Buck, who described the recording years later as [...] "muddy and hi-end", expressed his displeasure by breaking a copy of the <b>finished</b> single and <b>nailing</b> it to his wall. However, Buck admitted that [...] "there's something to be said for the original sort of murky feeling for original recording".|$|R
