5|$|In 2010, <b>fipronil</b> {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, {{in a study by}} the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this {{pesticide}} still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of <b>fipronil</b> on honey bees. <b>Fipronil</b> is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.|$|E
25|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (<b>Fipronil),</b> or permethrin (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|E
500|$|In February 2007, {{about 40}} French deputies, led by Jacques Remiller of the UMP, {{requested}} {{the creation of}} a parliamentary investigation commission on overmortality of bees, underlining that honey production had decreased by 1,000 tons a year for a decade. By August 2007, no investigation had opened. Five other insecticides based on <b>fipronil</b> were also accused of killing bees. However, the scientific committees of the European Union are still of the opinion [...] "that the available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and EU-member-states should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in their country." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{remedies}} {{have been}} tried {{in the search for}} control of the major pest species of cockroaches, which are resilient and fast-breeding. Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been suggested, without evidence for their effectiveness. Garden herbs including [...] bay, catnip, mint, cucumber, and garlic have been proposed as repellents. Poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or <b>fipronil,</b> and boric acid powder is effective on adults. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective. In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, the {{interaction}} of the phenomenon of [...] "dying bees" [...] with imidacloprid has been discussed for quite some time. A study from the [...] "Comité Scientifique et Technique (CST)" [...] {{was at the center of}} discussion, and led to a partial ban of imidacloprid in France. The imidacloprid pesticide Gaucho was banned in 1999 by the French Minister of Agriculture Jean Glavany, primarily due to concern over potential effects on honey bees. Subsequently, when <b>fipronil,</b> a phenylpyrazole insecticide and in Europe mainly labeled [...] "Regent", was used as a replacement, it was also found to be toxic to bees, and banned partially in France in 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{difficulty}} of eradicating meat ants {{has led to}} further studies. Two studies between 1996 and 2002 studied the effects of granular baits on meat ant colonies. Bait containing hydramethylnon and <b>fipronil</b> effectively {{reduced the number of}} workers foraging. However, this was only effective when [...] of bait was placed on citrus trees or onto mounds. The ant bait Amdro was used in a recent study to identify an effective method of eradicating meat ants, but results showed that the bait failed to reduce ant populations significantly. There was evidence that the amount of active mounds declined, but this effect was only temporary. This is due to colonies only having [...] of bait which was insufficient to eliminate further nests, but the effect may have been more dramatic if extra bait was used.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{pesticides}} {{are currently}} {{used against the}} small hive beetle. [...] The chemical <b>fipronil</b> (marketed as Combat Roach Gel [...] ) is commonly applied inside the corrugations {{of a piece of}} cardboard. [...] Standard corrugations are large enough that a small hive beetle can enter the cardboard through the end, but small enough that honey bees cannot enter (thus are kept away from the pesticide). [...] Alternative controls such as oil-based top-bar traps are also available, but they have had very little commercial success.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fipronil</b> bait is more {{effective}} and kills faster than Hydramethylnon. Mortality rates caused by secondary transmission are higher for <b>Fipronil</b> bait than for Hydramethylnon bait. <b>Fipronil</b> is a [...] "Group C - possible human carcinogen" [...] and has caused tumors in rats, particularly thyroid tumors.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{of acute}} {{toxicity}} via ingestion includes sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, agitation, weakness, and tonic-clonic seizures. Clinical signs {{of exposure to}} <b>fipronil</b> are generally reversible and resolve spontaneously. As of 2011, no data were available regarding the chronic effects of <b>fipronil</b> on humans. The U.S. EPA has classified <b>fipronil</b> as a group C (possible human) carcinogen based on an increase in thyroid follicular cell tumors in both sexes of the rat. However, as of 2011, no human data is available regarding the carcinogenic effects of <b>fipronil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Regent is a {{trademark}} {{for a broad}} spectrum systemic insecticide containing the active ingredient <b>fipronil.</b> <b>Fipronil</b> is an insecticide discovered and developed by Rhône-Poulenc between 1985-87.

5000|$|<b>Fipronil</b> was {{discovered}} and developed by Rhône-Poulenc between 1985 and 1987, {{and placed on}} the market in 1993 under the [...] Between 1987 and 1996, <b>fipronil</b> was evaluated on more than 250 insect pests on 60 crops worldwide, and crop protection accounted for about 39% of total <b>fipronil</b> production in 1997. Since 2003, BASF holds the patent rights for producing and selling fipronil-based products in many countries.|$|E
5000|$|The active {{ingredient}} <b>Fipronil</b> [...]05% disrupts the insect central nervous system, {{leading to the}} cockroach’s death in 6 to 24 hours. Cockroaches nestling together transfer insecticide to one another by touch. <b>Fipronil</b> acts as an insecticide with contact, and stomach action. It is sparingly soluble in water and is stable at normal temperatures for one year. <b>Fipronil</b> is an extremely active molecule and is a potent disruptor of the insect central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|An early-lifestage {{toxicity}} {{study in}} rainbow trout found that <b>fipronil</b> affects larval growth with a NOEC of 0.0066 ppm and an LOEC of 0.015 ppm. The metabolite MB 46136 is more toxic than the parent to freshwater fish (6.3 times more toxic to rainbow trout and 3.3 times more toxic to bluegill sunfish). Based on an acute daphnia study using <b>fipronil</b> and three supplemental studies using its metabolites, <b>fipronil</b> is characterized as highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|One {{insecticide}} in Brazil is <b>Fipronil</b> which inhibits GABA receptors of {{the nervous}} system, resulting in seizures, paralysis, and death. S. postica is in contact with <b>Fipronil</b> which is extremely toxic to bees. Compared to other bees, S. postica tolerate higher doses of <b>Fipronil,</b> but the toxicity is still high. Another toxic insecticide widely used in Brazil is Imidacloprid. Similar to <b>Fipronil,</b> S. postica are relatively more tolerant of this insecticide. The route of intoxication {{is very important in}} determining how lethal Imidacloprid is to the S. postica bees. Imidacloprid is significantly more toxic to S. postica through topical exposure compared to consumption of the insecticide. The increase in use of pesticides could cause a decline in pollinators like S. postica hurting the environments of Brazil.|$|E
50|$|In May 2003, the French Directorate-General of Food at the Ministry of Agriculture {{determined}} that a case of mass bee mortality observed in southern France was related to acute <b>fipronil</b> toxicity. Toxicity was linked to defective seed treatment, which generated dust. In February 2003, the ministry decided to temporarily suspend the sale of BASF crop protection products containing <b>fipronil</b> in France. The seed treatment involved has since been banned. <b>Fipronil</b> was used in a broad spraying to control locusts in Madagascar in a program that began in 1997.|$|E
