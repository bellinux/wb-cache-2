5|$|March 6, 2007: Jordan's {{hometown}} newspaper publishes {{an article}} casting {{doubts about his}} January 2007 claims on his Wikia userpage that he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States Trustee Program and had been a Kentucky paralegal.|$|E
5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed {{after a series of}} violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E
5|$|Hao Fengjun, another {{defector}} to Australia, <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 610 Office of Tianjin {{city and}} claims that his job involved {{the collection and}} analysis of intelligence reports on Falun Gong from Europe, Australia, and North America. The implication was that local 610 offices {{are involved in the}} espionage efforts abroad. Another defector from China's Ministry of State Security—which conducts both domestic and international intelligence—claimed that the repression and monitoring of underground Christians and Falun Gong practitioners is a major focus of the ministry.|$|E

5|$|The sixth {{production}} of Union Films, Soeara Berbisa {{was produced by}} Ang Hock Liem and directed by R Hu, an ethnic Chinese director who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company since 1940; the sound technician Boen Kin Nam served as assistant director. The screenplay was written by Djojopranoto, who replaced Union's former screenwriter Saeroen after the latter left for rival company Star Film following Wanita dan Satria (1941). The film began production by September 1941, and by October it was nearly complete.|$|E
5|$|During his quest, the Kid meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Nordale hired {{a recent}} University of Alaska Fairbanks {{graduate}} named Bob Bartlett. Bartlett <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> paper during school vacations, {{but he made}} journalism a full-time job following graduation. For four years, Bartlett was the only reporter (other than the editor) who regularly wrote local stories. In late 1930, Bartlett was made the paper's assistant editor {{in lieu of a}} raise that the paper couldn't afford to pay. Bartlett remained the paper's assistant editor until 1933, when he became the secretary to Anthony Dimond, Alaska's delegate to the U.S. Congress. Bartlett became the delegate to Congress in 1945, and in 1958, when Alaska hosted its first election for state office, Bartlett was elected one of its first two U.S. Senators.|$|E

5|$|On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began {{presiding}} over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew {{to make it to}} court. The trial was held at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been imposed by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and $5,000 fine. This federal court decision with constitutional and war power issues made news around the country.|$|E
5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E
5|$|To {{generate}} {{support for}} the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hull and Barnsley Railway. His task was {{to set up committees}} in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees. A large meeting of the working classes, attended by several local notables including the general secretaries of several trade unions, was held on 13November at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape—two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz—the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present—briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the hostages were embassy staff—predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer tasked with guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from Battersea, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> embassy in various positions since 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Sunday Times is a British {{national}} broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister {{paper of}} The Times. In 1968, under {{the ownership of}} Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times {{had been involved in}} a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's Place in History (1965).|$|E
