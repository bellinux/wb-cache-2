40|$|This {{article is}} the result of {{interviews}} with teachers, students, and school librarians in eight UK secondary schools regarding their use of multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> on CD-ROM. It focuses on a content analysis of their comments on how having access to multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> changes the way students work and learn in school, how they perceive it enhances their learning, and how it hinders it. Teachers reported that they used multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> as an additional information resource, or because their use was motivating to the students. Some said that having multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> had no effect on their teaching. However, they were not so much using multimedia resources within their teaching, but sending students out of their lessons to the library to use them. The most important factor, by far, in the students' motivation to use multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> in school was that they found them quick and easy to use. There was also strong support for motivation through the graphics, video, and sound on the CD-ROM. There was some support for the students being motivated because they were allowed to be in control of their learning. To {{make the most of the}} potential of multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> for enhancing students' learning in schools, it is recommended that a large and early emphasis needs to be placed on the teaching of information handling and research skills. Students pre- pared in this way will be better equipped to enjoy the more open, independent learning tasks to which multimedia <b>encyclopaedias</b> so readily lend themselves...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} on-going {{research on}} the production of knowledge in contemporary professional digital <b>encyclopaedias.</b> By adopting a theoretical perspective that considers the interplay of humans, non-humans and practices at the same level, it develops further a socio-technical perspective on knowledge production. Methodologically, the project involves an ethnographic study staring from two editorial sites – the Swedish Nationalencyklopedin and the Norwegian Store Norske Leksikon. The empirical material consists of participatory observations, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, internal documents, {{as well as the}} two <b>encyclopaedias</b> appearance on the web, in social and legacy media. The preliminary results point to a co-existence of old and new orders of knowledge. Traditional taxonomies and formal expertise blend with social media, Google Analytics and new orders of work. The way <b>encyclopaedias</b> adjust to Google exemplifies, albeit in different ways, the fundamental role of ‘management by Google’ in contemporary networked society. It is concluded that digital <b>encyclopaedias,</b> Wikipedia as well as Nationalencyklopedin and Norwegian Store Norske Leksikon, constitute interesting arenas for investigating changing demands on the production of public knowledge...|$|R
