40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the rheology and processing of solvent-free core shell ?polymer opals? that consist of a soft outer shell grafted to hard colloidal polymer core particles. Strong iridescent colours can be produced by shearing the material in a certain way that causes the initially disordered spheres to rearrange into ordered crystalline structures and produce colours by diffraction and interference of multiple light scattering, similar to gemstone opals. The basic linear viscoelastic rheology of a polymer opal sample was determined as a function of temperature and the material was found to be highly viscoelastic at all tested temperatures. A Cambridge Multipass Rheometer (MPR) was specifically modified in order to make controlled mechanical measurements of initially disordered polymer opal tapes that were sandwiched between protective PET sheets. Axial extension, simple shear and a novel ?<b>edge</b> <b>shearing?</b> geometry were all evaluated and multiple successive experiments of the <b>edge</b> <b>shearing</b> test were carried out at different temperatures. The optical development of colloidal ordering, measured as optical opalescence, was quantified by spectroscopy using visible backscattered light. The development of opalescence was found {{to be sensitive to the}} geometry of deformation and a number of process variables suggesting a complex interaction of parameters that caused the opalescence. In order to identify aspects of the deformation mechanism of the <b>edge</b> <b>shearing</b> experiment, a separate series of in situ optical experiments were carried out and this helped indicate the extent of simple shear generated with each <b>edge</b> <b>shear</b> deformation. The results show that strong ordering can be induced by successive <b>edge</b> <b>shearing</b> deformation. The results are relevant to polymer opal rheology, processing and mechanisms relating to ordering within complex viscoelastic fluids. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{microstructural}} {{damage in}} controlling the edge stretchability of Complex-Phase (CP) and Dual-Phase (DP) steels was evaluated using hole tension experiments. The experiments considered a tensile specimen {{with a hole}} {{at the center of}} specimen that is either <b>sheared</b> (<b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> condition) or drilled and then reamed (reamed edge condition). The damage mechanism and accumulation in the CP and DP steels were systematically characterized by interrupting the hole tension tests at different strain levels using scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and optical microscopy. Martensite cracking and decohesion of ferrite-martensite interfaces are the dominant nucleation mechanisms in the DP 780. The primary source of void nucleation in the CP 800 is nucleation at TiN particles, with secondary void formation at martensite/bainite interfaces near the failure strain. The rate of damage evolution is considerably higher for the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> in contrast with the reamed <b>edge</b> since the <b>shearing</b> process alters the microstructure in the shear affected zone (SAZ) by introducing work-hardening and initial damage behind the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge.</b> The CP microstructures were shown to be less prone to shear-induced damage than the DP materials resulting in much higher <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> formability.

A direct {{punching}} of inclined ultra-high strength {{steel sheets}} having low ductility {{was carried out}} {{to improve the quality}} of the <b>sheared</b> <b>edge.</b> In the direct punching of an inclined sheet, the contact between the sheet and punch became gradual because of touch from the bottom edge of the punch, and thus the sheared portion tended to bend in the latter half of punching.

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>shear</b> {{flow and}} its effect on {{regulating}} turbulent transport have long been suspected {{to play an important role}} in plasmas operating near the Greenwald density limit n_G. In this study, equilibrium profiles as well as the turbulent particle flux and Reynolds stress across the separatrix in the HL- 2 A tokamak are examined as n_G is approached in ohmic L-mode discharges. As the normalized line-averaged density n̅_e/n_G is raised, the shearing rate of the mean poloidal flow ω_ sh drops, and the turbulent drive for the low-frequency zonal flow (the Reynolds power P_Re) collapses. Correspondingly, the turbulent particle transport increases drastically with increasing collision rates. The geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) gain more energy from the ambient turbulence at higher densities, but have smaller shearing rate than low-frequency zonal flows. The increased density also introduces decreased adiabaticity which not only enhances the particle transport but is also related to a reduction in the eddy-tilting and the Reynolds power. Both effects may lead to the cooling of edge plasmas and therefore the onset of MHD instabilities that limit the plasma density...|$|R

To achieve this good blanking edge quality in fine-blanking, quite a large number of factors need to be considered simultaneously during the operation, such as blanking speed, processing material, product shape, lubrication and tool geometry. Thus, the objective of this paper is mainly to study the influence of tool geometry change in fine-blanking for different materials. This is because the nose radius usually seriously deteriorates with increasing service period in mass production, which eventually causes the entire loss of the specific features of the fine-blanking process.

40|$|In recent years, Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) {{have been}} used for the {{lightweight}} structural design and manufacturing in automotive industry. This class of sheet metals are prone to edge fracture during stamping production, and the fracture often occurs at much lower strain than that predicted based on the forming limit curves. The uncertainty in predicting edge fracture represents a great challenge in the application of AHSS. This dissertation is focused on the better understanding of edge fracture phenomenon through experimental observation and computer modeling with the consideration of microstructure effect. In this dissertation, Hole Expansion (HE) test was used to investigate the mechanisms of edge fracture of two AHSS, Dual Phase DP 780 and DP 980. The HE test includes two processing steps: hole punching and hole expanding. The punching process creates holes of various <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> morphologies, which are the input to the hole expanding process, along with the intrinsic property of material, produce a joint effect on the crack initiation and propagation on the <b>sheared</b> <b>edges</b> during HE test. The hole punching process was first investigated. The <b>sheared</b> <b>edges</b> were analyzed with image processing, and the relative heights of <b>sheared</b> four <b>edge</b> zones were measured, which were used to determine the strain distributions of <b>sheared</b> <b>edges.</b> The punching process was further simulated with FEA, and referenced with the experimental observations. Fracture mechanism of hole punching process was deduced. The process of crack initiation and propagation in hole expanding process was studied the next. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe cracks on the <b>sheared</b> <b>edges.</b> FEA simulation was applied to investigate the effect of <b>sheared</b> <b>edge</b> geometry on the stress evolution in the hole expanding process. The interaction of two neighboring parallel cracks in the crack propagation process was analyzed to explain the effect of crack population on the main crack propagation. To investigate the microstructure effect on the edge fracture, the dual phase grain structure and its effect on mechanical properties and fracture behavior of DP steels were analyzed. Based on HE test results and observed DP steel grain structures, a criterion to predict edge fracture was proposed. This criterion includes mesoscale grain structure features of DP steels, and it can be applied to predict the HE test results of DP steels. The heterogeneous microstructures of DP steels were built into the Representative Volume Element (RVE) models to study the effects of microstructure parameters and fracture mechanisms on macroscale mechanical properties of DP steels, with damage based failure criteria applied to constituent ferritic and martensitic phases...|$|R
