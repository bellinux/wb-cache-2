40|$|Industry trends {{suggest that}} the PC and {{telephone}} user experiences will converge {{over the next several}} years. This convergence raises important questions for the HCI community: how should the PC-phone user experience be designed, and how does PC-phone technology affect work practices? This paper focuses on the first question and provides some initial data on the second question. We describe a PC-phone prototype we built called <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Telephony,</b> and we report data from an eight month field deployment of <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Telephony</b> within our company where over 7, 000 people installed the prototype. Results indicate that PC-phone software is a promising technology for the workplace and that the most valuable features may be those that help people manage their incoming calls...|$|E

40|$|Digital <b>Enhanced</b> Cordless <b>Telephony,</b> DECT, is a world-wide {{standard}} for cordless telephony that is frequently integrated into Unified Communications systems both in {{commercial and residential}} environments. DECT supports encryption to protect the confidentiality of the communications whilst allowing the interoperability between products from different models and manufacturers. In this paper we explore, from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint, {{the security of the}} DECT cryptographic pairing process, which plays a vital role in the security chain of Unified Communications systems involving DECT technology. Furthermore, we demonstrate a practical security attack against the DECT pairing process that is able to retrieve the cryptographic keys and decrypt in real-time any subsequent encrypted voice communication. We also present a proposal for a more secure alternative cryptographic pairing process that is not vulnerable to this type of passive attack. JRC. G. 6 -Digital Citizen Securit...|$|R
50|$|The IN concepts, {{architecture}} and protocols were originally developed as standards by the ITU-T {{which is the}} standardization committee of the International Telecommunication Union; prior to this a number of telecommunications providers had proprietary implementations. The primary aim of the IN was to <b>enhance</b> the core <b>telephony</b> services offered by traditional telecommunications networks, which usually amounted to making and receiving voice calls, sometimes with call divert. This core would then provide a basis upon which operators could build services {{in addition to those}} already present on a standard telephone exchange.|$|R
40|$|The Cisco Unified IP Phone 7965 G and 7945 G are full-featured {{telephones}} {{that provide}} voice communication over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. These phones function much like digital business phones, {{allowing you to}} place and receive phone calls and to access features such as mute, hold, transfer, speed dial, call forward, and more. In addition, because Cisco Unified IP Phones are connected to your data network, they offer <b>enhanced</b> IP <b>telephony</b> features, including access to network information and services, and customizeable features and services. The phones also support security features that include file authentication, device authentication, signaling encryption, and media encryption. A Cisco Unified IP Phone, like other network devices, must be configured and managed. These phones encode G. 711 a, G. 711 Âµ, G. 722, G. 729 a, G. 729 ab, iLBC, and decode G. 711 a, G. 711 u, G. 722, iLBC, G. 729, G 729 a, G 729 b, and G 729 ab. These phones also support uncompressed wideband (16 bits, 16 kHz) audio. This chapter includes the following topics...|$|R

Using the intelligent network (IN) approach for supporting telecommunications services enables the use of productivity-enhancing techniques for the creation of new services. Rather than creating new services by cutting fresh software code, modules of service-independent logic can be arranged using graphical user interfaces. As a result, advanced telecommunications services, which are independent of the central switch, can be created more quickly than ever...|$|R
40|$|Emergency " 911 " {{service is}} a {{critical}} service provided in the public switched telephone network. With the increasing demand to introduce IP Telephony, the issue of providing 911 service in the new environment will arise. In this paper, we {{address the issue of}} emergency 911 service in the TCP-UDP/IP network architecture that supports enhanced emergency features. We identify the functionalities needed in this environment. In particular, we outline a Location Resolution Protocol that is needed for the infrastructure; further, we describe various components in the E 911 -IP environment, and present a conceptual view on how the service can be provided when the Location Resolution Protocol is coupled with other existing and proposed protocols. In addition, we present the call initialization processing steps in the new environment.

40|$|I {{would like}} to express my deepest {{gratitude}} to my great supervisor, Professor Bernard Pagurek, for his constant guidance, patience, inspiration, advice and encouragement throughout the research work and {{the preparation of this}} thesis. His constant striving for creative and rigorous research influenced many aspects of my life. I benefited greatly from his profound knowledge and experience in the field. I am grateful to all my colleagues in the Network Management Lab, for their help. I {{would like to}} thank AT&T for providing the thesis project and financial assistance. I {{would also like to thank}} V. M. Bell for her help.
