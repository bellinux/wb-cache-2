25|$|Additionally, President Sarkozy {{pledged to}} sell Libya three civil nuclear power {{stations}} {{as part of}} a package of trade and assistance that will boost the role of French companies in the oil-rich country. During his visit to Libya on 25 July 2007, Sarkozy signed an agreement of cooperation on civil nuclear technology. He decided to build three civil nuclear power stations for the Libyan state. According to Paris, the nuclear power stations are meant for <b>desalinization</b> of sea water, but Le Monde has pointed out that the Libyans quickly bypassed any reference to <b>desalinization.</b> This deal was criticized by the French left-wing and also by German governmental sources, including Deputy Foreign Minister Gernot Erler, Greens leader Reinhard Buetikofer and SPD deputy Ulrich Kelber. And during Tony Blair's visit end of May 2007, the British group BP signed a natural gas contract for 900 million dollars.|$|E
25|$|South Korea {{has carried}} {{out a lot of}} {{construction}} work on the Liancourt Rocks. Today, the islands house a lighthouse, a helicopter pad, a large South Korean flag visible from the air, a post box, a staircase, and police barracks. In 2007, two <b>desalinization</b> plants were built capable of producing 28 tons of clean water every day. Both of the major South Korean telecommunications companies have installed cellular telephone towers on the islets.|$|E
25|$|To {{add to the}} {{efficiency}} of the Israeli system - the reclaimed sewage water may be mixed with reclaimed sea water (Plans are in action to increase the <b>desalinization</b> program up to 50% of the countries usage by 2013 - 600 billion liters of drinkable sea water a year), along with aquifer water and fresh sweet lake water - monitored by computer to account for the nationwide needs and input. This action reduced the outdated risk of salt and mineral percentages in the water. Plans to implement this overall usage of reclaimed water for drinking are discouraged by the psychological preconception of the public for the quality of reclaimed water, and the fear of its origin.|$|E
500|$|The {{west coast}} of Florida relies on <b>desalinization</b> for its fresh water; the {{quantity}} demanded is too great for the land to provide. Nitrates in the underground water system {{and high levels of}} mercury also impact the quality of fresh water the park receives. In 1998 a Florida panther was found dead in Shark Water Slough, with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Increased occurrences of algal blooms and red tide in Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay have been traced to the amounts of controlled water released from Lake Okeechobee. The brochure given to all visitors at Everglades National Park includes a statement that reads, [...] "Freshwater flowing into the park is engineered. With the help of pumps, floodgates, and retention ponds along the park's boundary, the Everglades is presently on life support, alive but diminished." ...|$|E

2500|$|The islets are {{volcanic}} rocks, {{with only}} {{a thin layer of}} soil and moss. About 49 plant species, 107 bird species, and 93 insect species have been found to inhabit the islets, in addition to local marine life with 160 algal and 368 invertebrate species identified. Although between 1,100 and 1,200 litres of fresh water flow daily, <b>desalinization</b> plants have been installed on the islets for human consumption because existing spring water suffers from guano contamination. Since the early 1970s trees and some types of flowers were planted. [...] According to historical records, there used to be trees indigenous to Liancourt Rocks, which have supposedly been wiped out by overharvesting and fires caused by bombing drills over the islets. [...] A recent investigation, however, identified ten spindle trees aged 100–120 years. Cetaceans such as Minke whales, orcas, and dolphins are known to migrate through these areas.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Le Parisien alleged on 13 August 2007 {{that the}} {{agreement}} concerning nuclear technologies did not concern <b>desalinization</b> of sea water, but focused in particular on the ERP third-generation nuclear reactor, worth $3 billion. The Parisian newspaper cited Philippe Delaune, the deputy of {{the deputy director of}} international affairs of the CEA atomic agency. It is the main share-holder of Areva, the firm which products ERP reactors. Although the French President denied any relationship between the deal with Areva and the liberation of the six, Le Parisien points out a troubling chronology: Areva was called to present its products to Libya at the end of June 2007, a short time before the release of the six. The French Socialist Party, through the voice of Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was [...] "geopolitically irresponsible." [...] The German government also denounced the agreement. Through Siemens, they retain 34% of the shares of Areva's subsidiary in charge of building the ERP (Areva NP).|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{industrial}} period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As {{the industrial}} period progressed however, this view began {{to be replaced by}} a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted. In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. <b>Desalinization</b> and <b>desalinization</b> plants play a major role also.|$|E

50|$|One {{major part}} of the plan {{consists}} of a canal between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. In May 2008, Yitzhak Tshuva, an Israeli businessman, announced plans to launch this project.

50|$|As <b>desalinization</b> and {{purification}} {{of water}} is critical for obtaining deionized water for laboratory research, large-scale chemical synthesis in industry and consumer applications, the use of porous materials for this application has received particular interest. Capacitive deionization operates in a fashion with similarities to a supercapacitor. As an ion-containing water (electrolyte) is flown between two porous electrodes with an applied potential across the system, the corresponding ions assemble into a double layer in the pores of the two terminals, decreasing the ion content in the liquid exiting the purification device. Due {{to the ability of}} carbide-derived carbons to closely match the size of ions in the electrolyte, side-by-side comparisons of <b>desalinization</b> devices based on CDCs and activated carbon showed a significant efficiency increase in the 1.2-1.4 V range compared to activated carbon.|$|E

50|$|Urbanization causes ground, water, and air pollution. Increasingly {{urban areas}} {{call for more}} desalinated water and a growing water sector. <b>Desalinization</b> plants use {{greenhouse}} gasses and are highly inefficient. The process of oil extraction also contributes to air pollution by emitting high rates of carbon dioxide. Excess greenhouse gas emissions deplete the ozone and raise global temperatures.|$|E

5000|$|Jordan {{has little}} water, and dams in Syria have reduced its {{available}} water sources over the years. Confronted by {{this lack of}} water, Jordan is preparing new techniques to use non-conventional water resources, such as second-hand use of irrigation water and <b>desalinization</b> techniques, which are very costly and are not yet used. A <b>desalinization</b> project will soon be started in Hisban, south of Amman. The Disi groundwater project, {{in the south of}} Jordan, will cost at least $250 million to bring out water. Along with the Al-Wehda Dam on the Yarmouk River, it is one of Jordan's largest strategic projects. The dam was first proposed in 1953 as part of the Johnston mission's Unified Plan; however, political differences between Israel and Jordan prevented construction from beginning until 2004. The dam is currently listed as a [...] "Work in Progress" [...] on the website of the Turkish contractor Ozaltin.|$|E
