40|$|The {{usage of}} plants, plant {{extracts}} or plant-derived pure chemicals to treat disease become a therapeutic modality, which has {{stood the test}} of time. Today several pharmacological classes of drugs include a natural product prototype. Aspirin, atropine, ephedrine, digoxin, morphine, quinine, reserpine and tubocurarine are a few examples of modern drugs, which were originally discovered through the study of traditional cures and folk knowledge of indigenous people. A team work amongst ethnobotanists, <b>ethnopharmacologists,</b> physicians and phytochemists is must for the fruitful outcome on medicinal plants research. While the <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> have a greater role in the rationalization of combination of activities, the phytochemist’s role will slightly shift towards standardization of herbal medicines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ethnopharmacology {{is at the}} {{intersection}} of the medical, natural, and social sciences. Despite its interdisciplinary nature, most ethnopharmacological research has been based on the combination of the chemical, biological, and pharmacological sciences. Far less attention has been given to the social sciences, including anthropology and the study of traditional knowledge systems. Methods I reviewed the literature on traditional knowledge systems highlighting its potential theoretical and methodological contributions to ethnopharmacology. Results I discuss three potential theoretical contributions of traditional knowledge systems to ethnopharmacological research. First, while many plants used in indigenous pharmacopoeias have active compounds, those compounds do not always act alone in indigenous healing systems. Research highlights the holistic nature of traditional knowledge systems and helps understand plant's efficacy in its cultural context. Second, research on traditional knowledge systems can improve our understanding of how ethnopharmacological knowledge is distributed in a society, and who benefits from it. Third, research on traditional knowledge systems can enhance the study of the social relations that enable the generation, maintenance, spread, and devolution of cultural traits and innovations, including ethnopharmacological knowledge. At a methodological level, some <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> have used anthropological tools to understand the context of plant use and local meanings of health and disease. I discuss two more potential methodological contributions of research on traditional knowledge systems to ethnopharmacological research. First, traditional knowledge systems research has developed methods that would help <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> understand how people classify illnesses and remedies, a fundamental aspect of folk medicinal plant selection criteria. Second, <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> could also borrow methods derived from cultural consensus theory to have a broader look at intracultural variation and at the analysis of transmission and loss of traditional ethnopharmacological knowledge. Conclusions Ethical considerations in the ethnopharmacology of the 21 st century should go beyond the recognition of the Intellectual Property Rights or the acquisition of research permits, to include considerations on the healthcare of the original holders of ethnopharmacological knowledge. Ethnopharmacology can do more than speed up to recover the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples to make it available for the development of new drugs. <b>Ethnopharmacologists</b> can work with health care providers in the developing world for the local implementation of ethnopharmacological research results. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{what extent}} do <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> from diverse {{disciplines}} share a vision of what ethnopharmacology is and what it might become? This question was explored several years ago through content analysis of the Journal of Ethnopharmacology (JEP), the official journal of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology (ISE). The analysis revealed that although the published articles represent the breadth of natural and social sciences, most studies are themselves not synthetic or interdisciplinary. For the present study, analysis was extended through the most recently published issues of the JEP and compared, for the same time period, to {{the subject matter of}} another natural products journal, Pharmaceutical Biology. Whereas research published in the JEP better represents the interdisciplinary objectives of that journal, the difference is not striking. By way of illustration, several studies are reviewed that represent the unique, synthetic perspective that is highlighted in the mission statements of both the JEP and the ISE. The conclusion underscores the lack of clarity in research objectives and suggests that <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> of all backgrounds can enhance their work by projecting pharmacologic data against a backdrop of medical ethnography and by enriching cultural interpretations of medical actions by exploring the physiologic potential of plants. © 2001 Elsevier Scienc...|$|R
40|$|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: "Reverse pharmacology", {{also called}} "bedside-to-bench" or "field to pharmacy" approach, is a {{research}} process starting with documentation of clinical outcome as observed by patients with different therapeutic regimens. The treatment most significantly associated with cure is selected for future studies: first, clinical safety and efficacy; then in vivo and vitro studies. Some clinical data, i. e. details on patient status and progress, can be collected during ethnobotanical surveys; they will help clinical researchers and, once effectiveness and safety are established, will also help users of traditional medicine make safer and more effective choices. To gather clinical data successfully, <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> need to be backed by an appropriate team of specialists in medicine and epidemiology. <b>Ethnopharmacologists</b> can also gather important data on traditional medicine safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The {{first step is to}} create a consensus on the meaning of "clinical data", their interest and importance. An understanding of why "a cure is not a proof of effectiveness" is a starting point to avoid faulty interpretation of the clinical observations. RESULTS: Experience showed that, with the "bedside-to-bench" approach, a treatment derived from traditional recipe can be scientifically validated (in terms of safety and effectiveness) with a cost of less than a million euros, thus providing an end-product that is affordable, available and sustainable. CONCLUSIONS: With rigorous clinical study results, medicinal plant users gain the possibility to refine heath strategies. The field surveyor may gain a better relationship with the population, once she/he is seen as bringing information useful for the quality of care in the community...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} scientific {{approach is}} empirical. One of the favoured means of gathering quantitative {{data in the}} health and social sciences, including ethnopharmacology and medical ethnobotany, is by use of questionnaires. However, while there are numerous published articles discussing the importance of questionnaire content, the fact that questionnaires themselves may be inappropriate {{in a number of}} cultural contexts, even where literacy is not a factor, is usually ignored. In this paper, the authors will address the main issues posed by the use of questionnaire surveys, using case studies based on their own personal experiences as <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> ‘in the field’. The pros and cons of qualitative and quantitative research and the use of alternative means to elicit quantitative data will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The East African {{region is}} highly endowed with plant biodiversity, {{and it is}} {{estimated}} that there are over 21 000 higher plant species in the region. This provides <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> {{with a wide range of}} plant species for phytochemical and pharmacological studies. In addition, the region is home to one of the ecological hotspots of plant species, the Eastern Arc Mountains, along the eastern coast of Tanzania. Much of the ethnopharmacological work conducted using plant samples from East Africa has involved higher plants, most of which are endemic. As a result, novel natural products with intriguing chemical structures and pharmacological properties have been elucidated. This review presents the anticancer, antimalarial, antimicrobial, anti-HIV and antileishmanial natural products isolated from medicinal plants growing in East Africa (Table 1).

50|$|The Fabiana genus {{has been}} studied by <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> due {{to the use of}} {{extracts}} from species within the genus in traditional South American medicine. The plants are employed as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory (through infusions and decoctions), as well as to set broken bones using the resin exuding foliage and branches. European researchers have periodically studied the medicinal value of the plant since as early as 1877. A range of current studies have validated the diuretic and anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant for Fabiana species including F. imbricata F. patagonica, F. punnensis, F. densa, and particularly, F. bryoides, which also inhibited spontaneous mutanogenisis in the bacterium Salmonella typhimumrium by up to 50% with no impact on cell viability. The foliage of F. imbricata, specifically has been traditionally employed as a diueretic and digestive and has been proven to have a dose-dependent gastroprotective effect, in studies evaluating the main sesquiterpene of the foliage. Interest in F. imbricata has extended into the development of invitro culturing of the plant’s tissue for the harvesting of secondary metabolites for further research.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the ethnopharmacological knowledge {{of women in}} an urban Mexican migrant community in Athens, GA, USA. Data were collected using free-list, pile-sort and semi-structured interviews. The pharmacopoeia of this community includes herbal remedies, over-the-counter medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prescription medicines. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis of pile-sort data revealed that Mexican women living in Athens classify medicines into four categories: herbal remedies, salves, pastillas (pills-both prescription and non-prescription) and other commercial preparations. Herbal remedies are viewed as natural and safe while pastillas {{are thought to be}} dangerous and potentially addictive. Comparisons of Mexican explanations for the actions of five medicines (Matricaria recutita L. [Asteraceae], Mentha spp. L. [Lamiaceae], Ruta spp. L. [Rutaceae], Ocimum basilicum L. [Lamiaceae] and paracetemol) with the pharmacological literature show several similarities and confirm that migrant women use these medicines effectively. Mexican migrant women use medicinal plants in combination with commercially produced medicines, but most have a strong preference for the herbal remedies that they make themselves, over drugs prescribed by physicians. Some of their descriptions of the actions of medicines are supported by the pharmacological literature, but <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> have not fully investigated all of the attributes that migrant women ascribe to them...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResearch {{efforts are}} {{unevenly}} distributed between categories of ecosystem services, with regulating services receiving more interest from scientists than provisioning and cultural services. Whereas food provision {{is the most}} commonly studied provisioning services, products collected from ecosystems for medicinal and aromatic purposes are overlooked. <b>Ethnopharmacologists</b> have studied the contribution of wild plants to human well-being, {{but there have been}} few attempts to relate this contribution to the concept of ecosystem services. Existing studies highlighted the fact that the poorest populations are the most dependent on biological products for their two contributions to human health (medicine) and livelihoods (incomes through medicinal product trade). In developing countries, the cost and the accessibility of formal health care systems explains the use of alternative medicine and medicinal plants even though it has been observed that people may also prefer traditional medicine for cultural, religious or spiritual reasons. Plant collector are often rural dwellers that are economically marginalized, such as landless people or women. Using semi-structured interviews and participative workshops, we identified the most used wild medicinal plants in two watersheds of Apurimac region, Peru. We analyzed their distribution and harvesting patterns (maps of ecosystem service supply or use) and we described their uses and contributions to different component of well-being. Results showed that most people collected wild plants for medicinal purposes and that more than 80 % of interviewees had a strong to medium economic dependence to plant harvesting. These elements offer interesting insight for local decision-makers since a restriction or control of harvest could deeply affect livelihoods with high economic dependence. Small-scale cultivation and the diffusion of sustainable harvesting practices could be considered as alternative strategies for wild plant conservation...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{discovery}} and development (very often unknowingly) {{is based on}} traditional and local knowledge about a species’ medical use or toxicological effects (both desired and undesired effects). The list of compounds ultimately derived from such knowledge is very long indeed and includes morphine, codeine, and aspirin {{to name just a}} few but also drugs licensed relatively recently like galanthamine and artemisinine. Here I review this link and – using examples of new drugs currently under development preclinically or in clinical trials – discuss how such new drugs have been ‘discovered’, or more precisely developed into a clinically used medication. Field-based ethnopharmacological studies are the most essential basis for such drug development efforts. Such studies have a multitude of theoretical and applied goals and in fact only very few are in any way directly linked with projects in the area of drug discovery. One of the core tasks of <b>ethnopharmacologists</b> is to ascertain that such traditional knowledge is safe-guarded and remains an integral and appreciated part of a culture and that – if commercial products are developed from such knowledge – both the material and immaterial benefits are distributed equitably. Preclinical (i. e., pharmacological and phytochemical) research has been conducted on numerous plants using a multitude of pharmacological targets. Such knowledge is not only an element of drug development, but also contributes to our understanding of the effects of such local and traditional medicines. Some recent examples of clinical developments of drug leads into new medicines highlight the potential of such knowledge-based drug development programs. Many new drug leads are ‘poster children’ of ethnopharmacology-driven drug development programs. Lastly, some extracts that are complex mixtures of active and inactive constituents have been developed and are used now clinically. Ethnopharmacology and drug development can be understood only if a truly multidisciplinary approach is taken, and this is one of the most exciting and promising challenges of the field – it requires a dialogue not only between disciplines but also between cultures...|$|R
40|$|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ethnopharmacology {{focuses on}} the {{understanding}} of local and indigenous use of medicines and therefore an emic approach is inevitable. Often, however, standard biomedical disease classifications are used to describe and analyse local diseases and remedies. Standard classifications might be a valid tool for cross-cultural comparisons and bioprospecting purposes but are not suitable to understand the local perception of disease and use of remedies. Different standard disease classification system exist but their suitability for cross-cultural comparisons of ethnomedical data has never been assessed. Depending on the research focus, (I) ethnomedical, (II) cross-cultural, and (III) bioprospecting, we provide suggestions {{for the use of}} specific classification systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyse three different standard biomedical classification systems (the International Classification of Diseases (ICD); the Economic Botany Data Collection Standard (EBDCS); and the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC)), and discuss their value for categorizing diseases of ethnomedical systems and their suitability for cross-cultural research in ethnopharmacology. Moreover, based on the biomedical uses of all approved plant derived biomedical drugs, we propose a biomedical therapy-based classification system as a guide for the discovery of drugs from ethnopharmacological sources. RESULTS: Widely used standards, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) by the WHO and the Economic Botany Data Collection Standard (EBDCS) are either technically challenging due to a categorization system based on clinical examinations, which are usually not possible during field research (ICD) or lack clear biomedical criteria combining disorders and medical effects in an imprecise and confusing way (EBDCS). The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), also accepted by the WHO, has more in common with ethnomedical reality than the ICD or the EBDCS, as the categories are designed according to patient's perceptions and are less influenced by clinical medicine.

40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: In 1962 <b>ethnopharmacologists,</b> Hofmann and Wasson, {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Oaxaca, Mexico. These two researchers were the first scientists to collect a flowering specimen of Salvia divinorum allowing the identification of this species. While the species 2 ̆ 7 traditional use is confined to a very small region of Mexico, since Hofmann and Wasson 2 ̆ 7 s expedition 50 years ago, Salvia divinorum has become globally recognized for its main active constituent, the diterpene salvinorin A, which has a unique effect on human physiology. Salvinorin A is a kappa-opioid agonist and the first reported psychoactive diterpene. Methods: This review concentrates on the investigation of Salvia divinorum over the last 50 years including ethnobotany, ethnopharmacology, taxonomy, systematics, genetics, chemistry and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic research. For {{the purpose of this}} review, online search engines were used to find relevant research. Searches were conducted between October 2011 and September 2013 using the search term “Salvia divinorum”. Papers were excluded if they described synthetic chemical synthesis of salvinorin A or analogues. Results: Ethnobotanically there is a comprehensive body of research describing the traditional Mazatec use of the plant, however, the modern ethnobotanical use of this plant is not well documented. There are a limited number of botanical investigations into this plant and there are still several aspects of the botany of Salvia divinorum which need further investigation. One study has investigated the phylogenetic relationship of Salvia divinorum to other species in the genus. To date the main focus of chemistry research on Salvia divinorum has been salvinorin A, the main active compound in Salvia divinorum, and other related diterpenoids. Finally, the effects of salvinorin A, a KOR agonist, have primarily been investigated using animal models. Conclusions: As Salvia divinorum use increases worldwide, the emerging cultural use patterns will warrant more research. More botanical information is also needed to better understand this species, including germination, pollination vector and {{a better understanding of the}} endemic environment of Salvia divinorum. As well there is a gap in the genetic knowledge of this species and very little is known about its intra-species genetics. The terpenes in Salvia divinorum are very well documented, however, other classes of constituents in this species warrant further investigation and identification. To date, the majority of the pharmacology research on Salvia divinorum has focused on the effects of salvinorin A using animal models. Published human studies have not reported any harmful effects when salvinorin A is administered within the dose range of 0. 375 – 21 µg/kg but what are the implications when applied to a larger population? More data on the toxicology and safety of Salvia divinorum are needed before larger scale clinical trials of the potential therapeutic effects of Salvia divinorum and salvinorin A are undertaken...|$|R
