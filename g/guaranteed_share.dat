40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{queueing}} algorithm for networks, called Hierarchical Fair Queueing (HFQ). This shares the bandwidth between classes of users, and (within each class) between subclasses. HFQ provides a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>share</b> of bandwidth to each class, but bandwidth is not wasted when a class is inactive. Unlike the Link Sharing scheme of Floyd-Jacobsen, HFQ is provably fair, in that throughput is a close approximation to the ideal sharing scheme for an infinitely divisible resource. HFQ extends the techniques of Fair Queueing of Demers-Keshav-Shenker, {{to deal with a}} hierarchy of classes. HFQ also provides bounded delays for real time traffic. We implemented HFQ as part of a real IP gateway, and performed a number of tests which demonstrate its fairness. 1. Introduction The design of a service discipline to use in network gateways has received much attention in recent years. The traditional First Come First Served (FCFS) discipline used in most gateways has proved to [...] ...|$|E
30|$|A {{quick note}} is to {{differentiate}} the citizens’ income idea from reforms currently underway in the MENA region. At {{the time of}} writing, Saudi Arabia was about to roll out a household cash grant system to compensate citizens for future energy price increases. 22 Different from the citizens’ income, these cash grants will a) be mean-tested and b) not be tied to public employment or other labor market reforms. While mean-testing can in principle make compensation schemes fiscally cheaper, they are administratively complex, especially in countries without an established income tax system. Mean-tested grants also create incentives against work and skill acquisition, as such benefits are lost as other sources of income improve. More generally, mean-tested benefits are less secure for individuals than an unconditional grant providing a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>share</b> in national wealth. Unconditional grants will arguably make other distributional reforms, such as public employment reforms, more widely acceptable among citizens. While conditional compensation grants are a step forward, they remain only a partial fix for the broader distortions created by HRC wealth sharing. Universal grants provide a more comprehensive reform option.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{focuses on}} the job {{satisfaction}} of the employees of the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh. Introduction: Almost every country irrespective of its stage of development is engaged in garment manufacturing and trading. This industry migrates from high-wage to low-wage countries like a “flying goose”. Almost, without any exception, historically, the readymade industry was the first industry a country was able to introduce, which {{eventually led to the}} development of other industries. Literature review: Literature review shows that after the liberation industrial base here in Bangladesh had to face a sudden vacuum of the entrepreneurs (who were mainly from West Pakistan). However, towards 1980 ’s a new industrial venture namely garments manufacturing factories started to grow with some favorable policy support from the Government and preferential treatment of major apparel importing countries by <b>guaranteed</b> <b>share</b> of their market. Methods: The data collection method is primary survey on employees of garment industry and experts of the same industry supported by secondary research on previous research, industry report, government paper, and interview of resource persons. Percentage analysis, hypothesis tests are the primary tools used for the data analysis. Conclusions: The findings show that garment workers are unhappy with their working environment and about pay package. garments, Job, Satisfaction, Employees, Working, Environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Future routers {{will not}} only forward data packets but also provide {{value-added}} services, such as security, accounting, caching, and resource management. These services can be implemented as general programs, to be invoked by traversing packets embedding router program calls. Software programmable routers pose new challenges {{in the design of}} router operating systems (OS). First, router programs will require access to diverse system resources. The resource demands of a large community of heterogeneous resource consumers must either be coordinated to enable cooperation or arbitrated to resolve competition. Second, it is beneficial to concurrently support multiple virtual machines, each with a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>share</b> of physical resources. This allows services to be customized and to seamlessly evolve. We present the design and implementation of a next generation router OS that can meet the above challenges. We define an orthogonal kernel abstraction of resource allocation, which can schedule various time-shared and space-shared resources with quality of service (QoS) differentiation and guarantees. A scalable and flexible packet classifier enables dynamic resource binding and per-flow processing of received packets. We have prototyped our system on a network of UltraSPARC and Pentium II computers. Currently, QoS-aware schedulers for CPU time, forwarding bandwidth, memory-store capacity, and capacity for secondary data stores have been integrated. We present experimental results on various aspects of resource management in our system. Index Terms—Software-programmable router, router operating system, resource management, QoS guarantees.
