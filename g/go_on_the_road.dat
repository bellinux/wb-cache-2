5|$|The {{ending of}} the Conan Late Night and {{beginning}} of The Tonight Show coincided with the start of Springsteen and the E Street Band's 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. O'Brien told a Variety reporter {{at the time of}} the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with Springsteen as had been done for past tours.|$|E

Benny's parents refused to let their son <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> at 17, {{but it was the}} beginning of his long friendship with the Marx Brothers, especially Zeppo Marx.|$|E

25|$|While the Bucs {{played well}} in 2000 and 2001 {{and made the}} playoffs in each season, {{they were unable to}} fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory. The wild card spots that Tampa Bay earned forced them to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for their postseason opener in each year, and both road games took them into frigid Philadelphia to play the Eagles. The two losses also {{continued}} an unusual losing streak for Tampa Bay: they remained winless all-time in games played when the temperature was less than 32°F (0°C).|$|E
25|$|The 2014–15 {{team was}} invited to {{participate}} in the 2014 Preseason WNIT, the first in the program's history. They are also the 2014–15 Northeast Conference Women's Basketball Champions after defeating Robert Morris 77–62 in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. St. Francis Brooklyn is the first team to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and win all three tournament games to be crowned Northeast Conference Champions. They are also the first number 5 seed to take home the championship trophy. This is the first championship for St. Francis women's basketball in program history. The women's basketball team made its first NCAA Tournament appearance and lost to eventual champions Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of their career, the members of Point of Grace have had their hearts drawn to reaching out to young women. Early on, they began showing support of Mercy Ministries of America, a non-profit organization that helps young women who face life-controlling issues such as abuse, depression, unplanned pregnancies and eating disorders. The group frequently plugged Mercy Ministries at their concerts, and Nancy Alcorn, the founder, would normally <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with them or send a graduate from the Mercy Program to share her testimony about the work of Mercy Ministries. Alcorn is a regular featured speaker at the Girls of Grace conferences.|$|E

25|$|In September 2010, after 14 {{years at}} the Arena, the Eagles moved to Northumbria University's newly built Sport Central {{development}} featuring a 3,000 capacity arena, located in their campus in the north east {{part of the city}} centre. While having the arena's capacity {{had been part of the}} reason why the team went from an under-performing side to British Basketball League champions for which the team were thankful, part of the reason for the move was that due to clashes with Friday night concerts the team would have to play away from home, leading to lost revenue, with the final season seeing the team <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for three straight months, while the arena hosted the musical Mamma Mia!. The move also offered improved training arrangements, and enhanced pre-existing links with the university teams. The team had also only been averaging 3,000 crowds in the arena, which could hold 6,500.|$|E
500|$|... "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] is {{the tenth}} episode of The Simpsons sixth season. It was first {{broadcast}} on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on December 4, 1994.

He and Homer <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to sell their elixir, and Grampa reveals that Homer’s conception was unintentional.|$|E
500|$|After the 2007 playoffs saw two wild-card {{teams with}} better records (Jacksonville Jaguars and {{eventual}} Super Bowl XLII champions New York Giants) <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to defeat division winners (Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively) during wild-card weekend, the NFL explored another proposal {{to change the}} playoffs so that {{the team with the}} better record would host the game, even if that meant a division winner went on the road. The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's good for your fans to know you will have a home game." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past we were always very aware of who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and play them for a year. By {{the end of the year}} they'd mutate into something much more excited". Gordon credited Memphis for its relaxed atmosphere and cited the album as one of her favorites.|$|E
500|$|One {{continuing}} subplot {{with the}} tour's scheduling was E Street drummer Max Weinberg's availability vis à vis {{his job as}} The Max Weinberg 7 bandleader for Conan O'Brien, given that {{during the first half}} of 2009 Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York was ending and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles was beginning. [...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they had just gotten off the Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... I know he was very much trying to figure it out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

Martha and friends related that Bill {{did not want to}} <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> any more and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. According to McCallum, [...] "It's my {{unproven}} gut feeling that that [...] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sutcliffe {{was born}} in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire into a working class family.

Between November 1971 and April 1973 Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. He left when he was asked to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> as a salesman.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the reunion}} was short-lived. When Level 42 began {{to promote the}} new album (with Jakszyk {{returning}} to the live band for concerts and TV appearances) it was without Phil Gould. Gould played only one promotional gig and did not <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for the Forever Now tour. He was [...] replaced as live drummer by Gavin Harrison. Harrison later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson. It was announced halfway through the Forever Now tour, {{on the day of}} the Manchester Apollo gig, that Level 42 would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments.|$|E

2500|$|On August 1, , the {{day before}} {{the first anniversary of the}} accident, the Yankees filed a $4.5-million lawsuit against Cessna Aircraft Co. and Flight Safety International, Inc. (the company who was {{training}} Munson to fly), with team spokesman John J. McCarty saying [...] "we asked for $4.5 million because that is what Munson would be worth if the Yankees traded him." [...] Munson's widow, Diana, also filed a $42.2 million wrongful death lawsuit against the two companies. Cessna offered Munson a special deal on flying lessons if he would take them from FlightSafety International. Rather than requiring Munson to take a two-week safety class in Kansas, FlightSafety assigned a [...] "traveling instructor" [...] to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with him, and train him between ballgames. The suit was eventually settled out of court.|$|E
2500|$|Although The Someloves' Mather was not {{interested}} in touring or even performing live, the other members created Dom Mariani's Orange with the line-up of Mariani, Moon, Italiano and Zupanovich to showcase the album. They also recorded a track, [...] "Christ-masonic", for a various artists' compilation, Rockin' Bethlehem: The Second Coming (1990). In 1998 Mariani described how Orange developed, [...] "The Someloves was a loose studio idea ... I was hanging out to play live again but Darryl wasn't into it ... the record company were also putting the pressure on us to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> ... The album had been well received, so it was a real shame we couldn't go on with it. So it became Orange". Orange performed The Someloves' and some new material but by mid-1991 Orange had also disbanded. In 2006, Half A Cow records issued [...] "Don't Talk About Us: The Real Pop Recordings of the Someloves 1985-89" [...] which collected together every official recording The Someloves made.|$|E
2500|$|The Tender Trap {{operated}} on Sunday nights, in the theatre-restaurant {{room of the}} legendary Les Girls building in Sydney's infamous Kings Cross, New South Wales. [...] The Les Girls Building stood prominently {{on the corner of}} Darlinghurst Road and Roslyn Street, {{in the heart of the}} Cross, an area popularly known as [...] "the Golden Mile". The original Les Girls review, featuring gorgeous [...] "drag queens" [...] including the leading lady Carlotta, had performed in the building since 1963, but in the early 1990s the review decided to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> inspired by the film Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, leaving the building unused. The Les Girls building carried some intense history; it was owned by Sydney identity Abe Saffron; Kings Cross activist Juanita Nielsen was last seen here; various ghosts were rumoured to call it home. But in 1994 the building was still remarkably intact, a piece of living history. Seeing an opportunity, Sydney filmmaker and DJ Sean O'Brien approached the management, and procured the use of the cabaret room for Sunday nights. Sean named the Sunday night cabaret club after the Frank Sinatra song, and the Tender Trap first opened its doors on 11 December 1994, at the cocktail hour of 7pm. The performer on the opening night was singer Stuart Grant with his jazz combo. Stuart had previously been in the infamous 1980s post punk band the Primitive Calculators.|$|E
