These factors will revolve around the organisation's business, people and structure. They will include culture, politics, inter group trust, power bases and fear of change.

If the plan is not documented, even though these factors may be taken into account initially, there is likely to be slippage over time in the awareness levels of these factors. The matter of who influences the process and to what degree they do so, will also be crucial. The planning process itself should be based on recognised models for planning change, otherwise the plan will not be properly grounded and will lack the necessary direction to achieve success. All the participants should have some knowledge of how organisations function and of planning techniques, even if it is not realistic to expect professional non managerial groups to devote significant amounts of their time to gaining detailed knowledge of matters which are not normally part of their duties. The planning process should ensure that some levels of knowledge of these matters is made available to these groups in a simple format so that they at least have basic knowledge of what is likely to confront them...|$|E

40|$|The Canadian {{diabetes}} {{association is}} working {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with diabetes through self-management education, research, and advocacy. Continued self-management education is the cornerstone in helping individuals living with diabetes. One of the important parameters in determining the effectiveness of any self-management education intervention is its ability to modify a risky health behavior. The Diabetes expo is one of the several projects implemented by Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) that are aimed towards improvement of the self-management skills of people living with diabetes. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a community diabetes self-management event and annual expo event hosted by CDA is discussed as a case study. First, review of previous documents and reports available with organization was done. Further, key informant interviews were conducted to identify the intended outcomes for evaluation of effectiveness of diabetes expo. To complete the task of the evaluation, logic model was used. In the next step indicators were identified which will measure the outcomes of the programme. In order to do that review of the Canadian Diabetes educator sections reference guide on best practices and critical literature review was also conducted. Review of the survey questionnaire used by CDA revealed the need for evaluation methods which will generate data for measuring the intended outcomes of diabetes expo. Constructs of health belief model (HBM) were employed in building the evaluation tool for the <b>intended</b> <b>participants</b> in a three parts survey questionnaire. The objective was to generate important data which will help project coordinators measure the change in perceptions along with other intended short term outcomes of the project. Finally, the data from the previous evaluation report was compared with the short term outcomes identified from the key informant interviews, critical literature review, and review of other documents. The data shows that diabetes expo is very popular amongst the <b>intended</b> <b>participants.</b> However its effectiveness is mainly determined by the achievement of the expected intended short term outcomes (changes in perception areas identified by HBM, empowerment) of a self-management education event.  ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{expected}} {{effects of the}} introduction of a fully paid long-term care leave programme in the Netherlands are investigated. In particular we are interested in the effects on perceived burden and job performance. We analyse data from a survey among workers who care for a person in their social circle for longer than two weeks. The caring workers with a high perceived burden and intention to participate in the programme were asked questions regarding the expected effects on burden. An econometric model in which we account for these two potentially nonrandom selection mechanisms is set up to analyse the expected reduction in burden due to the intended take-up of care leave. As a result of the introduction of the programme about 60 % of the <b>intended</b> <b>participants</b> who perceive a high burden expect a reduction in their burden. The relation between burden and job performance shows that the programme would reduce the number of caring workers who perform less precise in their job by one-third.

40|$|In {{order to}} deal with complex water {{management}} problems, it is increasingly claimed that researchers should collaborate with authorities and other stakeholders. According to the literature, such collaboration can enhance cognitive learning about the issues at stake, but there is little empirical evidence for this. In this paper, we assess whether collaborative research leads to more cognitive learning, and which factors may influence this. We first develop a structured methodology for assessing cognitive learning and identifying potential factors. Next, we apply this methodology in a case study on groundwater management in Delft (The Netherlands) and one on long-term flood management in the Lower Rhine area (Germany and The Netherlands). Contrary to some of the literature, our findings indicate that only intensive collaboration enhances cognitive learning. Therefore, we recommend organizing collaborative research only when all <b>intended</b> <b>participants</b> are sufficiently motivated to collaborate and learn. For these cases, we recommend to organise 1) many meetings, 2) intensive discussion of perspectives, 3) active participation in the research, and 4) an equal input in and influence on the research process by all involved actors.

40|$|Can one {{be fooled}} {{into believing that}} one {{intended}} an action that one in fact did not intend? Past experimental paradigms have demonstrated that participants, when provided with false perceptual feedback about their actions, can be fooled into misperceiving {{the nature of their}} intended motor act. However, because veridical proprioceptive/perceptual feedback limits the extent to which participants can be fooled, few studies have been able to answer our question and induce the illusion to intend. In a novel paradigm addressing this question, participants were instructed to move a line on the computer screen by use of a phony brain-computer interface. Line movements were actually controlled by computer program. Demonstrating the illusion to <b>intend,</b> <b>participants</b> reported more intentions to move the line when it moved frequently than when it moved infrequently.

40|$|This article {{describes}} approaches for planning, dealing, and analyzing heterogeneity {{in a systematic}} review of complex interventions. Approaches aim to generate a priori hypotheses of the mechanism of action of a complex intervention to identify the key variables that might contribute to variation among studies and guide statistical analysis. In addition to characteristics related to the population, intervention, and outcomes, we describe study-related variables, such as the way the interventions have been implemented and the context and conduct of studies. These approaches will guide reviewers planning a meta-analysis and provide a rationale for not meta-analyzing data if {{there is too much}} variability. Potential difficulties in applying meta-analytical techniques to examine statistical association among study results and sources of potential heterogeneity are described; these include the selection of a fixed or random-effects model, the risk of multiple testing and confounding when studies include different aspects of a complex intervention or different subsamples of the <b>intended</b> <b>participant</b> pool. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The researcher used the critical race theory and cultural proficiency theory to frame the study. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What challenges and barriers have African Americans experienced in receiving a quality education? (2) In what ways does family structure affect the success of African American professors toward the completion of a graduate degree? (3) What positive experiences have African Americans had throughout their educational career to encourage their pursuit of the professoriate? and (4) How can faculty diversity be obtained among institutions of higher education? 	The study employed a mixed-methods research design to examine the experiences of African American faculty members employed in Illinois higher education institutions. The quantitative portion of the study consisted of an online survey distributed to African American faculty members. The qualitative portion included both focus groups and interviews.

40|$|Background. A {{major concern}} in {{intervention}} studies is {{the generalizability of}} the findings due to refusal of <b>intended</b> <b>participants</b> to actually take part. In studies including ill older people the number of those declining to participate may be large and the concern is therefore relevant. Objectives. To compare patients characteristics, rates of acute readmission, and mortality after one and six months among older persons who agreed and those who declined to participate in a randomized controlled trial and to describe subgroups of nonparticipants. Design. Comparative study based on a randomized controlled trial. Setting. University hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark. Participants. Patients ≥ 70 years discharged home after a short Emergency Department stay. 399 were requested to participate; 271 consented, whereas 128 refused. Results. Refusers {{were more likely to be}} readmitted (p< 0. 001) or die (p= 0. 006). The largest subgroup of refusers described as “too ill” had the highest risk of readmission (OR = 3. 00, 95 % CI = 1. 61 – 5. 47, p= 0. 001) and of mortality within six months (OR = 3. 50, 95 % CI = 1. 64 – 7. 49, p= 0. 002).

40|$|Introduction. The {{occurrence}} {{of infectious diseases}} is monitored {{on the basis of}} surveillance data from morbidity and mortality registers and data from laboratories. Important additional information can be derived from serosurveillance: the study of the prevalence of specific antibodies in the population. Particularly for the control of the immunity for diseases against which people are vaccinated following the National Immunization Programme serosurveillance or immunosurveillance is necessary. Therefore, the RIVM has taken the initiative to establish a serum bank of a random sample of the Dutch population and the so-called PIENTER-project has been started. In 1994 a pilot study was carried out. Aim. The pilot study had a twofold aim: firstly, the assessment of the feasibility of the design and the development of an ascertained protocol for the final nation-wide data collection, secondly the judgement of the possibility to obtain a representative data set (by means of an comprehensive non-response investigation, which is described in part II of this report series). Design. A cross-sectional population-based study was done in the province of Utrecht. Methods. An age-stratified random sample of 510 inhabitants (0 - 80 years of age) was taken from the population registers of four municipalities. The <b>intended</b> <b>participants</b> who were approached by mail, were expected to fill in a questionnaire and to visit a clinic to allow blood to be taken. The evaluation of the logistics was based on the experience during the pilot, partly written down in registrations and personal logbooks of the study team, partly derived from a written questionnaire filled in by the concerned collaborators. Furthermore, the non-response study has offered leads for optimalization of the acquisition of participants. Findings and recommendations Data collection in the general population can be done in cooperation with Public Health Services with a central coordination. The cooperation between the many partners, both within the RIVM and outside, was good and justice was done to the contribution of every partner. However, more attention should be payed to the protocol and the procedure for approval of the specific serological studies before the sera can be given out to the laboratories. In these protocols the assignment of tasks and responsibilities of the Department of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology and of the participating laboratories should be well described. From the results of the pilot it was concluded that the protocol met the conditions: no serious logistical bottlenecks were encountered. Nevertheless, some adaptations in the execution are proposed because of the expansion to a nation-wide data collection in 1995 and later. Particularly investments should be done in automating the processing of sera and the administration of the serum bank. Improvement of the efficiency and limitation of possible sources of errors are an important argument for this automation. Moreover, a more direct approach of the <b>intended</b> <b>participants</b> by way of reminding them by telephone, before the clinic takes place, is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Maternal support {{contributes}} to maternal and child well-being, yet not all mothers incorporate support into their maternal practices. Most research on mothering standards {{and practices in}} the U. S. focuses on white, middle-class, married mothers. This study expands upon this research by incorporating an intersectional lens to explore how mothers interpret standards of “good mothering” across race, class, and family structure. I conducted a mixed-method evaluation of a nonprofit program offering peer-based maternal support to mothers of color, lower-income mothers, and single mothers; 41 in-depth interviews with mothers to learn why maternal support resonated with some, but not all, mothers; and an in-depth focus group interview with {{the founders of the}} peer-based support program. Employing systems-centered intersectionality (Choo and Ferree 2010) and multi-institutional politics (Armstrong and Bernstein 2008), I found that some lower-income, single mothers practiced the parenting style “nurtured growth,” allowing them to supplement their limited income and physical and emotional presence with free and low-cost resources from public institutions (e. g., schools, churches, parks). Some other lower-income, single, mothers of color resisted normative parenting practices rooted in self-sacrifice by practicing “empowered mothering. ” This practice incorporated self-care and mother-centric support systems to challenge race-based interpretations of good mothering. Finally, the theme “cultural mismatch” explains the difficulty faced by the nonprofit organization in attracting mothers of color and single mothers. I argue that racial, economic, and marital variations in maternal standards, practices, and support rendered the program’s curriculum incompatible with its <b>intended</b> <b>participants.</b> I conclude by offering recommendations for this and other maternal support programs...|$|E
