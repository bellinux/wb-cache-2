500|$|When Gretta sees Dave {{accepting}} {{an award}} on television, she criticizes him for selling {{out to the}} music industry and she expresses her grievances {{with him in a}} song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, who is back in New York to promote his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums. Gretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of [...] "Lost Stars," [...] a love ballad she had once written and composed for him as a Christmas present, believing that the true meaning of the song has been lost. Dave tells her that the audiences love when he plays it in the new way, and that their energy <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that's not what she intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the Gramercy Theatre that weekend so that she can see the impact it has had on his fans. She arrives at the venue just in time to watch him play her original arrangement of the song. After tearfully watching him play and seeing the reaction of the crowd to their song, Gretta decides to leave the concert and cycles through the city with a smile slowly dawning on her face.|$|E

2500|$|An award-winning {{article by}} Joyce Tracewell {{describes}} the Electric Mass: [...] "Sun shines through stained glass and colors bounce until the kaleidoscopic vision is suddenly shattered by incredibly swelling music. Smiling musicians with flowery clothes, jeans, long hair, beards and sunglasses play deliberate alien music, {{the kind that}} makes you shiver. It <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to the ceiling pushing against the walls. They sing in voices that should have belonged to Druids or Incas, or Gypsies under a night sky, and you see Jesus smiling at them. When you leave you feel somebody has been dissecting your soul and everything is clearer. And that's what an Electric Mass is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reality in}} the bell-chamber {{is a very small}} and roughly-finished room, only {{partially}} protected from gales by louvred, unglazed windows on all sides. A massive and braced hardwood frame <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> completely from west to east. The frame is over [...] high and is smooth and polished to the touch. On the south and north sides there are narrow squeeze spaces of about [...] between the frame and the wall. There is no aid to access {{to the top of the}} frame. The wheels of the top tier of bells project above the frame. The frame exactly fits the room, and the bells exactly fit the frame, but only because their wheels are arranged in different directions to allow fit. Access to the roof would require a slim and agile climber who would then climb a ladder, and from the ladder lift and slide with one hand a very heavy insulated trapdoor. The trapdoor is weatherproofed by being shaped to overhang the lips on which it is seated. The survival of the frame and consequently the safety of the bells depends on the condition of this trapdoor and the roof. It is likely that the tower's floors were installed after hanging the bells: the frame could then be built in place, the bells winched from the floor of the tower, and the floors would then be put in. Winching the bells up through the tower would require a massive beam across the tower roof to support the pulley; no such beam exists now.|$|E
60|$|She {{has risen}} half up, not started up, in being awakened; {{and is not}} looking at the angel, but only thinking, it seems, with eyes cast down, as if supposing herself in a strange dream. The morning light <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and shows at the foot of her little pallet-bed, her {{embroidery}} work, left off the evening before,--an upright lily.|$|E
60|$|Twilight <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and deepens into dusk. He wonders listlessly {{how it is}} that Time {{seems to}} be moving with such swift strides. After a while he hears a voice close to him, {{speaking}} in a slow, monotonous tone--a voice curiously familiar to him, though he cannot tell to whom it belongs. He does not turn his head, but sits listening to it drowsily. It is talking about tallow: one hundred and ninety-four casks of tallow, and they must all stand one inside the other. It cannot be done, the voice complains pathetically. They will not go inside each other. It is no good pushing them. See! they only roll out again.|$|E
6000|$|Dick <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and shook}} <b>the</b> air with wild, glad, {{stallion}} nickering; and then, with mane-tossing and foot-pawing, chanted: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very nice, thank you," [...] {{answered}} a prim little {{voice from the}} dusk below, for only the glow of <b>the</b> fire <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> just then.|$|R
60|$|Although {{the ports}} were open, {{it was very}} hot, and when the {{kerosene}} lamp flickered in the draughts an unpleasant smell <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> men felt languid and their attention wandered from the dragging game.

60|$|SCENE--Same as Act II. As {{the curtain}} rises, JAYSON is {{discovered}} {{sitting in an}} armchair by the fireplace, in which a log fire is burning fitfully. He is staring into the flames, a strained, expectant expression on his face. It is about {{three o'clock in the}} morning. There is no light but that furnished by the fire which <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with shifting shadows. The door in the rear is opened and RICHARD appears, his face harried by the stress of unusual emotion. Through the opened doorway, a low, muffled moan of anguish sounds from {{the upper part of the}} house. JAYSON and RICHARD both shudder. The latter closes the door behind him quickly as if anxious to shut out the noise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} end is the same; but it does make a {{difference}} how they turn to ashes, and how I spend my life. That log, with its one dull spot of fire, gives neither light nor warmth, but lies sizzling despondently among the cinders. But the other glows from end to end with cheerful little flames that go singing up the chimney with a pleasant sound. Its light <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and shines out into the dark; its warmth draws us nearer, making the hearth the cosiest place in the house, and we shall all miss the friendly blaze when it dies. Yes," [...] she added, as if to herself, [...] "I hope my life may be like that, so that, whether it be long or short, it will be useful and cheerful while it lasts, will be missed when it ends, and leave something behind besides ashes." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{dogs are}} full of elegant ailments, unknown to vulgar dogs; and are petted and nursed by Lady Lillycraft with the tenderest kindness. They are pampered and fed with delicacies by their fellow-minion, the page; but their stomachs are often weak and out of order, so that they cannot eat; though I have now and then seen the page give them a mischievous pinch, or thwack over the head, when his {{mistress}} was not by. They have cushions for their express use, on which they lie before the fire, and yet are apt to shiver and moan if there is the least draught of air. When any one enters the room, they make a most tyrannical barking that is absolutely deafening. They are insolent {{to all the other}} dogs of the establishment. There is a noble stag-hound, a great favourite of the Squire's, who is a privileged visitor to the parlour; but the moment he makes his appearance, these intruders fly at him with furious rage; and I have admired the sovereign indifference and contempt with which he seems to look down upon his puny assailants. When her ladyship drives out, these dogs are generally carried with her to take the air; when they look out of each window of the carriage, and bark at all vulgar pedestrian dogs. These dogs are a continual source of misery to the household as they are always in the way, they every now and then get their toes trod on, and then there is a yelping on their part, and a loud lamentation on the part of their mistress, that <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with clamour and confusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dinner," [...] said Barker the valet, {{appearing}} {{at the door}} and breaking a silence that seemed to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> like a tangible presence, [...] "is served!" ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{presence}} of the Tweedys has been most agreeable and has [...] contributed in no small degree to break the shock of removal to [...] these new rooms, which are not near so cosy as the old; especially [...] with the smoking of my stove, which went on all the first two days. [...] That has been stopped, however, and the only trouble is now to get [...] the fire alight at all. I have generally to start it 3 or 4 times, [...] {{and the removal of}} the material of each failure from the grate is a [...] fearful business. I have also to descend to the cellar myself to [...] get my coal, and my [...] "hod," [...] as Ma Sweetser, my land-lady, calls it, [...] not being very much bigger than a milk-pitcher, doesn't add to the [...] charm. The coal is apt to drop on the stairs, and I have to pick it [...] all up. At present the stove <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with a nephitic and [...] pestilential gas, so that I have to keep the window open. I went [...] last night with the Tweedys to the concert for which they came up, [...] and with them this morning to hear Wendell Phillips. This Sweetser [...] family is worthy of Dickens. It consists of a Mr. and Miss S., Mr. [...] S.'s three gushing girls, a parrot and a maniac. The maniac is very [...] obstreperous. Her husband left her boarding here 3 months ago and [...] went to Cuba. When she got mad he was written to, but has sent no [...] reply, and they are keeping her. For the Aunt's sake I keep my [...] drawer locked against her at night. Old Sweetser is a riddle I hope [...] to do justice to at some future time, but can't begin on now. His [...] sister shakes like an aspen whenever she is spoken to. Oh I forgot [...] the most important character of all, the black wench who [...] "does" [...] the [...] room. She is about 20 years old and wears short frocks, but talks [...] like Alice Robeson and has an antediluvian face about as large as [...] the top of a flour-barrel.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{attempts}} to furnish his new condo. He rents the furniture, {{much to the}} dismay of House, who returns the furniture. Then, Wilson is seen in a furniture store trying to buy furniture, but is unable to choose anything. Finally, he hires a decorator and <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with furniture, buying House a Hammond B-3 organ. House is pleased with the gift and plays [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale".|$|E
50|$|Behind the door, Kidd {{finds an}} immaculately clean child's nursery. A {{football}} drops onto the floor, {{which was the}} source of the sound. Suddenly, the sound of a child's laughter <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> along with a soft 'Hello?'. Kidd notices that a little lead soldier somehow found its way into his hand. He then realizes that the generator is running down. Unwilling to be left in the dark, Kidd rushes to the outhouse to start up the electricity generator.|$|E

5000|$|Adam Jones {{directed}} the video for [...] "Ænema" [...] which features stop-motion animation with art design by Cam de Leon. The video revolves around a humanoid figure with alien-like features. Throughout the video the character ventures through an aquatic world. A hose-like organ (resembling an umbilical cord) which squirts out water protrudes from its abdomen and <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{in which the}} figure stands. Towards {{the end of the}} video a human character wearing business attire tosses the figure in a water-filled box.|$|E
50|$|Mrinalini relives her past, {{as night}} {{gradually}} turns to dawn. An azaan (Islamic call to prayer) starts up somewhere. Slowly early morning light <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The moment has {{passed and the}} death she had wished for so intensely no longer seems a priority. Her German Shepherd comes and rubs its head on its mistress’s feet and squeaks to be let out. Mrinalini smiles, tears up the suicide note and takes her dog out for a walk. On the street, she meets morning walkers, old and young, joggers, a group of school children.|$|E
50|$|Marins wakens in a {{room with}} a black mass in progress. He sees the red-gowned hooded figures of Luciana, Mr. Julio and the witch, as well as Vilma and Eugenio side by side. The {{constant}} sounds of tortured screams <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> After the dancers raise their arms, some sparks fly and Coffin Joe appears. Marins is shocked to see his creation in flesh and blood, shouting rants and pronouncements typical of Coffin Joe, such as “may the blood of those who don't deserve to live burst out of their bodies!”, and “may lightning burn the scum!”.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> sound, which <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{with its}} hurry of short syllables, its sudden pauses, and its sudden attacks, might be {{compared}} to some animal hubbub, frantic and inarticulate.|$|R

60|$|There {{was another}} silence; and the sunset {{breaking}} {{more and more}} from <b>the</b> sundering clouds, <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with soft fire and painted the dull walls with ruby and gold.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the last}} day of the investigation, the narrator accompanies the police into the cellar. They still find nothing significant. Then, {{completely}} confident in his own safety, the narrator comments on the sturdiness of the building and raps upon the wall he had built around his wife's body. A loud, inhuman wailing sound <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The alarmed police tear down the wall and find the wife's corpse, and on its rotting head, to the utter horror of the narrator, is the screeching black cat. As he words it: [...] "I had walled the monster up within the tomb!" ...|$|E
5000|$|When they arrive, {{the guests}} sit on floor mats around the food {{which has been}} placed in the center, while incense <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The {{ceremony}} begins with a formal speech (udjub) in high Javanese. The speech thanks the attendees for coming, presents {{the reason for the}} slametan, announces his intentions and petitions the spirits to secure for himself and his guests a state of equanimity (slamet, hence the name of the ritual), and finally apologizes for any errors in his speech and the humble inadequacy of the food. During pauses in the speech, the audience responds with solemn [...] "inggih" [...] ("yes").|$|E
50|$|Having read {{horror stories}} about wicked stepmothers, the gang is {{determined}} {{to break up the}} marriage between Darla Hood's widowed father and his new bride. Never bothering to find out, as Darla has, that the second Mrs. Hood is a wonderful woman, the kids pull off all sorts of pranks at the wedding ceremony, from playing the radio too loud to releasing a cylinder of laughing gas. The wedding guests start smiling then laughing as the gas <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Someone in the building discovers what they're doing and shuts off the canister. The wedding is temporarily postponed and the gang is sentenced to a spanking, assembly-line style.|$|E
