5|$|All five {{senators}} served {{out their}} terms. Only <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> McCain ran for re-election, {{and they both}} retained their seats. McCain {{would go on to}} run for President of the United States twice, and was the Republican Party nominee in 2008. As of 2017, he is still a senator.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{committee}} investigated in private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> McCain, as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E

5|$|When the Republican Party regained {{control of}} the Senate in 1996, Glenn was the ranking {{minority}} member on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chaired by Maine senator Susan Collins) which investigated illegal foreign donations by China to U.S.political campaigns for the 1996 election. Considerable acrimony existed between <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> committee chair Fred Thompson of Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the {{relationship}} between <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> Metzenbaum was strained. There was a thaw in 1983 (when Metzenbaum endorsed Glenn for president) and in 1988 when Metzenbaum was opposed for reelection by Cleveland mayor George Voinovich. Metzenbaum won, 57 to 41 percent. In his 1980 reelection campaign, Glenn won by the largest margin ever for an Ohio Senator, defeating U.S. Representative Tom Kindness in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Negan murders <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> Abraham {{to coerce}} Rick's loyalty. Rick {{initially}} submits, but Michonne persuades him to fight back, and recruits a community called the Scavengers for help. Meanwhile, Rosita and Eugene make a bullet to kill Negan. When this fails, Negan forcibly recruits Eugene as a Savior. Separately, Carol and Morgan befriend Ezekiel of the Kingdom, another community, while Maggie and Rosita rally the Hilltop. Alexandria is {{attacked by the}} Saviors, aided by the turncoat Scavengers, but the Kingdom and Hilltop defend Alexandria. The three communities declare war on the Saviors.|$|E

5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping <b>Glenn</b> (<b>and</b> McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|At 42, Glenn was {{the oldest}} member of the {{astronaut}} corps and would likely be close to 50 {{by the time the}} lunar landings took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> his wife in December 1962 that he run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.|$|E
5|$|In Atlanta, Rick's group {{gets into}} {{conflict}} with the Vatos, a group of Latinos that kidnap <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> demand they exchange Rick's bag of weapons for his return. When they face-off at the Vatos' base, they discover it is a hidden nursing home, and the Vatos are only trying {{to protect their own}} family. Rick leaves some of his weapons and ammo for the Vatos, and Glenn is returned unharmed. Rick's group finds their vehicle missing, and suspect Merle took it seeking vengeance on the survivors', and they start to race on foot back to the camp.|$|E

5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified <b>Glenn,</b> <b>and</b> his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{a backup}} pilot for Shepard and Grissom {{on the first}} two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions. Glenn was {{selected}} for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been. <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude test, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} of the Bears-Vikings rivalry took place in Minneapolis and was the third game at TCF Bank Stadium; the Bears won the first game in 2010 while the Vikings won in 2014. To succeed against the Vikings, Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears had to excel {{at the start of}} the game; offensively, the Bears had a first quarter scoring {{differential}} of -48, 31st in the league, while scoring only twice on game-opening possessions. In the third quarter, the Bears scored a league-worst 32 points; in comparison, the Vikings defense had allowed only one touchdown on opening drives and a league-low 37 points in the third quarter. The defense took on a Vikings offense spearheaded by Adrian Peterson, whose 1,251 yards led the league. On special teams, the Vikings led the league in post-kickoff starting position, while being ranked third in returns of at least 20 yards with 26 and first in returns of at least 40 yards with five. Additionally, kickoff returner Cordarrelle Patterson led the league in return average with 31.1 yards. Christian Jones, Cameron Meredith, Bryce Callahan, Nick Becton, Tayo Fabuluje, Jacoby <b>Glenn</b> <b>and</b> Antone Smith were inactive.|$|E
