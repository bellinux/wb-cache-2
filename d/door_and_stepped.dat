25|$|At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan {{entered the}} car park of the Lordship Credit Union {{premises}} and they parked, as did another {{car that was}} accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the hard shoulder of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range {{in the back of}} the head with a long barrelled shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had taken}} perhaps {{four or five}} steps when I felt that old mill {{building}} quiver. [...] I turned {{and ran for the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> out on solid ground, and then turned around {{to see what was going}} to happen, but folks, it had already happened. [...] The mill wasn't there. [...] I could just see pieces of planking and timbers going over the falls and rushing on down into the valley of Cane Creek below.|$|E

[...] / [...] "I had an old Zaporozhets car, and I installed my war trophy Messerschmitt jet engine in it. While driving on a highway, I saw a Ferrari ahead and tried to overtake it.

There was {{an opening in the}} tapestry to give exit.|$|R
2500|$|In 1890, Native American {{historian}} Charles Alexander Eastman {{recorded his}} first meeting with Blue Horse at Pine Ridge Agency, South Dakota. Eastman reported Blue Horse was his “first caller” at the Pine Ridge Agency and Chief Emeritus of the Wágluȟe Band. “He softly opened the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>stepped</b> in without knocking, in characteristic Indian fashion. After greeting me in Sioux, he promptly produced his credentials, which consisted of well-worn papers that had been given him by various high military officers, from General William Selby Harney to General George Crook, and were dated 1854 to 1877. The old man wanted nothing so much as an audience, and the tales of his exploits served to pass the evening." [...] Eastman recorded that “Blue Horse had been, as he claimed, a friend to the white man, for {{he was one of the}} first Sioux U.S. Army Indian Scouts, and also one of the first to cross the ocean with Buffalo Bill." ...|$|E
