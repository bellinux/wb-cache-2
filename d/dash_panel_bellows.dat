5000|$|NIJ Level III-A (or better) {{ballistic}} protection (front {{doors and}} <b>dash</b> <b>panel)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} has MG Metro {{front seats}} trimmed in Connolly Leather hide, VDO instruments in an ERA-designed <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> pile carpeting, and a sunroof.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of Crawley buses feature a light blue base {{with a dark}} blue roof which swoops down at the front. It also has a white stripe separating the roof from the base, and a light blue lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b> The Fastway livery is a silver base with navy blue cantrail panels and a navy blue lower front panel. Some older buses feature light blue with a dark blue roof and skirt panels along with a dark blue lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} trim was also changed, {{with the most}} notable differences being {{the introduction of a}} separate instrument cluster, instead of the gauges installed in the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> in earlier cars.|$|R
5000|$|These four-wheeled, {{double-deck}} tramcars {{were the}} mainstay of the Glasgow tram fleet from electrification until the late 1950s (only being withdrawn due to the imminent closure of the system). Over 1000 were built between 1898 and 1924. They were progressively modernised in four phases, although not all went through each phase. The first cars were open-top unvestibuled four-wheelers (phase one). They then received top covers with open balconies (phase two), platform vestibules and roll-top draught covers (phase three) and finally fully enclosed top covers (phase four). Electrical equipment and running gear was also upgraded at each modernisation phase. The earlier cars had rounded front <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> but later cars which were built with vestibule glazing from new had hexagonal profile <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b> When early cars were upgraded to receive vestibule glazing they retained their round <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> and latterly the main visual difference within the fleet was between the [...] "round dash" [...] and [...] "hex dash" [...] variants. A few cars were also cut down to single deckers for use on the Clydebank - Duntocher route which passed under low railway bridges.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{features a}} new grille, front bumper, headlamps, taillights, rear bumper and new wheel covers. The interior sports {{a more modern}} look as well as better visibility and usability, new instrument cluster design and metallic-finish <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|It began {{life as the}} Premiere 320 {{which was}} then updated to the Prima when the Premiere was {{replaced}} by the Paragon. The Prima was then modified with the Paragon lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> and rear panel and rechristened the Profile.|$|R
50|$|Like later Spectras, {{the body}} is of low floor design and has the same lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> as the single decker Kinetec. Like the Kinetec, this bus again uses the chassis maker's (MAN's) front with the East Lancs Olympus body.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was revised {{with a new}} center console, lower <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> (to meet U.S. regulations) and a single monopod gauge cluster (with electronic gauges). For the North American market a model dubbed the Graduate was added in tribute to the car's famous appearance in the 1967 film, The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman.|$|R
2500|$|... 1997 – Manual {{transmission}} {{available on}} turbo models. Restyled front bumper and grey (instead of black) taillight surrounds. Restyled headlights, now black {{on the inside}} with chrome rings (all chrome previously) and a clearer lens. All 1997 labeled as 15th Anniversary model. New grey <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> to replace the previous black. Japanese production stopped in September.|$|R
5000|$|The AD {{retained}} the new [...] "stovebolt" [...] 194 CID L six-cylinder engine from the Series AC, but with bigger intake valves and smaller exhaust valves, {{along with a}} new manifold, raised power from [...] to [...] The suspension now included hydraulic shock absorbers and the fuel gauge was moved from the tank to the <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R

50|$|A CVT was optional, and was {{available}} in a stretched-wheelbase version with seven seats, called the Cube³. With a CVT, the steering wheel button controls and the sport wheel button on the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> are located next to the hazard flasher switch. In mid-2005, the cube had an optional upgrade with the new HR-series 1.5 L engine from the Nissan Tiida.|$|R
50|$|Thermoforming {{differs from}} {{injection}} molding, blow molding, rotational molding {{and other forms}} of processing plastics. Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and <b>dash</b> <b>panels,</b> refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds, and plastic pallets.|$|R
50|$|Southdown {{specified}} the <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> of the Cavalier {{on their}} batch. The return of North Western was maybe a surprise {{as they were}} a major supporter of the 11m Alexander Y type, but they obviously wanted something shorter (and a bit classier) for their extended tours, their two Leopard L2 had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay.|$|R
5000|$|The 1996 models {{add more}} {{standard}} features to include standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps, {{and a new}} <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> featuring revised gauges with passenger-side airbag. The new base engine was a 2.4-liter four-cylinder [...] "2.4L Twin Cam" [...] that replaced the 2.3-liter Quad 4. There were little changes other than reduced trim levels and options for the final two model years.|$|R
25|$|The Nash Ambassador and Statesman {{continued}} with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy {{owing to the}} lighter unitized Nash body.|$|R
50|$|The XK140's walnut {{dashboard}} {{was replaced}} by one trimmed in leather. On the early drophead coupés, the aluminium centre <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> which was discontinued after June 1958, had an X pattern engraving similar to the early 3.8 E-Type. Thinner doors gave more interior space. On the front parking lights, which were located atop the wings (fenders), a little red light reminded the driver the lights were on.|$|R
50|$|Right Hand Drive {{cars were}} {{manufactured}} in Canada for export to some {{countries such as}} Australia, UK, etc., until 1969. They used {{a version of the}} 1965 Impala <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> until 1969. Australian models were assembled in Australia from kits as this lessened tax on the cars. A similar arrangement applied in New Zealand although the bodies were supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed.|$|R
50|$|The Nash Ambassador and Statesman {{continued}} with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy {{owing to the}} lighter unitized Nash body.|$|R
5000|$|Exterior {{differences}} were virtually unchanged, though all 1972 models were revised with [...] "Fasten Seat Belt" [...] warning lamps {{on the right}} side <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b> The [...] "Decor Group" [...] exterior trim package was also revised, allowing coupe and convertible owners to option their car with tu-tone lower body paint, plus the honeycomb sportlamp grille from the Mach 1/Boss 351 and the Mach 1's urethane bumper.|$|R
2500|$|... 1977 {{model year}} minor changes [...] {{included}} {{a more modern}} round gauge cluster to replace the long sweeping speedometer, and a revised <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> which changed to a flatter design. [...] Some new colors were offered (as {{with the rest of}} the divisions) and some small trim added. A separate brochure was printed for the Concours while the [...] "1977 Nova" [...] brochure detailed only base and Custom versions.|$|R
50|$|The 1964 season short Cavaliers for BET fleets Greenslades (10 Reliance) and Devon General Grey Cars (8 Reliance) were notable {{in being}} to 7 ft 6in width and having Grenadier style <b>dash</b> <b>panels.</b> Grey Green took eleven, Leopard L2, Crump of Pinner took another Reliance and Hutchings & Cornelius with one Reliance became the last new {{customer}} for the Cavalier. 31 {{of the short}} version were built in its final season.|$|R
50|$|Some smaller {{cars in the}} 1950s and 1960s, such as Citroën 2CV, Renault 4L {{and early}} Renault 5 feature a shifter in the <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b> This was cheaper to {{manufacture}} than a column shifter and more practical, as the gearbox was mounted {{in front of the}} engine. The linkage for the shifter could then be positioned on top of the engine. The disadvantage is that shifting is less comfortable and usually slower to operate.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to lessen the {{perceived}} distance {{to the base of}} the windshield, a ridge was added to the interior <b>dash</b> finishing <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} level of every world, there are {{single-use}} dash arrows on the floor that allow Pac-Man to rapidly zip {{from one end of}} the board to the other end, though steering is possible. After using up a <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> touching ghosts will render them dizzy and temporarily motionless, and they will not be able hurt Pac-Man. However, if Pac-Man traverses the dash arrow opposite the direction it is pointing, he will slow down and be vulnerable to be attacked.|$|R
5000|$|... 1979 - As for 1978 {{but with}} revised <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and the {{discontinuance}} of the 460 engine. To {{mark the end}} of the full-size luxury car segment through them, Lincoln introduces the [...] "Collector's Series" [...] for the Mark V coupe and Continental sedan, with many options made standard. There is information that suggests that the first 500 [...] "Collector's Series" [...] Mark V coupés were built with the 460 engine. There are certainly a few surviving examples of early cars fitted with factory 460's.|$|R
5000|$|To {{celebrate}} BMW Motorsport 20th anniversary, BMW {{had built}} 20 specially equipped Euro-spec M5s in late 1992. These, {{based on the}} 3.8 L engine were only in Mugello Red (274) and {{had a number of}} aesthetic trim upgrades such as carbon fiber <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and special rear view mirrors. Unique seat center & door trim fabric was matched with Alcantara. Alcantara was also used on the steering wheel, shift lever & parking brake lever. Red seatbelts with [...] "BMW Motorsport" [...] were also included.|$|R
50|$|These {{lightweight}} trailers {{were the}} purchased {{for the opening}} to Groudle Glen in 1893 but only No. 49 remains in semi-regular service today. Of note also, is number 51 which was restored to original condition in 1989 including detailing of original fleet name on the end <b>dash</b> <b>panels</b> and lightweight roof. At this time the car was numbered 13 as it would originally have been; in 1893 when it arrived there were no power cars numbered past 3, and so the trailers took consecutive numbering sequence but owing to a subsequent re-think by the operators, trailers were re-numbered commencing after the last power car (33). So {{it was that the}} original number 13 was displayed until it reverted to its latter number 51 during management and policy changes in 2001. This trailer is also serviceable but the remaining class members are in storage, with 52 serving as a flatbed wagon. Traditionally this car was stripped of its seating and roofing each winter for use by permanent way crews, but this practice ceased in 1954 after which time the item has been a dedicating flatbed runner. It survives today and had a distinctive yellow-painted <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> with standard painted fleet number, based at Laxey Car Sheds.|$|R
50|$|Caddy Life has a {{flexible}} seating system. The two {{rear bench seat}} rows can {{be taken out of}} the vehicle altogether to give the vehicle 2850 litres of cargo room; in addition, the Caddy Life has a 1500 kg towing capacity. In 2005, a Special Edition Caddy Life Colour Concept with two distinctive colours, Red Spice and Ravenna Blue, was released with upholstery fabrics, floor mats {{and a variety of other}} elements on the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> in the same colour as the exterior body, and a leather trimmed steering wheel, gear and handbrake lever.|$|R
50|$|On many Cadillac {{models of}} the 1950s and '60s, the antenna could be raised and lowered by pulling out or pushing in on the radio's volume control knob. The Lincoln Continental of the late 1960s had {{push-button}} controls integrated into the factory radio. But most cars had a separate control that often was not even located near the car radio. And sometimes the control on early models was not even labeled, e.g., the late 1960s, early '70s Ford Thunderbird control was integrated into a courtesy light module on the <b>dash</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{dashboard}} (also called <b>dash,</b> instrument <b>panel</b> (IP), or fascia) is {{a control}} panel located directly {{ahead of a}} vehicle's driver, displaying instrumentation and controls for the vehicle's operation.|$|R
50|$|From 1966, the Acadian {{name was}} only {{used for the}} Nova-based car and Beaumont became a {{standalone}} marque, still sold by Pontiac-Buick dealers. The interiors used the <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> from the (U.S.) Pontiac Tempest/LeMans/GTO series. Exterior sheetmetal is shared with the US-market Chevelle (the rear taillight housings are Beaumont-exclusive - taillight lenses have wraparound corners {{with the exception of}} the 1967 model where its trapezoidal shape is similar in appearance to the one used on the later 1969 Plymouth Belvedere/Satellite). While full wheel covers came from the Pontiac LeMans, small hubcaps and rally wheels were the same as on the Chevelle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{design of}} {{automotive}} trim configurations {{has become increasingly}} driven to maximize the acoustic performance benefit while minimizing material weight. Statistical energy analysis (SEA) {{can serve as a}} useful tool to predict the high frequency acoustic response on both a component and full vehicle level. This paper focuses on the automotive <b>dash</b> <b>panel,</b> using VAOne software to establish the SEA model. The method of orthogonal test is applied to optimize the sound package design to satisfy maximum high-frequency transmission loss (TL) and minimum weight by modifying the acoustic material, thickness, surface density and coverage of sound package...|$|R
25|$|For the 1990 model year, changes {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower <b>dash</b> <b>panel</b> became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed.|$|R
