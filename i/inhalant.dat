5|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} is {{a chronic}} dermatitis {{associated with a}} hereditary tendency to develop allergies to food and <b>inhalant</b> substances.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the <b>inhalant</b> water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E
5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the <b>inhalant</b> siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E

5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from <b>inhalant</b> abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the <b>inhalant</b> and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the <b>inhalant</b> siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inhalants</b> cause nausea, blurred vision, {{memory lapse}} {{and loss of}} motor coordination. These effects may be a minor {{discomfort}} to the user after inhalation, but permanent damage from <b>inhalants</b> is irreversible. Damage to organs such as the liver, kidneys, brain and heart could be fatal.|$|R

50|$|Wealthy {{adolescents}} {{were the first}} to use <b>inhalants</b> and being addicted to them, often using them to alleviate depression. In terms of addiction, <b>inhalants</b> are ordinary household products such as cleaners, cooking sprays, fabric protectors, paint thinner and adhesives and solvents. Because of the low cost of Rugby and other <b>inhalants,</b> poor people (especially inexperienced youths) use them to relieve hunger pains and common poverty health problems. “Rugby Boys” (also called “Solvent Boys”) and even girls do the sniffing in the streets. The chemical is placed in a plastic bag, and inhaled from the bag to achieve euphoria.|$|R
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or <b>inhalant</b> anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

25|$|Triclosan {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself. This effect may also occur with chlorhexidine gluconate and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked triclosan to allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals. Additionally, triclosan concentrations have been associated with allergic sensitization, especially <b>inhalant</b> and seasonal allergens, rather than food allergens.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, Native {{children}} in the isolated Northern Labrador community of Davis Inlet were the focus of national concern in 1993, when many {{were found to be}} sniffing gasoline. The Canadian and provincial Newfoundland and Labrador governments intervened on a number of occasions, sending many children away for treatment. Despite being moved to the new community of Natuashish in 2002, serious <b>inhalant</b> abuse problems have continued. Similar problems were reported in Sheshatshiu in 2000 and also in Pikangikum First Nation. In 2012, the issue once again made the news media in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has long}} faced a petrol (gasoline) {{sniffing}} problem in isolated and impoverished aboriginal communities. Although some sources argue that sniffing {{was introduced by}} United States servicemen stationed in the nation's Top End during World War II |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121901/http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/SAN/Attachments/Hansard/2006/LC/WH290806.LC.htm |archivedate = 29 September 2007}} or through experimentation by 1940s-era Cobourg Peninsula sawmill workers, other sources claim that <b>inhalant</b> abuse (such as glue inhalation) emerged in Australia in the late 1960s. Chronic, heavy petrol sniffing appears to occur among remote, impoverished indigenous communities, where the ready accessibility of petrol has helped {{to make it a}} common substance for abuse.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the most}} {{primitive}} form of smoking requires tools {{of some sort}} to perform. This {{has resulted in a}} staggering variety of smoking tools and paraphernalia from all over the world. Whether tobacco, cannabis, opium or herbs, some form of receptacle is required along with a source of fire to light the mixture. The most common today is by far the cigarette, consisting of a mild <b>inhalant</b> strain of tobacco in a tightly rolled tube of paper, usually manufactured industrially and including a filter, or hand-rolled with loose tobacco. Other popular smoking tools are various pipes and cigars.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to classify <b>inhalants</b> by the effect they have on the body. Solvents such as toluene and gasoline act as depressants, causing users to feel relaxed and sleepy. Many <b>inhalants</b> act primarily as asphyxiant gases, with their primary effect due to oxygen deprivation. Nitrous oxide can be categorized as a psychedelic drug, as it can cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Other agents may have more direct effects at receptors, as <b>inhalants</b> exhibit a variety of mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action of many non-medical <b>inhalants</b> have not been well elucidated. Anesthetic gases used for surgery, such as nitrous oxide or enflurane, are believed to induce anesthesia primarily by acting as NMDA receptor antagonists, open channel blockers that bind {{to the inside of}} the calcium channels on the outer surface of the neuron, and provide high levels of NMDA receptor blockade for a short period of time.|$|R

25|$|Bitterlings have a {{remarkable}} reproduction strategy where parents transfer {{responsibility for the}} care of their young to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's <b>inhalant</b> water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide, also {{sometimes}} known as laughing gas, is a legally available gas used for purposes that include anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, {{as well as}} food preparation and the fueling of rocket and racing engines. Substance abusers {{also sometimes}} use the gas as an <b>inhalant.</b> Like all other inhalants, it's popular because it provides consciousness-altering effects while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit or illegal drugs of abuse. Abuse of nitrous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation called hypoxia, brain damage, and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency {{that can lead to}} nerve damage.|$|E
25|$|Jenkem is a {{supposed}} <b>inhalant</b> and hallucinogen created from fermented human waste. In the mid-1990s, {{it was reported}} to be a popular street drug among Zambian street children. They would put the feces and urine in a jar and cover it with a balloon then let it ferment out in the sun, then afterwards they would inhale the fumes created. In November 2007, there was a moral panic in the United States after widespread reports of jenkem becoming a popular recreational drug in middle and high schools, though the true extent of the practice has since been called into question. Several sources reported that the increase in American media coverage was based on a hoax and on faulty Internet research.|$|E

25|$|In most countries, fluoroquinolones are {{approved}} {{for use in}} children only under narrowly-defined circumstances, owing {{in part to the}} observation of high rates of musculoskeletal adverse events in fluoroquinolone treated juvenile animals. In the UK, the prescribing indications for fluoroquinolones for children are severely restricted. Only <b>inhalant</b> anthrax and pseudomonal infections in cystic fibrosis infections are licensed indications in the UK due to ongoing safety concerns. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, serious adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these were considered by the treating physician to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the study drug. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the U.S. FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System {{at the time of the}} 20 September 2011 U.S. FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee included musculoskeletal events (39, including 5 cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including 5 cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.|$|E
500|$|Fertilization {{is usually}} external. Typically, a short stage lasts {{a few hours}} or days before the eggs hatch into trochophore larvae. These later develop into veliger larvae which settle on the seabed and undergo {{metamorphosis}} into juveniles that are sometimes (for example {{in the case of}} oysters) known as [...] "spat". In some species, such as those in the genus Lasaea, females draw water containing sperm in through their <b>inhalant</b> siphons and fertilization takes place inside the female. These species then brood the young inside their mantle cavity, eventually releasing them into the water column as veliger larvae or as crawl-away juveniles.|$|E
