40|$|Background: The {{observed}} {{activity of}} cisplatin {{in breast cancer}} and its unattractive toxicity profile in palliative treatment warranted further study of platinum analogues in this disease. Patients and methods: Sixty-two patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, 61 {{of whom had been}} previously treated with chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to therapy with either <b>iproplatin</b> (n = 32) or carboplatin (n = 30). Both platinum analogues were administered intravenously, <b>iproplatin</b> at a dose of 240 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks and carboplatin at a dose of 450 mg/m 2 every 5 weeks. Results: Only two patients responded to <b>iproplatin</b> (7 %) for durations of 21 and 61 weeks, and one patient responded to carboplatin (3 %) for a duration of 64 weeks. All responses were complete. At the given dose schedules carboplatin was more myelosuppressive than <b>iproplatin.</b> Non-hematologic toxicities included nausea and vomiting (93 % vs. 90 %), diarrhea (20 % vs. 10 %) and hemorrhage (16 % vs. 10 %) for <b>iproplatin</b> and carboplatin, respectively. Two patients developed alopecia with carboplatin. No renal toxicity was observed. Conclusions: Both <b>iproplatin</b> and carboplatin have limited activity in previously treated women with advanced breast cancer when given in conventional dosages. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

40|$|A {{modified}} double-layer Hamburger and Salmon cloning assay {{was used}} to test cisplatin and its analogs (spiroplatin, carboplatin and <b>iproplatin)</b> on fresh tumor samples from 63 patients with a variety of non-hematological malignancies. Among them were 18 breast cancers, 17 ovarian cancers and 7 of unknown primaries. Half the patients received prior chemotherapy. Cisplatin regimens were given in 16 cases. When possible, cells were exposed for 1 h to each drug in concentrations of 0. 1 Μg/ml and 1. 0 Μg/ml for cisplatin and spiroplatin, 1. 0 Μg/ml and 10 Μg/ml for carboplatin and <b>iproplatin.</b> A ≧ 50 % cell kill with at least one drug was found in 20 samples including 8 ovarian cancers, 3 breast cancers and 1 unknown primary. A ≧ 70 % cell kill was seen in 2 samples with cisplatin, 3 with spiroplatin and carboplatin, and 6 with <b>iproplatin.</b> There was only partial cross-resistance between cisplatin and its analogs. Among 57 paired comparisons of cisplatin with spiroplatin, 2 showed drug sensitivity to cisplatin alone, 6 to spiroplatin alone, and 6 to both. The same sort of observation was made with carboplatin. The lack of cross-resistance between cisplatin and <b>iproplatin</b> was particularly striking: among 53 pairs, 6 were sensitive to cisplatin alone, 8 to <b>iproplatin</b> alone, and 2 to both. About 20 % of the samples that were resistant to cisplatin were sensitive to <b>iproplatin.</b> Our data show hints of activity in breast and ovarian cancers with all analogs and suggest that they will achieve clinical antitumor activity similar to that they will achieve clinical antitumor activity similar to that of cisplatin. The in vitro evidence of incomplete cross-resistance between cisplatin and its analogs should be investigated further. © 1990 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the acute tubular nephrotoxicity of three platinum compounds {{in children and}} adults with solid tumors by monitoring the urinary excretion of alanine aminopeptidase, N -acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, and total protein. Cisplatin (100 mg/m 2) was administered with mannitol, or at a twofold larger total dosage (50 mg/m 2 per day for 4 days) in a 3 % saline infusion. Carboplatin (300 mg/m 2) was administered in combination with 5 -fluorouracil, and <b>iproplatin</b> was administered in dosages ranging from 216 to 388 mg/m 2. Enzymuria and proteinuria induced by cisplatin at a total dosage of 200 mg/m 2 on a divided schedule did not significantly differ from that observed for the single 100 mg/m 2 dose. Enzymuria and proteinuria induced by carboplatin and <b>iproplatin</b> were significantly less than that for cisplatin; however, one patient developed chronic tubular damage after three courses of carboplatin, and the acute tubular toxicity of <b>iproplatin</b> in one of 15 patients was exceptional. Our findings support the value of administering cisplatin in hypertonic saline on a divided schedule as a strategy to reduce acute tubular damage. Although carboplatin and <b>iproplatin</b> are less nephrotoxic than cisplatin, occasionally patients experience subclinical acute or chronic tubular damage {{that may lead to}} overt nephrotoxicity with continued therapy...|$|E
40|$|Mutagenesis and {{cytotoxicity}} {{were studied}} in Escherichia coli by <b>iproplatin</b> and carboplatin, two analogs of cisplatin (CDDP) currently undergoing clinical trial. As with CDDP, mutagenesis by these agents was {{mediated by the}} umuDC gene product. In contrast to CDDP, however, mismatch repair did not substantially contribute to survival of cells after exposure to these agents since dam- 3 E. coli were not more sensitive than wild type E. coli. UvrA- E. coli, however were more sensitive to these analogs demonstrating that as with CDDP, uvr endonuclease-mediated excision contributes to the repair of DNA damage induced by platinum compounds...|$|E
40|$|Ten human ovarian {{carcinoma}} {{cell lines}} have been studied as a potential in vitro screen {{for the development of}} novel anticancer platinum complexes. Lines have been established and developed both from solid and ascitic tumours, from pretreated and untreated patients, and are available at a range of in vitro passage numbers. The biological properties of the lines were consistent with them being human, epithelial and of ovarian carcinoma origin. Using a tritiated thymidine or leucine uptake method, and a 96 hour continuous drug exposure, the {{lines have been}} calibrated against four platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin, <b>iproplatin,</b> carboplatin and tetraplatin. Striking differences in cytotoxicity were observed across the lines for each agent. Some lines were consistently resistant, others generally sensitive, whereas some showed clear evidence of differential sensitivity to a particular agent. Statistical analysis (Spearman rank correlation) involving the six possible pairings of drugs showed that cisplatin, <b>iproplatin</b> and carboplatin elicit a very similar pattern of response in these lines whereas tetraplatin elicits a completely different response pattern. Similar cytotoxicity values were obtained using a soft agar cloning assay. Results using a tetrazolium dye reduction assay, however, gave somewhat higher and more variable values, particularly with tetraplatin. The thymidine uptake assay will be adopted in further studies on a selected panel of six lines. This panel encompasses the spectra of sensitivities identified {{for each of the four}} agents against the original ten lines and may provide a useful screening facility for the development of novel platinum drugs, in that it detects both cell line-determined and structure-determined differences in cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the Eastern Cooperative Oncol-ogy Group (ECOG) has studied {{a series of}} {{combination}} chemotherapy regimens in metastatic (stage IV) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In January 1984, the ECOG activated a randomized study, EST 1583, which concluded the evaluation of combination regimens in phase III trials and initiated the evaluation of single agents exclusively in previously untreated patients. The treatment regimens in EST 1583 consisted of: (1) mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin (MVP); (2) vinblas-tine and cisplatin (VP); (3) MVP alternating with the regimen cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrex-ate, and procarbazine (CAMP); (4) carboplatin fol-lowed by the MVP regimen {{at the time of}} progression; and (5) <b>iproplatin</b> followed by MVP at the time o...|$|E
40|$|The human tumor stem-cell assay {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the in vitro chemosensitivity of 27 evaluable samples to cisplatin and its analogues, <b>iproplatin</b> and carboplatin, {{as well as to}} BCNU, teniposide, vindesine, and dibromodulcitol. All agents exhibited some antitumor activity with the exception of dibromodulcitol (zero response out of 19 evaluable samples). Vindesine, BCNU, and carboplatin were the three most active compounds, with response rates of 29 %, 23 %, and 22 %, respectively. There was a lack of complete cross-resistance between carboplatin and cisplatin as well as between carboplatin and BCNU. Our data suggest that clinical studies with carboplatin and combinations of vindesine plus cisplatin and its analogues may be worthwhile. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{platinum}} drug chemosensitivity of five human cervical {{squamous cell}} carcinoma cell lines (HX/ 151, HX/ 155, HX/ 156, HX/ 160 and HX/ 171) derived from previously untreated patients has been determined. Compared to our data obtained previously using human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, all five lines were relatively resistant to cisplatin, carboplatin, <b>iproplatin</b> and tetraplatin. One of the lines (HX/ 156) was exceptionally sensitive to the novel platinum (IV) ammine/amine dicarboxylates JM 216 [bis-acetatoammine dichloro (cyclohexylamine) platinum (IV) ] and JM 221 [ammine dibutyrato dichloro (cyclohexylamine) platinum (IV) ]. The range in IC 50 values across the five lines was approximately 2. 5 -fold for cisplatin, carboplatin and <b>iproplatin,</b> 13 -fold for tetraplatin and JM 216, and 25 -fold for JM 221. No significant correlation (P > 0. 05) was observed between platinum drug chemosensitivity and either glutathione levels or cadmium chloride sensitivity, an indicator of metallothionein levels. In addition, {{there was no significant}} correlation (P > 0. 05) between cisplatin cytotoxicity and intracellular cisplatin accumulation or JM 216 cytotoxicity and intracellular JM 216 accumulation over the dose range 5 - 100 microM (2 h exposure). The exceptional sensitivity of HX/ 156 to JM 216 appears, at least partially, to be a result of enhanced accumulation of JM 216. An 8. 6 -fold acquired cisplatin resistant stable variant of HX/ 155 has been generated in vitro. Intracellular cisplatin accumulation was reduced by 2. 4 +/- 0. 3 -fold (mean +/- s. d.) in HX/ 155 cisR across the dose range 1 - 100 microM (2 h exposure). Glutathione levels in HX/ 155 cisR were elevated by 1. 3 -fold in terms of protein content and by 1. 6 -fold in terms of cell number. HX/ 155 cisR was 1. 9 -fold resistant to cadmium chloride. Total platinum bound to DNA after cisplatin exposure (10, 25, 50 or 100 microM for 2 h) was 3. 6 +/- 0. 6 -fold (mean +/- s. d.) lower in HX/ 155 cisR. Hence the mechanism of acquired cisplatin resistance in HX/ 155 cisR appears to be multifocal, with reduced intracellular drug accumulation and elevated glutathione and metallothionein levels combining to reduce DNA platination levels. While HX/ 155 cisR was cross-resistant to tetraplatin and carboplatin, novel platinum (II) and (IV) ammine/amine complexes, including JM 216 and JM 221, partially circumvented resistance (resistance factors of 1. 5 - 2). Non cross-resistance was observed to <b>iproplatin</b> and nine non-platinum anticancer agents. Intracellular tetraplatin accumulation was reduced by 1. 8 +/- 0. 1 -fold (mean +/- s. d.) in HX/ 155 cisR across the dose range 1 - 100 microM (2 h exposure). In contrast, after JM 216 exposure (1 - 100 microM for 2 h), no significant difference in intracellular platinum levels between HX/ 155 and HX/ 155 cisR was observed.

40|$|Cisplatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} active of {{currently}} available cytotoxic agents and has efficacy against a wide range of malignancies. More recently one of its analogues, carboplatin, has tended to replace cisplatin in the treatment of some tumour types on the basis of equivalent efficacy and significantly decreased nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity (Calvert et al., 1982; Smith et al., 1985; Wiltshaw, 1985). Cis-dichloro-trans-dihydroxy bis (isopropylamine) platinum (iv) (CHIP, <b>Iproplatin),</b> another analogue investigated in parallel with carboplatin, likewise proved to be an active agent (Sessa et al., 1988; van Glabbeke et al., 1988) but its development was curtailed with the emergence of nephrotoxicity. Despite its wide spectrum of clinical activity, cisplatin initially made little impact in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. There were two main reasons for this. First...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{glutathione}} (GSH) in {{the effectiveness}} of and resistance to 7 platinum compounds [5 Pt(II) and 2 Pt(IV) drugs] was evaluated in a 8. 6 -fold cisplatin (CDDP) -resistant human small cell lung cancer cell line (GLC 4 /CDDP), the parent GLC 4 line, a 3. 7 -fold CDDP-resistant human embryonal carcinoma cell line (Tera-CP), and the parent Tera line (NTera 2 /D 1). Resistance factors for both CDDP-resistant cell lines were determined after continuous incubation (4 days) with CDDP. Continuous incubation with the other studied platinum drugs revealed complete cross-resistance for carboplatin (CBDCA) and zeniplatin but less for enloplatin (ENLO) and <b>iproplatin</b> in both models. Tetraplatin and lobaplatin showed, respectively, partial and complete cross-resistance in GLC 4 /CDDP but no cross-resistance in Tera-CP.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} redox {{behavior of}} <b>iproplatin</b> (JM 9) was investigated at the carbon paste electrode using cyclic voltammetry {{in the absence}} and presence of free chloride ions. In the absence of chloride, a diffusion‐controlled, two‐electron reduction peak (Epc 1) is observed, giving a platinum(II) derivative that is oxidized to a Pt(IV) compound on cycling (Epa 1). Photolytic reduction‐hydrolysis to two platinum(II) derivatives results in a Pt(II) compound which on anodic scanning is oxidized to a Pt(IV) compound (Epa 2) that is subsequently reduced to'a Pt(II) compound on cycling, to {{give rise to a}} second (earlier) reduction peak (Epc 2). The other (nonhydrolyzed) photolytic reduction Pt(II) product can also be reduced (E[*]pc 2 ′) to give Pt(O) that subsequently is oxidized to Pt oxides (E[*]pa*); this latter Pt(II) compound is prevalent in the presence of chloride ions, which inhibit hydrolysis.

Resistance factors for both CDDP-resistant cell lines were determined after continuous incubation (4 days) with CDDP. Continuous incubation with the other studied platinum drugs revealed complete cross-resistance for carboplatin (CBDCA) and zeniplatin but less for enloplatin (ENLO) and <b>iproplatin</b> in both models. Tetraplatin and lobaplatin showed, respectively, partial and complete cross-resistance in GLC 4 /CDDP but no cross-resistance in Tera-CP. GSH level, but not glutathione S-transferase activity, of the 4 cell lines correlated with platinum drug concentrations inhibiting cell survival by 50 % after continuous incubation (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 05). GSH depletion by DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (BSO) increased sensitivity, as measured after a 4 -h exposure to the drugs, of GLC 4 /CDDP for CDDP 2. 0 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 7 -fold, for zeniplatin 1. 7 -fold, and almost {{to the level of}} the sensitive GLC 4 for ENLO, whereas no effect was observed for lobaplatin and the Pt(IV) compounds <b>iproplatin</b> and tetraplatin. BSO-modulating effect was higher in the sensitive GLC 4 line for most compounds; therefore reduction of resistance could be achieved only for CDDP and ENLO. In contrast to GLC 4, no modulation occurred in Tera. In Tera-CP BSO increased sensitivity for CDDP 1. 5 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 9 -fold, and for zeniplatin 1. 2 -fold; no effect was observed for ENLO, lobaplatin, and the Pt(IV) compounds. Reduction of CDDP resistance by BSO was known to occur with identical cellular platinum levels and higher Pt-DNA binding in GLC 4 /CCDP. However, pretreatment with BSO followed by 4 h ENLO incubation increased cellular platinum levels in both GLC 4 and GLC 4 /CDDP while Pt-DNA binding remained unchanged. In conclusion, GSH reflected sensitivity to platinum-containing drugs. However, since the involvement of GSH differed between the models and the various platinum drugs, the effect of modulation with BSO was unpredictable...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SCC- 25 /CP) which is relatively stably resistant to m-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) ((' 1) 1) 1 ') after repeated exposure to escalating doses of the drug. The studies reported elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the SCC- 25 /CP cell line is resistant to CDDP. The SCC- 25 /CP cell line is approximately 30 -fold resistant to CDDP, approximately 10 fold resistant to carboplatin, and about 9 -fold resistant to <b>iproplatin.</b> Using ["*"Pt]CDDP, we examined the levels of platinum in whole cells and cellular fractions of both the SCC- 25 and SCC- 25 /CP cells after l h exposure to 100 iiM drug.

40|$|In vivo {{models of}} {{acquired}} {{resistance to the}} platinum-based agents cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), <b>iproplatin</b> (CHIP) and tetraplatin have been established using a panel of six parent human ovarian carcinoma lines, two (HX/ 110 and PXN/ 87) being derived from previously untreated patients. Resistance has been generated to CDDP (three lines), CBDCA (one line), CHIP (three lines) and tetraplatin (one line) either by treatment in vivo or (for one line to CDDP) through exposure in vitro and subsequent transfer to mice. With the four tumours where resistance was generated using CDDP or CBDCA, a complete cross-resistance to the remaining platinum agents studied was observed. In contrast, {{in one of three}} lines with derived resistance to the platinum (IV) agent, CHIP, (PXN/ 951) a retention in sensitivity was observed with CDDP and CBDCA. Only one of the six parent tumour lines (PXN/ 100) was markedly sensitive to tetraplatin. Where resistance was generated to tetraplatin (PXN/ 100 T) there was some retention of activity by CDDP. For the CDDP-resistant line established in vitro, there was a close agreement between the cross-resistance profile obtained in vitro vs that obtained in vivo. This tumour panel may be useful in the elucidation of cellular and molecular resistance mechanisms to platinum drugs operative in vivo. Moreover, as they appear to mimic the clinical observations of shared cross-resistance between CDDP, CBDCA and CHIP, they may represent valuable preclinical evaluation models for the discovery of drugs capable of conferring responses in CDDP-refractory ovarian cancer...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} drug resistance {{observed in the}} clinic, two cisplatin-resistant cell lines were produced fi om a murine ovarian reticulosarcoma, M 5076 (M 5), by pulse (MS/CDDP) and continuous (M 5 /CDDPc) treatment with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CD DP). These cell lines showed a similar stable low level of resistance (approximately 3 -fold) to CDDP and cross-resistance to carboplatin, <b>iproplatin</b> and the new alkylating agent tallimustine, but not to L-PAM (L-phenylalanine mustard) and BCNU (1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea). Collateral sensitivity to two inhibitors of topoisomerase II, VP 16 (etoposide) and doxorubicin (Dox), but cross-resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, were observed. The two cell lines were also sensitive to 5 -fluorouracil. No {{increase in the level}} of glutathione or activity of glutathione S-transferase could be observed in resistant cells compared with the parental M 5 cells. Total DNA platination immediately after treatment was similar in the parental and resistant cell lines. Repair of total DNA platination, measured after 24 h of recovery, was undetectable in M 5 and MS/CDDP cells, but was 33 % in M 5 /CDDPc cells. Initial DNA-interstrand cross-links (DNA-ISC) were six times higher in M 5 than in M 5 /CDDP cells, but 24 h after treatment, both lines had completely repaired this damage. M 5 /CDDPc cells did not show formation of DNA-ISC at any time after treatment. The two resistant cell lines were tumorigenic when implanted in mice and resistant to CDDP treatment in vivo. The CDDP resistant tumours were not cross-resistant in vivo to L-PAM, BCNU and Dox, which had been active in vitro, nor to tallimustine, which had been cross-resistant in vitro. Mechanisms of resistance in M 5 /CDDP and M 5 -CDDPc seem to be based on a lower formation of DNA-ISC combined, for the latter cell line, with a higher repair capacity for total DNA platination.
