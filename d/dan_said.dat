500|$|Exiled 1989 student leader Wang <b>Dan</b> <b>said</b> he was [...] "ecstatic". Human {{rights lawyer}} Li Heping called the award [...] "huge {{encouragement}} for the Chinese people... an affirmation {{that there are}} people around the world who really care about human rights and the legal system in China, that the world hasn't forgotten us." [...] He added that others, such as Gao Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, and Hu Jia, also deserved the prize. The Globe and Mail said that while many activists agreed he was worthy of the award, some radical reformers within Chinese democracy movement, such as Wei Jingsheng, see the moderate Liu as the wrong choice due to his advocacy of a gradual path to constitutional democracy in China.|$|E
500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and <b>Dan</b> <b>said</b> that what they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. So I tried to approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These things should be so big and fast it's hard to keep up with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|The Hakeem Nicks Laugh/Loser Game Show Sound - Jokes {{are a major}} fixture of {{the show}} and one-liner jokes occur quite often. [...] For example, during one episode Stugotz made the {{accusation}} that [...] "Gone with the Wind" [...] was overrated and decried {{the length of the}} movie. [...] He punctuated this grievance with the joke [...] "How long does it take for something to blow away?". [...] When such a joke is made, it will invoke one of two sounds, either the Loser Game Show Sound (The Tuba Riff from The Price is Right, played following a contestant losing) or the Hakeem Nicks Laugh. [...] The Hakeem Nicks Laugh was sound taken during an interview that <b>Dan</b> <b>said</b> was an otherwise useless endeavor as Nicks hadn't been saying anything interesting, and Dan insists the subtle [...] "heh heh heh" [...] of The Hakeem Nicks Laugh was the only thing of value found in the interview. [...] If a joke is deemed generally bad, corny, or falls in the category of a [...] "dad joke", or if Mike Ryan feels like irritating Dan, the joke will get the Loser Game Show Sound. [...] If it is deemed to be clever enough, or if there is a certain aspect of sexual innuendo, it will garner the Hakeem Nicks Laugh.|$|E
