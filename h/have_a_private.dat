5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller (1579–1654) of Kraków, Poland, {{asked that}} his family {{henceforth}} celebrate a private Purim, marking {{the end of his}} many troubles, including having faced trumped-up charges.

25|$|Wittgenstein argues, in {{his later}} work, that this account of private {{language}} is inconsistent.

For example, if one cannot <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> language, it might not make any sense to talk of private experiences or of private mental states.|$|E

25|$|The officer {{commanding}} the Army of India was the Commander-in-Chief, India who {{reported to the}} civilian Governor-General of India. The title was used before {{the creation of a}} unified British Indian Army; the first holder was Major General Stringer Lawrence in 1748. By the early 1900s the Commander-in-Chief and his staff were based at GHQ India. Indian Army postings were less prestigious than British Army positions, but the pay was significantly greater so that officers could live on their salaries instead of having to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> income. Accordingly, vacancies in the Indian Army were much sought after and generally reserved for the higher placed officer-cadets graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. British officers in the Indian Army were expected to learn to speak the Indian languages of their men, who tended to be recruited from primarily Hindi speaking areas. Prominent British Indian Army officers included Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood, Claude Auchinleck and William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim.|$|E
