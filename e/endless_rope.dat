George Binns, an Inspector of Mines, had suggested in 1883 that an ordinary <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> system would be better than the system then being tried for lowering coal on the incline. Mr Hughes adopted this idea and altered the system into five self-acting inclines, each with an <b>endless</b> <b>rope.</b> In 1884, George Binns reported that the new inclines worked very well, but noted it was necessary to stop each incline every time a tub (truck) passed the incline terminus, causing considerable delays.

2500|$|The level 9 adit was {{the longest}} built at Rhosydd, {{measuring}} [...] from the mouth to the haulage system at the inner end. It had a gradient of 1 in 86 to aid drainage, and took eight years to complete, being completed in 1870 or 1871. During its construction, an internal incline was built downwards from floor 5, so that rock from higher levels could be lowered down to the mine exit. Trucks were moved along the adit by attaching them to an <b>endless</b> <b>rope,</b> which was driven by a [...] diameter pitchback water wheel located {{near the mouth of}} the adit. They were marshalled into rakes of about 12 wagons, with a gripper truck or megryn at both ends. A screw handle was used to attach the front megryn to the rope, both on the line of full trucks in the mine and on empty ones outside the adit. The rope was then set in motion, and when the couplings between the trucks were tight, the gripper on the back megryn was applied. When they reached the far end, the grippers were released, as the water wheel took some time to stop. A similar system was used on the Glasgow Subway when it first opened. For most of its length, there were only three rails in the adit, the centre one being shared by both tracks. They fanned out into double tracks at both ends, and for [...] in the middle, so that trucks moving in opposite directions could pass one another. Communication between the operators at either end was by a bell system.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} on ship and on shore men worked desperately. Before long {{the end of}} the hawser was carried round on the high cliff, and pulled as taut as the force at hand could manage, and made fast. Soon <b>endless</b> <b>ropes</b> were bringing in passengers and crew as fast as place could be found for them. It became simply a race for time. If the fire, working against the wind, did not reach the hawser, and if the ship lasted the furious bumping on the sandbank, which threatened to shake her to pieces each moment, all on board might yet be saved.|$|R

60|$|Still {{those on}} shore delayed to act for a minute, {{in order to}} make quite sure that ample time had been allowed for the {{fastening}} of the pulley. And now the all-important operation of conveying a thick hawser to the wreck was begun. With the tackle already fast to the ship this was comparatively easy. The whip being rove through a pulley, both ends were kept on shore and fastened together. It thus became a sort of <b>endless</b> <b>rope,</b> by which things could be passed to the wreck and back again. Even without any hawser at all, many lives might have been saved by this rope; but, being small, it was liable to get broken, therefore the end of the thick hawser was sent out and received by Bax, who bound it also securely to the mainmast close to the pulley, about fifteen feet above the deck.|$|E

6000|$|Sophie Charlotte partook of her Mother's tendencies; {{and carried}} them with her to Berlin, there to be {{expanded}} in many ways into ampler fulfilment. She too had the sage Leibnitz often with her, at Berlin; no end to her questionings of him; eagerly desirous to draw water from that deep well,--a wet rope, with cobwebs sticking to it, too often all she got; <b>endless</b> <b>rope,</b> and the bucket never coming to view. Which, however, she took patiently, as a thing according to Nature. She had her learned Beausobres and other Reverend Edict-of-Nantes gentlemen, famed Berlin divines; whom, if any Papist notability, Jesuit ambassador or the like, happened to be there, she would set disputing with him, in the Soiree at Charlottenburg. She could right well preside over such a battle of the Cloud-Titans, and conduct the lightnings softly, without explosions. There is a pretty and very characteristic Letter of hers, still pleasant to read, though turning on theologies now fallen dim enough; addressed to Father Vota, the famous Jesuit, King's-confessor, and diplomatist, from Warsaw, who had been doing his best in one such rencontre before her Majesty (date March, 1703),--seemingly {{on a series of}} evenings, in the intervals of his diplomatic business; the Beausobre champions being introduced to him successively, one each evening, by Queen Sophie Charlotte. To all appearance the fencing had been keen; the lightnings in need of some dexterous conductor. Vota, on his way homeward, had written to apologize for the sputterings of fire struck out of him in certain pinches of the combat; says, It was the rough handling the Primitive Fathers got from these Beausobre gentlemen, who indeed to me, Vota in person, under your Majesty's fine presidency, were politeness itself, though they treated the Fathers so ill. Her Majesty, with beautiful art, in this Letter, smooths the raven plumage of Vota;--and, at the same time, throws into him, as with invisible needle-points, an excellent dose of acupuncturation, {{on the subject of the}} Primitive Fathers and the Ecumenic Councils, on her own score.

50|$|A dumb pulley {{can lift}} very large masses a short distance. It {{consists}} of two fixed pulleys of unequal radii that are attached {{to each other and}} rotate together, a single pulley bearing the load, and an <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> looped around the pulleys. To avoid slippage, the rope is usually replaced by a chain, and the connected pulleys by sprockets.|$|E
5000|$|The brine {{was raised}} by pumps with an <b>endless</b> wire <b>rope</b> chain that was powered by an engine. When the brine reached the surface, it had a {{slightly}} [...] "turbid appearance." [...] This {{was the result of}} the brine mixing with clay and fine sand raised from the well, together with small bubbles of carbon dioxide. The brine also contained ferrous carbonate which was held in the solution by carbon dioxide. As the carbon dioxide escaped, the ferrous salt absorbed oxygen from the air and the hydrated ferric oxide separated as a [...] "yellowish red turbidity," [...] which settled after a short period, leaving behind a clear brine.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, in 1870, John Barraclough Fell {{replaced}} it with another experimental narrow gauge railway line, dubbed the Parkhouse Tramway, named after the Parkhouse Farm west of the mines. This had a gauge of 8 in and had also a very low centre of gravity and stabilising side rollers on a central beam consisting of two trusses. It was driven by a stationary engine and <b>endless</b> wire <b>rope.</b> It could transport up to 100,000 tons per year. The waggons were each loaded with one ton of iron ore, and small carriages with eight passengers were run with perfect steadiness and safety at a speed of 15 to 20 miles per hour.|$|R
50|$|Trains are {{worked up}} the incline between Queen's Street station and Cowlairs by {{attaching}} {{them to an}} <b>endless</b> wire <b>rope,</b> which is worked by a stationary engine {{at the top of}} the incline, and trains are piloted down the incline from Cowlairs to Queen's Street station, by attaching heavy breaks with a breaksman in each break in front of the trains. Sometimes the engines remain attached to the tail of the trains in descending the incline, and sometimes the trains proceed without an engine. This depends on whether the engine is required at Queen's Street or not, but in every case the breaksmen, who travel on the incline breaks in front of the train, are placed in charge of the train.|$|R

For some young 'stars' it seemed that they could do no wrong, and management always made excuses for them.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the incline}} {{did not work}} well.

5000|$|Finally, {{the most}} {{advanced}} systems involved continuous loops of rope operated like a cable car system. Some mines used endless chains before wire-rope became widely available. [...] The endless chain system originated in the mines near Burnley (England) around 1845. An <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> system was developed in Nottinghamshire around 1864, and another independently developed near Wigan somewhat later (also in England). [...] In these systems, individual cars or trains within the mine could {{be connected to the}} cable by a grip comparable to the grips used on surface cable car systems. [...] In some mines, the haulage chain or cable went {{over the top of the}} cars, and cars were released automatically when the chain or cable was lifted away by an overhead pulley. Where the cable ran under the cars, a handheld grip could be used, where the grip operator would ride on the front car of the train working the grip chained to the front of the car. In some cases, a separate grip car was coupled to the head of the train. [...] At the dawn of the 20th century, <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> haulage was the dominant haulage technology for the main haulage ways of underground mines.|$|E
60|$|But {{some part}} of the army will {{certainly}} cross at Potgieter's; and as I looked down on the smooth smiling landscape it seemed very strange to think that in a few days it would blaze into a veritable hell. Yet the dark lines of shelter trenches, the redoubts crowning the hills, the bristle of tiny black figures busily entrenching against the sky line, hundreds of horses grazing in the plain, all promised a fierce and stubborn defence. I turned about. The country to the southward was also visible. What looked to the naked eye like an <b>endless</b> thin <b>rope</b> lay streaked across the spacious veldt, and when I looked through the glass I saw that it was ten or twelve miles of marching men and baggage.

6000|$|The {{reader will}} {{understand}} that two ropes were now fastened to the mainmast of the [...] "Trident," [...] their other ends being fixed to a heavy anchor buried in the sand on shore. One of these ropes was the thick hawser, the other the whip; but as this whip was an <b>endless</b> or revolving <b>rope,</b> as has been explained, to an onlooker it appeared that there were three ropes stretched between the vessel and the shore, two of them thin and one thick.|$|R

50|$|The Puretic {{power block}} line was {{introduced}} in the 1950s and was the key factor in the mechanization of purse seining. The combination of these blocks with advances in fluid hydraulics and the new large synthetic nets changed the character of purse seine fishing. The original Puretic power block was driven by an <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> from the warping head of a winch. Nowadays, power blocks are usually driven by hydraulic pumps powered by the main or auxiliary engine. Their rpm, pull and direction can be controlled remotely.|$|E
50|$|The <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> for {{the incline}} {{was driven by}} two beam engines at Cowlairs, of the high {{pressure}} type, made by Kerr, Neilson and Company of Glasgow. They had 28 inch cylinders, and 72 inch stroke. The crankshaft had a spur wheel of 12 feet diameter, which drove the cable drum through gearing. The main cable drum was 18 feet in diameter, mounted in a pit under the track. The beam engines were supplied with steam at 50 psi by 8 boilers, each 30 feet long and 5 feet diameter.|$|E
5000|$|Nationalisation {{brought about}} a review of pre-war {{development}} plans, which resulted in re-organisation of the pits in the area. After abandoning No.5 shaft in 1950, in 1951 two horizontal 16 ft wide by 13 ft high tunnels were driven 2750 yd in a southerly direction from No's 3 and 4 shafts. In 1960 these tunnels intersected the Crombouke seam, allowing and two more faces to be opened for production. An <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> haulage was installed and [...] capacity tubs were introduced to take coal to the skip pockets in No.4 shaft bottom.|$|E
60|$|Here a tram-car, {{without any}} visible means of support, slid stealthily {{behind me and}} nearly struck me in the back. This was the famous cable car of San Francisco, which runs by {{gripping}} an <b>endless</b> wire <b>rope</b> sunk in the ground, and of which I will tell you more anon. A hundred yards further {{there was a slight}} commotion in the street, a gathering together of three or four, something that glittered as it moved very swiftly. A ponderous Irish gentleman, with priest's cords in his hat and a small nickel-plated badge on his fat bosom, emerged from the knot supporting a Chinaman who had been stabbed in the eye and was bleeding like a pig. The by-standers went their ways, and the Chinaman, assisted by the policeman, his own. Of course this was none of my business, but I rather wanted to know {{what had happened to the}} gentleman who had dealt the stab. It said a great deal for the excellence of the municipal arrangement of the town that a surging crowd did not at once block the street to see what was going forward. I was the sixth man and the last who assisted at the performance, and my curiosity was six times the greatest. Indeed, I felt ashamed of showing it.|$|R

A shelter was provided for the passengers. The bottom of the car was 12 ft above high water level and it cleared the ship canal wall by 4.5 ft. It was suspended from a moving trolley 77 ft in length. In conditions of reasonable weather and load the journey took 2.5 minutes. The driver was sited in a cabin on top of the car from which he had an uninterrupted view in all directions.

6000|$|... {{and then}} pieced and dizened out afresh as a toy. And then again he started {{away from his}} own thoughts, at finding himself {{on the edge of}} that very gulf, which, as Mellot had lately told him, Barnakill denounced as the true hell of genius, where Art is {{regarded}} as an end and not a means, and objects are interesting, not in as far as they form our spirits, but in proportion as they can be shaped into effective parts of some beautiful whole. But whether it was a temptation or none, the desire recurred to him again and again. He even attempted to write, but sickened {{at the sight of the}} first words. He turned to his pencil, and tried to represent with it one scene at least; and with the horrible calmness of some self- torturing ascetic, he sat down to sketch a drawing of himself and Argemone on her dying day, with her head upon his bosom for the last time--and then tossed it angrily into the fire, partly because he felt just as he had in his attempts to write, that there was something more in all these events than he could utter by pen or pencil, than he could even understand; principally because he could not arrange the attitudes gracefully enough. And now, in front of the stern realities of sorrow and death, he began to see a meaning in another mysterious saying of Barnakill's, which Mellot was continually quoting, that 'Art was never Art till it was more than Art; that the Finite only existed as a body of the Infinite; and that the man of genius must first know the Infinite, unless he wished to become not a poet, but a maker of idols.' Still he felt in himself a capability, nay, an infinite longing to speak; though what he should utter, or how--whether as poet, social theorist, preacher, he could not yet decide. Barnakill had forbidden him painting, and though he hardly knew why, he dared not disobey him. [...] But Argemone's dying words lay on him as a divine command to labour. [...] All his doubts, his social observations, his dreams of the beautiful and the blissful, his intense perception of social evils, his new- born hope--faith it could not yet be called--in a ruler and deliverer of the world, all urged him on to labour: but at what? [...] He felt as if he were the demon in the legend, condemned to twine <b>endless</b> <b>ropes</b> of sand. The world, outside which he now stood for good and evil, seemed to him like some frantic whirling waltz; some serried struggling crowd, which rushed past him in aimless confusion, without allowing him time or opening to take his place among their ranks: and as for wings to rise above, and to look down upon the uproar, where were they? His melancholy paralysed him more and more. He was too listless even to cater for his daily bread by writing his articles for the magazines. Why should he? He had nothing to say. Why should he pour out words and empty sound, and add one more futility to the herd of 'prophets that had become wind, and had no truth in them'? Those who could write without a conscience, without an object except that of seeing their own fine words, and filling their own pockets--let them do it: for his part he would have none of it. But his purse was empty, and so was his stomach; and as for asking assistance of his uncle, it was returning like the dog to his vomit. So one day he settled all bills with his last shilling, tied up his remaining clothes in a bundle, and stoutly stepped forth into the street to find a job--to hold a horse, if nothing better offered; when, behold! on the threshold he met Barnakill himself.|$|R
50|$|Fisken {{also worked}} on the fly-rope system; an <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> set into motion by the {{flywheel}} of the engine drove windlasses by which the plough or other implement was put in motion. A great deal of excellent work was done on this system, especially with tackle made by Messrs. Barford & Perkins of Peterborough, {{but for some reason}} the system never took with farmers, and very few sets of Fisken's tackle are now in use. Fisken was the author of a pamphlet on 'The Cheapest System of Steam Cultivation and Steam Cartage,' and of another 'On the Comparative Methods of Steam Tackle,' which gained the prize of the Royal Bath and West of England Society.|$|E
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century Shipley Wharf {{directly}} above Shipley Lock was very busy with the transhipment of coal from railway wagons which had descended an incline from the Shipley Collieries to narrowboats on the Erewash Canal.There was also a much earlier wagonway which connected the Shipley collieries to Shipley wharf between the completion of the Erewash Canal in 1779 and the completion of the Nutbrook Canal in 1796, from which point in time the Nutbrook Canal took this traffic.The incline in use at the end of the nineteenth century was originally built to connect the Shipley Collieries, then owned by the Miller-Mundy family with the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley railway line and was operated for this purpose between 1848 and 1870. Problems with the Nutbrook Canal's water supply instigated the re-laying of rails on the incline and its extension under the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley line and under the Midland Railway's Eastwood Colliery branch line, to Shipley Wharf. Coal was loaded into narrowboats here from 1895 until 1942.The sidings at the wharf were laid in a triangle. The coal wagons descended the incline under braking relying on gravity and accumulated momentum to carry them to the sidings where they were connected to an <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> kept in motion by a stationary steam engine in the centre of the triangle. The <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> went around three wheels at the corners of the triangle. One was sited on the Erewash Canal's aqueduct which spanned the Erewash River, a second was under the bridge which carried the Eastwood Colliery's branch line over the Shipley line and the third was alongside Eastwood Lock. Using this mechanism the colliery wagons were brought alongside the wharf and could be emptied directly into waiting narrowboats.|$|E
50|$|The mast, which lacks shroud and bar, is hollow {{case and}} {{consists}} of glued wood with a hoisted (a planed or machined grooved) luff. The relatively coarse mast is supported by simple ball bearings at deck fitting and in the bottom. The sails are hoisted and hauled usually only once, in spring and autumn. During the season the sail(s) are wound up on the mast by this rotated by a crank in the cockpit which drives an <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> on a collar attached to {{the lower part of}} the mast. Reefing is therefore simple. By rotating the mast slightly a better aerodynamic profile which avoids turbulence on the leeward side of the circular mast is created. At full run the two sails are hauled on each side so the sail area doubled.|$|E
5000|$|A {{description}} of Zeita from {{the mid-19th century}} travels of James Turner Barclay notes that it is, [...] "... a picturesque Arab village, situated on a conical hill." [...] Writing at length of the well {{at the foot of}} the hill where he and his travel companions were directed after inquiring for water, he relates: [...] "... arriving there, we found several persons drawing water for themselves, donkeys, horses, and cattle. And notwithstanding the water was rather warm and considerably muddied by a Fellah who was wading about in the deep fountain, or more correctly speaking, shallow well, yet so thirsty were we that we drank it with decided gusto. It was eight or ten feet deep, and four or five yards in diameter, with the usual stone troughs for watering animals ..." [...] Camping between the well and the millet fields of the village, Barclay describes the expanse of the cultivated fields, as well as the construction and operation of the well in more detail: [...] "This Sakieh or well, supplied with machinery for raising water, is plied day and night by camels. A beautiful marble Corinthian capital supports the shaft of the main wheel. There are eighty-five stone jars, each containing two or three gallons, fastened at intervals of four feet on the two <b>endless</b> grass <b>ropes</b> going over the large rough pulley wrapped with grass cords. The water, which is incessantly poured out of the jars, is received into a channel cut into a marble pillar laid horizontally, and thus delivered into a reservoir twenty-four feet square, and thence let off into a trough of masonry thirty-six feet long and two and half broad, the outer border of which is made up of marble pillars worked in horizontally, as in other instances. But copious and unremitting as is this supply of water, it would seem totally inadequate to the demand. Herd after herd, and flock after flock, came crowding in about sunset, and the cry was, [...] "still they come", until it was too dark to count them ..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although work did {{not always}} come Randel's way, he never stpped coming up with new ideas, such as the {{elevated}} railway, which he tried to develop well before they became a reality. Randel, {{who claimed to have}} thought of the idea of elevated trains in 1829, attempted to get permission from New York City's Board of Alderman [...] - [...] the Common Council's name since 1831 [...] - [...] to build an elevated railway on Broadway. A committee of three evaluated the proposal, and had positive things to report about it, but recommended taking a cautious approach to such a sweeping change. They asked for models and further description and details, which Randel provided them after commissioning a cast-iron one-tenth scale model in Philadelphia at the cost of $4,000 (...) to $5,000 (...) [...] He invited Broadway business owners and their families to see the model, which was on display at 413 Broadway, and got a significant amount of positive press coverage. Randel's design was similar to the cable cars in San Francisco in that the trains were pulled by an <b>endless</b> loop of <b>rope.</b> There would be four lines, two uptown and two downtown, one a local and one an express each way, in a closed loop from Bowling Green to Union Square, a distance of about 3 mi in each direction. Despite the great care displayed by Randel in dealing with every detail of the system, from sanitation to the privacy of those in residences along the line, the Board of Alderman rejected Randel's the idea.|$|R
5000|$|The mines on the Denniston Plateau {{included}} the Banbury, Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, Whareatea, and Sullivan mines. The first mine was the Banbury, which began production in 1880. A double track 2 ft (0.61m) gauge 560 metre long horse tramway was built {{from the top}} of the incline to the Banbury Mine above the Waimangaroa Gorge to carry coal from the mine to the top of the incline. Later, horse-power was replaced by a steam engine-powered moving <b>endless</b> <b>rope</b> to which mine tubs were hooked by chains for their journeys to and from the bins at Brakehead. By 1889, the double track tramway (now called a roperoad) had been extended through and beyond the Banbury Mine, past the Ironbrook Mine and on to the Coalbrookdale Mine—a distance of about 2.4 kilometres (1.5 miles). The roperoad system was renewed along a partly new alignment between 1900 and 1904. (An image of one of these roperoads can be seen below in External links.) ...|$|E
