50|$|Geotrichosis {{generally}} {{has a good}} prognosis and patients generally have successful recovery. However, {{there is not a}} standard treatment for geotrichosis. There are several types of antimicrobial or antifungal compounds {{that can be used for}} geotrichosis treatment. One type of treatment of geotrichosis can involve miconazole and ketoconazole, which has shown to improve cutaneous, branchopulmonary, intestinal and joint conditions. Another method of treatment involves symptomatic care, bed rest, iodine therapy, aerosol nystatin and amphotericin B. Azole drugs including <b>isoconazole</b> and clotrimazole are used for geotrichosis treatment. Associated treatment for pulmonary geotrichosis includes the use of potassium iodide, sulfonamides or colistin. The associated asthma can be treated with desensitization and prednisolone. Amphotericin B, clotrimazole and S-fluorocytosine have become more susceptible to G. candidum. Antimycotic resistance can appear due to repeated treatment.|$|E
50|$|As {{aromatic}} compounds {{have been}} exhausted {{to a large}} extent as building blocks for life science products, N-heterocyclic structures prevail nowadays. They are found in many natural products, such as chlorophyll; hemoglobin; and the vitamins biotin, folic acid, niacin (PP), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and thiamine (vitamin B1). In synthetic life science products, N-heterocyclic moieties are widely diffuses both pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Thus, β-lactams are structural elements of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, imidazoles are found both in modern herbicides, e.g. Arsenal (imazapyr) and pharmaceuticals, e.g. the antiulcerants Tagamet (cimetidine. see above) and Nexium (omeprazole), the antimycotics Daktarin (miconazole), Fungarest (ketoconazole) and Travogen (<b>isoconazole).</b> Tetrazoles and tetrazolidines are pivotal parts of the “sartan” class of hypertensives, e.g. Candesartan cilexetil (candesartan), Avapro (irbesartan), Cozaar (losartan) and Diovan (valsartan).|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for novel metal-based complexes with biologically relevant molecules in technology and medicine. Three new Cu(II) coordination compounds with antifungal agent <b>isoconazole</b> (L), namely mononuclear complexes CuCl 2 (L) (2) (1), and Cu(O 2 CMe) (2) (L) (2) center dot 2 H(2) O (2) and coordination polymer Cu(pht) (L) (2) (n) (3) (where H(2) pht - o-phthalic acid) were synthesized and characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray crystallography. X-ray analysis showed that in all complexes, the <b>isoconazole</b> is coordinated to Cu(II) centres by a N atom of the imidazole fragment. In complex I, the square-planar environment of Cu(II) atoms is completed by two N atoms of <b>isoconazole</b> and two chloride ligands, whereas the Cu(II) atoms are coordinated by two N atoms from two <b>isoconazole</b> ligands and two O atoms from the different carboxylate residues: acetate in 2 and phthalate in 3.

40|$|The present article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} (up to 1994) on contact sensitivity to imidazoles and {{presents the results}} obtained from 15 patients observed at the Contact Allergy Unit in Leuven. The frequency {{as well as the}} cross-reaction patterns described are analyzed. Although allergic contact reactions may have been missed in the past (mainly because of problems with the correct choice of vehicle for patch testing), they seem to be relatively infrequent in view of their widespread use. The imidazole derivatives most frequently reported to be allergens are miconazole, econazole, tioconazole, and <b>isoconazole.</b> As far as cross-reactivity is concerned, statistically significant associations were found in the patient data between miconazole, econazole, and isoconazole; between sulconazole, miconazole, and econazole; and also between <b>isoconazole</b> and tioconazole. Patients sensitive to phenylethyl imidazoles (except ketoconazole) needing antimycotic therapy should be advised to use ketoconazole, clotrimazole, bifonazole, or, perhaps, the new flutrimazole.

The three imidazole drugs namely tioconazole, <b>isoconazole</b> and fenticonazole were simultaneously separated {{for the first time}} by MEKC technique using dual cyclodextrin (CD) approach. A combination of two neutral CDs; 2 -hydroxypropyl-�-CD (HP-�-CD) and heptakis (2, 6 -di-O-methyl) -�-CD (DM-�-CD) (35 mM: 10 mM) in background electrolyte (BGE) containing 35 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0), 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 15 % (v/v) acetonitrile at 27 kV and 30 oC gave the best separation of six stereoisomers of imidazole drugs with resolutions, Rs 1. 90 - 27. 22 and peak efficiencies, N > 180 000 in less than 15 min. The samples were injected electrokinetically at 3 kV for 3 s and detection was carried out at 200 nm. The method was linear over the concentration range of 25 - 200 mg/L (r 2 > 0. 998) and the detection limits (S/N = 3) of the three imidazole drugs were found to be 2. 7 - 7. 7 mg/L. The CD-MEKC method was successfully applied to the determination of the three imidazole drugs in spiked human urine to give mean recoveries ranging from 72. 3 to 107. 5 % (RSD < 6 %, n = 3). The method was also applied to the analysis of commercial cream formulation of tioconazole and <b>isoconazole.</b> Good mean recoveries were obtained, ranging from 93. 6 - 100 % (RSD < 7 %, n = 3). The best chiral separation of vinpocetine that gave four resolved peaks was achieved using 40 mM HP-�-CD in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0) consisting of 40 mM SDS and 10 % v/v acetonitrile at a separation temperature of 25 oC and separation voltage 25 kV. Samples were injected electrokinetically at 5 kV for 7 s. Vinpocetine detection was accomplished using diode array detector at 200 nm.

For this purpose, a D-optimal design with 21 experimental points was applied. Four antifungal agents (econazole, <b>isoconazole,</b> miconazole, sulconazole), three local anesthetics (bupivacaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine), two sympathomimetics (salbutamol and terbutaline) and one β-blocker (carvedilol) were selected as basic model analytes.

Two methods of inoculum preparation for susceptibility testing were evaluated that used (i) inocula consisting only of microconidia of dermatophytes filtered in Whatman filter model 40 and (ii) unfiltered inocula consisting of hyphae and microconidia. We followed the recommendations of approved document M 38 -A of CLSI (formerly NCCLS) with some adaptations, including an incubation period of 7 days and an incubation temperature of 28 °C. Reference strains of Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes were included as quality-control strains.
