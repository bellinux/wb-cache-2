Connecticut was <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> against the pass; they allowed an average of only 165yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259yards during the regular season.|$|E

This {{provided}} him with an <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familial to its staff.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> with children.|$|E
50|$|In the Second World War the {{requirement}} for motive power, <b>especially</b> <b>goods</b> train locomotives, rose sharply. To cope with the demand the standard locomotive classes 44, 50 and 86 were built, after 1941, to a simpler, more austere design and given the designation (ÜK) after the class number.|$|R

After going to {{elementary}} and junior high schools in Canton, Motley attended Canton McKinley High School, where he played on the football and basketball teams. He was <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> as a football fullback, and the McKinley Bulldogs posted a win-loss record of 25–3 during his tenure there. The team's three losses all came against Canton's chief rivals, a Massillon Washington High School team led by coach Paul Brown.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Picardy Spaniel (or Épagneul Bleu de Picardie) is a {{breed of}} Spaniel {{originating}} in France, {{from the area}} around the mouth of the River Somme, around the start of the 20th century. It is descended from Picardy Spaniels and English Setters, and is described as a quiet breed that requires much exercise due to its stamina. It is <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> with children. Similar to the Picardy Spaniel, it has a distinctive coloured coat. Recognised by only a handful of kennel associations, the breed is predominantly known in France and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Charles August was {{no great}} admirer of Joseph's. As a younger man, he had sought {{the hand of}} Joseph's sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph and their mother insisted she marry instead the better-connected Duke of Parma. After this disappointment, Charles II August married Maria Amalia of Saxony in 1774; she was the {{daughter}} of the Elector Christian (d. 1765) and his wife Maria Antonia, Max Joseph's sister. In 1769, the reigning Saxon elector, Frederick Augustus III, had married Charles August's sister. Charles August, sometimes called duc de Deux-Ponts (a French translation of Zweibrücken, or two bridges), was a French client and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> relations with the Saxon Electors: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia's husband received his rightful inheritance.|$|E

25|$|ACK {{scanning}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} unusual scan types, as it does not exactly determine whether the port is open or closed, but whether the port is filtered or unfiltered.

Simple packet filtering will allow established connections (packets with the ACK bit set), whereas a more sophisticated stateful firewall might not.|$|E
50|$|The {{volume of}} traffic in Germany, <b>especially</b> <b>goods</b> transportation, is {{at a very high}} level due to its central {{location}} in Europe.In the past few decades, much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to road, which led the Federal Government to introduce a motor toll for trucks in 2005. Individual road usage increased resulting in a relatively high traffic density to other nations. A further increase of traffic is expected in the future.|$|R
5000|$|The Class A10 {{was an open}} wagon, newly {{designed}} in 1909 and built from 1913 to 1928. Over 200,000 of these trucks were built, the largest production run of a class of goods wagon in the world. Also described as an [...] "open coke wagon", it was intended for the transportation of almost all not-hygroscopic <b>goods,</b> <b>especially</b> bulk <b>goods</b> such as coal, sand or agricultural produce.|$|R

Less frequently, he also threw a changeup to left-handed hitters at 87–89mph. The {{curve is}} <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> for {{swinging}} strikes with its 44% whiff rate for Burnett's career. The changeup has also been good for getting groundouts — it has a ground ball/fly ball ratio of better than 5:1.|$|E
25|$|The Hoover Constellation was a spherical canister-type {{vacuum cleaner}} notable for {{its lack of}} wheels. Floating on a cushion of air, it was a {{domestic}} hovercraft. They were not <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions, nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface. Despite this, original Constellations are sought-after collectibles today.|$|E

Geelong did not lose a single match played at the venue between 26 August 2007 and 27 August 2011. Geelong's Jimmy Bartel credited the home field advantage to the fact that Geelong {{is one of the few}} clubs which practices on the same field that it plays on.|$|E

5000|$|According to meritocratic theories, <b>goods,</b> <b>especially</b> {{wealth and}} social status, should be {{distributed}} to match individual merit, which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work.

Marxism {{can be regarded as}} a needs-based theory on some readings of Marx's slogan [...] "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".

They included many types of brachiopods, ammonites and molluscs characteristic of the shallow seas {{in which they were}} deposited. Some of the names he coined (like Cornbrash) are still used today for this formation.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a particle-based {{simulator}} that allows for a representation of cellular compartments is SRSim.

It is therefore <b>especially</b> <b>good</b> at simulating the assembly and structure of complex biomolecular complexes, as evidenced by a recent model of the inner kinetochore.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{difference}} in the use of slaves, the boundary between the Upland South and Deep South can still be seen today on maps showing the population percentage of African-Americans.

In 1930, the three brothers were recalled from the Indian Army to take up roles in the armed forces of Nawanagar, with Himmatsinhji named Commander-in-Chief. As a result, Himmatsinhji relinquished his British commission on 14 June 1931. However, his time in this position was short. Ranjitsinhji died in April 1933, having named Dijvijaysinhji as his heir.|$|E
