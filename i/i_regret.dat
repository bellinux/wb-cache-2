25|$|<b>I</b> <b>regret</b> nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I {{did what}} I had to do. Placed before the same {{circumstances}} today, I would do {{exactly the same}} thing. I will never deny what I did and what happened. It was not a youthful indiscretion.|$|E
25|$|It {{would give}} me great {{pleasure}} to comply with his request and see you personally, but, as the military laws of my country prohibit me from going on board a foreign vessel, <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> to have to decline this honor and to ask that you will kindly come on shore, where I await you to accede to your wishes as far as possible, and to agree as to our mutual situations. Asking your pardon for the trouble I cause you, I guarantee your safe return to your ship.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
60|$|Top {{and bottom}} of it is, <b>I</b> <b>regretted</b> my girovago, though I knew it was no good {{thinking}} of him. His way was not my way. Yet <b>I</b> <b>regretted</b> him, <b>I</b> did.|$|R

25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>regret</b> to {{say that}} none of us {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|Cruikshank quickly responded, on 10 April 1872, {{and claimed}} {{even more of}} Ainsworth's novels as being his own: I have to beg that you will permit me to express my regret that his memory should be in such a {{defective}} state, {{that he should have}} forgotten the circumstances and facts as to the origins of Oliver Twist, and of The Miser's Daughter; and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> also this contradiction of his will compel me, in justice to myself, to give in a work I am preparing for the press a full, true, and particular account of all the professional transactions between Mr. Ainsworth and myself, in which I shall prove, beyond all fear of contradiction, that I am also the sole originator of what is called 'Ainsworth's Tower of London,' as well as another work bearing his name, but the ideas and suggestions of what were given to him by, Sir, your obedient servant, George Cruikshank.|$|E

500|$|Knowing that {{prosecutors}} {{were about to}} publicly disclose her past addiction, McCain preemptively revealed the story to reporters, saying that she was doing so willingly: [...] "Although my conduct {{did not result in}} compromising any missions of AVMT, my actions were wrong, and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> them ... if what I say can help just one person to face the problem, it's worthwhile." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Thompson's {{father died}} as a result of circulatory {{problems}} at the age of 52. The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to tell you how much <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> his not being around". She added, [...] "At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I've done ... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{trouble was}} I {{had to share}} the stuff, {{and the length of}} the {{traverse}} was doubtful. <b>I</b> <b>regretted</b> that there were not more than a dozen bottles. And when they were gone <b>I</b> even <b>regretted</b> that <b>I</b> had shared any of it. I was thirsty for the alcohol, and eager to arrive in the Marquesas.|$|R
60|$|Nothing, in short, {{could have}} been more eminently satisfactory, and the fact that <b>I</b> <b>regretted</b> it is only a proof of the {{essential}} weakness of my character.|$|R

When MalcolmX left the Nation of Islam and converted to Sunni Islam, he tried to convince Clay to join him, but Clay declined and refused {{to speak to him}} again. When Ali left the group in 1975 and became a Sunni Muslim, he wrote, [...] "urning my back on Malcolm was one of the mistakes that <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> most in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, as Pixies were {{recording}} Trompe le Monde, Albini {{described his}} impressions of Pixies during {{the recording of}} Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: [...] "A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings." [...] Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, [...] "to this day <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> having done it. I don't think that I regarded the band as significantly as I should have." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{dared to}} hope we had invented {{something}} that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong... No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The first," [...] said I unthinkingly. Next second <b>I</b> <b>regretted</b> it, for <b>I</b> {{remembered that}} Infadoos {{had told us}} that the fairest woman must be offered up as a sacrifice.|$|R

500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

[...] After being pressed by the judge, Hastert {{admitted}} to sexually abusing boys whom he coached, {{saying that he had}} molested [...] "Individual B" [...] and did not remember some of the others. Hastert said he did not remember abusing Cross, [...] "but I accept his statement." [...] Hastert stated [...] "what I did was wrong and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> it ... I took advantage of them." [...] Hastert also acknowledged that he had misled the FBI. Judge Durkin referred to Hastert as a [...] "serial child molester" [...] and imposed a sentence of fifteen months in prison, two years' supervised release, including sex-offender treatment, and a $250,000 fine. [...] Hastert is [...] "one of the highest-ranking politicians in American history to be sentenced to prison." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the insistence}} of PedroI, Domitila {{departed}} from Rio de Janeiro on 27 June 1828. He had resolved to marry again and to become a better person. He even tried to persuade his father-in-law of his sincerity, by claiming in a letter [...] "that all my wickedness is over, that I shall not again fall into those errors into which I have fallen, which <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> and have asked God for forgiveness". FranzI was less than convinced. The Austrian emperor, deeply offended by the conduct his daughter endured, withdrew his support for Brazilian concerns and frustrated PedroI's Portuguese interests. Because of PedroI's bad reputation in Europe, owing to his past behavior, princesses from several nations declined his proposals of marriage one after another. His pride thus wounded, he allowed his mistress to return, which she did on 29 April 1829 after having been away nearly a year.|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
