5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a prearranged move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said that the only thing they did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E

Instead of challenging Habsburgs, Stibor of Beckov and the Clan of Ostoja made agreement of cooperation which would benefit both sides.

25|$|England's final group {{game was}} against Australia, and whilst both sides had already qualified, {{the game was}} seen as a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get a {{psychological}} advantage before a potential final match-up. Australia posted an impressive 144-5, despite an economical performance from Katherine Brunt, thanks to scores of 39 from Meg Lanning and 38 from Lisa Sthalekar. This time Marsh departed early, bringing Sarah Taylor to the crease, although England continued to struggle to keep with the run rate, losing both Edwards and Arran Brindle. However, Wyatt's arrival at the crease saw a partnership of 65 off 33 balls, leading England's to a comfortable victory, Taylor ending on 65* and Wyatt on 33*. England carried this momentum into their semi-final with New Zealand, Lydia Greenway effecting a run out in the first over to dismiss New Zealand captain Suzie Bates, and thereafter New Zealand were only able to post a disappointing effort of 93-8. England comfortably scored the runs, with contributions from Edwards, Taylor (who finished not out for the third successive game) and Greenway, and reached their second World Twenty20 final.|$|E
25|$|By about 3:00p.m. on April 30, 1864, {{the federal}} forces finally crossed the Saline River {{with all their}} {{remaining}} men and the artillery pieces and equipment and supply wagons which were not irretrievably stuck in the mud, which they burned. Steele's forces were compelled to abandon many more wagons in the swamp north of the Saline River. The Confederates did not renew the attack as Steele's men crossed the pontoon bridge {{on the afternoon of}} April 30. Not only were the Confederates exhausted from the morning’s battle, but the federal forces had set up artillery and infantry {{on the opposite side of}} the river to protect the remaining federal soldiers as they crossed the bridge. After crossing the Saline River, Steele's forces cut and burned the pontoon bridge, which they would not need for the remainder of their march. With no way to get across the river, the Confederates could not follow them. By not trapping Steele's force at Camden or cutting them off before they reached the Saline River, the Confederates under Kirby Smith lost a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> destroy Steele's army, which was the major portion of federal forces in Arkansas.

25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E
