The results show that the likelihood of booking online increases if someone is drawn to a website to gather information in the first place, and if the product sold through the website is transparent and well-understood (either per se or because the customer is familiar with the product), or if any other booking-related communication would impose a <b>financial</b> <b>charge,</b> independent of the socio-demographic background of the prospective traveler...|$|R

Gelli's extradition in February 1988 required a high-level security apparatus, including 100 sharpshooters, decoy cars, a train, road blocks and two armored cars to transfer him to Italy. In July 1988 he was absolved of charges of subversive association by a Bologna court but was presented with a five-year prison term for slander, having side-tracked {{the investigation into the}} 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station. Stipulations connected to his extradition, however, prevented him from serving time. Two years later, an appeal court threw out Gelli's slander conviction. A retrial was ordered in October 1993.|$|E
50|$|Many {{parents and}} lawyers {{find it very}} hard to justify the reasons for the {{parenting}} coordinator's decisions and <b>financial</b> <b>charges.</b> There is a possible conflict of duties since the PC has judicial, executive, and legislative power when deciding on parents' conflict resolution; i.e. they can establish rules, decide whether parents follow the rules, punish parent who do not follow the rules, and get financial interest from the time they spend. This may lead some PC to motivate parents to report every minor problems and suggestions to the PC that can lead to delay of conflict resolution between parents. Because the PC gets paid for his or her involvement, there is a financial incentive and therefore a conflict of interest built into the PC process.|$|E
5000|$|Exclusions to GAP {{insurance}} vary {{by country}} or state. Some exclusions include a maximum loss limit of $50,000 while others require a loan term {{of less than}} 84 months. GAP is an optional purchase; however, many states in the US require that a car dealership offer GAP {{at the point of}} purchase. Other states require insurers to offer GAP if a client requests it. [...] States such as Louisiana require that the purchaser sign a disclosure document as proof. Although GAP is optional, some finance companies require GAP as a condition to obtaining a loan. The Truth in Lending Act excludes GAP premiums from <b>financial</b> <b>charges</b> if GAP was not required by the creditor, the premiums were disclosed in writing, and the consumer provides a written request for the insurance.|$|E

Dubuclet was the only office holder allowed to remain in office during the minor coup d'état, known as the Battle of Liberty Place that occurred in September 1874.

50|$|Women {{typically}} {{stay in the}} hospital, {{public or}} private, {{for no more than}} 24 hours after birth. The tendency is towards early discharge due to overcrowding in the public facilities, and due to <b>financial</b> <b>charges</b> in the private facilities. Most hospitals have policy encouraging the initiation of breastfeeding before discharge. However, the early initiation of breastfeeding rate in Trinidad and Tobago is only 41.2% as of 2013; that is the percentage of infants who receive milk from their mother’s breast within an hour of being born. Furthermore, as of 2013, only 12.8% of newborns are exclusively breastfed {{in the first six months}} after birth and 83.4% are introduced to solid or semi solid or soft foods in their first six to eight months. In part, this phenomenon might be due to the often-spoken-of belief in Trinidad and Tobago that in order for the baby to sleep properly at night, he/she must be given cereal with his/her milk before bed.|$|E
5000|$|Skate {{served as}} {{governor}} of the National Capital District from 1995 to 1997. He was prime minister from 1997 to 1999 and resigned after 18 months, fearing that he would lose a challenge. In 2002, his political party the People's National Congress Party (PNC) became a coalition partner {{in the government of}} Michael Somare and Skate became Speaker of the National Parliament. He was appointed acting governor-general in November 2003, a constitutional requirement when that office falls vacant. Sir Pato Kakeraya was scheduled to take up the office on 20 January 2004, but Skate continued to act in the office because of court challenges to Kakeraya's election. On 3 March 2004, Skate was suspended as acting governor-general because of allegations that he misappropriated funds during the 1990s. He then advised the Prime Minister to appoint a cabinet minister as acting governor-general. The following day, however, he was cleared of the <b>financial</b> <b>charges</b> in court, and he became acting governor-general again. In May 2004, his party left the coalition when he and other members refused to support a constitutional amendment supported by Somare which would have given the government more time to be immune to no-confidence votes. As a result, the PNC became the largest opposition party. On 28 May 2004, Skate ceased to be speaker when the parliament elected a pro-government candidate, Jeffrey Nape. The office of governor-general was still vacant at that stage, so Nape automatically succeeded Skate as acting governor-general.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Napoleonic Wars, the title [...] "colonel of the regiment" [...] had become a sinecure appointment for distinguished generals and {{members of the royal family}} or British nobility. Despite an individual only being permitted to hold one colonelcy, it was a profitable position as they were in <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> of their regiment's allowance from the government. This meant they could hope to make a profit on the funds allocated for equipment, supplies and uniforms. As generals were mostly on half-pay, a colonelcy was a method of providing them with extra income. However it should be noted that many colonels spent large sums of their own money on their regiments.|$|R

5000|$|On February 28, 2011, Egyptian Prosecutor General Abdel Magid Mahmud put {{a freeze}} on the assets of ousted {{president}} Hosni Mubarak and his family and imposed a travel ban on them. Subsequently the Egyptian government asked the U.S. government and the European Union to freeze {{the assets of the}} Mubaraks whilst investigating the widespread allegations of profiteering by Mubarak, his wife Suzanne, and their sons Alaa and Gamal. On March 6 Mohamad Hamouda, Mubarak's lawyer during his presidency, stated that he agreed to represent Mubarak on certain conditions, including that the Mubarak family inform him of their exact assets. Hamouda also stated that Mubarak will take legal action against The Guardian and The New York Times for defamation. On the following day Hamouda withdrew from legal representation for the Mubaraks citing his [...] "discomfort" [...] with the case. Hamouda stated that achieving justice in this case will be difficult and explained that he was given only three days to review evidentiary documents and, two days into this period, he had not yet received these documents from the prosecutor. Hamouda stated that another lawyer, Mourtada Mansour, would represent the Mubaraks. Cairo criminal court was scheduled to start proceedings in this case on March 8, 2011. On that day neither Mubarak nor his council appeared in court. The court reaffirmed the travel ban on the Mubarak family and upheld the decision by the prosecutor to freeze the Mubaraks' accounts, citing that there is sufficient evidence to suspect Mubarak and his family of profiteering and misappropriation of public funds. The Mubaraks were contesting the travel ban in appeals court, while a criminal court was to convene to consider the <b>financial</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while living by ghostwriting and {{piecemeal}} assignments, Callender became {{one of a group}} of radical Republican journalists who socialized together and held similar views on democracy and economic nationalism. During this period, he produced a series of pamphlets in which he attempted to frame a comprehensive political theory, advocating for the government's duty to the poor (in the form of progressive taxation), economic independence from Europe, and the promotion of native industry. These goals put him at odds with the Federalists, and with some of the more conservative and agrarian Republicans.His writings attacked Federalist positions with a mix of reasoned argument, satire and personal invective. His first pamphlet challenged the introduction of an excise tax into American commerce, but it was his invective against America's early national heroes - Washington, Adams, and Hamilton - and against their policies and failings, that gained him notoriety. In his pamphlet History of 1796, published in installments in the late Spring and early Summer of 1797, he exposed the sexual relationship between Alexander Hamilton and a married woman, Maria Reynolds and Hamilton's alleged financial corruption. Callender presented compelling evidence of adultery, but in 1798's Sketches of the History of America, he wrote that the affair was a distraction from Hamilton's greater offense: partnering with Reynolds' husband in corrupt financial dealings. [...] On August 25, 1797, Hamilton published his own pamphlet in response, denying being a party to any improper financial matter, although he confessed to the adultery and proved that he had been victim of blackmail by James Reynolds over his adultery with Reynolds' wife rather than consorting with him in speculation. According to Callender, that was just a smokescreen. The <b>financial</b> <b>charges</b> were never proven, and after the scandal somewhat subsided, in 1798 President Adams appointed Hamilton for a new public office: Major General of the Continental Army.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Running MapReduce {{programs}} in the public cloud introduces the important problem: how to optimize resource provisioning to minimize the <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> for a specific job? In this paper, we study {{the whole process of}} MapReduce processing and build up a cost function that explicitly models the relationship between the amount of input data, the available system resources (Map and Reduce slots), and the complexity of the Reduce function for the target MapReduce job. The model parameters can be learned from test runs with a small number of nodes. Based on this cost model, we can solve a number of decision problems, such as the optimal amount of resources that can minimize the financial cost with a time deadline or minimize the time under certain financial budget. Experimental results show that this cost model performs well on tested MapReduce programs...|$|R
