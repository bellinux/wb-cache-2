5|$|After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, which {{resulted}} in the end of the independent Kingdom of <b>Hungary,</b> Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both <b>Hungary</b> and Croatia. This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies, fighting against the Ottoman Empire. In the Little War in <b>Hungary</b> both sides exhausted themselves after sustaining heavy casualties. The Ottoman campaign in <b>Hungary</b> ceased until the offensive against Szigetvár.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was stopped}} at Kőszeg {{and failed to}} conquer Vienna, Suleiman {{additionally}} secured his possession in <b>Hungary</b> by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and <b>Hungary.</b> Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all <b>Hungary,</b> but recognised Ferdinand's possession of {{that part of the}} country that enjoyed the status quo.|$|E

Horthy {{replaced him}} with an old reactionary confederate from his Szeged days: Gyula Gömbös. Gömbös was an outspoken anti-Semite and a budding fascist. Although he agreed to Horthy's demands that he temper his anti-Jewish rhetoric and work amicably with <b>Hungary's</b> large Jewish professional class, Gömbös's tenure began swinging <b>Hungary's</b> political mood powerfully rightward. He strengthened <b>Hungary's</b> ties to Benito Mussolini's Italian fascist state. Fatefully, when Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933, he found in Gömbös an admiring and obliging colleague.

5|$|Although the German–Hungarian {{relations}} remained tense, {{no major}} confrontations {{occurred when the}} German crusaders marched through <b>Hungary</b> in June 1147. Two months later, Louis VII of France and his crusaders arrived, along with Boris Kalamanos who attempted {{to take advantage of}} the crusade to return to <b>Hungary.</b> Louis VII refused to extradite Boris to Géza, but prevented the pretender from coming into contacts with his supporters in <b>Hungary</b> and took him to Constantinople. Géza joined the coalition that Louis VII and Roger II of Sicily formed against Conrad III of Germany and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons came to <b>Hungary</b> during Géza's reign. Western European knights and Muslim warriors from the Pontic steppes also settled in <b>Hungary</b> in this period. Géza even allowed his Muslim soldiers to take concubines.|$|E
5|$|Andrew III of <b>Hungary</b> {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples {{to send his}} grandson to <b>Hungary</b> to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to <b>Hungary.</b> They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII of <b>Hungary,</b> died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required {{that it should have}} been performed with the Holy Crown of <b>Hungary</b> in Székesfehérvár.|$|E
5|$|Another peace {{agreement}} between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in <b>Hungary.</b> Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians {{good reason to believe}} that <b>Hungary</b> was still contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in <b>Hungary</b> ended, until its revival in 1566.|$|E

5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper <b>Hungary</b> (today parts of Slovakia and Northern <b>Hungary)</b> and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed <b>Hungary</b> for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of <b>Hungary.</b> Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of <b>Hungary.</b> The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of <b>Hungary</b> with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E
5|$|Between 1938 and 1940, {{following}} German–Italian mediation in the First and Second Vienna Awards, and the Hungarian {{invasion of}} Carpatho-Ukraine, <b>Hungary</b> enlarged its territory. It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia {{and the northern}} part of Transylvania, which the Kingdom of Romania ceded. One of the ethno-cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and <b>Hungary</b> at this time was the Székely Land. The support that <b>Hungary</b> received from Germany for these border revisions meant that {{the relationship between the two}} countries became even closer. On 20 November 1940, <b>Hungary</b> formally joined the Axis Tripartite Pact. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the Prime Minister, Count Pál Teleki, <b>Hungary</b> concluded a friendship and non-aggression treaty with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not, as Germany's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. After the Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941, when the Germans asked the Hungarian Regent, Miklós Horthy, for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory, Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent. Concluding that <b>Hungary</b> had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs, Teleki shot himself. Horthy informed Hitler that evening that <b>Hungary</b> would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia, though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, Clemence of Austria. He was born in 1288; the place of his birth is unknown. Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II's wife, Mary, who was a {{daughter}} of Stephen V of <b>Hungary.</b> After {{the death of her}} brother, Ladislaus IV of <b>Hungary,</b> in 1290, Queen Mary announced her claim to <b>Hungary,</b> stating that the House of Árpád (the royal family of <b>Hungary)</b> had become extinct with Ladislaus's death. However, her father's cousin, Andrew also laid claim to the throne, although his father, Stephen the Posthumous, had been regarded a bastard by all other members of the royal family. For all that, the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of <b>Hungary</b> on 23July 1290. She transferred her claim to <b>Hungary</b> to Charles Martel in January 1292. The Babonići, Frankopans, Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel's claim, but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and AndrewIII.|$|E

5|$|Frederick Barbarossa, who {{had been}} crowned Holy Roman Emperor, {{received}} the envoys of Manuel I in Nuremberg in July 1156. The Byzantine envoys proposed a joint invasion of <b>Hungary,</b> but Barbarossa refused their offer. On 16 September, Barbarossa stipulated that the dukes of Austria were to support the Holy Roman emperors during a war against <b>Hungary</b> in his charter by which he elevated Austria to a duchy, showing {{that the relationship between}} <b>Hungary</b> and the Holy Roman Empire was still tense. Barbarossa's close advisor, Daniel, Bishop of Prague, visited <b>Hungary</b> in the summer of 1157. On this occasion, Géza promised that he would support Barbarossa with auxiliary troops if the emperor invaded Italy.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} {{the title of}} Duke of Bosnia from his father, Béla II of <b>Hungary,</b> {{at the age of}} six but never ruled the province. Instead, around 1160, he followed his younger brother, Stephen's, example and settled in Constantinople but both were to return to <b>Hungary</b> following the death of their elder brother, Géza II of <b>Hungary,</b> in 1162. Their return was backed by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos who used their return in a bid to expand his suzerainty over <b>Hungary.</b> Initially, the Emperor was planning to assist Stephen IV in seizing the throne, but the Hungarian lords were only willing to accept Ladislaus as king against the late Géza II's son, Stephen III.|$|E

Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans {{to submit to the}} legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave <b>Hungary.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hungary</b> {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of the European Economic Community member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later. During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained arms from several countries (including <b>Hungary),</b> despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, <b>Hungary</b> and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues).

5|$|In {{addition}} to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across <b>Hungary</b> when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe.
