This was because the band's producer, Sanderson had come into contractual issues with the land owner of his recording studio. The album was critically acclaimed, praised for both its increased accessibility, sonic development and {{the increased use of}} Eva Spence's singing.

5|$|After the Women's World Cup held {{in early}} 2009, Coleman {{transferred}} {{to play for}} the Australian Capital Territory, so Healy became New South Wales' wicket-keeper on a full-time basis {{for the start of the}} 200910 season. After making scores of 11, 12 and 29 in her first three innings of the one-day season, she struck an unbeaten 89 against Victoria. Coming <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> the fall of Leah Poulton with the score at 1/9 after three overs, she hit 13 fours in 82 balls, putting on partnerships of 72 with Blackwell and 82 with Sthalekar. New South Wales reached their target of 187 with more than 13 overs to spare and Healy was named the Player of the Match, having earlier taken a catch and made a stumping. Her season was interrupted by her selection in the Australian Under-21 team to play against the New Zealand Emerging Players. In five matches, she scored 50 runs at 10.00, took five catches and made one stumping as Australia won the series 41.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Healy was {{elevated}} two positions to No. 7. Coming <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> {{the fall of}} Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal {{was part of a}} sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Deandra Dottin from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten {{at the top of their}} quartet.|$|E
5|$|This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> {{the fall of}} Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson {{when he was on}} eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect the gaps between the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} this failure is to be {{attributed}} not to the want of sufficient cavalry, for indeed there was an ample number for the purpose, but to the confusion and disorder consequent upon the surprise which the French attack had occasioned, and which was augmented by the darkness that had set <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> the field. Nor was the failure caused {{by the absence of}} that most essential requisite in a charge of cavalry, good example {{on the part of the}} officers who lead the well set squadrons into the midst of an enemy's ranks.|$|E
25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at a red tomato, and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|The lessons, as {{has been}} seen, are drawn {{variously}} from the Bible, the Acts of the Saints and the Fathers of the Church. In the primitive church, books afterwards excluded from the canon were often read, e.g. the letters of Clement of Rome and the Shepherd of Hermas. In later days the churches of Africa, having rich memorials of martyrdom, used them to supplement the reading of Scripture. Monastic influence accounts {{for the practice of}} adding to the reading of a biblical passage some patristic commentary or exposition. Books of homilies were compiled from the writings of SS. Augustine, Hilary, Athanasius, Isidore, Gregory the Great and others, and formed part of the library of which the Breviary was the ultimate compendium. In the lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> the normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive reading. The lessons are read at Matins (which is subdivided into three nocturns).|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season, Andrews made her Twenty20 {{international}} debut against New Zealand at the Allan Border Field in Brisbane, having never played in the format at domestic level. She was attacked by the opposition batsmen, ending with 1/42 from four overs in a tied match. The rest of the Australians conceded their runs at 6.18 per over. After missing the first ODI, she returned to take two wickets in each of the next three matches before going wicketless in the fifth match. She ended with six wickets at 24.50 at the relatively high economy rate of 4.59; Australia won all of the last four matches. The second ODI was a close call as Australia won by one wicket?? from the ?? ball of the match. Andrews came <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> the fall of the eighth wicket and scored two from three balls before being run out, but ?? and ?? saw Australia to victory.|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

Anderson <b>in</b> <b>Upon</b> Further Review: Sports in American Literature, [...] "By the 1940s, Tunis {{enjoyed a}} career {{based on the}} {{practice}} of criticizing those aspects of American culture that others took lightly"." [...] He felt that the more organized sports became, the more they led to the glorification of athletes, turning the United States into a country of spectators. As much as he loved sports, his writings often tried to show the need for balance in personal and national life. At one point he declared [...] "Sports is the great opium of the people. It has become an addiction. It has made them forget more important things." ...|$|E

500|$|Although the Allies {{were again}} repulsed, these {{persistent}} attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Clérambault into making the worst French error of the day. Without consulting Tallard, Clérambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting {{the balance of}} the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. [...] "The men were so crowded <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> one another", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, [...] "that they couldn't even fire – let alone receive or carry out any orders." [...] Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts' intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.|$|E
500|$|According to {{engineer}} Ryan Hewitt, the track contains [...] "four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing." [...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural ambience {{of the home}} it was recorded <b>in.</b> <b>Upon</b> playback of a rough mix of the song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song's conclusion, but mistakenly forgot {{to do the same}} for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had been listening to the Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to keep it in the final version of the song.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Youth and Pleasure, the {{critical}} response to The Destroying Angel was generally favourable even from those critics usually hostile to Etty. The painting generated favourable comparisons to Michelangelo and Rubens, and Etty's early supporter William Carey (writing {{under the name}} of [...] "Ridolfi") considered it to be evidence of Etty's [...] "redeeming grace and spirit". The painting was explicitly seen as a renunciation by Etty of his previous nude studies, with Fraser's Magazine described it as [...] "a sermon to [...] admirers... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken <b>in</b> <b>upon,</b> and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that little gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".|$|E

500|$|Despite some criticism, The Destroying Angel {{changed the}} way Etty was {{perceived}} by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally {{with the aim of}} discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies. Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed. Many explicitly saw The Destroying Angel as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works. Fraser's Magazine described the painting as [...] "a sermon to [...] admirers... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken <b>in</b> <b>upon,</b> and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that little gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".|$|E
500|$|However, in {{the light}} of the bad {{publicity}} surrounding Madonna and her then husband Sean Penn, coupled with the fact that their drama film Shanghai Surprise had failed commercially, she had to fight hard to persuade Warner Bros. to green light the project. She also wanted her close friend James Foley to direct the film, proclaiming him to be a [...] "genius". Foley had previously directed the music videos of her songs [...] "Live to Tell", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "True Blue". Warner Bros. were looking for another way to cash <b>in</b> <b>upon</b> Madonna's success with soundtracks, and felt that her name alone might be enough to guarantee the success of the film as well as its soundtrack. So they felt that they had no choice, but to green light the project. Filming began in October 1986, in New York, but it was not until January that Madonna started working on the soundtrack.|$|E
