5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria.</b> However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E

25|$|Less common causes include {{pancreatic}} cancer, pancreatic duct stones, vasculitis (inflammation of {{the small}} {{blood vessels in the}} pancreas), and porphyria—particularly acute intermittent porphyria and <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria.</b>|$|E
25|$|The non-acute porphyrias are X-linked {{dominant}} protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital {{erythropoietic porphyria}} (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP). None of these are associated with acute attacks; their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.|$|E
25|$|Pigment gallstones {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{seen in the}} developing world. Risk factors for pigment stones include hemolytic anemias (such as from sickle-cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis), cirrhosis, and biliary tract infections. People with <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP) {{are at increased risk}} to develop gallstones. Additionally, prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors has been shown to decrease gallbladder function, potentially leading to gallstone formation.|$|E
25|$|The organs mainly {{involved}} in heme synthesis are the liver (in which {{the rate of}} synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly. However, due to its toxic properties, proteins such as Hemopexin (Hx) are required to help maintain physiological stores of iron {{in order for them}} to be used in synthesis. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, these include acute intermittent porphyria, congenital erythropoetic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria.</b>|$|E
500|$|Solar {{urticaria}} is an immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity {{that can}} be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization. Primary SU {{is believed to be}} a type I hypersensitivity (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis) in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is [...] "induced by UV or visible radiation." [...] Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as tar, pitch, and dyes. People who use drugs such as benoxaprofen or patients with <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this photosensitivity are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light.|$|E

50|$|Previously known {{mutations}} in the ALAS2 {{resulted in a}} loss-of-function mutation causing X-linked sideroblastic anemia. <b>Erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP) has similar symptoms as X-linked dominant <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> but the mutation occurs as a loss-of-function in the FECH (ferrochelatase) enzyme; the very last enzyme in the pathway. All individuals studied presented symptoms without {{mutations in}} the FECH enzyme. The patterns of inheritance led the researchers to conclude the mutation must come from an enzyme on the X-chromosome with ALAS2 being the most likely candidate.|$|E

5000|$|Protoporphyrin IX as {{a direct}} {{precursor}} of heme is accumulated by patients of <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria,</b> {{which is one of}} the genetic disorders of the biosynthesis of the heme pathway. It causes a severe photosensitivity against visible light.|$|E
5000|$|Afamelanotide (brand name Scenesse) {{has been}} {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> in Europe and is also being investigated as a method of photoprotection in the treatment of polymorphous light eruption, actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma (a form of skin cancer).|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP) {{is a form}} of porphyria, which {{varies in}} {{severity}} and can be very painful. It arises from a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase, leading to abnormally high levels of protoporphyrin in the erythrocytes, plasma, skin and liver. The severity varies significantly from individual to individual.|$|E
5000|$|Afamelanotide (melanotan I, CUV1647; {{brand name}} Scenesse) is a {{synthetic}} peptide and analogue of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone {{used to prevent}} skin damage from the sun in people with <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> in Europe since January 2015.

50|$|Carotenoderma is {{deliberately}} caused by beta-carotenoid treatment of certain photo-sensitive dermatitis {{diseases such as}} <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria,</b> where beta carotene is prescribed in quantities which discolor the skin. These high doses of beta carotene {{have been found to}} be harmless in studies, though cosmetically displeasing to some. In a recent meta analysis of these treatments, however, the effectiveness of the treatment has been called into question.|$|E
50|$|X-linked {{dominant}} <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> {{is distinct}} from EPP in {{that there is no}} overload of Fe2+ ions. Additionally, unlike the other condition the arises out of a mutation of the ALAS2 gene, there is no anemia. XDEPP is characterized by a buildup of Protoporphyrin IX caused by in increased level of function in the ALAS2 enzyme. Because there is a buildup of Proporphyrin IX with no malfunction of the FECH enzyme, all the available Fe2+ is used in the production of Heme causing the FECH enzyme to use Zn2+ in its place causing a buildup of Zinc Protoporphyrin IX. X-linked dominant <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> is a relatively mild version of porphyria with the predominate symptom being extreme photo sensitivity causing severe itching and burning of the skin due to the buildup of Protoporphyrin IX. One possible treatment was discovered when treating an individual with supplemental Iron for a gastric ulcer. Levels of free Protoporphyrin decreased significantly as there was iron available for the FECH to produce Heme. Levels of Zn Protoporphyrin, however did not decrease.|$|E
50|$|Defects in {{ferrochelatase}} {{create a}} buildup of protoporphyrin IX, causing <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP). The disease can result {{from a variety of}} mutations in FECH, most of which behave in an autosomal dominant manner with low clinical penetrance. Clinically, patients with EPP present with a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to suffering from an extremely painful photosensitivity. In less than five percent of cases, accumulation of protoporphyrin in the liver results in cholestasis (blockage of bile flow from the liver to the small intestine) and terminal liver failure.|$|E
50|$|Pseudoporphyria is {{clinically}} {{characterized by}} increased skin fragility; erythema; {{and the appearance}} of tense bullae and erosions on sun-exposed skin, which are identical to those seen in patients with PCT. However, a clinical pearl that may prove helpful in differentiating between pseudoporphyria and PCT is that the classic features of hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, and sclerodermoid changes found with PCT are unusual with pseudoporphyria.A second clinical pattern of pseudoporphyria has a similar presentation to <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP), an autosomal dominant porphyria resulting from a reduced activity of ferrochelatase.|$|E
50|$|Mechanisms {{other than}} allergen-antibody {{interactions}} {{are known to}} cause histamine release from mast cells. Many drugs, for example morphine, can induce direct histamine release not involving any immunoglobulin molecule. Also, {{a diverse group of}} signaling substances, called neuropeptides, {{have been found to be}} involved in emotionally induced urticaria. Dominantly inherited cutaneous and neurocutaneous porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria and <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria)</b> have been associated with solar urticaria. The occurrence of drug-induced solar urticaria may be associated with porphyrias. This may be caused by IgG binding, not IgE.|$|E
5000|$|Afamelanotide in a {{subcutaneous}} implant form {{is currently}} being prescribed and used for treatment of patients in Italy and Switzerland and has received market authorization from the European Medicines Agency as a dermal photoprotection inducing agent for those suffering from <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (EPP) covering all of the European Union under the brand name [...] "Scenesse". As of 2016 {{it continues to be}} evaluated in human clinical trials both for Europe and countries outside of the E.U. for a spectrum of indications including EPP.

When Chase tries to stop him leaving, House punches him in the face. While lying on the floor, Chase explains the specifics. House, embarrassed by his tantrum and lack of understanding, realizes that Chase is right. The OR is called and the surgery halted. Shortly after, Cuddy explains the diagnosis to Alice's parents.|$|E

5000|$|X-linked sideroblastic anemia or [...] "X-linked {{dominant}} erythropoietic protoporphyria", {{associated with}} ALAS2 (aminolevulinic acid synthase), {{has also been}} described. X-linked dominant <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> (XDEPP) {{is caused by a}} gain of function mutation in the ALAS2 (5-aminolevulinate synthase) gene; the very first enzyme in the Heme biosynthetic pathway. The mutation is caused by a frameshift mutation caused by one of two deletions in the ALAS2 exon 11, either c. 1706-1709 delAGTG or c. 1699-1700 delAT. This alters the 19th and 20th residues of the C-terminal domain thereby altering the 2° structure of the enzyme. The delAT mutation only occurred in one family studied whereas the delAGTG mutation occurred in several genetically distinct families. The delAGTG causes a loss of an a-helix which is replaced by a ß-sheet.|$|E

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of heliophobia {{depends on the}} person. Mild sufferers may feel uncomfortable, shaky, nauseated, or numb. Severe sufferers may feel anxious or suffer panic attacks. Other symptoms include heightened senses, lack of focus, feeling trapped, irregular heartbeat, air hunger, rapid breathing, parched mouth, sweating, muscle cramps, and physical discomfort that is not actually caused by bodily injury, but is a physical manifestation of the panic and fear that the heliophobic person experiences when exposed to light. This physical pain may be expressed, for example, as a phantom sensation of their skin burning under direct sunlight, {{even when it is}} visually apparent that their skin is not actually burning any more than healthy skin would as a result of sun exposure, but nonetheless still feels like real pain for the sufferer. However, other differential diagnoses like the rare genetic defect <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> characterized by a severe burning sensation of all exposed skin areas without leading to immediate visible signs have to be excluded.|$|E
5000|$|Mutations in PRPF31 are {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal dominant}} manner, accounting for 2.5% {{of cases of}} autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) in a mixed UK population. However, the inheritance pattern of PRPF31 mutations is atypical of dominant inheritance, showing the phenomenon of partial penetrance, whereby a dominant mutations appear to [...] "skip" [...] generations. This {{is thought to be}} due to the presence of two wild type alleles, a high-expressivity allele and a low-expressivity allele. If a patient has a mutant allele and a high-expressivity allele, they do not show disease phenotype. If a patient has a mutant allele and a low-expressivity allele, the residual level of protein falls beneath the threahold for normal function, and so they do show disease phenotype. The inheritance pattern of PRPF31 can therefore {{be thought of as a}} variation of haploinsufficiency. This variant of haploinsufficiency is only seen in two other human diseases: <b>Erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria,</b> caused by mutations in the FECH gene; and hereditary elliptocytosis, caused by mutations in the spectrin gene.|$|E
50|$|In past {{there have}} been reports showing from {{patients}} with sickle cell disease, spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>protoporphyria</b> and pyruvate kinase deficiency which have been suggested that Haptoglobin (Hp) depletion in plasma occurs prior to the decline of hemopexin (Hx) concentrations (Muller-Eberhard et al., 1968).Heme released during oxidation of Hb to met-Hb or from heme saturated hepatocytes is bound by albumin and rapidly transferred to Hx, the plasma protein with the highest binding affinity for heme. Hx is glycoprotein produced by the liver with a plasma concentration of 1-2 mg/ml (Muller-Eberhard et al., 1968). Hx prevents heme's pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects and it also promotes its detoxification, specifically when Hp concentrations are low or depleted in cases of severe or prolonged hemolysis. Hp and Hx, both are acute-phase proteins,induced during infection and inflammatory states to minimize tissue injury and facilitate tissue repair.The current review also suggests that the primary mechanisms by which Hp and Hx prevent heme toxicity prior to monocyte or macrophage clearance, it also critically evaluate the difference in genetic phenotype function and describe the rationale for exogenous Hp and Hx as therapeutic proteins.|$|E
