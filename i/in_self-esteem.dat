5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
25|$|Two main {{methods for}} music therapy are group {{meetings}} and one-one sessions. Group music therapy can include group discussions concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, songwriting, and musical improvisation. Groups emphasizing mood recognition and awareness, group cohesion, and improvement <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> {{can be effective}} in working with adolescents. Group therapy, however, {{is not always the}} best choice for the client. Ongoing one-on-one music therapy has also been shown to be effective. One-on-one music therapy provides a non-invasive, non-judgmental environment, encouraging clients to show capacities that may be hidden in group situations.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the rise}} of {{phenomenology}} and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Self-esteem then took {{a central role in}} personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of a person with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.|$|E

25|$|Adolescence {{shows an}} {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> {{that continues to}} increase in young adulthood and middle age. A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on {{whether it is a}} small or large decrease. Reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age. No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem. Multiple cohort studies show {{that there is not a}} difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of social media.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} studies emphasise {{the potential for}} positive behavioural outcomes of isotretinoin treatment associated with its efficacy in treating acne and subsequent improvements <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> However, such studies are unable to support the conclusion that acne results in clinical depression, nor that isotretinoin treatment leads to an improvement in clinical measures of depression and/or anxiety. Many of the studies cited to support {{the existence of a}} relationship between isotretinoin treatment and decreased symptoms of depression and/or anxiety have significant methodological flaws. For instance, one of the most commonly cited studies involved just 10 patients assessed with unstructured psychiatric interview, involved no control group and didn't report any statistics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to see how they concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E
40|$|Three studies {{tested the}} roles of {{implicit}} and/or explicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> reactions to mortality salience.

In Study 3, mortality salience increased the endorsement of positive personality descriptions but only among participants with the combination of low implicit and high explicit self-esteem. These findings indicate that high implicit self-esteem confers resilience against the psychological threat of death, and therefore the findings provide direct support for a fundamental tenet of terror management theory regarding the anxiety-buffering role of self-esteem...|$|R
40|$|Although {{previous}} research has intensively examined the life-span development of global self-esteem, nothing {{is known about the}} life-span development of domain-specific <b>self-esteem.</b> <b>In</b> this research, we examined the trajectories of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> 11 domains, moderators of the trajectories, and the age-graded relations of domain-specific self-esteem with global self-esteem and with the Big Five personality traits. Data come from a nationally representative Swiss sample of individuals aged 16 to 90 years (N = 1, 000). Depending on the specific domain, domain-specific self-esteem showed life-span trajectories that were quite different from the quadratic trajectory of global self-esteem. For example, <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the domains of physical appearance and physical abilities continuously decreased with age. <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the domains of physical appearance, social relations, honesty, problem solving, and academic abilities explained a large amount of variance <b>in</b> global <b>self-esteem,</b> whereas <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the domains of religiosity, physical abilities, mathematics, and verbal abilities did not. <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the domain of physical appearance was strongly correlated with global <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> adolescence and young adulthood, but the correlation significantly decreased with age. Controlling for <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the domain of academic abilities altered the trajectory of global self-esteem, suggesting that <b>self-esteem</b> changes <b>in</b> this domain account for the old-age decline of global self-esteem. Controlling for the Big Five personality traits did not substantially alter the life-span trajectories of either global or domain-specific self-esteem. The findings illustrate that the developmental patterns of domain-specific self-esteem differ, with regard to many domains, from the developmental pattern of global self-esteem and that the relations between domain-specific and global <b>self-esteem</b> change <b>in</b> meaningful ways across the life course...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the development of}} global <b>self-esteem</b> and <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> 6 specific domains across adolescence and young adulthood. Using a cohort-sequential design, we analyzed longitudinal data on 3, 116 Norwegian {{men and women from}} 13 to 31 years of age by means of growth curve modeling. Questionnaire data provided information on global <b>self-esteem</b> and <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> social, academic, athletic, and appearance domains. Data on important life outcomes was provided by register linkages. Results showed increasing levels of global <b>self-esteem</b> and <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> most domains with increasing age. Being male, higher parental education, and reported higher levels of parental care were related to higher levels of global <b>self-esteem</b> and <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> several domains. <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the appearance domain showed high and stable correlations with global <b>self-esteem,</b> whereas <b>in</b> social domains, correlations with global self-esteem increased over age, with a particularly steep increase for romantic appeal self-esteem. As to the prospective relationship between self-esteem and important life outcomes, results showed that participants high <b>in</b> academic <b>self-esteem</b> attained higher education levels and higher income, but most of the relationship was explained by covariates such as parents’ socioeconomic status and school grades. Low global self-esteem predicted later prescription of antidepressants, even after controlling for covariates. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive picture of the development of global and domain-specific self-esteem throughout adolescence and young adulthood using long-term longitudinal data. The results underscore the importance of examining development of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> specific domains in addition to global self-esteem.

25|$|Feeney and Thrush (2010) have {{identified}} three main functional components of secure base caregiving. First, individuals can support their relationship partner's exploratory, autonomous behaviour by being available in case support is needed. This can include actions such as removing obstacles to the partner's goal pursuit (for example, taking over some household chores {{to free up}} time for the partner {{to engage in a}} new activity), being sensitive and responsive to the partner's communications of distress, and communicating readiness to help in the event that support becomes needed. Second, effective caregiving does not unnecessarily interfere with exploration. That is, effective caregivers do not provide support when it is neither needed nor desired, attempt to take over or control the activity, or disrupt the partner's goal strivings. Third, partners should communicate encouragement and acceptance of exploration (i.e., convey enthusiasm about the pursuit rather than suggest that it is not worthwhile or will somehow detract from the relationship). Individuals who perceive their partners to be available to help are more persistent in the performance of challenging activities, whereas individuals whose partners show more interference during an activity show less persistence at the task, poorer performance, less enthusiasm for the challenge, greater negativity/hostility toward their partner, and decreases <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Partners' communications of enthusiasm are related to better performance, heightened enthusiasm, better mood, increases in state self-esteem, enhanced self-perceptions, greater enjoyment, and more positive feelings toward the partner.|$|E
2500|$|High {{levels of}} mastery, low risk taking, and better health {{are ways to}} predict higher self-esteem. In terms of personality, emotionally stable, extroverted, and {{conscientious}} individuals experience higher self-esteem. These predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence. [...] However, {{this does not mean}} it can not be changed. Hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers, but then slightly higher levels by age 30. African Americans have a sharper increase <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> in adolescence and young adulthood compared to Whites. However, during old age, they experience a more rapid decline <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Although studies {{thus far}} have {{reported}} only a correlation of warm, supportive parenting styles (mainly authoritative and permissive) with children having high self-esteem, these parenting styles {{could easily be}} thought of as having some causal effect <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> development. Childhood experiences that contribute to healthy self-esteem include being listened to, being spoken to respectfully, receiving appropriate attention and affection and having accomplishments recognized and mistakes or failures acknowledged and accepted.

2500|$|The final major {{aspect of}} {{identity}} formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem {{is defined as}} one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> over the course of adolescence. [...] "Barometric self-esteem" [...] fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disadvantages}} with elderspeak are {{the effect}} {{it has on}} older adults {{and how they are}} perceived, both by younger adults and by themselves. Older adults often find elderspeak patronizing and disrespectful. [...] Elderspeak is based on stereotypes because of the way younger adults speak to older adults as if they are less competent, older adults find fewer opportunities to communicate effectively and may experiences declines <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> depression, assumption of dependent behaviour consistent with their stereotypes of elderly individuals. They can even become less interested in social interaction. This cycle of communication {{is often referred to as}} the “communication predicament of aging”. Adults receiving elderspeak are often judged by the speaker as being not only less competent, but also being in a worse disposition. Interestingly, the same study showed that when using elderspeak, the speaker was judged as having a worse disposition as well.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Mansfield Park raised {{controversy}} among reviewers. In 1974, the American literary critic Joel Weinsheimer wrote that Mansfield Park was {{of all the}} Austen novels [...] "...perhaps the most profound; certainly {{it is the most}} problematic". Many modern readers find it difficult to sympathise with Fanny's timidity and her disapproval of the theatricals, finding her [...] "priggish, passive, naive and hard to like."

Other critics point out that she is a complex personality, perceptive yet given to wishful thinking, and that she shows courage and grows <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> during {{the latter part of the}} story. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin, who is generally critical of Fanny, argues that [...] "it is in rejecting obedience in favour of the higher dictate of remaining true to her own conscience that Fanny rises to her moment of heroism." [...] But Tomalin reflects the ambivalence that many readers feel towards Fanny when she also writes: [...] "More is made of Fanny Price's faith, which gives her the courage to resist what she thinks is wrong; it also makes her intolerant of sinners, whom she is ready to cast aside." ...|$|E
