500|$|Many fans on the {{internet}} were hoping that the episode would reveal whether or not Mulder is Jewish. In the episode, however, Mulder is unable to identify a Jewish book, states {{that he does not}} know Hebrew, and quips that Jesus returned from the dead. When asked whether or not Mulder is Jewish, Gordon said that he did not think that he is, nor did <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "even half-Jewish". He did, however, note that [...] "there's something about David [...] that could be Jewish or that has a Jewish sensibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2003, Tatchell {{acted as}} a press {{spokesman}} for {{the launch of the}} Zimbabwe Freedom Movement, which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that it might have been by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action. This speculation proved to be unfounded. The Mugabe regime dismissed the ZFM as a [...] "hoax." [...] However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film [...] "Peter Tatchell: Just who does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is?" [...] by Max Barber.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas C. Drabick Jr. of Blacklick said in {{a letter}} to the editor {{published}} in The Dispatch [...] "He has unlimited and unfettered arrogance. Who does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> works for? Clearly, he does not believe that he is responsible to the people of Ohio; otherwise, he would not seek to keep secrets from us." [...] The Dispatch agreed, editorializing that [...] "Government decisions made in secret aren't necessarily better decisions, they're just secret decisions. [...] Unfortunately, too many of Ohio's legislative leaders seem sold on the idea that keeping things hush-hush is good." [...] Nevertheless, the Senate passed Johnson's proposal, part of the state budget, over attempts by the Democratic minority to remove the language from the bill.|$|E

"That is his way," [...] said Noel; [...] "always when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> {{has reason}} to <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> does <b>think,</b> {{but this is an}} error. He didn't see the army. I noticed him, and he didn't see it. He was troubled by his old complaint." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E
2500|$|By summer 572, both Zu and Mu Tipo were in {{conflict}} with Hulü Guang. [...] Hulü disliked Zu, and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals. [...] Once, when he was resting at a governmental building, Zu, who was blind, rode past him without realizing that Hulü was there, and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time. [...] Hulü angrily stated, [...] "Who does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is?" [...] Zu, realizing that Hulü disliked him, bribed Hulü's servant and asked the servant about Hulü's opinion of him. [...] The servant stated, [...] "Ever since you came into power, the Minister Prince each night sighed and stated, [...] "With a blind man in power, the empire will surely be destroyed." [...] Meanwhile, Mu had once requested to marry Hulü's daughter by a concubine, but Hulü refused. [...] Further, when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang, Hulü publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army's horses. [...] Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hulü. [...] They therefore fostered suspicion of Hulü in the emperor's mind, and that suspicion was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Hulü's daughter and Gao Wei's wife Empress Hulü was not favored by Gao Wei.|$|E

[...] "At least, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> is. He's {{been in love with}} a different girl every season since I came out. And now that Reggie Byng has gone and married Alice Faraday, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> has a chance. You heard about that, I suppose?" ...|$|R
