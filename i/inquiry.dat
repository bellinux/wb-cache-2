The <b>inquiry</b> (known as the Holyrood <b>Inquiry,</b> or the Fraser <b>Inquiry)</b> was headed by Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and held at the Scottish Land Court in Edinburgh. The <b>inquiry</b> took evidence from architects, civil servants, politicians and the building companies. Evidence was taken over the course of 49 hearings and the final report ran to 300 pages.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April 1946 the Minister for Civil Aviation, Arthur Drakeford, {{appointed}} Mr Justice Simpson of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory {{to conduct}} an <b>inquiry</b> into the accident. Counsel assisting the <b>inquiry</b> was to be Henry Winneke.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became the}} subject of an <b>Inquiry</b> chaired by a Supreme Court judge.

5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had both}} political and military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill suggested that an official <b>inquiry</b> into the disaster should be held after the war. When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the <b>inquiry.</b> The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no <b>inquiry</b> be held, as {{it would not be}} possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted this advice, and no <b>inquiry</b> was ever held.|$|E

Public <b>inquiries,</b> formerly relied on {{as an alternative to}} criminal and civil proceedings and as a means to engage the public on issues of policy, now seem to exhibit more intense procedures akin to those found in the alternative processes they were designed to resist. Under increasing juridification pressures, what function should public <b>inquiries</b> fulfil? In short, my aim is to explore our understanding of public <b>inquiries</b> and the implications of the trend towards juridification is having on the ability of public <b>inquiries</b> to fulfil their social and policy functions...|$|R
5|$|The main {{impact of}} the midget {{submarine}} attack and subsequent operations was psychological; dispelling any belief that Sydney was immune to Japanese attack and highlighting Australia's proximity to the Pacific War. There was no official <b>inquiry</b> into the attacks, despite demand from some sections of the media, as there was concern that an <b>inquiry</b> would lead to defeatism and reduce faith in John Curtin's government, particularly after the damaging <b>inquiry</b> into Australian defences that had followed the Japanese aerial attack on Darwin three months earlier.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} <b>inquiry</b> held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public <b>inquiry</b> were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E

5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of <b>inquiry</b> to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the <b>inquiry</b> as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The <b>inquiry</b> concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E
5|$|After the {{suggestion}} {{by the head}} of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by the Government due to much greater means being needed, the Government agreed that a public <b>inquiry</b> should be opened. A public <b>inquiry</b> into the plans was opened in December 1944, with the hearing lasting for three days. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman of the <b>inquiry.</b> The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington.|$|E
5|$|An <b>inquiry</b> {{was held}} into {{widening}} the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first <b>inquiry</b> being abandoned in 1978, and a second <b>inquiry</b> in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inquiries</b> into homicides {{committed}} by psychiatric patients are currently mandatory under Department of Health guidance. They are often broadly defined in their {{terms of reference}} and almost always address not only {{the cause of the}} incident but also professional skill, practice, and culpability. Concurrent pursuit of both purposes is unlikely to maximise "learning from experience. " Also, since <b>inquiries</b> can set their own thresholds for culpability, doctors can potentially be judged to a higher standard than would be required by the General Medical Council or negligence law. Lack of strict legal process increases the inherent potential unfairness to doctors. Investigation of cause and culpability should be separated and <b>inquiries</b> restricted to the former. There should also be a standing secretariat for <b>inquiries</b> to set terms of reference and to collate and distribute findings of <b>inquiries.</b> Widespread mandatory systematic audit of professional practice and service efficiency concerning risk assessment and management should largely replace costly ad hoc mandatory <b>inquiries</b> after homicides...|$|R
40|$|This article {{historically}} considers {{major public}} <b>inquiries</b> {{as an institution}} of the British regulatory state, using recent data from parliamentary committees. Major <b>inquiries</b> draw upon judicial independence to restore political authority. Despite their formally ‘public’ character, major <b>inquiries</b> were more confined to matters internal to the state before the 1980 s, reflecting the insularity of ‘club rule’ and the invisibility of the actual ‘public’. <b>Inquiries</b> began to assume their modern form in the 1960 s, {{but it was in}} the context of the need for new institutions that arose with the collapse of ‘club rule’ that <b>inquiries</b> took on new significance. Their increased use reflects not simply an increase in the number of events necessitating such a response, but a greater need for a mechanism with both a public orientation and formal independence. The article suggests that <b>inquiries</b> may have become overburdened instruments, particularly in relation to an expectation to effectively eliminate risk. ...|$|R
5|$|Before the <b>inquiry</b> opened, a {{poll was}} {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day <b>inquiry</b> opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the <b>inquiry</b> examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E

After the <b>inquiry</b> had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
