50|$|Also {{unlike many}} {{previous}} Cunard Queens, Queen Elizabeth {{is not a}} true ocean liner as {{she does not have}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>plating</b> throughout the hull nor the propulsion system of a dedicated transatlantic liner. However the bow was constructed with <b>heavier</b> <b>plating</b> to cope with the Transatlantic run, and the ship has a high freeboard. During construction Queen Mary 2 had cost approximately $300,000 US per berth, nearly double that of many contemporary cruise ships, so Cunard made the economical decision to base Queen Elizabeth on an enhanced Vista-class cruise ship.|$|R
50|$|Dillinger Hütte {{produces}} <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plate,</b> cast slag {{pots and}} semi-finished products, such as pressings, and (pressure) vessel heads and shell sections. Total production when the French subsidiary, GTS Industries, is included is well over two million tonnes of <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> annually, in a thickness range extending from 6 to 440 mm, making the company Europe's largest <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> producer. This robust material {{is used for}} fabrication of drilling rigs, ships, petrochemicals plants, bridges and heavy machinery; reference projects include the Öresund Bridge and the Millau Viaduct, the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, and the luxury liner, Queen Mary 2. The striking arc of the Olympic Stadium in Athens was also welded from plate supplied by Dillinger Hütte. The main application for Dillinger Hütte's <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> output, however, is the making of large-caliber line pipe for major pipeline projects. The so-called thermomechanical rolling process, an extremely sophisticated rolling method which permits attainment of maximized mechanical properties combined with optimum working (bending and welding) characteristics, is used for these products. Dillinger Hütte is also a 50% owner of Europipe GmbH, Europe's largest manufacturer of large-caliber line pipe, with facilities in Germany, France and the USA.|$|R

50|$|Flat rolling is {{the most}} basic form of rolling with the {{starting}} and ending material having a rectangular cross-section. The material is fed in between two rollers, called working rolls, that rotate in opposite directions. The {{gap between the two}} rolls is less than the thickness of the starting material, which causes it to deform. The decrease in material thickness causes the material to elongate. The friction at the interface between the material and the rolls causes the material to be pushed through. The amount of deformation possible in a single pass is limited by the friction between the rolls; if the change in thickness is too great the rolls just slip over the material and do not draw it in. The final product is either sheet or plate, with the former being less than 6 mm thick and the latter greater than; however, <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> tend to be formed using a press, which is termed forming, rather than rolling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{stability}} of centerline inhomogenity of continuously cast slabs and hot rolled products. The centerline segregation is a disadvantageous failure of slabs which can affect the quality properties of the final products. During hot rolling of slabs the centerline segregation pattern will become thin and stretch and {{it can also be}} detected in the middle part of <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> and coils. It is a common experience that the centerline segregation of <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> can not be easily decreased by post heat treatment. The pattern of the centerline segregation was modeled physically by preparing a sandwich structure of steel plates with different levels of carbon and alloying elements. Homogenization experiments were performed and the samples were examined metallographically. Diffusional calculations proved the governing role of carbon activity which is influenced by the distribution of alloying elements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{manufacturing}} process of heavy steel plates generates some internal residual stresses. During machining {{process at the}} end users, shape defects may be created by these residual stresses. An industrial characterization method of residual stress state in heavy steel plates with a thickness of several hundreds of millimetres is described here. The measurement principle by acoustical birefringence and the used experimental equipment are presented. The first tests were performed on standard plates representative of the various possible residual stress states. The analysis of ultrasonic signals allowed {{the definition of the}} most suitable measurement configuration and the attainment of satisfactory accuracy. Assessments of the acoustical birefringence coefficient across plate width permits to estimate residual stress profile of these plates and to identify <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> where the geometric stability during the machining process will be insufficient. The method is then validated on the heavy industrial plates at different manufacturing steps. Introduction: The {{manufacturing process}} of heavy steel plates generates some internal residual stresses. These stresses are modified at every manufacturing step, for example during hot rolling or during cooling. At the final manufacturing step, <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> present residual stress profiles i...|$|E
40|$|High quality <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> {{have to be}} free of any defects. The UT-inspection for {{internal}} defects is introduced as a standard. However, until now the inspection for surface defects is limited to visual inspection, magnetic stray flux — or eddy current inspection. The most sensitive technique is the magnetic stray-flux technique, but it is very time consuming because of the necessity to scan the whole surface. Using Rayleigh waves the inspection can be automated and performed at rolling speed. The sensitivity of frequency optimized Rayleigh waves is sufficient to detect a 0. 3 mm deep model defect at a distance of 300 mm. The use of piezoelectric probes is limited by coupling problems. These problems are overcome by the use of EMAT’s, which have been optimized with respect to probe size, sensitivity and wear resistance. For the automated inspection the ALOK-system has been adapted in a laboratory system to the surface inspection of <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> by Rayleigh waves. This equipment consists of an ultrasonic hardware device for fast data-acquisition and -preprocessing (essential data reduction) according to the ALOK-algorithm, and a computer to realize noise- and ghost — elimination as well as defect imaging and -reconstruction...|$|E
