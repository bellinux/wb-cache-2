500|$|After Milk's {{vote for}} the mental health {{facility}} in White's district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and communicated with only one of Milk's aides. Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. [...] "He was impulsive... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively so... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not take defeat," [...] San Francisco's assistant fire chief told reporters. White's first campaign manager quit {{in the middle of}} the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an egotist and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press. White's associates and supporters described him [...] "as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge". The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, [...] "Talking to him, I realized that he saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all that was wrong with the world".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his goalscoring, pundits have noted Mandžukić for his physical strength, versatility, mobility and fitness, {{as well as his}} ability in the air. He was even given the nickname Đilkoš (pronounced jill-kosh) by Miroslav Blažević, which means brash and unsophisticated, referring to the striker's physical strengths, powerful physique and seemingly endless stamina, rather than his technical ability. Known for his high work-rate and defensive contribution, Mandžukić's former manager at Wolfsburg, Felix Magath, noted his endurance, stating that the striker is 'so fit that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play two back-to-back games without stopping even for a minute.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized {{his friend}} and {{sometime}} client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, [...] "The question this government needs to answer is {{why it was so}} necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept." [...] Cory Doctorow wrote, [...] "Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Andy's {{family tree}} was in {{different}} kind. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have traced his descent any further back than a corporation.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{very happy}} about this-—the {{connection}} especially. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have borne it {{if it had been}} the Infanta. How is that dear Babie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not {{old enough}} to work!” said Rollo, “Why, he is pretty big. He is {{almost as big as}} the horse. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> draw you alone in the wagon.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Borg famously {{never won}} the US Open, losing {{in the final}} four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a {{contemporary}} of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments—especially the Australian Open—was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told Sports Illustrated, [...] "I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have won the Grand Slam, {{but by the time he}} left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Eleanor, [...] "is {{quite another}} matter. Anyway, he {{is a man}} who could be {{depended}} on--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be firm on points where you might waver. You are a little too good-natured, Jimmy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's inhuman cruelty, that's what it is," [...] said Miss Cornelia, violently agitated. [...] "I {{did think}} Dr. Blythe was a decent man. <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have {{been guilty of}} this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{he going}} to a coach for? There is no examination, is there? And if there was, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> pass it. <b>He</b> has been in the sixth for the last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Alfred {{made his}} reply {{almost in a}} whisper. 'If you ask me, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> If you got him down and trampled on him, you might make him mild. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> there's any other way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better let it go," [...] Carrie interposed. [...] "I {{like that}} man. If you have drawn him right, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be trusted. However, you {{look as if}} you had been among the devil's club. What {{are you going to do}} with your clothes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{eventually}} their dealings became deliberately and boldly dishonest. That {{meant the}} inevitable spilling of blood sooner or later, {{and so he}} grew into the leader {{because he was the}} strongest. Whatever he is to be judged for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have been infinitely worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir. I {{never heard}} of either one of 'em," [...] said Harry, hanging down his head. [...] "I fear my book-learning was {{neglected}} at home, sir. My brother had read every book that ever was wrote, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> have talked to you about 'em for hours together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hout aye; that might, could, {{and would}} be Hughie Morrison. <b>I</b> didna <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hae peen sae weel up. He has made a day on us; but his Argyleshires will have wearied shanks. How far was he pehind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Tina!' said Felix, smiling, 'he {{would hardly}} do in a colony. He is {{heart and soul}} a clergyman, and whether he will ever {{be more of a}} man I don't know; but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> rough it as a missionary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mirah {{had been}} {{smiling at the}} swiftly-made image, and she smiled still, but {{with a touch of}} {{something}} else than amusement, as she said--"Thank you. But you have never done anything I did not like. <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> belonging to you," [...] she added, looking at Mrs. Meyrick.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oui, parbleu,' {{says the}} Marky,--but I didn't mind him, for I could have thrown the little fellow {{out of the}} window; but it was {{different}} with Bloundell,--he was a large man, that weighs three stone more than me, and stands six inches higher, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done for me.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} bear the sight or sound of the poor baby. Poor Adela had {{scarcely}} lived to hear it was a boy, and all she had said about it was, [...] "Ursula, you'll be his mother." [...] And, oh! I have tried. If love would do it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not be more even to dear Adela! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave that to me," [...] said Sir Patrick. [...] "I {{will not}} trust to a messenger, nor will I send a letter, because, if I could write one, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not read it. He will suffer anxiety {{in the mean}} while, but I will ride to Perth {{tomorrow}} by times and acquaint him with your designs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have, too. <b>He</b> {{walked a}} hundred miles in a hundred hours. They said he bet that he'd drink a hundred pints of beer in a hundred hours: but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do it--not strong beer; don't think any man could. The beer here isn't worth a--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But really, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{have had}} any one in the Vicarage before that afternoon. I feel sure we should have heard of it. I don't see how a strange cat could come within four miles of Siddermorton without the report coming round to us. The people here gossip so...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] replied Peter. [...] "Do {{you know}} I'm {{very fond of}} the Sparrow family. I just love your cousin Chippy, who nests in the Old Orchard every spring. I wish he would stay all winter. I really don't see why <b>he</b> doesn't. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> if you can." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found this}} was not all. Ill success in that had transported them to {{personal}} abuse, either of himself, or (what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> less forgive) of his friends. They had called men of virtue and honour bad men, long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them bad writers; and some had been such old offenders, that he had quite forgotten their persons {{as well as their}} slanders, till they were pleased to revive them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe he}} knows," [...] said Alan. [...] "It was that {{which made him}} faint after the accident, for he had his {{perceptions}} fully at first. I have suspected all day {{that he was more}} himself than he seemed, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not bear to awaken his mind to understand it, and that he was afraid to hear about her--your sister, so that our mention of her was a great relief, and did him good. I am convinced he knows the rest. Only go on, be calm, as you have been, and we shall do very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Daly," [...] {{said the}} Earl of Morganic {{to his first}} lieutenant, an {{experienced}} old Irishman of fifty, who still sung a good song and told a good story, and what was a little extraordinary for either of these accomplishments, knew how to {{take good care of}} a ship;--"Daly, I suppose we must humour the old gentleman, or he'll be quarantining me, and that I shouldn't particularly like {{on the eve of a}} general action; so we'll ease off forward, and set up the strings aft, again. Hang me if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find it out if we didn't, so long as we kept dead in his wake!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrew {{may need}} {{supporters}} who don't altogether {{believe in the}} immaculate Leonard some day. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> if needful, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> count on us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do not know. He {{went out}} with his hawk, and <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have gone {{anywhere}} else. Did they say so to my mother?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he cannot help himself. To you he {{does not}} do even as much as that, because he can help himself. I have chosen to leave it {{to him and he}} has done nothing. But this is not quite fair, and he must be told so. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be told in more dutiful language." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Singleton. [...] "But {{you must}} {{understand}} me. The methods generally adopted in such cases would be bound to fail. You would require an overseer with rather exceptional technical knowledge, who must, besides this, be quite free from the usual prejudices on the native question. They would, no doubt, be a little difficult to avoid, since at first {{he would have to}} put up with a few attempts upon his life; but, if he could combine resolution and strict justice with a conciliatory attitude, the attempt would cease, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> earn you a fair return on a moderate outlay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My son and Dr. Rochecliffe {{are half}} starving," [...] said the knight. [...] "And {{there is a}} lad, too, below," [...] said Joceline; [...] "a page, he says, of Colonel Albert's, whose belly rings {{cupboard}} too, and that to no common tune; for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> eat a horse, as the Yorkshireman says, behind the saddle. He had better eat at the sideboard; for he has devoured a whole loaf of bread and butter, as fast as Phoebe could cut it, {{and it has not}} staid his stomach for a minute--and truly I think you had better keep him under your own eyes, for the steward beneath might ask him troublesome questions if he went below--And then he is impatient, as all your gentlemen pages are, and is saucy among the women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Righto! Tell {{you what}} I'm {{prepared}} to do. I'll pal you up, {{take you to}} lunch and dinner at the smart places, {{take you to the}} Opera right nights, and the mater shall ask you to dine once in Belgrave Square and send you cards for her big shows. Then the governor shall ask you to lunch at his club one day, and if there's anything doing, you tumble, {{there are a couple of}} his clubs <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> put you up for. You'll be seen about with me. People will ask who you are. I shall lay it on thick, of course, about the millions, and before you know where you are, old bean, you'll be hobnobbing with all the dukes and duchesses of the land." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{is as much}} of a Pholosopher as {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> [...] <b>could</b> have done a great deal in this direction if he had studied [...] while young, for he seems to enjoy reasoning out things, no matter [...] what; in a great many such directions he has greater ability than [...] in the gifts which have made him famous.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> pay if <b>he</b> lost," [...] Dobbin said; and {{his advice}} {{met with the}} success which advice usually commands. Osborne and Crawley were {{repeatedly}} together now. General Tufto dined abroad almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very close indeed {{to those of the}} General) which the aide-de-camp and his wife occupied in the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you'll {{be a great}} fool {{for your}} pains--a greater fool almost than I take you to be. What do you expect your father can do for you? My belief is, that if four hundred pounds would take him to heaven, he couldn't make up the money. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> raise it either in Europe or Asia. I'm sure of this; I wouldn't lend it him." ...|$|R
