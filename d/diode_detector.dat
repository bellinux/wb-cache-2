40|$|New {{generation}} Cadmium Telluride (CZT & CdTe) {{solid state}} detectors can provide high quantum efficiency with reasonably good energy resolution and can operate at near room temperature; an unique advantage for space experiments. We present here {{results of our}} study of small <b>diode</b> <b>detectors</b> as well as large area pixel detectors. Our study is aimed at developing near room temperature hard X-ray spectroscopy detectors for ASTROSAT and other future Indian space science missions. We have studied a Si-PIN detector in the energy range 5 - 60 keV and CZT & CdTe Schottky <b>diode</b> <b>detectors</b> in the energy region 10 - 1330 keV. We have studied large area (64 cm$^ 2 $) CZT pixel detectors with pixel size close to the small CZT detector. We have studied individual pixels as well as CZT detector as a whole (summed over all the 1024 pixels). The energy resolution behaviour of the large area CZT detector {{is similar to that}} of small <b>diode</b> <b>detectors</b> in the low energy region. The change in operating temperature from room temperature ~ 20 to ~ 70 $ degree C drastically affects both the energy resolutionas well as the peak area due to a sharp rise in the thermal noise.

40|$|Diamond {{has long}} been the {{material}} of interest for radiotherapy dosimetry due to its high sensitivity, radiation hardness and near tissue equivalency. However natural diamond detector has not become a popular choice because of variability among detectors, high cost and response dependence on dose rate. The recent success in synthesizing single crystal diamond has reignited the interest. Synthetic diamond is highly reproducible in purity and electrical properties, combined with small size, it is a suitable candidate for small field dosimetry. A newly available synthetic single crystal diamond detector is being studied to determine the basic dosimetric characteristic and applicability in small field dosimetry. A series of measurements were made in comparison with a 0. 125 c. c ionization chamber, and two <b>diode</b> <b>detectors.</b> Response of the diamond detector is independent on dose, dose rate and energy. The output factors of small fields determined by the diamond detector is lower than that of the <b>diode</b> <b>detectors</b> and higher than that of the ionization chamber which are known to over response and under response respectively. In percentage depth dose and beam profile measurements, the diamond detector performs similarly with the two <b>diode</b> <b>detectors.</b> It is found that the diamond detector is suitable for small field relative dosimetry. Further investigation is required to study the spatial resolution of the diamond detector in different measurement geometry and the suitability in determining percentage depth dose in the buildup region. published_or_final_versionDiagnostic RadiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R

[...] It was not widely used until its amplifying ability was recognized around 1912. [...] The first tube receivers, invented by De Forest and built by hobbyists until the mid 1920s, used a single Audion which functioned as a grid-leak detector which both rectified and amplified the radio signal. There was uncertainty about the operating principle of the Audion until Edwin Armstrong explained both its amplifying and demodulating functions in a 1914 paper. [...] The grid-leak detector circuit was also used in regenerative, TRF, and early superheterodyne receivers (below) until the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|A plate {{detector}} (or anode-bend detector) is {{a vacuum}} tube detector circuit used in A.M. radios, although {{the term is}} sometimes extended to transistor circuits that similarly rely upon distorted amplification to enhance {{one half of the}} received signal over the other. This circuit employs a tube with an indirectly heated cathode, typically a medium-mu triode, or a tetrode or pentode with a sharp cut-off control grid. Partial rectification of R.F. signals occurs in the plate of the detector tube if it is forced into its non-linear region at roughly the zero crossing point of the input signal. This differs from a grid-leak detector, which achieves rectification in the control grid. It also differs from the <b>diode</b> <b>detector</b> circuit commonly used to provide both R.F. rectification and automatic volume control (A.V.C.) bias to the R.F. amplifier tubes.|$|E
50|$|One {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} the grid leak detector is that the input impedance of the detector may {{be affected by the}} need to self bias the detector tube with grid current. Having the grid leak resistor, even in the Megohm range, shunting signal to ground loads the received signal. Although this may be mitigated to some degree by taking the resistor {{to the top of the}} tuned circuit (i.e. in parallel with the capacitor) and through the coil to earth, or by circuit design and component optimization, forward grid current will still load the input signal (and reduce the Q of the tuned circuit). Plate detectors have the advantage in that they isolate the detector load from the input circuit more effectively and may be employed where sensitivity is thought to be otherwise compromised by a grid leak or <b>diode</b> <b>detector</b> circuit.|$|E

50|$|To measure impedance, {{the bridge}} is adjusted, so that the two legs have the same impedance. When the two {{impedances}} are the same, {{the bridge is}} balanced. Using this circuit {{it is possible to}} either measure the impedance of the antenna connected between ANT and GND, or it is possible to adjust an antenna, until it has the same impedance as the network {{on the left side of}} the diagram below. The bridge can be driven either with white noise or a simple carrier (connected to drive). In the case of white noise the amplitude of the exciting signal can be very low and a radio receiver used as the detector. In the case where a simple carrier is used then depending on the level either a <b>diode</b> <b>detector</b> or a receiver can be used. In both cases a null will indicate when the bridge is balanced.|$|E

It is used to detect recoiled target atoms and scattered beam ions using several detectors namely silicon <b>diode</b> <b>detector,</b> time-of-flight detector, gas ionization detector, etc. Such detectors are described below. Main advantage of HI-ERDA is its ability to obtain quantitative depth profiling information of all the sample elements in one measurement. Recent studies have shown that depth resolution obtained by using this technique is excellent. Depth resolution less than 1 nm can be obtained with good quantitative accuracy thus giving these techniques significant advantages over other surface analysis methods. Also, the accessible depth of 300 nm can be achieved using this technique. A wide range of ion beams including 35Cl, 63Cu, 127I, and 197Au, with different energies can be used in this technique in order for recoil to occur.|$|E
50|$|Plate {{detectors}} {{are used}} in both T.R.F. and (less commonly) superheterodyne receivers. The grid is connected directly to the secondary of the final R.F. or I.F. transformer. The cathode is connected to ground through a circuit consisting of a parallel-connected bias resistor (usually 10 kÎ© to 50 kÎ©) and bypass capacitor (usually 0.25 ÂµF to 0.5 ÂµF). When sufficient negative bias {{is applied to the}} grid, the plate current is pushed almost to the cut-off point. When a modulated R.F. signal is applied to the grid under these conditions, a corresponding increase in plate current occurs. As the signal amplitude varies, the plate current also varies, causing the plate to act as a <b>diode</b> <b>detector</b> while the tube as a whole also acts as an audio amplifier. A plate bypass capacitor (usually 500 pF to 0.002 ÂµF for triodes, or 250 pF to 0.001 ÂµF for tetrodes and pentodes) is used to regulate plate current.|$|E
