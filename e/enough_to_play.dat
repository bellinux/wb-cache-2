Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was troubled by a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E

5|$|Getzlaf {{made his}} first {{appearance}} with the senior team at the 2008 World Championship. He led the tournament with 11 assists and his 14 points was second overall to teammate Dany Heatley's 20. Canada reached the championship game, but were forced to settle for the silver medal after Russia overcame a two-goal third period deficit and won the championship 5–4 in overtime. Getzlaf {{was named to the}} Canadian roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, however a sprained ankle suffered during the NHL season left his participation in doubt until just before Canada was required to confirm its roster. He had recovered <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> and recorded seven points in seven games, including the game-winning goal in Canada's 3–2 semi-final victory over Slovakia. Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 overtime victory over the United States.|$|E

She also scored two goals in the 7–1 Premier League Cup final win over Birmingham City, after which Fulham's manager Gaute Haugenes claimed Chapman was good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in any national side in the world. Chapman then scored the winning goal in the 2–1 FA Women's Cup final victory over Doncaster Belles, a volley from 20yards.

5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in that stretch, going 40–66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 carries (his other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, and by then Roethlisberger was healthy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E
5|$|The team {{departed}} New Zealand on 1 August 1888, {{and sailed}} to England via Melbourne. After their six-week voyage from Australia, the Native team arrived in England on 27 September 1888. Their first match was against Surrey, on 3 October, but Joe Warbrick was still injured {{and did not}} play. The side played regularly – they averaged just over three games per week while in Britain – but Warbrick did not appear until 7 November when the team faced Tynemouth. The match was won 7–1, but Warbrick – who played at fullback – exacerbated his foot injury. He managed to play six matches between mid-December and early January before he was again injured. He appeared against Stockport, a match drawn 3–3, on 12 January, but despite being fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> his form was poor.|$|E
5|$|Although Baggio {{initially}} {{struggled with}} injuries {{at the beginning}} of his first season with Milan, he came back into the starting line-up and was appointed the main penalty taker. He helped Milan win the Serie A title, notably scoring a goal against his former team Fiorentina from a penalty in the title-deciding match. Baggio finished the season with 10 goals in all competitions, in 34 appearances; 7 of his goals were scored in Serie A, in 28 appearances, and he also provided 10 assists in Serie A. He became one of the six players to win the Scudetto in consecutive years with different teams, and was voted the club's best player of the season by the fans, despite playing a more creative role. Towards the end of the season, Baggio had disagreements with Capello due to limited playing time, as Capello believed he was no longer fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for 90 minutes; although Baggio frequently started matches, he was often substituted during the second half.|$|E

5|$|Brodie re-signed for York City, {{who were}} newly relegated into the National League, on 17 May 2016 on a one-year contract. He made his second debut for York as an 84th-minute {{substitute}} in a 1–1 away draw with Maidstone United. Having struggled {{to come to}} terms with the physical requirements of returning to professional football, Brodie was told by manager Jackie McNamara that he would not start home matches until improving his fitness levels. Brodie scored his first goal of 2016–17 with a penalty in first-half stoppage time away against Gateshead on 16 August 2016, with York losing 6–1. This marked the start of a run of five goals from five matches, with McNamara praising his ability to score different types of goals, having scored with a header, a penalty, a left-footed volley and two right-footed shots in this run. Despite being York's top scorer with seven goals, new manager Gary Mills suggested in November 2016 that Brodie was not fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> under him.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on {{the hand}} with a short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it difficult to}} position themselves quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E

5|$|For reasons {{related to}} class and race, {{it had been}} unthinkable before the war for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain, but the postwar world saw social and {{political}} changes in the Caribbean. Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain, Headley was appointed {{as one of the}} West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948. Crab Nethersole, the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket, argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached. Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches, played in Barbados and Jamaica, and the white players Gerry Gomez and John Goddard were given the captaincy of the second and third matches. In the event, Headley only played in the first Test. In the first innings, he scored 29 but strained his back while fielding. Batting towards the end of West Indies' second innings, he scored seven not out. Rain helped England to draw the match. Headley's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests, but he was fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test. After the first island game, in which he scored 65, Headley's request to miss the second match to rest his back was refused by the Jamaican Board. He scored 36 not out, but aggravated his back pains and he withdrew from the final Test. West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard, who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test. He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948–49, despite Headley's availability and apparently superior claims to the position.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the match.|$|E
5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E
