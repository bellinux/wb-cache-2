Exogenous phytase supplementation in poultry and swine diets improves bioavailability of P, and limited research suggests that this strategy may have some application in dairy cattle rations. The effects of exogenous phytase and forage particle length on site and extent of P digestion were evaluated with 5 ruminally and ileally cannulated lactating cows (188 ± 35 d in milk). Cows were assigned in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments in 2 <b>incomplete</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>squares</b> with four 21 -d periods. Diets contained P slightly in excess of National Research Council requirements with all P from feed sources. During the last 4 d of each period, total mixed ration, refusals, omasal, ileal, and fecal samples were collected and analyzed for total P, inorganic P (Pi), and phytate (Pp). Total P intake was not influenced by dietary treatments but Pp intake decreased and Pi intake increased with supplemental phytase, suggesting rapid action of the enzyme in the total mixed ration after mixing. Omasal flow of Pi decreased with phytase supplementation, but we observed no effect of diet in ileal flow or small intestinal digestibility of any P fraction. Fecal excretion of total P was slightly higher and Pp excretion was lower for cows receiving diets supplemented with phytase. Milk yield and composition were unaffected by diets. When phytase {{was added to the}} mixed ration, dietary Pp was rapidly degraded before intake and total-tract Pp digestion was increased. The lack of effect of phytase supplementation on dietary P utilization was probably because these late-lactation cows had a low P requirement and were fed P-adequate diets...|$|R

Digestible organic matter intake was increased significantly by leucaena supplementation although digestibility of the whole diet did not alter. Rumen fluid ammonia-N was not altered by leucaena supplementation, but was increased by urea. This suggests that Tarramba foliage protein has some resistance to ruminal degradation.

Experimental periods were 18 days with 13 days for adaptation and 5 days for collection of feces and urine. Blood was collected at feeding and 3 and 6 hours after feeding on day 18 of each period. Supplementing steers with carnitine increased urinary carnitine excretion and plasma carnitine concentration. Nitrogen retention (a measure of protein deposition) was not affected by carnitine supplementation and averaged 29. 3 g/d. Plasma insulin and glucagon, indicative of energy status, and cholesterol and triglyceride, representative of energy storage metabolites, were not affected by carnitine supplementation. Plasma glycerol and beta-hydroxybutyrate, reflective of fat catabolism, increased with intermediate levels of supplemental carnitine.

Reticulo-rumen was the major site of net absorption of magnesium, whereas calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium were absorbed postruminally.

Total OM intake responded in a similar fashion; however, 160 / 3 d was less than 160 /d (P 0. 05) on digestibility. Reduced levels of protein supplemented infrequently may be an effective means of capturing additional cost savings...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of nutrients and gross energy (GE), metabolizable energy (ME), coefficient of metabolizability of gross energy (CM of GE), and fecal characteristics of dogs fed diets with two levels of feather meal, with or without addition of an enzyme blend containing lipase and protease activity. Ten adult Beagle dogs (aged between 1 and 2 years and weighing 10. 2 ± 1. 4 kg) were arranged in a 5 × 3 <b>incomplete</b> <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> design with five treatments and three periods. The extruded basal diet was provided in equal amounts to all dogs (220 g/d), and 7. 5 and 15 % of hydrolyzed feather meal without enzymes (HFM) or HFM processed with addition of the enzyme blend (HFM EB) was added on top of the basal diet just before feeding. The contrast analysis showed that inclusion of 7. 5 or 15 % feather meal negatively affected CTTAD of crude protein (CP), GE, and ME of the diets with no apparent effect of the enzyme treatment. However, when both feather meal samples were evaluated, the HFM EB resulted in better CTTAD of GE and CM of GE (0. 774 vs. 0. 666) than HFM without enzymes (0. 670 vs. 0. 567), respectively. There was no effect of either feather meal on fecal score. Regression analysis showed that the enzymes added to the feathers during the digestion process increased digestible energy by 600 kcal/kg of dry matter in the diet containing HFM EB. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis demonstrated that feather meal had a low molecular weight, with about 95 % of the molecules below 10, 000 Da. Addition of enzymes during the feather hydrolysis process may improve the energy content of the feather meal when included in diets for adult dogs...|$|E

This is just the chromatic number of its associated <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> graph. Although <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> graphs have been widely studied as strongly regular graphs, their chromatic numbers appear to be unexplored. We determine the chromatic number of a circulant <b>Latin</b> <b>square,</b> and find bounds for some other classes of <b>Latin</b> <b>squares.</b> With a computer, we find the chromatic number for all main classes of <b>Latin</b> <b>squares</b> of order at most eight...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{set in a}} <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> {{is a set of}} {{entries in}} a <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> which can be embedded in only one <b>latin</b> <b>square.</b> Also, if any element of the critical set is deleted, the remaining set can be embedded in more than one <b>latin</b> <b>square.</b> A critical set is strong if the embedding <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> is particularly easy to find because the remaining <b>squares</b> of the <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> are "forced" one at a time. A semi-strong critical set is a generalization of a strong critical set. It is proved that the size of the smallest strong or semi-strong critical set of a <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> of order n is ën 2 / 4 û. An example of a critical set that is not strong or semi-strong is also displayed. It is also proved that the smallest critical set of a <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> of order 6 is 9. 1.
