5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} {{aircraft}} are transmitted by the aircraft's Satellite <b>Data</b> <b>Unit</b> (SDU) and relayed via satellite to a ground station, {{where they are}} routed to other communication networks to reach their destination. Messages may also {{be sent to the}} aircraft, in reverse order. When passing through the satellite, the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the satellite, leaving the satellite at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the aircraft are made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The ground station then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment to be processed. The ground station keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E

Early applications require tremendous human efforts to annotate <b>data</b> <b>units</b> manually, which severely limit their scalability.

40|$|The {{distributed}} applications require group communications among multiple entities. In the group communication, {{it is important}} to discuss in what order each entity in the group can receive <b>data</b> <b>units.</b> In order to realize fault-tolerant systems, the same events have to occur in the same order in each entity. The ordering among the events is known as a causal order. This paper presents a reliable causally ordering broadcast (CO) protocol which provides the same causal ordering of <b>data</b> <b>units</b> for all the entities in the group. In the CO protocol, the <b>data</b> <b>units</b> received are causally ordered by using the sequence numbers of the <b>data</b> <b>units.</b> The CO protocol is based on the fully distributed control scheme, i. e. no master controller, and uses high-speed networks where each entity may fail to receive <b>data</b> <b>units</b> due to the buffer overrun.

500|$|At 02:25 MYT, the aircraft's {{satellite}} communication system sent a [...] "log-on request" [...] message—the first {{message on the}} system since the ACARS transmission at 01:07—which was relayed by satellite to a ground station, both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat. After logging on to the network, the satellite <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat and two ground-to-aircraft phone calls, at 02:39 and 07:13, which went unanswered by the cockpit. The final status request and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08:10, about 1 hour and 40 minutes after it was scheduled to arrive in Beijing. The aircraft sent a log-on request at 08:19:29, which was followed, after a response from the ground station, by a [...] "log-on acknowledgement" [...] message at 08:19:37. The log-on acknowledgement is {{the last piece of}} data available from Flight 370. The aircraft did not respond to a status request from Inmarsat at 09:15.|$|E
500|$|Aeronautical {{satellite}} communication (SATCOM) systems {{are used to}} transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit, as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may {{also be used to}} transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax and data links using other protocols. The aircraft's satellite <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> (SDU) is used to send and receive signals with the {{satellite communication}}s network; it operates independently from other aircraft equipment that communicate through the SATCOM system, many using the ACARS protocol. Signals from the SDU are relayed by a satellite, which simply changes the signal's frequency, and then received by a ground station, which processes the signal and, if applicable, routes it to its destination (e.g., Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals to the aircraft are sent in reverse order. When the SDU is powered on and attempts to connect with the Inmarsat network, it transmits a log-on request, which the ground station acknowledges. This is, in part, to determine that the SDU belongs to an active service subscriber and also used to determine which satellite should be used to transmit messages to the SDU. After connecting, if a ground station has not received any contact from a terminal for one hour, the ground station will transmit a [...] "log-on interrogation" [...] message, informally referred to as a [...] "ping"; an active terminal responds automatically. The entire process of interrogating the terminal is referred to as a [...] "handshake".|$|E
