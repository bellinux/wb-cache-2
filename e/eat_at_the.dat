25|$|On July 2, 1964, President Johnson {{signed the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law, prohibiting {{segregation}} of public facilities. Some Jim Crow laws and customs remained in effect in Selma {{and other places}} for some time. When activists resumed efforts to integrate Selma's eating and entertainment venues, blacks who tried to attend the movie theater and <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hamburger stand were beaten and arrested.|$|E
25|$|Most Jewish {{religious}} authorities {{held that}} a husband must allow his wife to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself. By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife {{to move to another}} home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.|$|E

25|$|At 3:07pm on 21 March 2002, Dowler left Heathside School in Weybridge {{and walked}} to Weybridge railway station with a friend. The girls got off at Walton-on-Thames railway station, one stop before Dowler's usual stop of Hersham, and went to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station cafe. After Dowler telephoned her father at 3:47pm to say she would be home in half an hour, the girls left the cafe at 4:05, with Dowler walking home alone. She was last seen three minutes later, walking along Station Avenue, by a friend of her sister, who was waiting at a bus stop. A closed-circuit {{television}} camera located further along the road showed no images of Dowler. A red Daewoo Nexia, which belonged to Levi Bellfield's girlfriend Emma Mills, was photographed driving past by the same camera at 4:32 pm. In an April 2009 interview, Bellfield {{said that he was}} driving the car.|$|E
25|$|Phinehas is said {{never to}} have {{accepted}} {{an invitation to a}} meal and, after he had attained his majority, to have refused to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table of his father. The reason given by him for this course of conduct was that {{there are two kinds of}} people: (1) those who are willing to be hospitable, but can not afford to be so, and (2) those who have the means but are not willing to extend hospitality to others (Hul. 7b). Judah I once invited him to a meal, and exceptionally he decided to accept the invitation; but on arriving at the house of the patriarch he noticed in the yard mules of a certain kind the use of which was forbidden by local custom on account of the danger in handling them. Thereupon he retraced his steps and did not return (Hul. l.c.).|$|E

25|$|Preparations {{are being}} made for the three guests to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nearby golf club {{as it is the}} night off for the Elgins, Clarissa's married butler and cook. Sir Rowland congratulates Clarissa on her {{relationship}} with and handling of Pippa who had a bad time with her real mother, Miranda and her drug-supplying lover, Oliver Costello. A phone call to the house is strangely cut off when Clarissa tells the caller that she is not Mrs. Brown but Mrs. Hailsham-Brown. Clarissa tells Sir Rowland that the house used to belong to a Mr. Sellon, a now-deceased antique dealer in Maidstone and the furnishings are his. His former trade means that enquiries are received about some of his furniture, including one for the desk that, unbeknown to her, Jeremy had been searching through earlier. Walking in on the conversation, Pippa tells the two that she has found out that the desk has a secret drawer and she shows it to them together with its contents: an envelope with three autographed papers inside with the signatures of Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and Robert Browning on them.|$|E
25|$|Canadian {{military}} {{nurses were}} {{well known for}} their kindness, efficiency, and professional appearance. Canadian nurses worked alongside soldiers on the war front, and felt the full effect of wartime risks and death, disease, and pain was encountered daily by the nurses. Most C.A.M.C. Nursing Sisters served in mobile infirmaries, or Casualty Clearing Stations. These Casualty Clearing Stations, or the C.C.S., as they were titled were typically situated on railway siding, close {{to the front lines}} so they could quickly and efficiently retrieve and treat soldiers who had fallen on the nearby battlefield. The proximity to the fighting exposed the Nursing Sisters to the horrors and dangers particular to the front. The advance areas were often under attack from air raids and shellfire, which frequently placed the lives of the sisters in danger. The Casualty Clearing Stations served as an advanced surgical center that administered emergency surgeries staffed by Canada’s most brilliant nurses. One of the most widespread problems the Nursing Sisters had to deal with at the C.C.S. was the vile cases of gangrene. Gangrene, caused by lethal mustard gas getting into an open wound, caused an infection of such toxicity it would literally <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> skin. Gangrene was such a dreadful problem among Casualty Clearing Stations because the infection spread rapidly making it very hard to contain. This variation of gangrene was certainly not something that the nurses would have been trained on prior to their arrival at a Casualty Clearing Station; however, they were able to treat the infection with much success. The Nursing Sister’s role in the efficiency of the Casualty Clearing Stations proved to be a great contribution to the Canadian war effort.|$|E
500|$|The rapid {{advancement}} {{and personal}} arrogance of the Munshi would inevitably {{have led to}} his unpopularity, {{but the fact of}} his race made all emotions run hotter against him. [...] Racialism was a scourge of the age; it went hand in hand with belief in the appropriateness of Britain's global dominion. [...] For a dark-skinned Indian to be put very nearly on a level with the queen's white servants was all but intolerable, for him to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same table as them, to share in their daily lives was viewed as an outrage. [...] Yet the queen was determined to impose harmony on her household. [...] Race hatred was intolerable to her, and the [...] "dear good Munshi" [...] deserving of nothing but respect.|$|E

500|$|Julian {{attended}} DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated {{nature of}} the town forced social humiliations. Julian {{was not allowed to}} live in the college dormitories and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals. [...] It took him days before Julian found an establishment where he could eat. He later found work firing the furnace, waiting tables, and doing other odd jobs in a fraternity house; in return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 as a Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian. By 1930 Julian's father would move the entire family to Greencastle so that all his children could attend college at DePauw. [...] He still worked as a railroad postal clerk.|$|E
500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|Ashman and Menken {{wrote the}} Beauty song score during the {{pre-production}} process in Fishkill, the opening operetta-styled [...] "Belle" [...] being their first composition for the film.

[...] As story and song development came to a close, full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City. The Beauty songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately, {{in order to give}} the songs a cast album-like [...] "energy" [...] the filmmakers and songwriters desired.|$|E

500|$|Debbie Cook {{left the}} Hole in May 2007 after {{spending}} seven weeks there, {{when she was}} sent back to Clearwater, Florida to organize a major public event involving Miscavige. According to Cook, she was driven to downtown Clearwater by another staff member, along with her husband, to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Church's dining hall. The couple took the opportunity to escape Scientology when the staff member went inside to get breakfast; Cook jumped into the driver's seat, drove with her husband to the nearest car rental outlet and hired a car to drive up to her father's house in North Carolina. Before they got there, they were intercepted by Church officials and ordered to return to Clearwater. She spent three weeks under guard, at one point writing in a letter to her mother that if she was not released she [...] "would take whatever steps necessary, like slitting my wrists", before finally signing a severance agreement. She later said that by that point, [...] "I would have signed that I stabbed babies over and over again and loved it".|$|E
500|$|Despite these problems, {{from late}} October 1974 his {{demeanour}} appeared {{to change for}} the better. His best man, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6November he met his uncle John Bevan, apparently in good spirits. Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that [...] "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, {{and there was nothing}} to suggest that he was worried or depressed". He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver Graham Hill. At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00pm and 4:00am, so Lucan often gambled into {{the early hours of the}} morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Clermont at about 3:00pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00pm lunch appointment with artist Dominic Elwes and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.|$|E
