5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections at the ends of the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E

5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no {{evidence}} to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} aquatic species of the genus Agkistrodon, and is usually {{associated}} with bodies of water, such as creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. The U.S. Navy (1991) describes it as inhabiting swamps, shallow lakes, and sluggish streams, but it <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> found in swift, deep, cool water. Behler and King (1979) list its habitats as including lowland swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation ditches, canals, rice fields, and small, clear, rocky, mountain streams.|$|E

5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E
5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>not</b> noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
