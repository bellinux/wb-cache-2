In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There {{were times when}} I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he returned. [...] "It {{certainly}} is a bad piece of business. But now I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> so I'll say good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{can take}} care of herself, you bet, an' come up bright an' smilin' every time. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to-morrow, Plums, an' hustle for five-cent stews." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> town to-morrow," [...] he said. [...] "But I'll {{come back}} here before very long. I'll bring you {{anything}} you want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a glutton he'd {{have made}} for the middle-weights,' remarked the trainer; 'with six months' {{coaching}} he'd astonish the fancy. It's a pity he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> prison.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Attention," [...] {{said the}} Voice, and then fiercely, [...] "Don't try any games. Remember I {{can see your}} face if you can't see mine. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And this is {{only the}} half of it," [...] {{announced}} the fun-loving Rover to his brother, in answer to a query. [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and get the rest out of the automobile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{must not}} know; keep them out!" [...] gasped the contractor. [...] "Get me some brandy and ring for the steward--quick. You have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and {{convince}} those fellows, Thurston. Good Lord!--this is agony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She may be {{miles from}} here by this time," [...] said Dick, with almost a groan. [...] "There is no help for it, Tom, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and break the news as best we can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hampton," [...] {{repeated}} Ditmar, with {{a suggestion}} of truculence that took his friend aback. Not for worlds would Mr. Sprole have offended the agent of the Chippering Mill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ketch him!" [...] {{returned}} Yuba Bill, derisively, [...] "why we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the station; and afore we're off agin he's pinted fur Clarmont on {{the relay}} we lose. Ketch him! H-ll's full of such ketches!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lane, {{you come}} to my house to-night," [...] he said. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work.... But I'll think--and we can talk it over. I still live where you used to come as a boy.... How strange life is!... Good day, Lane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, sir, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{pretty well}} <b>to</b> where we was in 1820, and begin {{it all over}} again. It is {{somewhat}} aggrawatin'! Might have been avoided, too, if they'd kep' a few more troops on the frontier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{waited for}} you since five o'clock, and I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now. Ciccio! Ciccio! I wanted so badly to see you. I shall never see thee again, brother, my brother!" [...] cried Gigi, and a sob shook him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with me," [...] {{says the}} young man. [...] "I've come two {{thousand}} miles for you. Aren't you {{tired of it}} yet. Bess? You've kept all of us waiting so long. Haven't you found out yet what is best?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your horses, Jeff, and {{you shall}} be the first served," [...] she said, and she offered him the plate with a bright smile and {{friendly}} grace, which were meant {{to keep him from}} the hurt of her intention.|$|E
6000|$|Dismayed and halting, she said: [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that trail which {{branched}} {{off to the}} right. I reckon {{that was}} the highland trail which Settle made {{to keep out of}} the swamp. I thought it was a trail from Cameron Peak, but it wasn't. Back we go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think it}} would," [...] remarked Father Brown, {{as he picked}} up his hat. [...] "I rather think I should tell her. Even the most murderous blunders don't poison life like sins; anyhow, I think you may both be the happier now. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Deaf School." ...|$|E
60|$|She set {{off at a}} good pace up the High Street, {{attended}} by her faithful follower, and passing through the small suburbs, struck out into the country beyond. After four miles the boatswain, who was no walker, reminded her that they had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, I've three beans left, Burton," [...] he explained, {{towards the}} end of the meal. [...] "I don't know why I should keep them. They'd only last a matter of seven months, anyway. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> sometime. Do you think I could get in with you in the company?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Them four {{wanted to}} leave," [...] said Jake, taking no trouble to {{disguise}} his disgust, [...] "and I had to fetch 'em over. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{and wait for}} 'em now," [...] and he swore with sincere disappointment. [...] "I reckon there ain't been such a jamboree in town for years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} to stop in that town and send some help here-- a police official, or a constable, or some men. Crabtree has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> jail, and I {{think we ought to}} have Pelter and Japson locked up, too-- {{although}} that may depend upon what father may have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|After a {{few minutes}} Asaph rose. He knew that Thomas Rooper had a slow-working mind, and {{thought it would be}} well to leave him to himself for a while. [...] "I'll go home," [...] said he, [...] "and 'tend to my chores, and by the time you feel like comin' up and takin' a smoke with me under the chestnut-tree, I reckon you will have made up your mind, and we'll settle this thing. Fer if I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Drummondville, I s'pose I'll have to pack up this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Farrington," [...] she said, {{with the}} smile that {{had won the}} Hotel Lotus, [...] "I {{want to tell you}} something. I'm going to leave before breakfast in the morning, because I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my work. I'm behind the hosiery counter at Casey's Mammoth Store, and my vacation's up at eight o'clock to-morrow. That paper-dollar is the last cent I'll see till I draw my eight dollars salary next Saturday night. You're a real gentleman, and you've been good to me, and I wanted to tell you before I went.|$|E
5000|$|Whiting {{is also in}} {{the process}} of writing another book on Japan's postwar characters. “I have a 150,000-word draft," [...] Whiting said, [...] "but {{unfortunately}} I picked the wrong 150,000. Now I’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and replace them with the right ones.” He said he rewrites all his books multiple times before publication.|$|R
5000|$|His {{first solo}} hit record in 1967, [...] "I've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Back</b> Home", was {{followed}} by [...] "Desperate Lover", [...] "Feeling Soul", [...] "Unchained", and [...] "Too Experienced". [...] He also composed songs for other reggae artists, including [...] "I Don't Want to See You Cry" [...] for Ken Boothe, and [...] "Feel Like Jumping", [...] "Truly", and [...] "Melody Life" [...] for Marcia Griffiths.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of cursing?" [...] said Stalky at last. [...] "We're {{all in the same}} boat. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and consort with the house. A locker in the form-room, and a seat at prep. in Number Twelve." [...] (He looked regretfully round the cozy study which McTurk, their leader in matters of Art, had {{decorated}} with a dado, a stencil, and cretonne hangings.) ...|$|R
60|$|Rosalba {{heard their}} shrieks and groans in the dungeon {{in which she}} was thrust; a most awful black hole, full of bats, rats, mice, toads, frogs, mosquitoes, bugs, fleas, serpents, and every kind of horror. No light was let into it, {{otherwise}} the gaolers might have seen her and fallen in love with her, as an owl that lived up in the roof of the tower did, and a cat, you know, who can see in the dark, and having set its green eyes on Rosalba, never would be <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the turnkey's wife to whom it belonged. And the toads in the dungeon came and kissed her feet, and the vipers wound round her neck and arms, and never hurt her, so charming was this poor Princess in the midst of her misfortunes.|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled as}} he saw the faint flush on Jimmy's face. [...] "Then I fancied {{there might be more}} in steam, and that since Merril wants the Tyee, I'd let him have her--at a figure. Anything she brings over and above the bond goes to your father. Well, I'll put on a broker to bid for her who knows his business. If I have to take her I guess I could get my money back by sailing her, and, anyway, the broker will run Merril up. You couldn't do it, because you'd be asked for {{security}} that you could put up the money. Now, that's about all, except that I want you not to take hold of anything that may be offered you until the auction's over and you have had a talk with me. I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the mill to-morrow for a week or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I've got the idea, now. You see, we can't walk any more. Think what we've done: {{four miles}} there, two to Moseley's, is six, {{then back to}} here--nine miles since noon, and not a bite to eat; I declare I don't see how we've done it; and as for me, I am just famishing. Now, somebody's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>to</b> help Mr. Brown--there's no getting around that; but whoever goes has got to ride, not walk. So my idea is this: one of us to ride back with Mr. Brown, then ride to Nancy Taylor's house {{with one of the}} Old People, leaving Mr. Brown to keep the other old one company, you all to go now to Nancy's and rest and wait; then one of you drive back and get the other one and drive her to Nancy's, and Mr. Brown walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A friend?" [...] said Sam; [...] "you can't {{mean any}} o' your own family, John, for you haven't <b>got</b> time <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> that length now, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, Dickie, old top," [...] he said, [...] "not so that you could notice it, don't you know! Things are still pretty much the same. I managed to get away from Blandings for a night, because the gov'nor had to come to London; but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with him on the three-o'clock train. And, as for money, I can't get a quid out of him. As a matter of fact, I'm in the deuce of a hole; and that's why I've come to you." ...|$|R
500|$|A mutant with {{accelerated}} healing, heightened animal-like senses, and—in 1973—retractable bone claws; in the future, his skeleton and claws are {{laced with}} adamantium in his body, making him virtually immortal. Jackman noted how Wolverine driving the plot {{in spite of}} his gruff personality made for interesting story choices, as [...] "if you want someone <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> take someone’s head off, fantastic, but he’s really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and almost act in parts as inspiration, as mentor, as guide, because he can’t do it all on his own, which is always his preferred method".|$|R
