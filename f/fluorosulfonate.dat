50|$|Organic (alkyl) fluorosulfonates {{are usually}} strong {{alkylation}} agents, similar to triflate esters (F3C-SO2-OR). But unlike the triflate group, the <b>fluorosulfonate</b> group is not stable against hydrolysis. Therefore, <b>fluorosulfonate</b> esters are less frequently used as alkylation agents than triflate esters.|$|E

5000|$|The fluorosulfates or <b>fluorosulfonates</b> are {{a set of}} salts of fluorosulfuric acid with an ion formula SO3F−. The flurosulfate anion can be teated {{as though}} it were a {{hydrogen}} sulfate anion with hydroxyl substituted by fluorine. The fluorosulfate ion has a low propensity to form complexes with the metal cation. Since fluorine is similar in size to oxygen, the fluorosulfate ion is roughly tetrahedral and forms salts similar to those of perchlorate. It is isoelectronic with hydrogen sulfate, HSO4−. When an organic group is substituted for the anions, organic <b>fluorosulfonates</b> are formed.|$|R
40|$|Site-directed {{conjugation}} {{of metal}} centers to proteins is fundamental for biological and bioinorganic applications of transition metals. However, methods for the site-selective introduction of metal centers remain scarce. Herein, we present broadly applicable synthetic {{strategies for the}} conjugation of bioactive molecules {{with a range of}} organometallic complexes. Following three different synthetic strategies, we were able to synthesize a small library of metal conjugated protein markers featuring different types of protein reactive sites (epoxides, phenylphosphonates, <b>fluorosulfonates</b> and fluorophosphonate groups) as well as different late transition metals (iron, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum). The products were isolated in moderate to excellent yields and high purity. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction of the metalated protein markers corroborates structural integrity of the metal complex and the protein reactive site. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{properties}} of the complex of ferricyt c with <b>fluorosulfonated</b> polyanion Nafion (as a representative `hydrophobic' polyanion) have been studied by means of optical spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The addition of the polyanion to a solution of ferricyt c (pH 7. 4) resulted in {{an expansion of the}} protein molecule characterized by a profound decrease in enthalpy of the thermal transition of ferricyt c. The conformational change of ferricyt c upon addition of Nafion was shown by a perturbation of the Met- 80 -heme iron bond and an apparent increase in the distance of Trp- 59 from the heme. The conformational change in the heme region was also observed by examining the CD spectra. The conformational state of ferricyt c in a complex with Nafion was similar to that designated as state II by Hildebrandt (Hildebrandt, P. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1040, 175 – 186) in the complex with negatively charged heteropolytungstates — a six-coordinated low-spin state with a destabilized structure of the heme crevice. The decrease in enthalpy of the thermal transition of ferricyt c, the spectral changes in absorbance and the CD spectra, together with an increase in Trp fluorescence induced by Nafion addition observed at high ionic strength, all point to the involvement of the non-coulombic interaction. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|<b>Fluorosulfonate,</b> {{in organic}} chemistry, is a {{functional}} {{group that has}} the chemical formula F-SO2-O-R, and typically {{is a very good}} leaving group. In inorganic chemistry, <b>fluorosulfonate</b> is another term for fluorosulfate, the anion F-SO2-O−, the conjugated base of fluorosulfonic acid. They form a series of salts with metal and organic cations called fluorosulfates.|$|E

50|$|Methylations are {{commonly}} performed using electrophilic methyl {{sources such as}} iodomethane, dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl carbonate, or tetramethylammonium chloride. Less common but more powerful (and more dangerous) methylating reagents include methyl triflate, diazomethane, and methyl <b>fluorosulfonate</b> (magic methyl). These reagents all react via SN2 nucleophilic substitutions. For example, a carboxylate may be methylated on oxygen to give a methyl ester; an alkoxide salt RO− may be likewise methylated to give an ether, ROCH3; or a ketone enolate may be methylated on carbon to produce a new ketone.|$|E
40|$|Alkoxy-N-methyl-acetiminium salts were {{prepared}} by addition of CH 3 OH and C 2 H 5 OH to N-methyl acetonitrilium <b>fluorosulfonate</b> at low temperature. Analysis of the (5) J(HH) and (3) J(13) C-H coupling constants in the NMR spectra showed an anti addition with a diastereoselectivity of > 9596. Deprotonation of these salts with (Z) -configuration gave the corresponding N-methyl-alkoxyacetimines with very high (E) -configuration. Upon protonation at - 78 degrees C, these iminoesters gave the corresponding alkoxy-N-methyl-acetirninium salts with (E) -configuration.

40|$|The {{functionalization}} of aromatic halides or aromatic compounds bearing substituents like <b>fluorosulfonate,</b> by coupling {{with various}} nucleophiles {{in the presence}} of transition metals (Pd, Cu, Ni [...] ) has become over the years the favoured method to build up new carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds. However, this strategy requires the availability of brominated or iodinated derivatives (which are often expensive) or chlorinated compounds (which present a reduced reactivity). The triflates are a good alternative, though their price limits their use to specific, valuable products. We would like to present here our results in the preparation of aromatic diazo-ethers from anilines derivatives as well as a study of their reactivity in metal-catalysed coupling reactions. During our investigations, we have also prepared a diazoaminobenzene containing substrate. Although this compound was somewhat prepared by accident, we became rapidly interested in its unusual structure and eventually found it to be reactive under adjusted coupling conditions [...] .

40|$|The {{design and}} {{chemical}} synthesis of new media for solar pumped iodine molecule lasers are explored. In {{an effort to}} prepare an iodo fluorocarbon compound absorbing strongly at 300 nm or above, the synthesis of perfluoro allylic iodides was investigated. These compounds furnish especially stable allylic radicals upon photodissociation. The desired red shift is anticipated in the absorption maximum could correlate with increasing radical stability. This expectation was based upon the analysis, previously reported, of the structures and absorption maxima of compounds studied earlier. A previously unknown substance was prepared, a prototypical target molecule, perfluoro- 3 -iodocyclopent- 1 -ene. It was obtained by reaction of perfluorocyclopentene with sulfur trioxide {{under the influence of}} antimony pentafluoride catalyst, followed by treatment of the resulting allylic <b>fluorosulfonate</b> with sodium iodide in sulfoland solvent. Preliminary data indicate that the absorption maximum for the iodo fluorocarbon is not shifted significantly to longer wavelength. It is not certain whether this result reflects an unexpected influence of the cyclic structure upon the position of the absorption maximum...|$|E
40|$|Cardiotrophin- 1, {{a member}} of the interleukin- 6 related {{cytokine}} family which acts via the glycoprotein 130 signalling pathway, may be involved in the process of ventricular remodelling. Its presence in human plasma has never been reported. We have devised a non-radioactive immunoluminometric sensitive and specific assay for CT- 1 based on a competitive ligand binding principle. The chemiluminescent label 4 -(2 -succinimidyl-oxycarbonylethyl) phenyl- 10 -methylacridinium 9 -carboxylate <b>fluorosulfonate</b> was used to label a peptide representing a domain in the middle section of CT- 1. Assay of this domain of CT- 1 (amino acids 105 - 120) in patients with heart failure revealed elevated CT- 1 values median 87 [range 74. 3 - 182. 8] fmol/ml) compared to normal controls (CT- 1 median 29. 55 [range 6. 9 - 48. 3] fmol/ml, P< 0. 0005). The molecular weight of human CT- 1 was estimated to be 26. 7 kD from sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This is the first quantitative assessment of CT- 1 in humans.

40|$|Some {{reactions}} {{leading to}} several anhydrous Uranium fluorosulfates {{through the use}} of fluorosulfonic acid or peroxydisulfuryl di-fluoride have been studied. It was found that HS 0 F can oxidize uranium 3 metal to the + 4 state or the + 2 state depending on the reaction conditions. The synthesis of the tan solid; U(S 03 F) 4 and the pale green solid thought to be U(S 03 F) 2 were prepared in this manner. It was found that S 206 F 2 can also oxidize uranium to yield the green solid U(S 03 F) 3. S 206 F 2 was also found to be a convenient reagent for placing a <b>fluorosulfonate</b> group on uranium tetrahalides to form addition or displacement products; the yellow solid UF 4 (S 03 F) 2 and the tan solid U(S 03 F) 4 were prepared in this manner. Other reactions involving the fluorosulfate, U(S 03 F) 4 as a reactant are also discussed. Analytical data and infrared spectra are reported for the compounds and x-ray powder data and magnetic susceptibility data are presented for U(S 03 F) 2 and U(S 03 F) 4. The reaction of the fluorinated anhydride µ -oxo-bis (phosphoryl difluoride), P 203 F 4 with some group VI B metal oxide salts has found to form the corresponding difluorophosphates.
