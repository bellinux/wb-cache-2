Other recommendations included redesign of the cablegripping device, substitution of modern braking mechanisms, improvements in cable pulleys and other components, and new inspection and repair procedures. Ames followed up by designing and installing new equipment to lengthen cable life, which averages only about two months. These cables-four of them for four different car routes [...] are <b>endless</b> <b>belts,</b> like ski lift cables, running from the downtown car barn to the end of each line. When a cable is installed, the loop is closed by splicing the ends together in a 72 -footlong splice. The splice is the weakest part of the cable and a source of problems. When the car operator applies his grip while over a splice, the resulting friction sometimes causes the splice to "unbraid" and fail; this means shutting down the line until the splice can be repaired. Even when unbraiding does not occur, gripping a splice shortens cable life by friction wear. Worn cables are a safety hazard and must be replaced, which is expensive at $ 1. 60 a foot for 10, 000 to 20, 000 feet of cable...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} an {{electrostatic}} generator in which charge is mechanically transported in small amounts into {{the interior of a}} high voltage electrode originated with the Kelvin water dropper, invented during 1867 by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), in which charged drops of water fall into a bucket with the same polarity charge, adding to the charge. In a machine of this type the gravitational force moves the drops against the opposing electrostatic field of the bucket. Kelvin himself first suggested using a belt to carry the charge instead of water. The first electrostatic machine that used an <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> to transport charge was constructed during 1872 by Augusto Righi. It used an india rubber belt with wire rings along its length as charge carriers, which passed into a spherical metal electrode. The charge was applied to the belt from the grounded lower roller by electrostatic induction using a charged plate. John Gray also invented a belt machine about 1890. [...] Another more complicated belt machine was invented during 1903 by Juan Burboa [...] A more immediate inspiration for Van de Graaff was a generator W. F. G. Swann was developing during the 1920s in which charge was transported to an electrode by falling metal balls, thus returning to the principle of the Kelvin water dropper.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{devices were}} designed and manufactured {{to study the}} use of mechanical impact and rubbing (friction and compression) to thresh soybeans pods. Threshing efficiency and seed damage were evaluated. The energy absorbed by pods as they shatter and the energy required to operate both devices were estimated and compared with the energy used by conventional combines to thresh soybeans. ^ The impact device was basically made of two parallel walls which hit the plants in a transverse reciprocating motion. The rubbing device connected pairs of vertical rollers driving two, facing each other, <b>endless</b> <b>belts</b> at different speeds and with adjustable gaps between them. The plants were fed either between the walls or belts to simulate the movement of both devices over a row of plants. ^ The impact device threshed 92. 5 % of the soybeans. Threshing efficiency increased significantly with decreasing levels of pod moisture content. The seed damage was within acceptable levels despite the trend to increase with increasing impact speeds and decreasing pod moisture content. The estimated energy absorbed per pod at 10 % moisture content was 0. 0127 J. The energy used by conventional combines was 20 % higher than that required by the impact device, and around 30 {{times higher than the}} total energy absorbed by pods during shattering. ^ The rubbing device threshed over 92. 5 % of the soybeans from 10 % moisture pods at any belt speed. There was no significant seed mechanical damage. The energy absorbed per pod was 0. 0123 J. The energy used by conventional combines was over 100 times higher than that absorbed by pods as they shattered, 12 times higher than that required by plants (pods and stems), and more than 4 times that required by the rubbing device. ^ Both devices performed satisfactory threshing with little seed mechanical damage and a relatively low level of energy consumption. These results support the conclusion that there is potential to improve soybean harvesting equipment. ...|$|R
50|$|The moving-belt {{interface}} (MBI) {{was developed}} in 1977. This interface consisted of an <b>endless</b> moving <b>belt</b> receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and fast-atom bombardment (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were magnetic sector and quadropole instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied {{in the analysis of}} drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988.|$|R

5000|$|In a Van de Graaff generator, {{invented in}} 1929 by Robert J. Van de Graaff, an <b>endless</b> fabric <b>belt</b> carries {{electric}} charge into a round hollow electrode, developing high voltages. In the Westinghouse machine, two belts traveled up a 47 ft. shaft to a mushroom-shaped electrode inside the dome (see cutaway drawing below). The high voltage {{was used to}} accelerate subatomic particles to high speeds as they traveled down an evacuated 47 ft. accelerator tube parallel to the belts into {{the base of the}} machine, where they struck a target to create nuclear reactions. The energy of the particles was equal to the voltage on the machine's electrode. The maximum voltage that a Van de Graaff generator could produce was limited by leakage of the charge off the electrode due to corona discharge and arcing. At atmospheric pressure, a Van de Graaff machine was limited to around 1 megavolt. So the machine was installed inside a pear-shaped 65 ft. tall, 30 ft. diameter air tank which was pressurized during use to 120 pounds per square inch. [...] The high pressure air improved insulation, reducing charge leakage, allowing the machine to achieve a voltage of 5 megavolts, although it was originally hoped to reach 10 megavolts.|$|R

40|$|This report {{documents}} the technical development {{for a patent}} disclosure of a double-clad process for the continuous casting of thin-strip carbon steel. The fundamental idea of the disclosure is to form a product strip by depositing molten steel between two, cooled, clad strips of the same material. The claimed benefits include: (a) the conservation of energy in steel making through the elimination of soaking pits and reheat cycles, and (b) an improved surface {{on both sides of}} the as-cast product such that it will be suitable for direct feed to a cold-reduction mill. However, the process as conceived is not necessarily limited to the casting of carbon steel, but may be also applied to other metals and alloys. The work is described under three headings as follows. Preliminary Considerations and Scoping Analysis presents the basic idea of the double-clad, thin-strip casting process; the energy conservation potential; scoping heat transfer calculations for the casting process; and independent review of this work. Thermal Analysis for Roller Configuration of Double-Clad Process, presents the development, results, and independent review of a finite-element thermal analysis for the casting process as originally conceived (using only chilled rollers in direct contact with the clad material of the product strip).
