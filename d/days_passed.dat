5|$|In the {{original}} process, MLB held a four-day-long silent auction during which interested MLB teams submitted sealed bids in U.S. {{dollars to the}} Commissioner's Office. After the allotted four <b>days</b> <b>passed,</b> the Commissioner closed the bidding process and notified the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the bidding team was. The NPB team then had four days to either accept or reject the non-negotiable bid amount.|$|E
5|$|Dry air {{prevented}} the convection from initially reorganising after Gillian was downgraded. With a ridge to the south, the low turned westward around the Top End of northwestern Australia. On 17March, the system moved north of 10°S, {{into the area}} of warning responsibility of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics. By that time, the low-level circulation was disconnected from its mid-level circulation, and land interaction with Indonesia was expected to prevent redevelopment. Late on 18March, the storm moved over the island of Timor, and over the subsequent two <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> over several other Indonesian islands. On 21March, the convection reorganised due to a drop in wind shear, and at 12:00UTC that day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status while the storm was about 380km (235mi) south-southeast of Jakarta. On the same day, the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm, noting that the circulation had improved as it moved away from Indonesia. With low wind shear and favourable outflow, Gillian gradually intensified while moving southwestward around the ridge. On 22March, the storm passed just north of Christmas Island while Gillian was developing an eye; by that time, the 10minute sustained winds had increased to 95km/h (60mph) within an environment favourable for continued strengthening.|$|E
5|$|Sifton's {{successor}} as Premier was Charles Stewart, the Minister of Public Works in his cabinet. Stewart, {{who supported}} conscription {{but did not}} actively campaign for it or the Unionists, kept Cross as Attorney-General, despite rumours that he would not. Cross's major challenge was enforcing prohibition, which was proving challenging. The Conservatives, and in particular George Douglas Stanley, were unreluctant to accuse Cross of mismanagement. In the meantime, a rift was opening between Cross and Stewart (whom the Conservatives accused, somewhat ironically, of being unduly influenced by his Attorney-General). Stewart found Cross neglectful of his duties, and after Cross refused to dismiss two detectives from his department whose work Stewart felt could be better done by the Alberta Provincial Police, Stewart requested his resignation. When twelve <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> without a reply from Cross, Stewart fired him August 26, 1918. His replacement as Attorney-General was Boyle, his nemesis of the Alberta and Great Waterways era.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{argument}} against the poison theory {{is the fact that}} twelve <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance. Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause. Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.|$|E
5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
5|$|Their morale {{boosted by}} this small victory, the Greeks moved forward, still {{remaining}} on higher ground, {{to a new}} position more suited for encampment and better watered. The Spartans and Tegeans were on a ridge {{to the right of}} the line, the Athenians on a hillock on the left and the other contingents on the slightly lower ground between. In response, Mardonius brought his men up to the Asopus and arrayed them for battle; However, neither the Persians nor the Greeks would attack; Herodotus claims this is because both sides received bad omens during sacrificial rituals. The armies thus stayed camped in their locations for eight days, during which new Greek troops arrived. Mardonius then sought to break the stalemate by sending his cavalry to attack the passes of Mount Cithaeron; this raid resulted in the capture of a convoy of provisions intended for the Greeks. Two more <b>days</b> <b>passed,</b> during which time the supply lines of the Greeks continued to be menaced. Mardonius then launched another cavalry raid on the Greek lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian Spring, which had been the only source of water for the Greek army (they could not use the Asopus due to the threat posed by Persian archers). Coupled with the lack of food, the restriction of the water supply made the Greek position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of Plataea, from where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water. To prevent the Persian cavalry from attacking during the retreat, it was to be performed that night.|$|E

5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the <b>days</b> <b>passed,</b> Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E
25|$|When a {{good number}} of <b>days</b> <b>passed</b> without the {{reinforcements}} of ships promised by president Jefferson, the attack on Tripoli was renewed by Preble on August 24. As the <b>days</b> <b>passed,</b> Tripoli showed no signs of surrender, which now prompted Preble to devise another plan. Intrepid, the same ship that captured Philadelphia, was loaded with barrels of gunpowder and other ordnance and sent sailing into a group of Tripolitan vessels defending the harbor. The attack on the harbor and Tripoli proved successful and ultimately caused the Bashaw of Tripoli to consider surrender and the return of American prisoners held captive, including Commodore Bainbridge of Philadelphia, who had been held prisoner since October 1803 when that ship was captured after running aground near Tripoli harbor. On June 4, 1805, the Bashaw of Tripoli finally surrendered and signed a peace treaty with the United States.|$|E

They therefore decided to take action against Uthman before the pilgrimage was over. During the siege, Uthman was asked by his supporters, who outnumbered the rebels, to let them fight against the rebels and rout them. Uthman prevented them in an effort to avoid the bloodshed of Muslim by Muslim. Unfortunately for Uthman, violence still occurred. The gates of the house of Uthman were shut and guarded by the renowned warrior, Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The sons of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, were also among the guards.|$|E
