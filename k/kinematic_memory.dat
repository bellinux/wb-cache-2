40|$|The local rigid-body {{component}} of continuum deformation is typically {{characterized by the}} rotation tensor, obtained from the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient. Beyond its well-known merits, the polar rotation tensor also has a lesser known dynamical inconsistency: it does not satisfy the fundamental superposition principle of rigid-body rotations over adjacent time intervals. As a consequence, the polar rotation diverts from the observed mean material rotation of fibers in fluids, and introduces a purely <b>kinematic</b> <b>memory</b> effect into computed material rotation. Here we derive a generalized polar decomposition for linear processes that yields a unique, dynamically consistent rotation component, the dynamic rotation tensor, for the deformation gradient. The left dynamic stretch tensor is objective, and shares the principal strain values and axes with its classic polar counterpart. Unlike its classic polar counterpart, however, the dynamic stretch tensor evolves in time without spin. The dynamic rotation tensor further decomposes into a spatially constant mean rotation tensor and a dynamically consistent relative rotation tensor that is objective for planar deformations. We also obtain simple expressions for dynamic analogues of Cauchy's mean rotation angle that characterize a deforming body objectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we present {{high-resolution}} VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph integral field unit spectroscopy (VIMOS-IFU) of the extremely metal-poor HII/blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy Tol 65. The optical appearance of this galaxy shows clearly a cometary morphology with a bright main body and an extended and diffuse stellar tail. We focus on the detection of metallicity gradients or inhomogeneities as expected if the ongoing star-formation activity is sustained by the infall/accretion of metal-poor gas. No evidences of significant spatial variations of abundances were found within our uncertainties. However, our findings show a slight anticorrelation between gas metallicity and star-formation rate at spaxel scales, {{in the sense that}} high star-formation is found in regions of low-metallicity, but the scatter in this relation indicates that the metals are almost fully diluted. Our observations show the presence of extended Hα emission in the stellar tail of the galaxy. We estimated that the mass of the ionized gas in the tail M(HII) _tail∼ 1. 7 × 10 ^ 5 M_ corresponds with ∼ 24 per cent of the total mass of the ionized gas in the galaxy. We found that the Hα velocity dispersion of the main body and the tail of the galaxy are comparable with the one found in the neutral gas by previous studies. This suggests that the ionized gas still retains the <b>kinematic</b> <b>memory</b> of its parental cloud and likely a common origin. Finally, we suggest that the infall/accretion of cold gas from the outskirts of the galaxy and/or minor merger/interaction may have produced the almost flat abundance gradient and the cometary morphology in Tol 65.

40|$|The {{effects of}} inelastic {{buckling}} on monotonic and cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel bars arc studied. Experimental tests {{show that this}} phenomenon occurs when the ratio between length and diameter of the bar exceeds 5, and that it leads to a postyield softening, branch in compression that strongly influences the cyclic behavior of the bar. An analytical model of rebars accounting for inelastic buckling is presented, suitable for inclusion in programs {{for the analysis of}} r/c sections using the fiber type of discretization. The model employs four hardening rules (<b>kinematic,</b> isotropic, <b>memory,</b> and saturation) as functions of four independent parameters (yield stress, elastic modulus, hardening ratio, and a weighing coefficient), An explicit stress-strain relation in finite terms for loading branches is utilized. The model yields accurate results in predicting the cyclic behavior of rebars, both with and without inelastic buckling, for deformation paths of general nature...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{experiment}} was twofold: identifying {{similarities and differences between}} flavour memory and visual memory mechanisms and investigating whether kinematics could serve as an implicit measure for food selection. To test flavour and visual memory an 'implicit' paradigm to represent real-life situations in a controlled lab setting was implemented. A target, i. e., a piece of cake shaped like either an orange or a tangerine, covered with either orange- or a tangerine-flavoured icing, was provided to participants on Day 1. On Day 2, without prior notice, participants were requested to recognize the target amongst a set of distractors, characterized by various flavours (orange vs. tangerine) and/or sizes (orange-like vs. tangerine-like). Similarly, targets and distractors consisting of 2 D figures varying in shape and size were used to assess visual memory. Reach-to-grasp kinematics towards the targets were recorded and analysed by means of digitalization techniques. Correlations between <b>kinematic</b> parameters, <b>memory</b> and liking for each food item were also calculated. Results concerned with memory recollection indices provided evidence of different key mechanisms which could be based either on novelty of flavour memory or visual memory, respectively. To a moderate extent, kinematics may serve as an implicit index of food selection processe...|$|R
