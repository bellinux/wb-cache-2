40|$|Capacitive {{deionization}} (CDI) is {{a technology}} in which water is desalinated by ion electrosorption into the electric double layers (EDLs) of charging porous electrodes. In recent years significant advances {{have been made}} in modeling the charge and salt dynamics in a CDI cell, but the possible effect of <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> within diffuse EDLs on these dynamics has not been investigated. We here present theory which includes <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> in describing the dynamics of a charging CDI cell. Through our numerical solution to the presented models, the possible effect of <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> on the CDI process is elucidated. While at some model conditions <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> enhances the rate of CDI cell charging, counter-intuitively this additional transport pathway is found to slow down cell charging at other model conditions...|$|R

40|$|Topological {{insulators}} {{are known}} for their metallic surface states, a result of strong spin-orbit coupling, that exhibit unique <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> phenomenon. However, these <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> phenomena are buried in the presence of metallic bulk conduction. We synthesized very high quality Bi 2 Te 2 Se single crystals by using a modified Bridgman method that possess high bulk resistivity of > 20 Omega cm below 20 K, whereas the bulk is mostly inactive and <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> dominates. The temperature dependence of resistivity follows an activation law like a gap semiconductor in temperature range 20 - 300 K. To extract the <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> from that of the bulk, we designed a special measurement geometry to measure the resistance and found that single-crystal Bi 2 Te 2 Se exhibits a crossover from bulk to surface conduction at 20 K. Simultaneously, the material also shows strong evidence of weak antilocalization in magnetotransport owing to the protection against scattering by conducting surface states. This simple geometry facilitates finding evidence of <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> in topological insulators, which are promising materials for future spintronic applications...|$|R
40|$|Topological {{insulators}} are {{predicted to}} present novel <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> phenomena, but their experimental {{studies have been}} hindered by a metallic bulk conduction that overwhelms the <b>surface</b> <b>transport.</b> We show that a new topological insulator, Bi 2 Te 2 Se, presents a high resistivity exceeding 1 Ohm-cm and a variable-range hopping behavior, and yet presents Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations coming from the surface Dirac fermions. Furthermore, {{we have been able}} to clarify both the bulk and <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> channels, establishing a comprehensive understanding of the transport in this material. Our results demonstrate that Bi 2 Te 2 Se is the best material to date for studying the <b>surface</b> quantum <b>transport</b> in a topological insulator. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Cobots are a {{class of}} hybrid human-controlled/computer-controlled {{material}} handling device, which can enhance ergonomics, productivity, and safety. Cobots implement software-defined virtual <b>guiding</b> <b>surfaces,</b> {{as well as providing}} some amplification of human power ("power assist"). Cobots make use of steerable nonholonomic joints to produce the <b>guiding</b> <b>surfaces</b> that aid the operator. This unique steering system, in place of powerful actuators, results in <b>guiding</b> <b>surfaces</b> that are smooth, frictionless, and intrinsically stable [...] making cobots particularly appropriate for safety-critical tasks. In this paper we describe the basic concepts of cobots with reference to laboratory prototypes having two or three workspace dimensions. Early industrial application in automobile final assembly plants is underway, and two cobots presently in industrial environments are describe...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} and time variability {{of the total}} volume transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current through Drake Passage is a key climatic index, yet still uncertain. We processed ten years of TOPEX/Poseïdon data along two adjacent descending tracks in Drake Passage assuming (following Gille, 1994) that the surface current velocity has a profile structure of double Gaussian jets corresponding respectively to the Subantarctic Front (SAF) and the Polar Front (PF). We seek the location, width and intensity of each jet {{as a function of}} time. Results from the two tracks are coherent and show that the time evolution of the flows is well constrained, although the absolute magnitude of the flow is not. Robust conclusions can be drawn using correlations between parameters and spectral analysis of their time evolution. The two front locations are positively correlated (0. 68). When the SAF is farther south, it is also wider and has a larger <b>surface</b> <b>transport.</b> When the PF is farther south, it narrows with a smaller <b>surface</b> <b>transport.</b> The two widths are significantly negatively correlated (- 0. 58) and the maximum velocities are independent (0. 08). The <b>surface</b> <b>transports</b> associated with the SAF and PF are strongly anti-correlated (- 0. 98) so that the variance of total <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> is much smaller than the variance of the <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> of each individual front. Spectral peaks for SAF and PF <b>surface</b> <b>transports</b> are, in order of decreasing amplitude, less than 4 months, semi-annual, 2. 6 years and annual. The total <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> variations are distributed into two broad bands (less than 4 months-the most energetic-and from 0. 5 to 3 years) ...|$|R

Cutting force will be greater, which is bound to exacerbate {{the wear and tear}} of the machine tool guides. Therefore, new requirements of numerical control machine tool <b>guide</b> <b>surface</b> hardness are proposed. Using Laser surface heat treatment process to scan the <b>guide</b> <b>surface</b> of CNC Machine Tool, the guide can get high hardness hardened layer. After being casted iron HT 300 was heat treated by the laser, the microstructure is homogeneous, very fine martensite. Its Surface hardness can get to HV 832. The treatment enhances the surface abrasion resistance, scratch-resistant capacity.
