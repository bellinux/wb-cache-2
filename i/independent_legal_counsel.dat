40|$|The {{principle}} 'best {{interests of}} the child' has been expanded by the legal community {{in recent years to}} apply to any matter involving children in family law proceedings. The weight ascribed to this principle, however, has been diluted. In custody, access and child protection cases, evidence of which custodial arrangements are in a child's interests are often presented by adult parties in prolonged and costly proceedings. The judge makes an order which is intended to meet the child's "best interests", in the child's absence. This paper first examines the historical and theoretical justifications for children's rights in Canadian and international law and the "best interests" principle. Second, the concept of "legal representation for children" is explored, with specific reference to inconsistencies in the jurisprudence concerning the role of independent representation for children. This paper argues that to truly reflect a custodial or access arrangement made in the child's "best interests", it is imperative that the child's voice be heard by the court through <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>counsel</b> assigned to represent that child's individual needs and concerns...|$|E

40|$|A minor girl 2 ̆ 7 s {{decision}} {{about how to}} handle an unplanned pregnancy is a highly contested issue. Especially contentious is the minor 2 ̆ 7 s ability to consent to an abortion independently of an adult such as her parents or a judge. That issue has received substantial attention from policy makers, scholars, judges, and legislators. Almost no attention has been paid, however, to the decision of a pregnant minor to continue her pregnancy, relinquish her constitutionally protected parental rights, and place a child for adoption. In 37 states, a minor 2 ̆ 7 s abortion decision is regulated differently than an adult 2 ̆ 7 s, while in only 15 states is a minor 2 ̆ 7 s decision to relinquish parental rights and consent to adoption treated any differently from an adult 2 ̆ 7 s decision.
