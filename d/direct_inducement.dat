The tax collectors had access without payment of fee to the registers. The registration of births was discontinued when the Taxation Acts expired. An attempt to introduce the registration of births was made in 1753, but unsuccessfully. The public had the old superstitious dread of anything like a census. Moreover, the custom was denounced as [...] "French," [...] and therefore abominable. In {{the same way it}} was thought telling to call the cloture [...] "the French gag" [...] during some recent discussions of parliamentary rules. In 1783 the parish register was again made the instrument of taxation, and threepence was charged on every entry. Thus [...] "the clergyman was placed in the invidious light of a tax collector, and as the poor were often unable or unwilling to pay the tax, the clergy had a <b>direct</b> <b>inducement</b> to retain their good-will by keeping the registers defective." ...|$|E
40|$|Key words: tire hydroplaning; CFD; {{tire tread}} pattern; {{numerical}} simulation Abstract. Tire hydroplaning {{has become a}} <b>direct</b> <b>inducement</b> of wet-weather road accidents. The model of hydroplaning of the deformed rib tire with load was built {{with the help of}} CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) technology. The three-dimensional SST k ω − coupled with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model was applied to numerically simulate the air-water two phase flow with free surface in tire hydroplaning. Based on the model of hydroplaning, the design of tire pattern rib and lateral grooves on tire hydroplaning were analyzed. Analysis shows that tire has a high pressure induced by water impact in the front of footprint; water flow is inclined to tire sidewall. For the rib grooves, the depth of rib groove has a largest effect, followed by the rib groove width, finally the distance between the two rib grooves; for the lateral grooves, the structure factors sequence is:lateral grooves number> width> angle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{feedback}} {{is considered to}} be an important factor in perceptual learning (PL), its role is normally considered limited to facilitation, rather than <b>direct</b> <b>inducement,</b> of PL. Recent studies, however, have suggested feedback to be more actively involved in the inducement of PL. The current study demonstrates an even more significant role for feedback in PL: feedback can evoke PL of a feature without any bottom-up processing of that feature. We use a “fake feedback” method, in which the {{feedback is}} related to an arbitrarily chosen feature, rather than actual performance. We find evidence of PL with this fake feedback method both when the learned feature is absent from the visual stimulus (Experiment 1) and when it conflicts with the visual stimulus (Experiment 2). We call this “feedback-based PL,” in contrast with the classical “exposure-based PL. ” We find that feedback-based PL and exposure-based PL can occur independently of each other even while occurring in the same paradigm. These results suggest that feedback not only facilitates PL that is evoked by bottom-up information, but that it can directly induce PL, where such feedback-based PL occurs independently of exposure-based PL...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} {{politics}} and ideology {{on the one}} hand and art, or architecture in fact, on the other has often been thought of as a bad thing something that 'spoils' the art. This work, by using the example of Germany between the two World Wars, tries to represent art as an integrated part of all social, political, economic and historical movements in a society. In that light, Bauhaus and Nazi architecture are not seen as good or bad exceptions in the history of architecture, but as a natural course, the reasons and <b>direct</b> <b>inducements</b> of which can be traced in any part of a society. However, by that, the individual and irrational in art should not to be denied, but there should be put an accent on continuity of architectural thought and art before everything...|$|R

[...] It provided a mechanism for non-Indian claims against the signatory Ojibwe bands to be reviewed by a commission appointed by the President of the United States in consultation with the Ojibwe bands, and appropriated $100,000 to be used to pay claims of individuals (whites) for past Indian wrongs, while relieving the Red Lake Band and Pembina Band of the threat of [...] "punishment for past offenses". (Article 4). [...] It left the [...] "chiefs" [...] of two of the bands with [...] "reservations" [...] consisting of 640 acres (one square mile) each (Article 9) and provided other <b>direct</b> <b>inducements</b> to the [...] "chiefs" [...] in the form of direct cash payments (Article 5). [...] In lieu of annuity payments, it also provided for payment to the Métis or [...] "half-breed" [...] relatives of the Chippewa (Ojibwe) who were citizens of the United States the right to obtain scrip entitling the holder to claim [...] anywhere within the ceded territory or elsewhere that was opened up for homestead by the United States (Article 8).|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} has documented the large impact that automatic enrollment has on savings plan participation. All the companies examined in these studies, however, have combined automatic enrollment with an employer match. This {{raises a question}} about how effective automatic enrollment would be without a <b>direct</b> financial <b>inducement</b> not {{to opt out of}} participation. This paper's results suggest that the match has only a modest impact on opt-out rates. We estimate that moving from a typical matching structure - a match of 50 % up to 6 % of pay contributed - to no match would reduce participation under automatic enrollment at six months after plan eligibility by 5 to 11 percentage points. Our analysis includes a firm that switched from a match to a non-contingent employer contribution. This firm's experience suggests that non-contingent employer contributions only weakly crowd out employee participation. ...|$|R
40|$|The 2003 Tokachi-Oki Earthquake caused {{extensive}} ground collapses {{accompanied by}} slightly lateral displacement. subsidences, and lateral spreads of gentle slopes in the Kyowa area of Tanno Town, situated about 230 km {{away from the}} epicenter. The <b>direct</b> <b>inducement</b> of such slope movements was the liquefaction of the volcanic ash that had artificially covered the valley. Especially, at Locality No. 1 in the Kyowa area, liquefied volcanic ash of about 10, 000 m 3 spouted from the slope to the sides, and a wide farmland collapsed. Such large ground collapses caused by lateral jetting of the liquefied volcanic ash are new phenomena and new landslide disasters induced by the earthquake. The old landforms of the liquefied and moved area were narrow waste-filled valleys and swamps formerly utilized as paddy but these were converted into the gently-sloping farmland by the land fill of the volcanic ash. Though the field of similar landform transition and ground condition is large in number, it is characteristic that the slope movements caused by the liquefaction of volcanic ash were confined to the fields where the reclaimed planes tilted to the south or south-southwest. In addition to, the dip direction of the reclaimed planes coincided with {{the direction of the}} main lateral displacement of the surface in each liquefied area. The dip direction of the reclaimed planes might have brought about the geomorphic effect...|$|E
40|$|Bundling or {{converging}} infrastructure {{has been}} the leading principle for locating infrastructure since the mid seventies. It is assumed to offer certain advantages, such as a restriction of severance, consumption of free space and environmental hindrance. However, the concept of converging infrastructure has not always {{found its way to}} practise. In the Netherlands, less than 20 % of the railways and motorways are converged with any other type of major infrastructure. Even in new projects, a non-bundled location alternative is sometimes being preferred. A typical example is the High-Speed-Rail Project. This difference between theory and practise {{has been the}} <b>direct</b> <b>inducement</b> for this research. When converging infrastructure, {{there are a lot of}} physical construction possibilities. There are 4 criteria by which the construction type of the convergion can be described: (1) the types of infrastructure which are to be bundled, (2) the mutual position to each other, (3) the construction sequence and (4) te position of the bundle in its environment. Within each criterion, a number of discrete types can be derived. Although bundling has been an explicit principle in the planning and construction of new infrastructure since a few decades, infrastructure has been converged for several centuries. A convergion can originate from its own even when it has not been explicitly set out as a starting-point. This is also the case if several infrastructure lines are located using the same general location principles. If two or more lines ale located according to the principle of the direct or straigt line between two points, these lines will be converged automatically. This is essential, because the general location principles and conditions (internal, external and construction conditions) are converging conditions as well. Bundling infrastructure does not cause specific effects, but does have specific characteristics which can influence the extent of the effects. However it is not possible to define this extent exactly in general, because the environmental characteristics (which are variable) are an important factor as well. Nevertheless, converging infrastructure leads to a minor increase of environmental effects in comparison whith the construction of the new infrastructure line. On the other hand, converging infrastructure can cause a negative impact on the direct consumption of free space, the construction cost and flexibility of the infrastructure itself, and the safety aspects. These negative aspects can be solved by applying a suitable physical construction type. Generating of corridors is the only general effect of converging infrastructure. This effect should always be investigated by comparing it with the national policy. Trai...|$|E
60|$|The moral rules which forbid mankind to hurt {{one another}} (in {{which we must}} never forget to include {{wrongful}} interference with each other's freedom) are more vital to human well-being than any maxims, however important, which only point out the best mode of managing some department of human affairs. They have also the peculiarity, {{that they are the}} main element in determining the whole of the social feelings of mankind. It is their observance which alone preserves peace among human beings: if obedience to them were not the rule, and disobedience the exception, every one would see in every one else a probable enemy, against whom he must be perpetually guarding himself. What is hardly less important, these are the precepts which mankind have the strongest and the most <b>direct</b> <b>inducements</b> for impressing upon one another. By merely giving to each other prudential instruction or exhortation, they may gain, or think they gain, nothing: in inculcating on each other the duty of positive beneficence they have an unmistakeable interest, but far less in degree: a person may possibly not need the benefits of others; but he always needs that they should not do him hurt. Thus the moralities which protect every individual from being harmed by others, either directly or by being hindered in his freedom of pursuing his own good, are at once those which he himself has most at heart, and those which he has the strongest interest in publishing and enforcing by word and deed. It is by a person's observance of these, that his fitness to exist as one of the fellowship of human beings, is tested and decided; for on that depends his being a nuisance or not to those with whom he is in contact. Now it is these moralities primarily, which compose the obligations of justice. The most marked cases of injustice, and those which give the tone to the feeling of repugnance which characterizes the sentiment, are acts of wrongful aggression, or wrongful exercise of power over some one; the next are those which consist in wrongfully withholding from him something which is his due; in both cases, inflicting on him a positive hurt, either in the form of direct suffering, or of the privation of some good which he had reasonable ground, either of a physical or of a social kind, for counting upon.|$|R
40|$|Vortex flows {{produced}} by submersibles typically unfavorably influence key {{figures of merit}} such as acoustic and nonacoustic stealth, control effectiveness/maneuverability, and propulsor efficiency/body drag. Sources of such organized, primarily longitudinal, vorticity include the basic body (nose and sides) and appendages (both base/intersection and tip regions) such as the fairwater, dive planes, rear control surfaces, and propulsor stators/tips. Two fundamentally different vortex control approaches are available: (1) deintensification of the amplitude and/or organization of the vortex during its initiation process; and (2) downstream vortex disablement. Vortex control techniques applicable to the initiation region (deintensification approach) include transverse pressure gradient minimization via altered body cross section, appendage dillets, fillets, and sweep, and various appendage tip and spanload treatment along {{with the use of}} active controls to minimize control surface size and motions. Vortex disablement can be accomplished either via use of control vortices (which {{can also be used to}} steer the vortices off-board), <b>direct</b> unwinding, <b>inducement</b> of vortex bursting, or segmentation/tailoring for enhanced dissipation. Submersible-applicable vortex control technology is also included derived from various aeronautical applications such as mitigation of the wing wake vortex hazard and flight aircraft maneuverability at high angle of attack as well as the status of vortex effects upon, and mitigation of, nonlinear control forces on submersibles. Specific suggestions for submersible-applicable vortex control techniques are presented...|$|R
6000|$|If a {{woman does}} not wish to be dealt with as a half-hearted murderess she should not behave like one. It should also be {{punishable}} {{on the part of a}} mother to leave children below a certain age alone for longer than a certain interval. It is absurd to punish people as we do, for the injuries inflicted by them upon their children during uncontrollable anger, and not to punish them for the injuries inflicted by uncontrolled carelessness. Such legislation should ensure children space, air and attention. [Footnote: It is less within the range of commonly grasped ideas, it is therefore less within the range of practical expedients, to point out that a graduated scale of building regulation might be contrived for use in different localities. Districts could be classed in grades determined by the position of each district in the scale of infant mortality, and in those in which the rate was highest the hygienic standard could be made most stringent and onerous upon the house owner. This would force up the price of house- room, and that would force up the price of labour, and this would give the proprietors of unwholesome industries a personal interest in hygienic conditions about them. It would also tend to force population out of districts intrinsically unhealthy into districts intrinsically healthy. The statistics of low-grade districts could be examined to discover the distinctive diseases which determine their lowness of grade, and if these were preventable diseases they could be controlled by special regulations. A further extension of these principles might be made. <b>Direct</b> <b>inducements</b> to attract the high birth-rates towards exceptionally healthy districts could be contrived by a differential rating of sound families with children in such districts, the burthen of heavy rates could be thrown upon silly and selfish landowners who attempted to stifle sound populations by using highly habitable areas as golf links, private parks, game preserves, and the like, and public- spirited people could combine to facilitate communications that would render life in such districts compatible with industrial occupation. Such deliberate redistribution of population as this differential treatment of districts involves, is, however, quite beyond the available power and intelligence of our public control at present, and I suggest it here as something that our grandchildren perhaps may begin to consider. But if in the obscurity of this footnote I may let myself go, I would point out that, in the future, a time may come when locomotion will be so swift and convenient and cheap that it will be unnecessary to spread out the homes of our great communities where the industrial and trading centres are gathered together; it will be unnecessary for each district to sustain the renewal and increase of its own population. Certain wide regions will become specifically administrative and central--the home lands, the mother lands, the centres of education and population, and others will become specifically fields of action. Something of this kind is to a slight degree already the case with Scotland, which sends out its hardy and capable sons wherever the world has need of them; the Swiss mountains, too, send their sons far and wide in the world; and on the other hand, with regard to certain elements of population, at any rate, London and the Gold Coast and, I suspect, some regions in the United States of America, receive to consume.] ...|$|R
