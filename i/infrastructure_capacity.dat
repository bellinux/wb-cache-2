25|$|Indian retail has {{experienced}} limited growth, and its spoilage of food harvest is amongst {{the highest in}} the world, because of very limited integrated cold-chain and other infrastructure. India has only 5386 stand-alone cold storages, having a total capacity of 23.6 million metric tons. However, 80 percent of this storage is used only for potatoes. The remaining <b>infrastructure</b> <b>capacity</b> is less than 1% of the annual farm output of India, and grossly inadequate during peak harvest seasons. This leads to about 30% losses in certain perishable agricultural output in India, on average, every year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To operate {{effectively}} {{the public}} health system requires <b>infrastructure</b> and the <b>capacity</b> to act. Public health's ability to attract funding for <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>capacity</b> development would be enhanced if {{it was able to}} demonstrate what level of capacity was required to ensure a high performing system. Australia's public health activities are undertaken within a complex organizational framework that involves three levels of government and a diverse range of other organizations. The question of appropriate levels of <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>capacity</b> is critical at each level. Comparatively little is known about <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>capacity</b> at the local level. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with senior managers in two Australian states with different frameworks for health administration. They were asked to reflect on the critical components of <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>capacity</b> required at the local level. The interviews were analyzed to identify the major themes. Workshops with public health experts explored this data further. The information generated was used to develop a tool, designed to be used by groups of organizations within discrete geographical locations to assess local public health capacity. Results Local actors in these two different systems pointed to similar areas for inclusion for the development of an instrument to map public health capacity at the local level. The tool asks respondents to consider resources, programs and the cultural environment within their organization. It also asks about the policy environment - recognizing that the broader environment within which organizations operate impacts on their capacity to act. Pilot testing of the tool pointed to some of the challenges involved in such an exercise, particularly if the tool were to be adopted as policy. Conclusion This research indicates {{that it is possible to}} develop a tool for the systematic assessment of public health capacity at the local level. Piloting the tool revealed some concerns amongst participants, particularly about how the tool would be used. However there was also recognition that the areas covered by the tool were those considered relevant. </p...|$|R
