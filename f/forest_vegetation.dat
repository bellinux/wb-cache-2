5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural <b>forest</b> <b>vegetation</b> has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
5|$|The kakapo {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the <b>forest</b> <b>vegetation</b> which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.|$|E

40|$|Linear {{landscape}} elements, such {{as those}} colonized by roadside vegetation maintained by regular mowing, are recognized as key habitats for semi-natural grassland plant species. This study aimed {{to find out whether}} <b>forest</b> edge <b>vegetation</b> along roads mowed twice a year could be comparable to those of semi-natural grassland by focusing on compositions of grassland plant species classifled by several plant traits like flowering season. A total of 37 typical grassland species were recorded and 27 Species among them occurred in the <b>forest</b> edge <b>vegetation</b> along roads. The average grassland species richness and the abundance of early summer and summer flowering grassland species were significantly lower in the <b>forest</b> edge <b>vegetation</b> than semi-natural grassland.

25|$|Basenjis {{share many}} unique traits with pariah dog types. Basenjis, like dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs {{and some other}} breeds of dog, come into estrus only once annually—as {{compared}} to other dog breeds, which may have two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingoes and Basenji lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait {{is the result of}} selecting against dogs that frequently bark—in the traditional Central African context—because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the Basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the Congo Basin, where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth <b>forest</b> <b>vegetation).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the small}} colony sizes, P. alternata have limited {{capability}} to defend the nests. Thus, the Black hover wasp construct nests {{in such a way}} to blend in with the <b>forest</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The camouflaged nests help reduce predation by serving as the major line of defense. The foundress responsible for making the nest searches for the materials and builds the nest, though some have already been built. The two major types of nests are the hanging nests and the flat-topped nests. [...] The hanging nests are slender in shape in comparison to the flat-topped nests that are more stout and oval-shaped. The hanging nests provide a protective screen that potentially block predators. P. alternata utilize both organic and inorganic materials. The inorganic materials vary based on region but demonstrates the use of man-made materials. The organic composite materials of the nests include a mixture of mud, sand, and plant hairs. These materials contribute to the pale brown color of the nests allowing them to blend in with surrounding trees and plants.|$|E
