[...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her.

2500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{begins with}} Meno asking Socrates {{to tell him}} if virtue can be taught.

[...] Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men—free or slaves. Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings.|$|E

[...] However, Turan explained that [...] "no one should see No Country for Old Men underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and McCarthy {{are not interested in}} violence for its own sake, but for what it says about {{the world we live in}} ...

[...] He also collected a half-century against Hampshire, although he was still yet to register a century in either domestic cricket or any form of the international game since that Trent Bridge instalment of the last home Ashes in 2005, which year also accounted for his most recent Test five-for. [...] "It's always been an Australian trait to over-rate players who have done well against them (just ask VVS Laxman)," [...] wrote Lawrence Booth. [...] "But {{in the case of}} Andrew Flintoff, this phenomenon is getting so out of control you wonder whether Steve Waugh has returned to orchestrate a cunning mind-game. In any case, <b>does</b> <b>anyone</b> honestly think a player with his fitness record will make it through a five-Test series condensed into less than seven weeks?" [...] Flintoff did offer some hope with the willow in the Twenty20 Cup, however, hitting 93 off 41 balls for Lancashire against Derbyshire in June.|$|E

2500|$|Early church commentaries {{are mixed}} with regard {{to whether or not}} Paul intends to condemn all {{homosexuality}} in these verses. Contemporary English translations imply that Rom 1:26b condemns lesbian sex, while 1:27 condemns sex between men. [...] However, several early church writers clearly state that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. [...] Brooten cites both Anastasios and Augustine as explicitly rejecting the 'lesbian hypothesis' (p.337). [...] Hanks asserts that [...] "not until John Chrysostom (ca 400 CE) <b>does</b> <b>anyone</b> (mis)interpret Romans 1:26 as referring to relations between two women" [...] (p.90). Townsley notes that other early writers, possibly including Chrysostom, reject the 'lesbian' hypothesis, specifically, Ambrosiaster, Didymus the Blind and Clement of Alexandria. Townsley goes on to specify the context of Rom 1:26-27 as the continuation of Paul's condemnation of the worship of pagan gods from earlier in the chapter, linking the 'homosexuality' implied in Rom 1:27 to the practice of temple prostitution with castrated priests of Cybele, practices condemned more explicitly in the Old Testament (1 Kings 15:12, 2 Kings 23:7), the same religious group that violently attacked Paul in Ephesus, driving him from the city (Acts 19). [...] The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Rom 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{focus of}} {{literary}} culture within Birmingham is the Tindal Street Press, which {{grew out of}} a Balsall Heath-based group of writers in 1998. The city's most notable publisher of literary fiction, Tindal Street Press has built a remarkable record of bringing West Midlands writers to wider attention: of the 48 titles published in its first ten years, 12 were nominated for one or more national or international prizes. Astonishing Splashes of Colour was the first novel by Quinton-based music teacher Clare Morrall. Set in Birmingham and featuring a lead character with synesthesia, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, and subsequently translated into twelve languages, becoming Tindal Street's bestselling title. The Birmingham area also provides settings for several of Morrall's subsequent novels, including 2008's The Language of Others , and 2012's The Roundabout Man. In 2007 Tindal Street published What Was Lost, the debut novel by Hall Green shopworker Catherine O'Flynn. Part ghost story and part mystery, it used the story of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl from a Birmingham shopping centre to illustrate the changes in an industrial community over two decades, being nominated for both the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007, and winning the first novel award at the 2007 Costa Book Awards. O'Flynn's 2010 second novel The News Where You Are led Fay Weldon to describe her as the [...] "J. G. Ballard of Birmingham", noting how O'Flynn [...] "deals with her particular city, finding poetry and meaning where others see merely boredom and dereliction ... as if the lonely dead of the city's past and present were determined to be heard". Other local writers who've seen notable success with Tindal Street include the Edgbaston-based social worker Gaynor Arnold and the Black Country writers Raphael Selbourne and Anthony Cartwright. The impact of Tindal Street on promoting the city's writers was summed up by The Observer in 2008: [...] "The company has an ability to mine local talent, even when their authors' biographies don't ooze glamour ... There are aspiring authors all over the country writing stories between night shifts, but only in Birmingham, it seems, <b>does</b> <b>anyone</b> pay attention." ...|$|E
