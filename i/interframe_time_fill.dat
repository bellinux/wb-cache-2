40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} a number of widely used ductile polymers has been investigated in compression at strain rates of ca. 2. 5 x 103 s- 1, both at room temperature (ca. 300 K) and at liquid nitrogen temperatures (ca. 100 K). A direct impact Hopkinson bar (DIHB) was used to measure the polymer stress-strain curves at this strain rate at both temperatures. High-speed photography (<b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> 7 µs) was a major tool in determining the fracture strain at both temperatures, particularly for those polymers that had such large failure strains that they did not fail within the time window of the DIHB (285 µs) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose and {{investigate}} {{the performance of a}} multi-channel scheduling algorithm based on the well-known deficit round-robin (DRR), which we call multi-channel DRR (MCDRR). We extend the original DRR to the case of multiple channels with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers to provide efficient fair queueing in hybrid time division multiplexing (TDM) /wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. We take into account the availability of channels and tunable transmitters in extending the DRR and allow the overlap of `rounds' in scheduling to efficiently utilize channels and tunable transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed MCDRR can provide nearly perfect fairness with ill-behaved flows for different sets of conditions for <b>interframe</b> <b>times</b> and frame sizes in hybrid TDM/WDM optical networks with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the time-resolved analysis of high-speed sequences of particle images is presented. The proposed method aims at the minimization of PIV {{errors in the}} lower velocity range by adjusting locally and dynamically the <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> interval of the PIV pairs in a recorded high-speed sequence. The algorithm performs the operation on a local basis, thus providing {{the same level of}} accuracy across the full velocity dynamic range of the flow. The present results indicate a greater performance than state-of-the-art PIV analysis based on multi-grid offset PIV and is successfully applied to synthetic and real flow cases. Figure 1 shows the application of the adaptive multi-frame PIV (AMF-PIV) algorithm to a cross-flow jet.

40|$|The {{advances}} in high-voltage switching developed {{in this project}} allow a camera user to rapidly vary the number of output frames from 1 to 25. A high-voltage, variable-amplitude pulse train shifts the deflection location to the new frame location during the interlude between frames, making multiple frame counts and locations possible. The final deflection circuit deflects to five different frame positions per axis, including the center position, making {{for a total of}} 25 frames. To create the preset voltages, electronically adjustable {+-} 500 V power supplies were chosen. Digital-to-analog converters provide digital control of the supplies. The power supplies are clamped to {+-} 400 V so as not to exceed the voltage ratings of the transistors. A field-programmable gated array (FPGA) receives the trigger signal and calculates the combination of plate voltages for each frame. The <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> and number of frames are specified by the user, but are limited by the camera electronics. The variable-frame circuit shifts the plate voltages of the first frame to those of the second frame during the user-specified <b>interframe</b> <b>time.</b> Designed around an electrostatic image tube, a framing camera images the light present during each frame (at the photocathode) onto the tube’s phosphor. The phosphor persistence allows the camera to display multiple frames on the phosphor at one time. During this persistence, a CCD camera is triggered and the analog image is collected digitally. The tube functions by converting photons to electrons at the negatively charged photocathode. The electrons move quickly toward the more positive charge of the phosphor. Two sets of deflection plates skew the electron’s path in horizontal and vertical (x axis and y axis, respectively) directions. Hence, each frame’s electrons bombard the phosphor surface at a controlled location defined by the voltages on the deflection plates. To prevent the phosphor from being exposed between frames, the image tube is gated off between exposures...|$|R
30|$|The working {{principle}} of this HFD-MAC {{is based on}} the distributed coordination function (DCF) in IEEE 802.11. This protocol uses CSMA/CA and a back-off mechanism to access the channel and to avoid collisions. For simplicity, the DCF <b>interframe</b> space (DIFS) <b>time</b> and back-off time are not shown in the figures, but the short <b>interframe</b> space (SIFS) <b>time</b> is shown by “S” in all of the figures. In this MAC, a node ignores collisions or the reception of erroneous packets during the NAV period. Moreover, it is assumed that FDNs can perform self-interference cancelation perfectly.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years several {{observations}} have been made of compressive failure in glass by a so called fracture wave. A high-speed photographic study has been conducted in order to observe the propagation of fracture waves in glass. Streak and framing photography have been used to determine details of the wave speed and surface structure of fracture waves induced in glasses by planar impact. A 50 mm single stage gas gun was used to launch copper flyer plates at velocities of up to 1 km s- 1. A computer controlled high-speed camera was used capable of exposure and <b>interframe</b> <b>times</b> from 50 ns upwards. Simultaneous measurements of the longitudinal stresses were made using manganin pressure gauges embedded in the samples. Results will be presented showing separation between the shock and fracture fronts suggesting that the failure mechanism is by compression rather than resulting from relief waves propagating from the free surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The short pulse duration, small {{effective}} source {{size and}} high flux of synchrotron radiation is ideally suited for probing {{a wide range}} of transient deformation processes in materials under extreme conditions. In this paper, the challenges of high-resolution time-resolved indirect X-ray detection are reviewed in the context of dynamic synchrotron experiments. In particular, the discussion is targeted at two-dimensional integrating detector methods, such as those focused on dynamic radiography and diffraction experiments. The response of a scintillator to periodic synchrotron X-ray excitation is modelled and validated against experimental data collected at the Diamond Light Source (DLS) and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). An upper bound on the dynamic range accessible in a time-resolved experiment for a given bunch separation is calculated for a range of scintillators. New bunch structures are suggested for DLS and ESRF using the highest-performing commercially available crystal LYSO:Ce, allowing time-resolved experiments with an <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> of 189 ?ns and a maximum dynamic range of 98 (6. 6 bits) ...|$|R

40|$|The resin flow {{behavior}} in the vacuum assisted resin infusion molding process (VARI) of foam sandwich composites was studied by both visualization flow experiments and computer simulation. Both experimental and simulation results show that: the distribution medium (DM) leads to a shorter molding <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> in grooved foam sandwich composites via the VARI process, and the mold <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> is linearly reduced {{with the increase of}} the ratio of DM/Preform. Patterns of the resin sources have a significant influence on the resin <b>filling</b> <b>time.</b> The <b>filling</b> <b>time</b> of center source is shorter than that of edge pattern.

40|$|International audienceSilicon carbide {{ceramics}} {{are generally}} used in armour configurations for the foot-soldier or military vehicles. However, their behaviour during impact {{is not fully}} understood. In this work, the dynamic fragmentation of silicon carbide has been characterised through different impact configurations: Edge-on impact tests and normal impact tests have been conducted in open and sarcophagus configuration. In the first configuration, an ultra-high speed camera is used to visualise the fragmentation process with an <b>interframe</b> <b>time</b> set to 1 pis. The sarcophagus configuration provides a post-mortem view of the damage pattern. Moreover, a comparison with numerical results given by an anisotropic damage model shows a good capacity to predict the damage patterns and the cracking densities of the ceramic after impact but also the damage kinetics observed during impact. In addition, an original impact configuration is proposed for characterising the dynamic behaviour of a pre-fragmented ceramic. The tests have been compared to experiments performed with a plane aluminium alloy target. The results underline the good penetration resistance of the fragmented ceramic...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} introduces tomographic shadowgraphy, {{a volume}} resolving imaging technique which {{is capable of}} recovering the liquid phase of a spray both spatially and temporally. The method {{is based on a}} multiple view camera setup with inline illumination provided by current pulsed LEDs which results in droplet shadows being projected onto the sensor plane. Each camera records image pairs with short <b>interframing</b> <b>times</b> which allows the trajectories of the individual droplets to be estimated using conventional three-dimensional particle tracking approaches. The observed volume is calibrated with a traversed micro target. A comparison is made between several photogrammetric and polynomial least square camera calibration techniques regarding their accuracy in deep volume calibration at magnifications close to unity. A calibration method based on volume calibration from multiple planar homographies at equally spaced z-planes was found to produce the most reliable calibration. Sequential combination of back-projected images at each voxel plane efficiently reproduces the droplet positions in three-dimensional space. The quality of spray reconstruction is investigated using experimental data from multiple view shadowgraphs of a hollow cone spray...|$|R
