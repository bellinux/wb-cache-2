There is an upper {{limit on the}} amount of DNA that can be packed into a phage (a maximum of 53 kb), {{therefore}} to allow foreign DNA to be inserted into phage DNA, phage cloning vectors may need to have some non-essential genes deleted, for example the genes for lysogeny since using phage λ as a cloning vector involves only the lytic cycle. [...] There are two kinds of λ phage vectors - <b>insertion</b> <b>vector</b> and replacement vector. Insertion vectors contain a unique cleavage site whereby foreign DNA with size of 5-11 kb may be inserted. In replacement vectors, the cleavage sites flank a region containing genes not essential for the lytic cycle, and this region may be deleted and replaced by the DNA insert in the cloning process, and a larger sized DNA of 8-24 kb may be inserted.|$|E
40|$|Gene {{targeting}} {{has been}} used to direct mutations into specific chromosomal loci in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The altered locus can be studied in vivo with chimeras and, if the mutated cells contribute to the germ line, in their offspring. Although homologous recombination is the basis for the widely used gene targeting techniques, to date, the mechanism of homologous recombination between a vector and the chromosomal target in mammalian cells is essentially unknown. Here we look at the nature of gene targeting in ES cells by comparing an <b>insertion</b> <b>vector</b> with replacement vectors that target hprt. We found that the <b>insertion</b> <b>vector</b> targeted up to ninefold more frequently than a replacement vector with the same length of homologous sequence. We also observed that the majority of clones targeted with replacement vectors did not recombine as predicted. Analysis of the recombinant structures showed that the external heterologous sequences were often incorporated into the target locus. This observation can be explained by either single reciprocal recombination (vector insertion) of a recircularized vector or double reciprocal recombination/gene conversion (gene replacement) of a vector concatemer. Thus, single reciprocal recombination of an <b>insertion</b> <b>vector</b> occurs 92 -fold more frequently than double reciprocal recombination of a replacement vector with crossover junctions on both the long and short arms...|$|E
40|$|Recombination of an <b>insertion</b> <b>vector</b> {{into its}} {{chromosomal}} homologue {{is a conservative}} event in that both the chromosomal and the vector sequences are preserved. However, gene conversion may accompany homologous recombination of an <b>insertion</b> <b>vector.</b> To examine gene conversion in more detail we have determined the targeting frequencies {{and the structure of}} the recombinant alleles generated with a series of vectors which target the hprt gene in embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that gene conversion of the introduced mutation does not significantly limit homologous recombination and that gene conversion occurs without a sequence specific bias for five different mutations. The frequency of the loss of a vector mutation and the gain of a chromosomal sequence is inversely proportional to the distance between the vector mutation and the double-strand break. The loss of a chromosomal sequence and the gain of a vector mutation occurs at a low frequency...|$|E

40|$|The mu and delta {{immunoglobulin}} heavy-chain genes {{comprise a}} complex transcriptional unit {{in which a}} single mRNA precursor gives rise to mu- and delta-specific transcripts. During the immature B-cell stage, posttranscriptional processing events involving alternate splicing and cleavage-polyadenylation site selection give rise to mu- but not delta-encoding transcripts. In terminally differentiated B cells, delta mRNA is not synthesized because of a transcription termination event occurring upstream of the delta-gene locus. In an attempt to gain insight into the respective contributions of alternate splicing and cleavage-polyadenylation in the control of delta mRNA synthesis, we have constructed a set of plasmids in which membrane mu (mu m) -delta intergenic sequences containing the mu m poly(A) site but differing in splicing capacity were inserted in between a VH and delta gene. The mu m-delta <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> were transfected into a B lymphoma line representative of an immature stage, and proximal mu m poly(A) site usage and delta mRNA synthesis were assessed. To determine unequivocally whether the mu m-delta intergenic region can regulate termination, the <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> were also transfected into a B myeloma line, and transcription through the region was measured. In immature B-cell transfectants, splicing site selection {{was found to have}} a key role in determining poly(A) site utilization and concomitant delta mRNA expression. Mature delta mRNA synthesis was blocked by an upstream cleavage-polyadenylation event only when the proximal poly(A) site was associated with appropriate splicing signals. Furthermore, in vitro transcription assays revealed that the mu m-delta intergenic region is sufficient to regulate transcription termination within a 1, 2430 -base-pair region containing the mu m poly(A) site in myeloma transfectants.

However, the ratio of the targeting frequencies exhibited by the different vector configurations differed for the two loci. When the fgr vector was linearized as an <b>insertion</b> <b>vector,</b> the ratio of targeted to random integrations was four- to eightfold greater than when the vector was linearized as a replacement vector. By contrast, the ratio of targeted to random integrations at the fah locus did not vary with the linearization site of the vector. The different relationships between the targeting frequency and the vector configuration at the fgr and fah loci may indicate a DNA sequence or chromatin structure preference for different targeting pathways...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a host-vector system for heterologous expression in Streptococcus gordonii (Sg) Challis (formerly Streptococcus sanguis), a commensal bacterium of the human oral cavity. The system is based on (i) integration of plasmid insertion vectors into the chromosome of specially engineered recipient hosts, and (ii) {{the use of the}} M 6 -protein-encoding gene (emm 6) as a partner for construction of translational gene fusions. M 6 is a streptococcal surface protein already proven useful as a fusion partner for the delivery of foreign antigens to the surface of Sg [Pozzi et al., Infect. Immun. 60 (1992) 1902 - 1907].

Simple <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> were constructed from single mariner elements into which exogenous DNA ranging in size from 1. 3 to 4. 5 kb had been inserted; composite vectors were constructed with partial or complete duplications of mariner flanking the exogenous DNA. All of the simple <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> showed levels of somatic and germline excision that were at least 100 -fold lower than the baseline level of uninterrupted mariner elements. Although composite vectors with inverted duplications were unable to be mobilized at detectable frequencies, vectors with large direct duplications of mariner could be mobilized. A vector consisting of two virtually complete elements flanking exogenous DNA yielded a frequency of somatic eye-color mosaicism of approximately 10 % and a frequency of germline excision of 0. 04 %. These values are far smaller than those observed for uninterrupted elements.

40|$|Mutations were {{targeted}} to the Hprt locus of mouse embryo-derived stem cells by using 22 different sequence replacement and sequence <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors.</b> The targeting frequency was examined at two sites within the Hprt locus {{as a function}} of the extent of homology between the targeting vector and the target locus. The targeting frequency was also compared by using vectors prepared from isogenic and nonisogenic DNA sources. With one exception, all of the vectors showed the same exponential dependence of targeting efficiency on the extent of homology between the targeting vector and the target locus. This was true regardless of whether they were sequence replacement or sequence <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors,</b> whether they were directed toward either of the two different sites within the Hprt locus, or whether they were prepared from isogenic or nonisogenic DNA sources. Vectors prepared from isogenic DNA targeted four to five times more efficiently than did the corresponding vectors prepared from nonisogenic DNA. The single case of unexpectedly low targeting efficiency involved one of the vectors prepared from nonisogenic DNA and could be attributed to an unfavorable distribution of heterology between the Hprt sequences present in the targeting vector and the endogenous Hprt gene.

40|$|Gene {{targeting}} using sequence <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> generally {{results in}} integration of one {{copy of the}} targeting vector generating a tandem duplication of the cognate chromosomal region of homology. However, occasionally the target locus is found to contain > 1 copy of the integrated vector. The mechanism by which the latter recombinants arise is not known. In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis by which multiple vectors become integrated at the chromosomal immunoglobulin mu locus in a murine hybridoma. To accomplish this, specially designed <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> were constructed that included six diagnostic restriction enzyme markers in the Cmu region of homology to the target chromosomal mu locus. This enabled contributions by the vector-borne and chromosomal Cmu sequences at the recombinant locus to be ascertained. Targeted recombinants were isolated and analyzed {{to determine the number}} of vector copies integrated at the chromosomal immunoglobulin mu locus. Targeted recombinants identified as bearing > 1 copy of the integrated vector resulted from a Cmu triplication formed by two vector copies in tandem. Examination of the fate of the Cmu region markers suggested that this class of recombinant was generated predominantly, if not exclusively, by two targeted vector integration events, each involving insertion of a single copy of the <b>vector.</b> Both <b>vector</b> <b>insertion</b> events into the chromosomal mu locus were consistent with the double-strand-break repair mechanism of homologous recombination.

Integration occurred either by double or by single crossover, and the integrated DNA segment was shown to be highly stable.

Transplastomic lines were obtained after introduction of pJS 75 DNA into leaf cells by the biolistic process and selection for the spectinomycin resistance marker.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{mechanism}} of double-strand-break (DSB) repair during gene targeting at the chromosomal immunoglobulin mu-locus in a murine hybridoma was examined. The gene-targeting assay utilized specially designed <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> genetically marked {{in the region of}} homology to the chromosomal mu-locus by six diagnostic restriction enzyme site markers. The restriction enzyme markers permitted the contribution of vector-borne and chromosomal mu-sequences in the recombinant product to be determined. The use of the <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> in conjunction with a plating procedure in which individual integrative homologous recombination events were retained for analysis revealed several important features about the mammalian DSB repair process:The presence of the markers within the region of shared homology did not affect the efficiency of gene targeting. In the majority of recombinants, the vector-borne marker proximal to the DSB was absent, being replaced with the corresponding chromosomal restriction enzyme site. This result is consistent with either formation and repair of a vector-borne gap or an "end" bias in mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) that favored the chromosomal sequence. Formation of hDNA was frequently associated with gene targeting and, in most cases, began approximately 645 bp from the DSB and could encompass a distance of at least 1469 bp. The hDNA was efficiently repaired prior to DNA replication. The repair of adjacent mismatches in hDNA occurred predominantly on the same strand, suggesting the involvement of a long-patch repair mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{targeting}} is {{a powerful}} technique for manipulating the human genome, but few studies have directly compared the targeting frequencies of various types of vector constructs. Here we show that similar targeting constructs are able to insert nucleotides at the homologous chromosomal target locus more efficiently than they can delete nucleotides, and combination insertion/deletion vectors appear to target at intermediate frequencies. This holds true for deletions ranging from 1 to 334 bp and insertions ranging from 1 to 1332 bp. In addition, vectors designed to inactivate the human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRT) by deleting nucleotides often produced rearrangements at the target locus {{that in many cases}} were due to insertions of multimerized vector constructs, effectively converting a deletion vector into an <b>insertion</b> <b>vector.</b> These findings were obtained when adeno-associated virus vectors were used to efficiently deliver single-stranded DNA targeting constructs, but the same phenomenon was also observed when transfecting linearized double-stranded plasmids.

To overcome this problem, we have developed integration vectors, which will allow researchers to introduce genes into two different nonessential regions of the Xf chromosome. The first set of vectors, the pAX 1 series, contains an antibiotic resistant gene and a multiple cloning site (MCS) flanked by sequences homologous to the intergenic region between two divergently transcribed genes PD 0702 and PD 0703.

Viruses were injected intracerebrally into the right cortex of C 57 /BL/ 6 suckling mice. After infection mice inoculated with the CAM/RB strain developed hind limb paralysis and ataxia. Clinical symptoms were never observed with an equivalent dose of Edtag virus or in sham infections. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect viral antigen in formalin-fixed brain sections. Measles antigen was observed in neurons and neuronal processes of the hippocampus, frontal, temporal, and olfactory cortices and neostriatum on both sides of symmetrical structures.

While these mutant collections have greatly facilitated genome-wide studies, mutations in essential genes are not present, and the roles of these genes are not as easily studied. To further support genome-scale research in S. pombe, we generated a barcode-tagged fission yeast insertion mutant library that has the potential of generating viable mutations in both essential and non-essential genes and can be easily analyzed using standard molecular biological techniques. Results An <b>insertion</b> <b>vector</b> containing a selectable ura 4 + marker and a random barcode was used to generate a collection of 10, 000 fission yeast insertion mutants stored individually in 384 -well plates and as six pools of mixed mutants. Individual barcodes are flanked by Sfi I recognition sites and can be oligomerized in a unique orientation to facilitate barcode sequencing. Independent genetic screens on a subset of mutants suggest that this library contains a diverse collection of single insertion mutations. We present several approaches to determine insertion sites. Conclusions This collection of S. pombe barcode-tagged insertion mutants is well-suited for genome-wide studies. Because insertion mutations may eliminate, reduce or alter the function of essential and non-essential genes, this library will contain strains with a wide range of phenotypes that can be assayed by their associated barcodes. The design of the barcodes in this library allows for barcode sequencing using next generation or standard benchtop cloning approaches. </p...|$|E
40|$|Vector-associated {{side effects}} in {{clinical}} gene therapy have provided {{insights into the}} molecular mechanisms of hematopoietic regulation in vivo. Surprisingly, many retrovirus insertion sites (RIS) present in engrafted cells {{have been found to}} cluster nonrandomly in close association with specific genes. Our data demonstrate that these genes directly influence the in vivo fate of hematopoietic cell clones. Analysis of insertions thus far has been limited to individual clinical studies. Here, we studied > 7, 000 insertions retrieved from various studies. More than 40 % of all insertions found in engrafted gene-modified cells were clustered in the same genomic areas covering only 0. 36 % of the genome. Gene classification analyses displayed significant overrepresentation of genes associated with hematopoietic functions and relevance for cell growth and survival in vivo. The similarity of insertion distributions indicates that <b>vector</b> <b>insertions</b> in repopulating cells cluster in predictable patterns. Thus, insertion analyses of preclinical in vitro and murine in vivo studies as well as <b>vector</b> <b>insertion</b> repertoires in clinical trials yielded concerted results and mark a small number of interesting genomic loci and genes that warrants further investigation of the biological consequences of <b>vector</b> <b>insertions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gene {{targeting}} {{was used}} to introduce nonselectable genetic changes into chromosomal loci in mouse embryo-derived stem cells. The nonselectable markers were linked to a selectable marker in both insertion- and replacement-type vectors, and {{the transfer of the}} two elements to the Hprt locus was assayed. When <b>insertion</b> <b>vectors</b> were used as substrates, the frequency of transfer was highly dependent upon the distance between the nonselectable marker and the double-strand break in the vector. A marker located close to the vector ends was frequently lost, suggesting that a double-strand gap repair activity is involved in vector integration. When replacement vectors were used, cotransfer of a selectable marker and a nonselectable marker 3 kb apart was over 50 %, suggesting that recombination between vector and target often occurs near the ends of the vector. To illustrate the use of replacement vectors to transfer specific mutations to the genome, we describe targeting of the AF 508 mutation to the CFTR gene in mouse embryo-derived stem cells. Gene targeting in mouse embryo-derived stem (ES) cells provides the means for generating mice of virtually any desired genotype (3, 4). Most applications of this technology have been directed at creating mice with mutations causing loss of function in the gene of interest. The loss of functio...|$|R

However, three cases of T cell lymphoproliferative disease have been identified almost 3 years after retrovirus gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immune deficiency. In two of these cases <b>vector</b> <b>insertion</b> into the LMO 2 locus was implicated in leukemogenesis, demonstrating that a more profound understanding is required of the genetic and molecular effects imposed on the host by vector integration or transgene expression. In vivo models to test for retro- and lentiviral vector safety prior to clinical application are therefore needed. Here we present a high incidence of lentiviral vector-associated tumorigenesis following in utero and neonatal gene transfer in mice. This system may provide a highly sensitive model to investigate integrating vector safety prior to clinical application...|$|R
