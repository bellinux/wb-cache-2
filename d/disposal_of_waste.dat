5|$|Waste {{management}} including sewage treatment, the linked {{processes of}} deforestation and soil degradation, {{and climate change}} or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, etc.|$|E
5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E

Introduction: The hygienic <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> household <b>wastes</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the greatest}} {{problems of the}} day. Inasmuch as they contain all of the excretions {{of the body and}} also garbage and refuse, and inasmuch as they may contain infections material, the safe and proper <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> is one <b>of</b> the first necessities of hygienic living. The health of the communities’ depends largely upon the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the refuse matter Death rates have been permanently lowered since the introduction of even fairly efficient <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes.</b> The dumping refuse upon vacant lots or around houses always leads to disease. Winds, animals, flies, and mosquitoes way become the carriers of disease. The waters are divided into three great classes. First, refuse, as ashes, dust, paper, rags and bottles.

Nagasaki prefecture established a 20 -year plan along with the municipalities for the wide range <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes.</b> The adequate locations as well as scale of incineration facilities were displayed in this plan. Later on most cities and towns began rational constructions of incineration facilities based on this plan. As a result, the number of incineration facilities in Nagasaki prefecture decreased from 60 facilities to 25 facilities in 10 years since 1999. According to calculations, the construction fee was cutback by approximately 68. 4 billion Yen...|$|R
25|$|A {{landfill}} site (also {{known as a}} tip, dump, rubbish dump, garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden) is a site for the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> materials by burial and the oldest form of waste treatment (although the burial part is modern; historically, refuse was just left in piles or thrown into pits). Historically, landfills {{have been the most}} common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington {{and started}} {{manufacturing}} soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt {{as a main}} raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from the manufacture of soda-ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce limebeds. This was a dangerous alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable.|$|E
25|$|Drilling also risks contaminating {{surface water}} and groundwater, which harms people {{drinking}} from those water sources. This contamination happens when hazardous chemicals from the drilling process leak into the water, when processing and refining the gas leave residue, and when <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> water nearby pollutes the land. These chemicals can be radioactive materials, methane, other gases, and carcinogenic chemicals. However, {{the industry has}} countered than this contamination {{is the result of}} bad practice and not of a bad industry.|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding the {{benefits}} accruing from sachet water production and consumption, the indiscriminate and improper <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> poses huge environmental problems. The study therefore identified factors responsible for indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sachet water <b>wastes</b> in Anambra State, Nigeria. Structured questionnaire {{were used to}} collect data from a sample of 161 respondents. Percentage, mean score, factor analysis, Pearson’s correlation matrix of interrelation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed for data analysis. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} shows attitude/behaviour (0. 620) and people’s ignorance of the effects (- 0. 532) as psychological factors responsible for indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sachet water <b>waste</b> while affordability (0. 562) and lack of recycling plants (0. 610) were economic factors responsible for indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sachet water <b>waste.</b> Attitude and need (80. 10 %) and environmental control (13. 24 %) were the two underlying dimensions used in explaining these factors which are responsible for indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sachet water <b>waste.</b> For proper and adequate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sachet water <b>wastes,</b> the study suggests public enlightenment campaigns aimed at helping people change their attitude about indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sachet water <b>waste...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{the high}} alpine country, plant {{communities}} are mostly meadows, herbs and shrubs with some scattered groves of foxtail pine and stunted whitebark pine. Trees often create krummholtz formations, or a stunted, deformed growth pattern characterized by branches closely hugging the ground. Talus slopes {{are home to}} small mammals such as pikas and yellow-bellied marmots. Birds such as gray-crowned rosy finches and American pipits, and sensitive amphibian species such as mountain yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite toads, feed on insects near alpine lakes and wetlands. Larger animals such as bears may venture into the alpine zone {{in search of food}} (a behavior now exacerbated by improper <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> by campers), but do not winter there.|$|E
25|$|The {{partners}} supplied {{their own}} tools; and {{were responsible for}} their upkeep. Many important responsibilities lay with the partners; thus, for instance, only two overseers were needed to manage more than 200 Leadhills’ miners. In {{the absence of an}} overseer’s constant and immediate personal supervision, the partners were totally responsible for their collective work practices and occupational safety; thus, the partners, rather than overseers, would decide how to act against threats posed by subterranean water, loose ground, earth tremors, etc. However, with no overseer, there was also no oversight; and, often, hastily constructed passages/shafts were misaligned with those of other teams, affecting the structure of the entire mine — also, the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and rubbish from one team’s work area often impeded the progress of another team (or teams).|$|E

2500|$|Minamata City {{established}} {{a system for}} certifying craftsmen who attach much importance to the environment in their production activities. This is called the Environment Master System, and commenced in fiscal 1998, before any other city in Japan. This {{is to improve the}} status and consciousness of craftsman and promote the creation of safe and sound commodities in consideration of environment and health, reflecting their experience with Minamata disease. In the first year, fiscal 1998, nine craftsmen engaged in the activities of paper making, and the production of tea leaves, bread, tangerine oranges, vegetables, rice or eggs were certified. In fiscal 1999, five craftsmen including a tatami-maker were additionally certified, making the current total of certified environmental masters fourteen. All of them produce products with confidence and pay careful attention to the environment in every part of their processes, including materials selection, production, processing, selling, and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> “Products produced by environmental masters” mean safe and sound products certified by the municipal office. For some time in the past, Minamata-made products were not favorably accepted on the market due to the bad image of the city. Nonetheless, people in Minamata have learned through experience the dreadfulness of environmental pollution and because of this, they can now produce truly safe and harmless products. Before the establishment of the master system, Minamata products were simply products produced with confidence by people who were particularly concerned about the environment. In the future, however, they will be traded as brand products produced by the renowned environmental masters of Minamata City. There are six qualification criteria to become an environmental master: ...|$|E
