50|$|<b>The</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Troyes threw <b>the</b> French in an uncomfortably humiliating position. To accept {{its terms}} meant that a {{defeated}} King of France could be coerced {{to hand over}} his kingdom to the enemy. To counter this act, the French developed <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inalienability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown. The succession is to be governed by <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> custom alone, rather than by <b>the</b> will <b>of</b> any person or body. This effectively removed the king's power to relinquish his kingdom, or disinherit <b>the</b> <b>heirs,</b> <b>the</b> princes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> From that moment the succession to the French throne was firmly entrenched in the Capetian lineage. As long as it continued to exist, the Estates cannot elect a new king. By this principle, the French do not consider Henry VI of England {{as one of their}} kings. Charles VII of France directly succeeded his father, not his nephew. Curiously, the French kings never asked the English monarchs to drop their nominal claim to France, which they persistently retained until 1800.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hardinge made a preconcerted signal, {{as soon as}} he came in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, that apprised its inmates of my arrival; and we knew, {{while still}} half a mile from the buildings, that the news had {{produced}} a great commotion. All the blacks met us on the little lawn--for the girls, since reaching womanhood, had made this change in the old door-yard--and I had to go through <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> shaking hands with every one of them. This was done amid hearty bursts <b>of</b> laughter, <b>the</b> mode in which <b>the</b> negroes <b>of</b> that day almost always betrayed their joy, and many a [...] "welcome home, Masser Mile!" [...] and [...] "where a Neb got to, dis time, Masser Mile?" [...] was asked by more than one; and great was the satisfaction, when I told his generation and race that the faithful fellow would be up with the cart that was to convey my luggage. But, Grace awaited me. I broke through the throng, and entered the house. In the door I was met by Chloe, a girl about my own sister's age, and a sort of cousin <b>of</b> Neb's by <b>the</b> half-blood, who had been preferred of late years to functions somewhat resembling those of a lady's maid. I say <b>of</b> <b>the</b> half-blood; for, to own <b>the</b> truth, few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York blacks, in that day, could have taken from their brothers and sisters, under <b>the</b> old dictum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common law, which declared that none but <b>heirs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>blood</b> should inherit. Chloe met me in the door-way, and greeted me with one of her sweetest smiles, as she curtsied, and really looked as pleased as all my slaves did, at seeing their young master again. How they touched my heart, at times, by their manner of talking about [...] "ole Masser, and ole Missus," [...] always subjects of regret among negroes who had been well treated by them. Metaphysicians may reason as subtly as they can about the races and colours, and on <b>the</b> aptitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black to acquire, but no one can ever persuade me out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belief <b>of</b> their extraordinary aptitude to love. As between themselves and their masters, their own children and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race to which they were subject, I have often seen instances which have partaken <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attachment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog to the human family; and cases in which <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> their masters have been preferred to those of their own flesh and blood, were of constant occurrence.|$|R
