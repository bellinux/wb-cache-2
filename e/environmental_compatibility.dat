The Department's staff with assistance from a geothermal resource technical committee and a consultant completed the following work tasks: assessment of available information on geothermal resources in Hawaii; promulgated the Administrative Rules on geothermal resource sub zones; assessment of geothermal resources in the State of Hawaii on a county-by-county basis; conducted impact analysis on social, economic, <b>environmental,</b> geologic hazards, <b>compatibility</b> to existing and planned land uses, and the relationship to other State and County programs.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{disadvantage of}} acrylic render vs. traditional rendering is that acrylic render lacks the sustainability and <b>environmental</b> <b>compatibility</b> of traditional cement-and-mineral render. All buildings have a finite lifetime, and their materials {{will eventually be}} either recycled or absorbed into the environment. Acrylic being a synthetic polymer material, it does not break down by natural weathering {{the way that a}} cement, sand, and lime mixture will, persisting in the natural environment for centuries as synthetic chemical compounds that have unknown long-term effects on ecosystems. Also, the application and drying process of acrylic resin render involves the atmospheric evaporation of pollutant solvents - necessary for the application of the resin - which are hazardous to the health of humans and of many organisms on which humans depend. Synthetic polymers such as acrylic are manufactured from chemical feedstocks such as acetone, hydrogen cyanide, ethylene, isobutylene, and other petroleum derivatives. The polymer products cannot be fully recycled (using present technology or any that can be confidently expected to be developed), so new raw materials, taken from the finite and diminishing supply of raw natural resources, must always be put into their manufacture, making the process unsustainable. Traditional cement-based render does not have these problems, making it an arguably better choice in many cases, despite its working limitations.|$|E

The focus is on feed-in tariffs (used in Germany, Spain, and France - for instance) and tradable green certificate (TGC) systems (United Kingdom and Italy, for instance). Considering economic theory and practical experience, the criteria for comparing these two alternatives are: cost-effectiveness, <b>environmental</b> effectiveness, and <b>compatibility</b> with market liberalisation. The paper argues that economic theory does not suggest a clear-cut advantage of one instrument over the other and it emphasises that, in any event, the choice of instrument depends on the relative importance attached to these criteria and on cultural factors such as faith - or lack thereof - in markets to help solve environmental problems. In this context, the paper questions the practical usefulness of a European-wide TGC system. Renewable energy sources; feed-in tariffs; green certificates...|$|R

National small-area analyses showed that in 2001 poor air quality was much more prevalent in socioeconomically deprived areas. We extend this social distribution of air quality analysis to consider how the distribution changed over the following decade (2001 - 2011), a period when significant efforts to meet EC air quality directive limits have been made, and air quality has improved. We find air quality improvement is greatest in the least deprived areas, whilst the most deprived areas bear a disproportionate and rising share of declining air quality including non-compliance with air quality standards.
