40|$|This {{document}} is the TRL 5 report according to Technology readiness level 5 (TRL- 5) Space Standard for the FP 7 MAGDRIVE project. According Space Standards the Technology readiness level 5 (TRL 5) shall be {{demonstrated by the}} delivery of a prototype whose performance has to be validated through testing in the relevant environment subject to scaling effects (if any). For a TRL 5 the level of maturity of the Breadboard to be provided shall be that of an Engineering model (EM). An EM is a full scale <b>high-fidelity</b> <b>unit</b> that demonstrates critical aspects of the engineering processes involved {{in the development of}} the operational unit. It has to be representative of the future operational system in form, fit and function, without full redundancy and high reliability parts. European Community's Seventh Framework Progra...|$|E
50|$|The Journal Company (owner of the Milwaukee Journal, {{which was}} {{consolidated}} with the Milwaukee Sentinel in 1995 {{to become the}} Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) was granted its first television station license in September 1931 for W9XD. The experimental station used a low-definition electromechanical system to transmit its signal, and conducted field tests from 1931 to 1933; in 1934, Journal converted W9XD's facilities to experimental <b>high-fidelity</b> apex radio <b>unit</b> W9XAZ in 1934. Its license was withdrawn by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1938 {{as part of an}} effort to limit broadcast licenses to stations that would actively engage in the development of television. No publicly announced television programming was broadcast by W9XD during this experimental period.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Adhesion {{phenomena}} {{are essential}} to many biological processes and to synthetic adhesives and manufac-tured coatings and composites. Supramolecular interactions are often implicated in various adhesion mechanisms. Recently, supramolecular building blocks, such as synthetic DNA base-pair mimics, have drawn attention {{in the context of}} molecular recognition, self-assembly, and supramolecular polymers. These reversible, hydrogen-bonding interactions have been studied extensively for their adhesive capabilities at the nano-and microscale, however, much less is known about their utility for practical adhesion in macroscopic systems. Herein, we report the preparation and evaluation of supramolecular coupling agents based on high-affinity, <b>high-fidelity</b> quadruple hydrogen-bonding <b>units</b> (e. g., DAN·DeUG, Kassoc = 10 8 M− 1 in chloroform). Macroscopic adhesion between polystyrene films and glass surfaces modified with 2, 7 -diamidonaphthyridin...|$|R
