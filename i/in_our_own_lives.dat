500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives?</b> Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

They are spaces of display in which objects are classified and arranged according to various needs: scientific, educational or historical. The philosopher Michel Foucault discusses how all cultures create heterotopias against which their “real sites” become unambiguous, clarified and legitimated. It is alongside these institutions that we emerge as subjects; that we come to place ourselves in a narrative and learn {{who we are and}} who we are not. By questioning the spaces with which we historicize ourselves and others, identify ourselves and others, and construct our very humanity with Cameron Bishop not only speaks of the fictions we create <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> real <b>lives,</b> outside the exhibition space, but those created on behalf of others...|$|R

We also need, as members of a democratic society, to keep ourselves informed {{and to be able to}} participate in and exert an influence upon the democratic process. Finally, we read and write for <b>our</b> <b>own</b> pleasure, growth and development. Since these abilities are understood to be so important, much attention is paid to them in schools, higher education, and in general public debate. Dyslexia is a well-known phenomenon and help and assistance is offered to pupils and students who experience difficulties with reading and writing. However, those who do not learn to read and write like other people have to work much harder and often with very little pay-off for their endeavours. This study investigates how people with reading and writing difficulties experience their difficulties and how they strive to overcome them. Nine persons, ranging in age from eight to 53, participated in the study over a period of 18 months. The main method of data production has been semi-structured interviews. The study has a phenomenological lifeworld approach, which indicates that subject and world are regarded an inseparable whole. Facticity, as it is understood in this study, is constituted by the world into which we are born, with its historical and cultural traditions, but also by the situation in which we find ourselves; as man or woman, poor or rich, young or old. We finally carry <b>our</b> facticity <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lived</b> bodies with its prerequisites for our encounters with the world. Projects, in this study, refer to the subject’s ability to transcend facticity, to learn, to go beyond the given and to create something new. The results show that people with reading and writing difficulties actively strive to overcome their difficulties, in accordance with their own abilities and conditions. The study also shows that the struggle with literacy tells a person who she is but, at the same time, the way she looks at herself also affects the ways in which she tackles literacy problems. The encounter is mutually dependent on the subject and the world. Literacy in today’s society appears to be an existential issue, although the nature of this issue differs in different periods of life. The participants learn in meaningful situations, which involve three aspects of meaning: learning as a joint venture, learning an interesting content and learning for one’s <b>own</b> sake. <b>Lived</b> time and lived space are also shown to be of great importance. To be able to learn, people build shelters around themselves. They also need to be permitted their own time to be able to learn. Swedish with an English summar...|$|R

6000|$|Most of the luxuries, {{and many}} of the {{so-called}} comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable that we know so much of them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in agriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a noble race of men. But why do men degenerate ever?

A major ingredient in a community’s identity lies in their understanding of the past, and that is where this paper will concern itself.

For this paper, I consider ‘identity’ to be what an individual or community believes about themselves, what role and characteristics they ascribe to, and consider as distinguishing them from others.

They have only studied the breaking into dream of elements that have remained unsatisfied without purifying discouragement. We can satisfy in life {{a few of our}} passions and each passion but a little, and our characters indeed but differ because no two men bargain alike. The bargain, the compromise, is always threatened, and when it is broken we become mad or hysterical or are in some way deluded; and so when a starved or banished passion shows in a dream we, before awaking, break the logic that had given it the capacity of action and throw it into chaos again. But the passions, when we know that they cannot find fulfilment, become vision; and a vision, whether we wake or sleep, prolongs its power by rhythm and pattern, the wheel where the world is butterfly. We need no protection, but it does, for if we become interested in ourselves, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> we pass out of the vision. Whether it is we or the vision that create the pattern, who set the wheel turning, it is hard to say, but certainly we have a hundred ways of keeping it near us: we select our images from past times, we turn from our own age and try to feel Chaucer nearer than the daily paper. It compels us to cover all it cannot incorporate, and would carry us when it comes in sleep to that moment when even sleep closes her eyes and dreams begin to dream; and we are taken up into a clear light and are forgetful even of our own names and actions and yet in perfect possession of ourselves murmur like Faust, [...] "Stay, moment," [...] and murmur in vain.|$|E
6000|$|The {{process of}} Lapham's {{financial}} disintegration {{was like the}} course of some chronic disorder, which has fastened itself upon the constitution, but advances with continual reliefs, with apparent amelioration, and at times seems not to advance at all, when it gives hope of final recovery {{not only to the}} sufferer, but to the eye of science itself. There were moments when James Bellingham, seeing Lapham pass this crisis and that, began to fancy that he might pull through altogether; and at these moments, when his adviser could not oppose anything but experience and probability to the evidence of the fact, Lapham was buoyant with courage, and imparted his hopefulness to his household. Our theory of disaster, of sorrow, of affliction, borrowed from the poets and novelists, is that it is incessant; but every passage <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> and in the lives of others, so far as we have witnessed them, teaches us that this is false. The house of mourning is decorously darkened to the world, but within itself it is also the house of laughing. Bursts of gaiety, as heartfelt as its grief, relieve the gloom, and the stricken survivors have their jests together, in which the thought of the dead is tenderly involved, and a fond sense, not crazier than many others, of sympathy and enjoyment beyond the silence, justifies the sunnier mood before sorrow rushes back, deploring and despairing, and making it all up again with the conventional fitness of things. Lapham's adversity had this quality in common with bereavement. It was not always like the adversity we figure in allegory; it had its moments of being like prosperity, and if upon the whole it was continual, it was not incessant. Sometimes there was a week of repeated reverses, when he had to keep his teeth set and to hold on hard to all his hopefulness; and then days came of negative result or slight success, when he was full of his jokes at the tea-table, and {{wanted to go to the}} theatre, or to do something to cheer Penelope up.

WHO has been providing many educational materials as well as making important policies related to Health Promoting School, including WHO's Global School Health Initiative. Since late 1990 s, some countries decided to adopt Health Promoting School Program as a national policy. In Western Pacific Region, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and others has started national program for Health Promoting School. We studied the backgrounds and some samples of Health Promoting Schools in particular countries {{as a part of the}} seminar in spring-summer semester in 2004. This short document is a summary of the seminar...|$|R
40|$|Hair is {{much more}} than meets the eye. It has {{recently}} been a topic of interest in the realm of sociology and anthropology. In depth literature has questioned the relationships between hair and race, hair and beauty, and hair and gender. Hair has been recognized as an important cultural marker denoting meanings specific in time and place to societies. In my thesis I will focus on an unchartered territory in understanding hair: length. Hair length denotes so much about American culture and our society. Length can be understood in a multitude of ways especially when beauty, power and race are added in. Interviews with college females will only support the myths of long hair that are inherent <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society. Their <b>own</b> <b>lived</b> experiences will add a spark of reality to abstract and metaphorical myths surrounding long hair. The experience of long hair will also be contrasted with short hair; how the two differ supporting each other in the normalization of societies standards. This thesis will serve to identify these traditional and normalized understandings of hair length and support them through the lived experience of the interviewee's...|$|R

60|$|And now I {{come to the}} end of this {{extraordinary}} incident, so overshadowing in its importance, not only <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> small, individual <b>lives,</b> but in the general history of the human race. As I said when I began my narrative, when that history comes to be written, this occurrence will surely stand out among all other events like a mountain towering among its foothills. Our generation has been reserved for a very special fate since it has been chosen to experience so wonderful a thing. How long its effect may last--how long mankind may preserve the humility and reverence which this great shock has taught it--can only be shown by the future. I think it is safe to say that things can never be quite the same again. Never can one realize how powerless and ignorant one is, and how one is upheld by an unseen hand, until for an instant that hand has seemed to close and to crush. Death has been imminent upon us. We know that at any moment it may be again. That grim presence shadows our lives, but who can deny that in that shadow the sense of duty, the feeling of sobriety and responsibility, the appreciation of the gravity and of the objects of life, the earnest desire to develop and improve, have grown and become real with us to a degree that has leavened our whole society from end to end? It is something beyond sects and beyond dogmas. It is rather an alteration of perspective, a shifting of our sense of proportion, a vivid realization that we are insignificant and evanescent creatures, existing on sufferance and at the mercy of the first chill wind from the unknown. But if the world has grown graver with this knowledge it is not, I think, a sadder place in consequence. Surely we are agreed that the more sober and restrained pleasures of the present are deeper as well as wiser than the noisy, foolish hustle which passed so often for enjoyment in the days of old--days so recent and yet already so inconceivable. Those empty lives which were wasted in aimless visiting and being visited, in the worry of great and unnecessary households, in the arranging and eating of elaborate and tedious meals, have now found rest and health in the reading, the music, the gentle family communion which comes from a simpler and saner division of their time. With greater health and greater pleasure they are richer than before, even after they have paid those increased contributions to the common fund which have so raised the standard of life in these islands.|$|R
