50|$|By the 1890s a Townsville branch {{had been}} {{established}} at Queen's Wharf. About 1900 the firm leased a single-storeyed brick building in Flinders Street, erected for them by shipping and commercial agents Aplin, Brown & Crawshay, who occupied the adjacent building {{at the corner of}} Flinders and Denham Streets. Shortly after this, in 1901, the business was reconstructed as the Howard Smith Company Ltd. In 1909 Harry Bellingham Howard Smith (managing director of the company and son of the founder of the <b>firm)</b> purchased two <b>allotments</b> {{on the other side of}} the leased premises in Flinders Street. On these, Howard Smith Company's own building was erected in 1910-11, and occupied in March 1911.|$|R
40|$|With the National Broadband Plan 2 ̆ 7 s {{promise of}} an {{additional}} 500 MHz of spectrum for commercial purposes, {{the question of how}} to allocate those resources among competing uses and users will dominate the communications policy debate over the coming years. In this Article, the Authors provide a theoretical analysis of some of the relevant tradeoffs involved in allocating spectrum among service providers, with a particular focus on incumbent exclusion rules such as spectrum caps. Two key assumptions center the analysis: (i) more firms implies lower prices (i. e., Cournot competition); and (ii) more spectrum permits more advanced services due to greater capacity and throughput. The derived theoretical tradeoff is straightforward: In a setting with many firms with little spectrum, there are low prices but relatively less advanced services; however, in a setting with fewer <b>firms</b> with larger <b>allotments</b> of spectrum, there may be higher prices but also more advanced services. The Authors 2 ̆ 7 analysis highlights several key components of the spectrum allocation decision. First, an incumbent-exclusion rule is not 2 ̆ 2 proentry, 2 ̆ 2 but instead seeks to select one form (price cutting) of entry over another (quality improving). Second, given the existing number of firms, the potential for sizeable competitive price effects is low. Third, the economic benefits of advanced wireless services are likely to be very high. Fourth, access to spectrum resources does not necessarily convey financial success, as spectrum is but one of many inputs necessary to provide service. In all, the Authors believe these facts, interpreted in the context of the theory, suggest incumbent exclusion rules are not welfare enhancing, at least in the United States...|$|R
