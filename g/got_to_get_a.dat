The group had {{achieved}} great commercial and critical success with the albums Tommy and Who's Next, but were struggling {{to come up with}} a suitable follow up. The group recorded new material with Who's Next collaborator Glyn Johns in May 1972, including [...] "Is It In My Head" [...] and [...] "Love Reign O'er Me" [...] which were eventually released on Quadrophenia, and a mini-opera called [...] "Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead", but the material was considered too derivative of Who's Next and sessions were abandoned. In an interview for Melody Maker, guitarist and bandleader Pete Townshend said [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new act together… People don't really want to sit and listen to all our past". He had become frustrated that the group had been unable to produce a film of Tommy or Lifehouse (the abortive project that resulted in Who's Next), and decided to follow Frank Zappa's idea of producing a musical soundtrack that could produce a narrative in the same way as a film. Unlike Tommy, the new work would be grounded in reality and tell a story of youth and adolescence that the audience could relate to.|$|E

Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip hop brands in hip hop magazines. In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should [...] "try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness. [...] " [...] In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s. Guru of Gang Starr was robbed of his Rolex watch at gunpoint, Queen Latifah's car was car-jacked, and Prodigy was robbed at gunpoint of $300,000 in jewelry.|$|E
