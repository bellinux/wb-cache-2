40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{expensive}} and difficult experiments, modern manufacturing {{is based on}} the analysis of forming processes in numeral atmosphere before the actual production set-up. In the presented work, the single stage deep drawing process of thin walled, mild steel, conical back plate of radial impeller of blowers is approached by means of a finite element analysis. Simulation of the drawing process for determining stress distribution in the <b>drawn</b> <b>component</b> for a particular displacement is explained in the presented work. The distribution of stress in the <b>drawn</b> <b>component</b> is obtained. The study was conducted by using ANSYS 12. 0, in which, two models have been tested. Both models constructed solely out of axisymmetric, quad 4 node, PLANE 42 elements which have been used to simulate the drawing process of drawing quality mild steel IS 2062 grade. The experimental analysis is carried out on two different flat plates having thickness 3 mm and 5 mm from which the conical back plate is manufactured.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{automotive}} and aerospace industries, {{the need for}} lightweight products is absolutely necessary. By combining between the strength and lightweight material usingTailor Welded Blank(TWB), the need can be achieved. Aluminium has the tendency to flow more than steel due to the lower density and weaker. Independence blank holder allows the application of different force on steel and aluminium in the forming process. The blank sheet flow can be controlled by different blank holder force (BHF). The promising materials are Steel and Aluminium alloy thatare formed into single blank sheet. The purpose of this numerical study is to demonstrate that dissimilar strength Steel-Al TWB can be subjected to deep drawing operations successfully, using optimum process parameters in the Finite Element (FE) simulation. The simulation indicate that Steel-Al TWB can produce deep <b>drawing</b> <b>components...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Trends in the {{automotive}} industry tend towards safety, fuel saving and reduction of exhaust gas result in an increased application of high strength steels as well as stainless steels in the car body production. Deep drawing is a tension/compression forming process of a sheet metal blank to a hollow part without a volitional thickness changing. This permanent deformation occurs when the applied stress exceeds the elastic limit of the material. The elastic deformation within the overall amount of deformation is not desired and leads to the so called spring back, which {{is directly related to}} the materials strength, sheet thickness and Young’s modulus. Besides strength and elastic modulus there are more factors affecting the part quality or the spring back behavior of deep <b>drawn</b> <b>components.</b> This paper will cover the effect of relevant forming parameters, as there are the die radius, the height of the beads and the drawing clearance.

Single unit activity was recorded from 8 microelectrodes inserted into the motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys while they were performing continuous drawing-like hand movements. Repeated scribbling paths, termed <b>drawing</b> <b>components,</b> were extracted by data-mining techniques. The set of the least predictable relations between drawing-components and pairs of neurons was determined and represented by one statistic termed the relations-score. The chance probability of the relations-score was evaluated by teetering the spike times. 1000 surrogates were generated by randomly teetering the original time of each spike in a small window.
