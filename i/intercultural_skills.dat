40|$|Cross-cultural {{adjustment}} is considered crucial for expatriate success. Such adjustment may {{be enhanced by}} providing the expatriates with the knowledge and awareness of norms and appropriate behaviours of the host country by means of cross-cultural training. Language training may also facilitate interaction with host nationals, thereby providing the expatriate with insight into the host country’s culture increase {{their understanding of the}} new environment. Further, cross-cultural training and language training may facilitate the development of <b>intercultural</b> effectiveness <b>skills.</b> These skills, in turn, are suggested to enhance the expatriate’s cross-cultural adjustment. The present study set out to investigate the impact of cross-cultural training, language training, and <b>intercultural</b> effectiveness <b>skills</b> on cross-cultural adjustment. The sample consisted of 67 North European expatriates located in China, an environment that is particularly challenging for these expatriates because the cultural distance between home and host country is large. <b>Intercultural</b> effectiveness <b>skills</b> were found to be important predictors of cross-cultural adjustment. Cross-cultural training did not prove to have any effect on cross-cultural adjustment, nor <b>intercultural</b> effectiveness <b>skills.</b> Language training, on the other hand, seemed to {{have a significant impact on}} cross-cultural interaction and general adjustment, a relationship that was mediated by <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills.</b> The results from this study point out the importance of language training, especially for North European expatriates in China. Further, the results encourage organisations to consider the <b>intercultural</b> effectiveness <b>skills</b> of potential candidates when selecting employees for expatriate assignments...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the importance of}} intercultural communication for career development in two segments of the hospitality industry, cruise and hotel. Three topics are explored: (1) the perceived relative importance of <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills</b> for career development, (2) whether differences exist between native and non-native English speakers in the importance assigned to intercultural communication, and (3) whether differences exist between cruise and hotel managers regarding {{the extent to which}} intercultural communication is perceived as important to career development. The sample for the original study consisted of 77 cruise ship directors and 111 hotel general managers. All 188 participants completed a Likert-style questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to collect information on the personal characteristics and skills perceived to be critical to managers? career development in the hotel or cruise industry. Demographic information was also collected. Descriptive statistics, Pearson Product Moment Correlations, Independent Samples t Tests, and content analysis were conducted. Analyses indicated that the respondents perceive intercultural communication to be moderately important in the hospitality industry, that non-native English speakers perceive <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills</b> as more important to career development than native English-speakers, and that cruise ship directors perceive <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills</b> as more important for career success than hotel general managers.

30|$|Prof. Sharifian: Of {{course it}} does! In recent decades we have {{witnessed}} significant geographical, demographic, and structural changes to the English language, and this requires us to revisit notions such as ‘language proficiency’. I think no matter how we define language proficiency in today’s world, <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills</b> {{should be at the}} heart of it. As you rightly point out, this will then have serious implications for how we assess proficiency too. Some scholars, including James Dean Brown, have recently written on this topic, but I think in terms of actual language testing, {{we have a long way}} to go. Whenever we raise an issue about testing, some people raise concerns such as ‘ease of administration’. Often academic arguments and non-academic concerns don’t match up in the area of language testing. I know major commercial language tests have been trying to include some diversity of language use in their tests, but I am not sure if that is enough to capture the kind of <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills</b> that I am referring to here.|$|R

Outsourcing is increasing, not only for products but also for processes, including highly technical engineering work.

40|$|Background: Intercultural {{communication}} behaviour {{of doctors}} with patients requires specific <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills,</b> {{which do not}} seem structurally implemented in medical education. It is unclear what motivates doctors to apply <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills.</b> We investigated how purposefully medical specialists think they practise intercultural communication and how they reflect on their own communication behaviour. Methods: Using reflective practice, 17 medical specialists independently watched two fragments of videotapes of their own outpatient consultations: one with a native patient and one with a non-native patient. They were asked {{to reflect on their}} own communication and on challenges they experience in intercultural communication. The interviews were open coded and analysed using thematic network analysis. Results: The participants experienced only little differences in their communication with native and non-native patients. They mainly mentioned generic communication skills, such as listening and checking if the patient understood. Many participants experienced their communication with non-native patients positively. The participants mentioned critical incidences of intercultural communication: language barriers, cultural differences, the presence of an interpreter, the role of the family and the atmosphere. Conclusion: Despite extensive experience in intercultural communication, the participants of this study noticed hardly any differences between their own communication behaviour with native and non-native patients. This could mean that they are unaware that consultations with non-native patients might cause them to communicate differently than with native patients. The reason for this could be that medical specialists lack the skills to reflect on the process of the communication. The participants focused on their generic communication skills rather than on specific <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>skills,</b> which could either indicate their lack of awareness, or demonstrate that practicing generic communication is more important than applying specific intercultural communication. They mentioned well-known critical incidences of ICC: language barriers, cultural differences, the presence of an interpreter, the role of the family and the atmosphere. Nevertheless, they showed a remarkably enthusiastic attitude overall was noteworthy. A strategy to make doctors more aware of their intercultural communication behaviour could be a combination of experiential learning and ICC training, for example a module with reflective practice...|$|R
