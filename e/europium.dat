5|$|<b>Europium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, <b>europium</b> usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All <b>europium</b> compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. <b>Europium</b> has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of <b>europium</b> exploit the phosphorescence of <b>europium</b> compounds. <b>Europium</b> {{is one of the}} least abundant elements in the universe; only about % of all matter in the universe is <b>europium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of <b>europium</b> in minerals {{relative to}} other rare-earth elements {{is known as the}} <b>europium</b> anomaly. <b>Europium</b> is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the <b>europium</b> anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europium</b> is a {{ductile metal}} with a {{hardness}} {{similar to that}} of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of <b>europium</b> are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. <b>Europium</b> has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europium</b> is {{not found}} in nature as a free element. Many {{minerals}} contain <b>europium,</b> with the most important sources being bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime and loparite-(Ce).|$|E
5|$|<b>Europium</b> is {{produced}} by nuclear fission, but the fission product yields of <b>europium</b> isotopes are low {{near the top of}} the mass range for fission products.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europium</b> {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of <b>europium</b> is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and {{who was able to}} isolate it in 1901; he then named it <b>europium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although <b>europium</b> {{is present}} {{in most of the}} {{minerals}} containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements {{it was not until the}} late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to <b>europium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Divalent <b>europium</b> (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the {{activator}} of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that <b>europium</b> was determined to be the cause.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europium</b> {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} {{when it is}} cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because <b>europium</b> is divalent in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = 7/2) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of <b>europium</b> oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine <b>europium</b> oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of <b>europium</b> purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide <b>europium,</b> with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than <b>europium</b> (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and <b>europium</b> (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E
5|$|Overall, <b>europium</b> is {{overshadowed by}} caesium-137 and strontium-90 as a {{radiation}} hazard, and by samarium {{and others as}} a neutron poison.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} {{is used in}} phosphor lamp coatings. Mixed with <b>europium</b> fluoride, it is also {{applied in}} the crystal membrane of fluoride ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
5|$|Relative to {{most other}} elements, {{commercial}} applications for <b>europium</b> {{are few and}} rather specialized. Almost invariably, its phosphorescence is exploited, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|A {{few large}} {{deposits}} produce or produced {{a significant amount}} of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare-earth element oxides, the largest known deposit. The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare-earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is <b>europium.</b> The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of <b>europium.</b> Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2015) {{application}} of <b>europium</b> is in quantum memory chips which can reliably store information {{for days at}} a time; these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk-like device and shipped around the country.|$|E
5|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic {{member of the}} actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element <b>europium,</b> and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.|$|E
5|$|An {{application}} that has almost {{fallen out of}} use {{with the introduction of}} affordable superconducting magnets is the use of <b>europium</b> complexes, such as Eu(fod)3, as shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy. Chiral shift reagents, such as Eu(hfc)3, are still used to determine enantiomeric purity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europium</b> forms stable {{compounds}} {{with all}} of the chalcogens, but the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te) stabilize the lower oxidation state. Three oxides are known: europium(II) oxide (EuO), europium(III) oxide (Eu2O3), and the mixed-valence oxide Eu3O4, consisting of both Eu(II) and Eu(III).|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, <b>europium,</b> or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>europium</b> {{is composed}} of 2 isotopes, 151Eu and 153Eu, with 153Eu being the most abundant (52.2% natural abundance). While 153Eu is stable, 151Eu was recently found to be unstable to alpha decay with half-life of , giving about 1 alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural <b>europium.</b> This value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. Besides the natural radioisotope 151Eu, 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 150Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, 152Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and 154Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than 4.7612 years, {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives shorter than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8 meta states, with the most stable being 150mEu (t1/2=12.8 hours), 152m1Eu (t1/2=9.3116 hours) and 152m2Eu (t1/2=96 minutes).|$|E
5|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, primarily decay by {{emission of}} alpha particles to isotopes of neodymium. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of <b>europium.</b>|$|E
5|$|This route gives white europium(III) {{fluoride}} (EuF3), yellow europium(III) chloride (EuCl3), gray europium(III) bromide (EuBr3), and colorless europium(III) iodide (EuI3). <b>Europium</b> also {{forms the}} corresponding dihalides: yellow-green europium(II) fluoride (EuF2), colorless europium(II) chloride (EuCl2), colorless europium(II) bromide (EuBr2), and green europium(II) iodide (EuI2).|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to <b>europium</b> metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and <b>europium,</b> and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides <b>europium</b> and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides <b>europium</b> and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium <b>europium</b> vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like <b>europium,</b> samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E
5|$|The stable {{alkali metals}} are all silver-{{coloured}} metals except for caesium, {{which has a}} pale golden tint: {{it is one of}} only three metals that are clearly coloured (the other two being copper and gold). Additionally, the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, and barium, as well as the divalent lanthanides <b>europium</b> and ytterbium, are pale yellow, though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium. Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. Indeed, these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} one star {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude. Alpha Circini, a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3.19, is 54light-years away and 4° south of Alpha Centauri. Not only {{the brightest star in}} the constellation, it is also the brightest example of a rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star in the night sky. It has the unusual spectral type A7Vp SrCrE, showing increased emissions of strontium, chromium and <b>europium.</b> Stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable. Alpha Circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with a separation of 5.7arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260AU and they take 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 to 1934, Spedding {{worked for}} Lewis as a {{chemistry}} instructor. Around this time, he {{became interested in}} the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. He borrowed money to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of <b>Europium</b> and Samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and <b>europium</b> and ytterbium {{of the rare}} earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from <b>europium</b> through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those up to samarium and <b>europium)</b> that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E
5|$|The Pr3+ ion {{is similar}} in size to the early {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those from lanthanum up to samarium and <b>europium)</b> that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare-earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y, with somewhat less Nd and Pr). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride. The product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E
