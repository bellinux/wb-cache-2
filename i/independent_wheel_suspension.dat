50|$|In 1930, Ardie President Willy Bendit {{assigned}} German engineer Josef Ganz {{to build}} a prototype of a small Volkswagen according to his design. This Ardie-Ganz prototype was finished in September 1930 and achieved highly successful road-test results. The car featured a tubular chassis, mid-mounted engine, and <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> with swing-axles at the rear.|$|E
50|$|All {{vehicles}} {{have power}} steering and incorporate {{a new type}} of suspension consisting of a double trailing arm <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension,</b> the kinetic properties of which give considerably improved mobility in rough terrain. The negative lead angle of the springing reduces the vertical and horizontal acceleration when driving rapidly across obstacles so that the physical load on the crew is lower compared to vehicles equipped with rigid axles.|$|E
5000|$|May 1969: Introduction of the Maxi 1500 5-door {{hatchback}} with transversely-mounted 1485 cc E Series {{engine and}} 5-speed manual gearbox driving the front <b>wheels,</b> <b>independent</b> <b>suspension</b> with hydrolastic shock absorbers (often {{referred to as}} [...] "The Cable-Change" [...] models).|$|R
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of American made vehicles continued to use simple Live rear axles into the 1980s, but Americans could access four <b>wheel</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>suspension</b> technology on imported cars, like the 1952 Volkswagen Beetle, 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and 1968 Datsun 510.|$|R
50|$|But the {{backlash}} {{of the economic}} crisis of 1929 arrived and manufacturers of luxury cars {{all over the world}} suffered from poor sales. The commercial and financial situation of the firm was badly shaken. In 1932 Delage introduced the type D6-11 (6-cylinder 2101 cc), and two years later the new eight-cylinder Delage, type D8-15 (2768 cc). These two models, equipped with <b>independent</b> front <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> did not increase sale figures. The transverse leaf and wishbone independent front suspension was licensed by Studebaker for their cars.|$|R
5000|$|Fred [...] "Skinny" [...] Clemons (14 February 1889 - 10 February 1945) was an American {{race car}} driver and designer. He {{was one of}} the first {{entrants}} at the Indianapolis 500. He designed and built his own cars, engines and created his own <b>Independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> which he patented in 1934. An identification letter 'C’ or ‘Cm ' often appears in front of the race Numbers on Clemons' cars. [...] Lou Meyer, [...] Joe Russo, [...] Wilber Shaw and many other race drivers drove his cars.|$|E
50|$|In December 1930, Adler {{assigned}} the German engineer Josef Ganz, {{who was also}} editor-in-chief of Motor-Kritik magazine, as a consultant engineer. In {{the first months of}} 1931, Ganz constructed a lightweight Volkswagen prototype at Adler with a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> with swing-axles at the rear. After completion in May 1931, Ganz nicknamed his new prototype Maikäfer (May Beetle). After a shift in management at Adler, further development of the Maikäfer was stopped as the company's new technical director Hans Gustav Röhr concentrated on front-wheel driven cars.|$|E

5000|$|As the 1950s approached, solid front axles {{had been}} {{generally}} replaced with front <b>wheel</b> <b>independent</b> <b>suspension,</b> smoothing the ride considerably and allowing for safer highway speeds. Along with others, the 1950 Studebaker Champion introduced {{independent front suspension}} into its product line, with Cadillac marketing its new [...] "Knee-Action" [...] suspension in 1953 model year automobiles.|$|R
50|$|The first {{company to}} build a car {{according}} to the many patents of Josef Ganz was the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, which introduced its Standard Superior model at the IAMA (Internationale Auto- und Motorradausstellung) in Berlin in February 1933. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> with swing-axles at the rear. Here the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler expressed interest in its design and low selling price of 1,590 Reichsmark. Under the new anti-Semitic government, however, Josef Ganz was a target for his enemies from the automotive industry that opposed his writings in Motor-Kritik.|$|E

50|$|With the Ardie-Ganz, Adler Maikäfer and Standard Superior cars, {{as well as}} his {{progressive}} {{writings and}} promotion of the concept of a Volkswagen (people's car) in Motor-Kritik magazine since the 1920s, Josef Ganz is claimed by some to have had input into the Volkswagen Beetle. These cars had some of features of the later Volkswagen Beetle, such as the tubular chassis, rear-mounted engine and <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> with swing axles. While the Volkswagen Beetle was produced in its millions after World War Two, the name of Josef Ganz was largely forgotten. In 2004, Dutch journalist Paul Schilperoord started researching the life and work of Josef Ganz, and in 2011 he published The Extraordinary Life of Josef Ganz: The Jewish Engineer Behind Hitler's Volkswagen.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} half of 1932, Wilhelm Gutbrod, the President of the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, came into contact with German {{engineer}} Josef Ganz. Ganz had been working on a small car design since the early 1920s and had so far built two prototypes, one for Ardie in 1930 and one for Adler in 1931, called the Maikäfer (May Beetle). After a demonstration with the Maikäfer by Ganz, Gutbrod was most interested to build a small car according to this design. The Standard Fahrzeugfabrik then purchased a license from Ganz to develop and build a small car according to his design. The prototype of this new model, which was to be called Standard Superior, was finished in 1932. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> with swing-axles at the rear.|$|E
50|$|LH 12 is two-axle {{bus with}} a semi-self {{supporting}} bodywork which is welded from closed steel profiles.

5000|$|... in 1923, {{as a young}} {{mechanical}} engineering student, Ganz made his first auto sketches for a car for the masses. This was a small lightweight car {{along the lines of}} the Rumpler Tropfenwagen with a mid-mounted engine, <b>independent</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension,</b> swing-axles and an aerodynamic body. Lacking the money to build a prototype, he began publishing articles on progressive car design in various magazines and, shortly after his graduation in 1927, he was assigned as the new editor-in-chief of Klein-Motor-Sport. Josef Ganz used this magazine as a platform to criticize heavy, unsafe and old-fashioned cars and promote innovative design and his concept of a car for Germany's general population. The magazine gained in reputation and influence and, in January 1929, was renamed Motor-Kritik. Contributors to the magazine included Béla Barényi, a young engineering student who designed cars with similar design.|$|E
