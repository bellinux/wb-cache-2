5|$|Bush {{had decided}} to speak to Woodward despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{declined}} Woodward's requests for his previous book State of Denial. The New Republic has also stated that General David H. Petraeus provided off the record information for the writing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{announced that it was}} his farewell international tour, the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were broken. The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, and stands to this day.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{enjoyed a}} good season in 2000–01 as they {{finished}} third in the league and reached the 2001 Scottish Cup Final, which was lost 3–0 to Celtic. Manager Alex McLeish departed for Rangers in December 2001; team captain Franck Sauzée was appointed as the new manager, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no previous coaching experience. A terrible run of form followed and Sauzée was fired after being in charge for 69 days.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{well known}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never missed a penalty kick in his {{professional}} career to date.|$|R
50|$|In the press, Landberg {{is often}} {{compared}} to guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen both stylewise and techniquewise. Although Landberg acknowledges the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{been listening to}} Malmsteen in his early teens, <b>he</b> rejects the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a similar style, pointing out music and composition as a far greater emphasis in his music than just guitar technique.Among strong influences, Landberg has cited Edward Van Halen in several radio interviews such as in The Heavy Metal Mayhem Radio interview in New York.|$|R
5|$|On the June 20, 2013 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Knockouts Division Executive Brooke Hogan {{stripped}} ODB and Young {{of the title}} because Young is a male talent, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been a male for the prior 478 days. This ultimately resulted in the titles being deactivated, as it's no longer listed among TNA's active championships.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed {{informed}} of European affairs. He learned that France {{had suffered a}} series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition. On 24 August 1799, he {{took advantage of the}} temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received no explicit orders from Paris. The army was left in the charge of Jean Baptiste Kléber.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E
50|$|I {{believe that}} {{everyone}} must rejoice in his destiny, in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> lived {{at all and}} achieved a destiny. Destiny is the only sure asset.|$|R
5000|$|On October 24, 2013 he {{was covered}} by the National Post stating that Calgary {{officials}} have a vendetta and {{was said to have}} pulled out a [...] "thick sheaf of white papers from his briefcase" [...] demonstrating the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had a lengthy battle for his rights to care for the homeless.|$|R
50|$|Simon {{was left}} {{out from the}} squad due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not {{acquired}} the German language correctly and his oversensitivity according to his coach, Torsten Fröhling.|$|R
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no bruising was seen as evidence {{that he had not}} blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|In 681, Constantine IV {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Bulgar khan Asparukh, and the new Bulgarian state assumed {{sovereignty}} {{over a number of}} Slavic tribes that had previously, at least in name, recognised Byzantine rule. In 687–688, the final Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians, and made significant gains, although the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to fight his way from Thrace to Macedonia demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but also the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of inspiration for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been disowned by his family, however, {{is likely}} to remain a {{symbolic}} act rather than a legally enforceable disinheritance, given India's modern inheritance laws.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} him. However, it doesn't matter. But {{why does}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> asked Ruth on his yacht excite you? Are you nervous about the sea?" ...|$|R

5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly dropped {{their opposition to}} him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure whether he should accept the papacy due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Romans did not, however, remove Nabis {{from the}} Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a {{landlocked}} and effectively powerless state, the Romans wanted an independent Sparta {{to act as}} a counterweight against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to surrender five hostages, amongst them his son, Armenas. The Romans did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of his congregation as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lectures}} {{he gave in}} 1967 at Harvard, Jorge Luis Borges {{mentioned}} {{him as one of}} his masters, and expressed wonder to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been forgotten.|$|R
50|$|Ewatski {{announced}} {{his plans to}} retire in 2007 based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> served for 34 years, and has entered a milestone in his life; the age of 55.|$|R

5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry about the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors {{that he was going to}} make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{the back}} of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 {{campaign}} with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{participated in}} the First Council of Constantinople (381), and perhaps gave there his famous sermon In suam ordinationem. He was chosen to eulogise at the funeral of Melitus, which {{occurred}} during the council. The council sent Gregory {{on a mission to}} Arabia, perhaps to ameliorate the situation in Bostra, where two men, Agapius and Badagius, claimed to be bishop. If this is the case, Gregory was unsuccessful, as the see was still contested in 394. He then travelled to Jerusalem, where Cyril of Jerusalem faced opposition from local clergy due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been ordained by Acacius of Caesarea, an Arian heretic. Gregory's attempted mediation of the dispute was unsuccessful, and he himself was accused of holding unorthodox views on the nature of Christ. His later reign in Nyssa was marked by conflict with his Metropolitan, Helladius. Gregory was present at a 394 synod convened at Constantinople to discuss the continued problems in Bostra. The year of his death is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 2008, Behan was {{questioned}} by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) {{in connection with the}} murder of a 72-year-old woman, Silvana Abate Francescatti, at her home on Monte Amiata, Arcidosso, in Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. The woman was found on 11 July with 13 stab wounds, including a fatal throat wound, but was believed to have died the previous day. Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of the year since 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a cut on his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed he had first gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while unpacking furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E
