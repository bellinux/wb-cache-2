500|$|Featuring [...] "multi-layered" [...] lyrics, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{has been}} the subject of various interpretations; common inferences range from an adventurous {{teenager}} seeking independence from overprotective parenting, to [...] "deeper meaning relating to gender" [...] and longing to be part of [...] "a different kind of society". The overall sentiment remains empowering. The line [...] "Bet you on land, they understand/Bet they don't reprimand their daughters/Bright young women sick of swimming, ready to stand" [...] has been widely interpreted as a feminist statement. Jenny Shelton, writing for Standard Issue Magazine, identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "a protest song" [...] that is both proactive and pro-feminist. Thought Catalogs Zaron Burnett III described the lyrics as [...] "feminist-sounding". One critic believes that since [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was released in 1989 during [...] "an uncertain time for women" [...] amidst backlash resulting from the women's movement, the song [...] "could represent the disillusionment of women in this decade – sick of being told to settle with their lot and placate their dreams of true liberation with capitalist consumerism; in the same way that Ariel has been forced to satiate her true desires with meaningless trophies by her father’s patriarchal subjugation." [...] A number of critics have also identified the song's lyrics as an allegory for the LGBT community seeking public acceptance and a place in which they feel as though they belong. BuzzFeed's Chris Hernandez wrote that closeted gay people can [...] "relate to Ariel's longing to be a part of a world that is immensely different than the one she's living in" [...] and [...] "that there is freedom in that world." [...] Writing for KQED, Tony Bravo agreed that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] discusses [...] "The longing that all gay <b>kids</b> <b>feel</b> to belong". Citing that Ashman himself was openly gay, Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out author Sean P. Griffin wrote that the lyricist uses the song to demonstrate [...] "a gay dilemma of trying to choose between different worlds" [...] by discussing [...] "fantasy, escape and forbidden romance." ...|$|E
