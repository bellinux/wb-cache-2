500|$|... is {{the title}} of a 2015 book by Jon Krakauer that looked at the Justice Department's {{investigation}} into a [...] "pattern of disrespect and indifference toward alleged victims" [...] by Missoula law enforcement in sexual assault cases between 2010 and 2012, some involving football players from the Montana Grizzlies. While being interviewed on NPR about the book, John Krakauer stated [...] "I don't mean to single out Missoula: Its rape rate is a little less than the national average; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> problems with dealing with rape are pretty depressingly typical".|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{begins on}} April 29, with the player (who remains unnamed) {{receiving}} {{a message from}} his brother, Pete Crowhurst, an architect working on the redevelopment of an abandoned train station and hotel in Dowerton, Dorset. Pete pleads for his brother to come to Dowerton, as something is wrong and he needs help. He mentions he is working with two ghost hunters, and says [...] "I think whatever they were hunting has found them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> found me too." [...] He then says [...] "it" [...] is outside the door, whispering his name, and he feels compelled to let it in. As the message ends, a door is heard opening.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] {{answered}} Evan almost inaudibly. [...] "We {{have found}} something which we both hate {{more than we}} ever hated each other, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>its</b> name." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{wrote that}} many of his critics mischaracterize the {{argument}} he puts forth in his essay {{in a manner similar to}} what Rosenfeld wrote was an erroneous portrayal in The New York Times. He explains: [...] "Since I never once referred to 'liberalism', called no one a 'Jewish anti-Semite' or 'self-hating Jew', said nothing about Democrats or the Iraq war, and made no attempt to 'silence' anyone, this Kafkaesque bill of indictment makes me wonder what is at play here â€“ illiteracy, dishonesty, or worse? As Bret Stephens recently put it, 'How does joining a debate become an effort to suppress it?' Rosenfeld denied it, stating that, [...] "Nobody's being silenced.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> a red herring to talk about silencing, this debate in fact is evidence of a robust and open discussion".|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. About {{the timing of}} the episode's airdate with Hurricane Sandy's landfall, he said, [...] "It's very strange and somewhat sad. We wrote this script I think in June. We based it on several big 50s and 60s Nor'easters that hit the East Coast, obviously not as severe as the one that just hit. It's very eerie." [...] About Jessica Lange's performance, he said, [...] "She's never really played a drunkard in her career so her doing this big drunk monologue that has both comedy and tragedy sometimes within a single minute and I think she just killed it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> really brilliant and tragic and it contains my favorite line she's ever said, which is 'Charles Laughton is an enormous whoopsie.' I thought that was really quite brilliant. Jessica Lange talking about Charles Laughton is just great. I know it was very challenging and she had a great time doing it. It was just a master class in acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E

6000|$|... "By the way, as this {{settlement}} escaped plunder, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>its</b> {{people may}} have done something by selling supplies to the army. Provisions of all kinds were very high and scarce, I remember, when we met Burgoyne." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{his musical}} {{influences}} on Wakin on a Pretty Daze, Vile stated, [...] "I {{was listening to}} some really disparate stuff while writing it, like there was this one Gary Numan song, [...] "Are Friends Electric?", and some other weird early-80s stuff, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> worked <b>its</b> way in there." ...|$|R
60|$|The folk {{glanced at}} each other, and whispered to their neighbours.

5000|$|It's funny: {{after all}} these years, the solo to [...] "Limelight" [...] is my {{favorite}} to play live. There's something very sad and lonely about it; it exists in its own little world.

2500|$|The New York Times op-ed {{columnist}} Nicholas Kristof {{commented on}} CNN's Piers Morgan Live about Wahl's and Martin's initial actions, [...] "admire their outspokenness but, you know, {{at the end}} of the day, RT is a Russian propaganda arm, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>its</b> going to matter very much to the geopolitical consequences here." ...|$|R

60|$|The head on {{the pillow}} stirred gently to and fro, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> cheek was dyed with an even sprightlier red than had {{coloured}} his.

6000|$|... "Saw ye my father" [...] {{is one of}} my {{greatest}} favourites. The evening before last I wandered out, and began a tender song, in what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> native style. I must premise that the old way, and the way to give most effect, is to have no starting note, as the fiddlers call it, but to burst at once into the pathos.

5000|$|In a 2008 interview, Middleton stated: [...] "It was a {{good time}} to call it a day.

60|$|I do not {{suppose that}} anyone who knows the name of Allan Quatermain {{would be likely to}} {{associate}} it with flowers, and especially with orchids.

6000|$|I {{have not}} yet been twenty yards from our house and barn; but I begin to {{perceive}} that this is a beautiful place.
