40|$|The last 15 {{years have}} seen a {{revolution}} in the way financial economists understand the world around us. We once thought that stock and bond returns were essentially unpredictable. Now we recognize that stock and bond returns have a substantial predictable component at long horizons. We once thought the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) provided a good description of why average returns on some stocks, portfolios, funds or strategies were higher than others. Now we recognize that the average returns of many investment opportunities cannot be explained by the CAPM, and multifactor models' have supplanted the CAPM to explain them. We once thought that long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> reflected expectations of future short term <b>rates</b> and that <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> differentials across countries reflected expectations of exchange-rate depreciation. Now, we see time-varying risk premia in bond and foreign exchange markets as well as in stock markets. Once, we thought that mutual fund average returns were well explained by the CAPM. Now, we recognize ``value'' and other high return strategies in funds, and slight persistence in fund performance. In this article, I survey these new facts. I show how they are related. Each case uses price variables to infer market expectations of future returns; each case notices that an offsetting adjustment (to <b>dividends,</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> or exchange rates) seems to be absent or sluggish. Each case suggests that financial markets offer rewards in the form of average returns for holding risks related to recessions and financial distress, in addition to the risks represented by overall market movements. ...|$|R

40|$|Market {{expectations}} about the Federal Reserve’s policy rate involve both the future path of that rate and the uncertainty surrounding that path. Fed policy actions have historically been preceded by high levels of uncertainty, which decline after the policy is made public. Recently, measures of near-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty have fallen to historical lows, due partly to a Fed policy rate near zero. Unconventional monetary policies have substantially lowered both expectations and uncertainty about the future path of the Fed’s policy rate. Expectations about the future crucially affect today’s asset prices. For example, stock prices reflect expectations of future <b>dividends.</b> Long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are influenced by expectations regarding future short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> House prices are related to expectations for future rents. However, some uncertainty always surrounds these expectations. Since investors typically dislike risk, this uncertainty affects asset prices. Importantly, uncertainty varies over time, rising to high levels during turbulent periods such as the recent financial crisis. This Economic Letter examines uncertainty about the future course of short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> that is, the expected path of Federal Reserve monetary policy. The analysis uses market-based measures of uncertainty from financial derivatives, such as options. A key question is how Fed policy actions affec...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we proceed to {{estimate}} {{a measure of}} the flow-through capability of the firms listed in the Spanish Stock Exchange. The flow-through capability is defined as the ability of firms to transmit inflation shocks to the prices of the products and services sold by the company. According to a strand of literature, this flow-through capability can explain, to some extent, the so called “stock duration paradox”, that is the difference between the theoretical stock duration derived from the DDM model and its empirical estimates. The line of reasoning suggest that if a company can pass on inflation shocks to the prices of its own outputs and then to profits and <b>dividends,</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> changes due to variations in the expected inflation will have a limited impact on stock prices. So in this paper we first estimate the flow-trough capability for different industries finding strong differences among them.

40|$|Three {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} focus on developing new statistical method-ologies {{to address some}} issues arising in applied econometrics literature. The first two essays concern issues involving the exponential of an integrated series, while the third essay proposes a GMM-type estimation that is robust {{to the presence of}} misspecified moment conditions. Since many time series of economic interest are often assumed to have a unit root in their logarithms, the exponential of an integrated series would then de-scribe those series in levels. For some variables such as stock prices, <b>dividends,</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> however, it is not a priori clear, given that one suspects a unit root, whether this unit root is in the levels or in the logarithms. Consequently, in applied work, such variables are sometimes modeled in logarithms and some-times in levels.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a valuation model for convertible bonds with hard call features. We define a hard call feature as the possibility for the issuer to redeem a convertible bond before maturity by paying the call price to the bondholder. We use the binomial approach to model convertible bonds with hard call features. By distinguishing between an equity and a debt component we incorporate credit risk of the issuer. The modelling framework takes (discrete) dividends that are paid during the lifetime of the convertible bond, into account. We show that incorporation of the entire zero-coupon yield curve is straightforward. The performance of the binomial model is examined by calculating theoretical values of four convertible bonds. The measure used to compare theoretical values with is the average quote, equal to the average of bid and ask quotes provided by several financial institutions. We conclude that in general long historical volatilities and implied volatilities tend to give the best results. Moreover, we find that our model follows market movements very well. The impact of different <b>dividend</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> scenarios is rather small. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} {{have concluded}} that expectations of future excess stock returns rather than future real dividend growth or real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are {{responsible for most of}} the volatility in stock prices. In this paper, we employ a state-space model to model the dynamics of the log price-dividend ratio along with long-term and short term <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> real <b>dividend</b> growth, and inflation. The advantage of the state space approach is that we can parsimoniously model the low frequency movements present in the data. We find that if one allows permanent changes, even though very small, in real <b>dividend</b> growth, real <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> inflation but not excess stock returns then expectations of real dividend growth and real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> become significant contributors to fluctuations in stock prices. However, we also show that stock price decompositions are very sensitive to assumptions about which unobserved market fundamentals have a permanent component. When we allow excess stock returns to have a permanent component but not real dividend growth, then excess stock returns becomes an important contributor to stock price movements while real dividend growth is not. Unfortunately, the data is not particularly informative about which of these alternative models is more likely. Dividends; Stock market; Stocks; Inflation (Finance) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} new {{evidence}} {{on the existence of}} disappearing dividend phenomenon in the Nigerian stock market and as to how clientele, catering and life-cycle theories of dividend affect firms’ dividend paying behaviour. We did not find conclusive evidence to suggest that dividend payments had become second order of importance in firms’ payout policies during 2003 – 2012 because we only observed a downward trend in dividend payments during 2010 – 2012. Logistic regression of a probability to pay or not to pay dividend and a panel regression of the size of dividend payment show that clientele theory stands out as compared to catering and life-cycle theories. Firms in our sample shape their dividend policies in line with the preference of foreign investors who have less preference for dividend over capital gain due to dividend taxes imposed on these shareholders. This underlines the importance of foreign investors on firms’ corporate decisions given the fact they owned {{more than half of the}} total shares traded on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Other determinants that affect the propensity to pay are profitability, investment opportunities, leverage, cash flow, crisis, stock market performance, past <b>dividend</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> with signs that are consistent with the prediction of traditional dividend theories...|$|R

Due to first order autocorrelations, lagged returns contribute significantly to return volatility in emerging markets. Decomposition of variances indicates that <b>dividend</b> yield and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> are determining factors of volatility, but at varying degrees in different emerging markets.

The reload {{provision}} in an {{employee stock option}} entitles its holder to receive one new (reload) option from the employer for each share tendered as payment of strike upon the exercise of the stock option. The number of reloads allowed can be finite or infinite. The shout feature in a call option allows its holder to reset the option’s strike price to the prevailing stock price upon shouting. We explore symmetry relationship between the price functions of the employee reload options and shout call options.

For an employee reload option with an infinite number of allowable reloads, the payoff of the employee reload option can be related to the lookback feature of the stock price process.

40|$|First {{published}} 10 October 2016 A {{combination of}} simple moving average trading strategies with several window lengths delivers a greater average return and skewness {{as well as}} a lower variance and kurtosis compared with buying and holding the underlying asset using daily returns of value-weighted US decile portfolios sorted by market size, book-to-market, momentum, and standard deviation as well as more than 1000 individual US stocks. The combination moving average (CMA) strategy generates risk-adjusted returns of 2 % to 16 % per year before transaction costs. The performance of the CMA strategy is driven largely by the volatility of stock returns and resembles the payoffs of an at-the-money protective put on the underlying buy-and-hold return. Conditional factor models with macroeconomic variables, especially the market <b>dividend</b> yield, short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> and market conditions, can explain some of the abnormal returns.
