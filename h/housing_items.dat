40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of discrete-event {{simulation}} for the design and control of physical protection systems for fixed-site facilities <b>housing</b> <b>items</b> of significant value. It begins by discussing several modeling and simulation activities currently performed in designing and analyzing these protection systems and then discusses capabilities that design/analysis tools should have. The remainder of the article then discusses in detail how some of these new capabilities have been implemented in software to achieve a prototype design and analysis tool. The simulation software technology provides a communications mechanism between a running simulation and one or more external programs. In the prototype security analysis tool, these capabilities are used to facilitate human-in-the-loop interaction and to support a real-time connection to a virtual reality (VR) model of the facility being analyzed. This simulation tool {{can be used for}} both training (in realtime mode) and facility analysis and design (in fast mode) ...|$|E
