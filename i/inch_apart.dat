60|$|When the lobes, {{which are}} rather thick, close, {{no trace of}} {{wrinkling}} {{can be seen on}} any part of their upper [page 317] surfaces, It appears therefore that the cells must contract. The chief seat of the movement is evidently in the thick mass of cells which overlies the central bundle of vessels in the midrib. To ascertain whether this part contracts, a leaf was fastened on the stage of the microscope in such a manner that the two lobes could not become quite shut, and having made two minute black dots on the midrib, in a transverse line and a little towards one side, they were found by the micrometer to be 17/1000 of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart.</b> One of the filaments was then touched and the lobes closed; but as they were prevented from meeting, I could still see the two dots, which now were 15/1000 of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart,</b> so that {{a small portion of the}} upper surface of the midrib had contracted in a transverse line 2/1000 of an inch (.0508 mm.).|$|E

The {{introduction}} of common spring water {{in place of}} one of the volta-electrometers used with twenty pairs of four-inch plates (1156.) caused such obstruction as not to allow one-fifteenth of the transferable force to pass which would have circulated without it. Thus fourteen-fifteenths of the available force of the battery were destroyed, local force, (which was rendered evident by the evolution of gas from the being converted into zincs,) and yet the platina electrodes in the water were three inches long, nearly an inch wide, and not a quarter of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E

Each particle of hydrogen as it moves one way, or of oxygen as it moves in the other direction, will transfer {{a certain amount of}} electrical force associated with it in the form of chemical affinity (822. 852. 918.) onwards through a distance, which is equal to that through which the particle itself has moved. This transfer will be accompanied by a corresponding movement in the electrical forces throughout every part of the circuit formed (1627. 1634.), and its effects may be estimated, as, for instance, by the heating of a wire (853.) at any particular section of the current however distant. If the water be a cube of an inch in the side, the electrodes touching, each by a surface of one square inch, and being an <b>inch</b> <b>apart,</b> then, by the time that a tenth of it, or 25.25 grs., is decomposed, the particles of oxygen and hydrogen throughout the mass may be considered as having moved relatively to each other in opposite directions, to the amount of the tenth of an inch; i.e. that two particles at first in combination will after the motion be the tenth of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart.</b> Other motions which occur in the fluid will not at all interfere with this result; for they have no power of accelerating or retarding the electric discharge, and possess in fact no relation to it.|$|E

One of the galvanometer wires was passed twice or thrice loosely round the brass axis of the plate, and the other attached to a conductor (86.), which itself was retained by the hand in contact with the amalgamated edge of the disc at the part immediately between the magnetic poles. Under these circumstances all was quiescent, and the galvanometer exhibited no effect. But the instant the plate moved, the galvanometer was influenced, and by revolving the plate quickly the needle could be deflected 90Â° or more.|$|E

Three minute dots, no bigger than pinheads, decorated either lip, and at a little distance were not at all discernible. Just upon the fall of the shoulder were drawn two parallel lines half an <b>inch</b> <b>apart,</b> and perhaps three inches in length, the interval being filled with delicately executed figures. These narrow bands of tattooing, thus placed, always reminded me of those stripes of gold lace worn by officers in undress, and which are in lieu of epaulettes to denote their rank.|$|E

He {{did not like to}} throw away his own time in {{finishing}} an undertaking so clumsily begun, and on the other hand, he did not like very well to refuse to help Phonny out of his difficulties. He finally concluded to undertake the work. So he took the cage down from the bench and put it upon the floor; he borrowed the iron square and the compasses from Stuyvesant; he ruled a line {{along the top of the}} box at the right distance from the edge, and marked off places for the holes, half an <b>inch</b> <b>apart,</b> along this line, pricking in, at the places for the holes, deep, with one of the points of the compass.

He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half an hour, awhile ago, up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's rate, he blew it out--I have already shown it to you--and put his inch-marks on a fresh one.|$|E

The actual {{superiority of}} the troughs which I have {{constructed}} on this plan, I believe to depend, first and principally, on the closer approximation of the zinc and copper surfaces;--in my troughs they are only one-tenth of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart</b> (1148.);--and, next, on the superior quality of the rolled zinc above the cast zinc used {{in the construction of}} the ordinary pile. It cannot be that insulation between the contiguous coppers is a disadvantage, but I do not find that it is any advantage; for when, with both the forty pairs of three-inch plates and the twenty pairs of four-inch plates, I used papers well-soaked in wax[A], these being so large that when folded at the edges they wrapped over each other, so as to make cells as insulating as those of the porcelain troughs, still no sensible advantage in the chemical action was obtained.|$|E
