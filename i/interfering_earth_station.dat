In {{addition}} to {{communicating with the}} satellite phones in its footprint, each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites, and routes data between them, to effectively create a large mesh network. There are several <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> which link to the network through the satellites visible to them. The space-based backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space {{to one of the}} <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> downlinks ("feeder links"). Station-to-station calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> As satellites leave the area of an <b>earth</b> <b>station,</b> the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> Communication between satellites and <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> is at 20 and 30GHz.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{capability}} of modern satellite earth terminals has increased, expanded, and {{benefited from the}} development and application of both microprocessor and minicomputer components. Microprocessors with intrinsic low cost and capability limited only by the imagination of engineers are now key components in the fundamental communications performance of <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> These components are now {{an integral part of}} antenna, modem, multiplexers, status and control, and communications control hardware. The concepts of unattended <b>earth</b> <b>stations,</b> remote controlled <b>earth</b> <b>stations,</b> and smart <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> would not be practical without the availability of microprocessor and minicomputer components. <b>Earth</b> <b>station</b> network control concepts have been developing {{over the last five years}} to solve the issue of increasing the utilization of large capital investment in Satellite Communication(SATCOM) systems. The ability to double the communications capacity of a SATCOM system without adding new satellites or <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> has been proven. Small minicomputers integrated into <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> configurations have made this possible. Microprocessor and minicomputer technology will continue to play an increasingly important and key role in future <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> hardware design and capability.

40|$|The NBS Boulder Laboratory is in {{the process}} of {{assembling}} a very high accuracy time transfer system. The system includes a 6. 1 meter Ku-band satellite <b>earth</b> <b>station,</b> two transportable <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> each with a 1. 8 meter dish, and commercial modems designed for two-way timing. Elements of the facilities are described in this paper. High-accuracy timing with this equipment using the two-way time transfer technique via a geostationary satellite is d'iscussed. Phase stability measurements of ground facilities in various loop-around schemes using a satellite simulator have been performed in order to determine ultimate stability limits. Allan-variance stability plots are generated for sample times of 1 s to several days at various carrier-to-noise density (C/No) ratios. These plots are compared to theoretical limits obtained from the model of phase jitter given for the spread spectrum modem. The use of small transportable <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> with full duplex capability provides for signal turn-around at a remote location with stationary satel-lites in common view with the NBS <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> It is shown that the portability of the small <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> readily allows a measurement of signal delays through the ground equipment including the orthomode transducer, feed, and other antenna-related items. Time delays through the various antenna parts have usually not been measured directly but have been estimated in previous papers on two-way time transfer. High-accuracy time comparisons can be performed between NBS and other Ku-band satellite <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> via geostationary satellites. Better than 1 ns accuracy should be possible using the two-way time transfer technique.
