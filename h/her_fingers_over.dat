60|$|The girl stood hesitating, twining <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> each other, restlessly.|$|E
60|$|Isobel stood {{twisting}} <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> {{each other}} before her nervously.|$|E
60|$|Miss Nugent {{repressed}} {{a shiver}} and, crossing to the fire, thoughtlessly extended <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the blaze.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{is it so}} easy to tell, of each, {{to which}} world he belongs, {{as it was to}} place the lady, who held out <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> that gorge called Grand Canyon, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> closed <b>over</b> his. She {{drew him}} a little nearer with glad recklessness.|$|R
60|$|He saw <b>her</b> frail <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the cup, <b>her</b> lips {{making a}} little move.|$|R
60|$|Yet Giuliana {{did nothing}} to assist me in that task. She {{returned}} from the book-shelf, and in passing lightly swept <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> my hair.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she lifted}} up the ivory harp with {{the strings of}} gold and swept <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it, trying its notes and {{adjusting}} them with the agate screws, looking at Amathel all the while with a challenge in her lovely eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Tasso {{gripped the}} {{take-off}} switch, running <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the smooth metal. [...] "A beautiful ship, Major. Well built. I admire your workmanship. You {{people have always}} done good work. You build fine things. Your work, your creations, are your greatest achievement." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{panel of}} the days was deeply worn--the long tenth notches half effaced, as alphabets of the blind. Ten {{thousand}} times the longing widow had traced <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> the bamboo--dull flute, which played, on, gave no sound--as if counting birds flown by in air would hasten tortoises creeping through the woods.|$|R
60|$|With <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> still {{tightened}} <b>over</b> the door-catch {{she turned}} and looked at him.|$|R
60|$|The unhappy {{woman looked}} down, and yet could hardly meet those grey {{beautiful}} eyes fixed so earnestly on her face. She hesitated, and passed <b>her</b> trembling <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> Fan's disordered hair, and finally burst into tears.|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{after the}} first passage of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> his face, with the breathless {{attention}} to what she was about, which, in my own case, I remembered so well. A second time, she passed her hand over him--considered again--and turned my way next.|$|E
6000|$|... "You thought I {{did it on}} purpose, but you're wrong. If I had, I'd {{have done}} it better than this. I wouldn't have this brutal pain." [...] She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her eyes. [...] "It's horrible to complain! Only it's so bad! But I won't again--promise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There! Yo' {{naturally}} {{wanted a}} little room for that, co'nnle, but now that yo' 've got it off,--and mighty pooty it was, too,--yo' can sit down." [...] And with that she sank down {{at one end of}} the sofa, prettily drew aside a white billow of skirt so as to leave ample room for Courtland at the other, and clasping <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her knees, looked demurely expectant.|$|E
60|$|There {{were more}} {{questions}} {{which he was}} longing to ask, but the cold negativeness of her manner chilled him. She sat with <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> poised <b>over</b> the keys, waiting for his departure. He turned and left the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> had strayed <b>over</b> {{one of the}} blossoms, and {{he noticed}} that while they talked she was convulsively {{crushing}} it into pulp.|$|R
60|$|She swung {{round in}} her seat, and the quick {{clicking}} {{of the instrument}} was resumed as <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> flew <b>over</b> it. The door opened, and Mr. Sabin entered. He leaned on his stick, standing on the threshold, and glanced keenly at both of them.|$|R
60|$|She {{was close}} in her husband's arms; {{she clung to}} him; {{whatever}} of strangeness and slowness and insularity she might find in him, none of that mattered so {{long as she could}} slip her hands beneath his coat, run <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the warm smoothness of the satin back of his waistcoat, seem almost to creep into his body, find in him strength, find in the courage and kindness of her man a shelter from the perplexing world.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are you asleep?' she {{repeated}} gently, {{as she stood}} {{at the side of the}} bed. And she reached her hand in the darkness to touch his forehead. Delicately, her fingers met the nose and the eyebrows, she laid her fine, delicate hand on his brow. It seemed fresh and smooth--very fresh and smooth. A sort of surprise stirred her, in her entranced state. But it could not waken her. Gently, she leaned over the bed and stirred <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the low-growing hair on his brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "IT can't be done! So I {{may as well}} give it I up and get a new pair. I {{long for}} them, but I'm afraid my nice little plan for Laura will be spoilt," [...] said Jessie Delano to herself, as {{she shook her head}} over a pair of small, {{dilapidated}} slippers almost past mending. While she vainly pricked <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> them for the last time, her mind was full of girlish hopes and fears, as well as of anxieties far too serious for a light-hearted creature of sixteen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} you are going," [...] she said, her voice almost sinking to a whisper, her eyes looking {{more and more}} intently at the music, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> flying <b>over</b> the keys of the piano with a strange feverish energy which I had never noticed in her before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Philip, don't be silly. I'm quick-tempered too and I can {{understand}} that I hurt you, but it's so stupid to sulk over it. What's the good of making us both unhappy? It's been so jolly, our friendship." [...] She passed <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> slowly <b>over</b> his hand. [...] "I love you, Philip." ...|$|R
60|$|He did so obediently, but wonderingly. She {{then opened}} the piano and took a seat upon the music stool before it, placed some loose sheets of music in the rack, and ran <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> lightly <b>over</b> the keys. Thus intrenched, she let her hands fall idly in her lap, {{and for the first}} time raised her eyes to his.|$|R
60|$|He {{removed his}} hands from {{clasping}} his shin, some distance above the ankle. She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the bone, over his stocking, to feel {{if there was}} any fracture. Immediately her fingers were wet with blood. Then he did a curious thing. With both his hands he pressed her hand down over his wounded leg, pressed it with all his might, as if her hand were a plaster. For some moments he sat pressing her hand over his broken shin, completely oblivious, as some people are when they have had a shock and a hurt, intense on one point of consciousness only, and for the rest unconscious.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have given}} Madame the message,” {{she said in}} her {{contained}} voice, swinging the door wide open. Then after relieving me of my hat and coat she announced me with the simple words: “Voilà Monsieur,” and hurried away. Directly I appeared Doña Rita, away there on the couch, passed the tips of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her eyes and holding her hands up palms outwards on each side of her head, shouted to me down the whole length of the room: “The dry season has set in.” I glanced at the pink tips of her fingers perfunctorily and then drew back. She let her hands fall negligently as if she had no use for them any more and put on a serious expression.|$|E
60|$|The Painted Lady {{could play}} on the spinet beautifully, but Grizel could not play, though {{it was she who}} was trying to play now. She was running <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the notes, {{producing}} noises from them, while she swayed grotesquely on her seat and made comic faces. Her object was to capture her mother's mind, and she succeeded for a short time, but soon it floated away from all control, and the Painted Lady fell a-shaking violently. Then Grizel seemed to be alarmed, and her arms rocked despairingly, but she went to her mother and took loving hold of her, and the woman clung to her child in a way pitiful to see. She was on Grizel's knee now, but she still shivered as if in a deadly chill, and her feet rattled on the floor, and her arms against the sides of the chair. Grizel pinned the trembling arms with her own and twisted her legs round her mother's, and still the Painted Lady's tremors shook them both, so that to Tommy they were as two people wrestling.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned again}} to the instrument, and let <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> wander <b>over</b> the keys, with a {{drooping}} head. Presently she lifted her face, and smoothed back from her temples some straggling tendrils of hair. Without looking at the priest she asked with the child-like bluntness that characterized her, [...] "Why don't you like {{to walk in the}} procession of Corpus Domini?" ...|$|R
60|$|She felt {{something}} hard {{and cold and}} metallic thrust into her hand. He made <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> close <b>over</b> it, hold it. The feel of the thing revived her. She opened her eyes. Stewart had given her his gun. He stood with his broad breast against her knee, and she {{looked up to see}} that old mocking smile on his face.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Beard doubtless {{accepted}} {{it as one}} of the man's eccentricities that Jethro did not respond to him, for without more ado he departed arm in arm with Ephraim. Jethro was looking at Cynthia, who was staring toward the desk {{at the other end of}} the corridor, her face flushed, and <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> closed <b>over</b> the arms of her chair. It never occurred to Jethro that she might have been embarrassed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're goin' on too slow--that's it," [...] said Del critically. [...] "Why, when Captain Savage meandered along {{here with}} Jinny" [...] (Virginia) [...] "last week, afore we {{got as far}} as this he'd reeled off a heap of Byron and Jamieson" [...] (Tennyson), [...] "and sich; and only {{yesterday}} Jinny and Doctor Beveridge was blowin' thistletops to know which was a flirt all along the trail past the crossroads. Why, ye ain't picked ez much as a single berry for Jinny, let alone Lad's Love or Johnny Jumpups and Kissme's, and ye keep talkin' across me, you two, till I'm tired. Now look here," [...] she burst out with sudden decision, [...] "Jinny's gone on ahead in a kind o' huff; but I reckon she's done that afore too, and you'll find her, jest as Spinner did, on the rise of the hill, sittin' on a pine stump and lookin' like this." [...] (Here the youngest Miss Piper locked <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her left knee, and drew it slightly up,--with a sublime indifference to the exposure of considerable small-ankled red stocking,--and with a far-off, plaintive stare, achieved a colorable imitation of her elder sister's probable attitude.) [...] "Then you jest go up softly, like as you was a bear, and clap your hands on her eyes, and say in a disguised voice like this" [...] (here Del turned on a high falsetto beyond any masculine compass), [...] "'Who's who?' jest like in forfeits." ...|$|E
60|$|She looked up, {{and in the}} {{darkness}} saw his face above her, his shapely, male face. There seemed a faint, white light emitted from him, a white aura, {{as if he were}} visitor from the unseen. She reached up, like Eve reaching to the apples on the tree of knowledge, and she kissed him, though her passion was a transcendent fear of the thing he was, touching his face with her infinitely delicate, encroaching wondering fingers. Her fingers went over the mould of his face, over his features. How perfect and foreign he was--ah how dangerous! Her soul thrilled with complete knowledge. This was the glistening, forbidden apple, this face of a man. She kissed him, putting <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> his face, his eyes, his nostrils, over his brows and his ears, to his neck, to know him, to gather him in by touch. He was so firm, and shapely, with such satisfying, inconceivable shapeliness, strange, yet unutterably clear. He was such an unutterable enemy, yet glistening with uncanny white fire. She wanted to touch him and touch him and touch him, till she had him all in her hands, till she had strained him into her knowledge. Ah, if she could have the precious KNOWLEDGE of him, she would be filled, and nothing could deprive her of this. For he was so unsure, so risky in the common world of day.|$|E
60|$|Gwendolen {{had never}} {{in her life}} felt so miserable. No sob came, no passion of tears, to relieve her. Her eyes were burning; and the noonday only brought into more dreary {{clearness}} the absence of interest from her life. All memories, all objects, the pieces of music displayed, the open piano--the very reflection of herself in the glass--seemed {{no better than the}} packed-up shows of a departing fair. For the first time since her consciousness began, she was having a vision of herself on the common level, and had lost the innate sense that there were reasons why she should not be slighted, elbowed, jostled--treated like a passenger with a third-class ticket, in spite of private objections on her own part. She did not move about; the prospects begotten by disappointment were too oppressively preoccupying; she threw herself into the shadiest corner of a settee, and pressed <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> her burning eyelids. Every word that Klesmer had said seemed to have been branded into her memory, as most words are which bring with them a new set of impressions and make an epoch for us. Only a few hours before, the dawning smile of self-contentment rested on her lips as she vaguely imagined a future suited to her wishes: it seemed but the affair of a year or so for her to become the most approved Juliet of the time: or, if Klesmer encouraged her idea of being a singer, to proceed by more gradual steps to her place in the opera, while she won money and applause by occasional performances. Why not? At home, at school, among acquaintances, she had been used to have her conscious superiority admitted; and she had moved in a society where everything, from low arithmetic to high art, is of the amateur kind, politely supposed to fall short of perfection only because gentlemen and ladies are not obliged to do more than they like--otherwise they would probably give forth abler writings, and show themselves more commanding artists than any the world is at present obliged to put up with. The self-confident visions that had beguiled her were not of a highly exceptional kind; and she had at least shown some rationality in consulting the person who knew the most and had flattered her the least. In asking Klesmer's advice, however, she had rather been borne up by a belief in his latent admiration than bent on knowing anything more unfavorable that might have lain behind his slight objections to her singing; and the truth she had asked for, with an expectation that it would be agreeable, had come like a lacerating thong.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} had, with {{infinite}} pains, contrived to learn two [...] "pieces" [...] which she usually executed with a jerky movement {{of her right}} hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made dreadful discords. But {{under the influence of}} the chocolate bonbon she sat down and ran <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> lightly <b>over</b> the keys producing such exquisite harmony that she was filled with amazement at her own performance.|$|R
6000|$|There was no applause {{when the}} air ceased, but a deep sigh from every one {{seemed to be the}} {{indication}} of a return to ordinary consciousness. Waboose and her mother did not sigh, however. They sat still and gazed in silent wonder. Jessie Macnab, with a slight blush at the unexpected effect, ran <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> lightly <b>over</b> the keys of her instrument, and then suddenly began to play a Highland reel with tremendous vigour! ...|$|R
60|$|Summer came, the moors were {{tangled with}} harebells like {{water in the}} ruts of the roads, the heather came rosy under the skies, setting the whole world awake. And she was uneasy. She went past the gorse bushes {{shrinking}} from their presence, {{she stepped into the}} heather as into a quickening bath that almost hurt. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> moved <b>over</b> the clasped <b>fingers</b> of the child, she heard the anxious voice of the baby, as it tried to make her talk, distraught.|$|R
