50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, a key is {{a machine}} element used to connect a rotating machine element to a shaft. The key prevents relative rotation {{between the two}} parts and may enable torque transmission. For a key to function, the shaft and rotating machine element must have a keyway and a <b>keyseat,</b> which is a slot and pocket in which the key fits. The whole system is called a keyed joint. A keyed joint may allow relative axial movement between the parts.|$|E
40|$|Recognizing {{different}} HKL response patterns while tripping {{through different}} restrictions {{in the well}} can be a huge advantage {{in the sense that}} it can reduce downtime and stuck pipe incidents as it allows for right means of removing the restriction. There can be different reasons for restriction of moving the drillstring in the wellbore. In this thesis restrictions are divided into <b>keyseat,</b> dogleg, borehole closure and ledges. Mathematical and physical HKL response models are presented for the 3 latter restrictions. For ledges and borehole closure, type curve models are presented. For tripping through a dogleg a stiff string model was derived based on deflection of steel beams. Field data from a well was evaluated with the use of the presented restriction models. The HKL response from tripping through the doglegs in the well was calculated, and different HKL abnormalities were identified with the different restriction models. Several over-pulls and took weights were identified with ledge type curve, which can be confirmed from lithology and comparison of HKL response for other runs at the same depth. Generally the doglegs in this well did not cause major overpulls or took weight as a result of the overall extra friction created in doglegs. Tripping through doglegs, does however causes, abnormal HKL response in relation to keyseating as a result of the string tension that is pulling the drillstring towards the borehole wall</p...|$|E
50|$|<b>Keyseating</b> is the {{creation}} of the slots in the mating items. <b>Keyseating</b> can be done on a variety of different machines including a broach, a keyseater, wire-cut EDM, a shaper or vertical slotting machine, either a vertical or horizontal mill, or with a chisel and file.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} forms of <b>keyseating</b> was done by chiseling. The keyway is roughed out using a chisel and then filed to size; the key is tried frequently to avoid over filing. This technique is long, tedious, and rarely used anymore.|$|R
50|$|Shaping or {{slotting}} {{is largely}} used for cutting keyways {{that do not}} extend through {{the full length of}} the part. Like <b>keyseating,</b> shaping uses a single-point cutting tool for cutting, however, shapers are not guided through the cut on a fixed post. As such, shaper cuts are generally more susceptible to deflection than keyseater cuts.|$|R
40|$|Interference fits {{are widely}} {{employed}} to semi-permanently connect gears, pulleys, flanges, wheels, disks, rotors, and similar mechanical components, to a shaft. The stress state along the hub central portion may be thoroughly predicted by modelling the press-fit problem as plane and by employing the Lamé equations for thick-walled cylinders, and the transmissible torque may be confidently estimated {{by relying on}} the Lamé predictions, since they are valid along most of the contact axial length. 	Often a key {{is added to the}} press-fit, to secure the torque transmission and to prevent any relative rotation between the shaft and the hub. Both parallel and tapered keys are employed in practical applications. With respect to their tapered counterparts, parallel keys possess the advantage that they do not cause any eccentricity. This study considers parallel keys only. The presence of the <b>keyseat</b> increases the compliance of the hub and the shaft, thus producing a diminution of the contact pressure between the hub and the shaft, which results in a similar diminution of the transmissible torque. In this paper, a preliminary Finite Element analysis is carried out to quantify the above diminution of the contact pressure in the assumption of frictionless contact. The analysis is carried out for a solid shaft and for a practically relevant selection of ratios between the hub inner and outer radii. 	A preliminary development is presented of an analytical approach based upon the classical Michell polar solution, which is particularly suitable to mimic rings. 	The diminution of the transmissible torque with respect to a keyless shaft-hub press-fit is quantified, and the results are presented in a design diagram...|$|E
5000|$|Machinists usually work to {{very small}} tolerances, usually within 0.010" [...] or 0.25 mm (more {{commonly}} expressed as ±0.010"(Plus or minus ten-thousandths of an inch) or ±0.13 mm), and sometimes at tolerances {{as low as}} 0.0001" [...] (plus or minus one tenth of a thousandth of an inch - or 0.0025 mm) for specialty operations. A machinist deals with all facets of shaping, cutting and some aspects of forming metal, although forming is typically a separate trade. The operations most commonly performed by machinists are milling, drilling, turning, and grinding. There are other more specialised operations that a machinist will less frequently {{be called upon to}} perform such as honing, <b>keyseating,</b> lapping, and polishing, to name a few.|$|R
5000|$|Keyseaters, {{also known}} as <b>keyseating</b> {{machines}} and keyway cutters, are specialized machines designed to cut keyways. They {{are very similar to}} vertical shapers; the difference is that the cutting tool on a keyseater enters the workpiece from the bottom and cuts on the down-stroke, while the tool on a shaper enters the workpiece from the top and cuts downward. Another difference is a keyseater has a guiding system above the workpiece to minimize deflection, which results in a closer tolerance cut. The process starts by clamping the workpiece to the table with a fixture or vise. The workpiece is properly located and then the reciprocating arm is started. Some models have a stationary table so the cutter is fed horizontally into the workpiece, while others have a movable table that feeds the workpiece into a fixed cutter. These machines can cut other straight sided features other than keyways (see the picture). They can also produce [...] slots, which are slots that do not extend through the whole workpiece.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of drilling a well {{is the potential}} economic profit. The total cost of a drilling operation result from a complex interplay of many factors (Graham and Muench, 1959). Work that can optimize some of these factors is desirable, {{and the need for}} information that can eliminate unfortunate incidents resulting in increased operational time and make the operation more efficient is constant. Well cemented layers and the composition of the cemented materials are the main causes of hard stringers. Hard stringers may lead to severe downhole problems like washouts, severe local doglegs and <b>keyseats.</b> Such downhole problems are often related to the unexpected appearance of hard stringers and may cause the drill string to stick and result in lost time. Hard and soft stringers may be detected through real-time drilling data. This is achieved by comparing different drilling parameters, like rotary speed (RPM), weight on bit (WOB) and block position (BPOS). A decrease in RPM followed by an increase in WOB indicates hard formations. However, manual analyses are time consuming and inefficient. A modified and improved version of the hardness detection program previously developed by Solberg (2011) is presented in present thesis. The model is based on a simplified version of the rate of penetration (ROP) equation proposed by Bourgoyne and Young (1986). Drillability is the desirable result from the equation, as drillability is the inverse of hardness. Not all the functional relations that initially are part of the ROP equation have been assumed relevant for the detection of soft and hard stringers. Some of them alter only gradually, either with depth or as the drilling operation progresses, and do not affect the sudden change in drillability as the well is being drilled. WOB, RPM and ROP (&# 916;BPOS/&# 916;t) are drilling parameters chosen as relevant for present work. They are obtained through real-time drilling data and utilized in the calculations of drillability. Exponents related to the WOB and the RPM functions will frequently vary with the hardness in the formation. However, frequent manipulation of the exponents is difficult to achieve and only one soft and one hard formation exponent related to each exponent type have been applied. The final result shows a plot of hardness variation with depth. The plot has been proved to correlate well with experienced hard stringers stated in the Final Well Report. The program has been proved to be able to detect lithology transitions. The boundaries of particularly the Utsira Fm are evident on the hardness curve. The detection of Utsira Fm is enhanced by both gamma ray and sonic log from the same formation in wells nearby. Correlations between the two logs and hardness have been established. However, due to absence of sonic and gamma ray data from Well 0, the trustworthiness of the establishment is hard to evaluate. </p...|$|R
