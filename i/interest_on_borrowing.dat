40|$|An {{agreement}} from Norwalk {{was issued}} in September 2002 {{on the basis}} of negotiations of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) a International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for the elimination of restrictions in the form of two different systems of financial reporting. The aim is to ensure absolute compatibility of existing U. S. GAAP and IFRS and the coordination of work programs in the future. Document Memorandum of Understanding was issued in 2006 in the frame of ongoing process of convergence, in which the FASB and IASB confirm their intention to create high-quality and global financial reporting standards. In this document there are specified areas, which would lead to convergence of procedures. Borrowing costs have been one from the fields, which was the subject of convergence works. U. S. GAAP dictated capitalization of borrowing costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of qualifying assets, while the IAS/IFRS leaved the decision on accounting entities, how it recognize and record borrowing costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the assets. In the beginning, the method of analysis and description is used to identify and describe the basic difference of both systems, which had existed before the initiation of convergence within the frame of “Borrowing Costs” project. The above mentioned primary analysis has served {{as the basis for the}} further comparative analysis and synthesis. The paper further presents comparative analysis of two basic methodical approaches towards the borrowing costs reporting incurred in relation to the acquisition of the qualifying assets, which was possible to apply until 31 st Dec 2008 under IFRS system. The comparative analysis is based on empirical company data. The subjects are mainly the differences in the indicators, which are used for the evaluation of the company financial situation. According (Suvova, 1999), mainly the indicators of vertical analysis of property and capital structure and selected ratio indicators of return are used. Short-term project of borrowing costs, whose aim was to unify the reporting of <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowing</b> funds on the side of IASB, was completed in March 2007 by issuing of the revised IAS 23 Borrowing Costs with effect from 1. 1. 2009. The paper deals with major changes to IAS 23 occurred in the context of the IASB – Borrowing costs. Elimination of a major difference in the reporting of borrowing costs in the system IAS/IFRS and U.

40|$|The {{quantity}} of rice production has increased {{regardless of the}} land operation size in recent years, but small and medium farmers still have a serious problem especially regarding the increasing cost involved in the production. As rice is the main crop, the condition of production, cost incurred in different inputs, purchasing nature of inputs {{and the source of}} production elements influence the cost of production, which directly effects rural subsistence. The study included three categories of rice farmers: small (30), medium (23) and large (11) in the district of Jessore in the south-western part of Bangladesh. The objectives of this study are to measure the differences in the cost of production of boro rice farmers on the basis of land held to determine further steps for their well being. The study found that although {{there were no significant differences}} in the {{quantity of}} inputs used for all categories of farmers, the unit cost of some inputs significantly varied between small - large and medium - large, thus affecting the cost of production. The reasons for the raised cost of production were that most of the small and medium farmers purchased inputs on credit, spending comparatively more than cash and they paid higher <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> money. </font...|$|R

40|$|Companies financed through {{borrowed}} capital are allowed {{a tax deduction}} for the costs re-lated to their {{borrowed capital}}. A similar tax relief for companies financed through share-holder’s equity does not exist, why these companies are taxed higher than companies fi-nanced by borrowed capital. The result {{is that there is}} an asymmetric tax treatment of companies depending on how they are financed. The autumn of 2012, the Swedish government presents a proposal for an investor deduc-tion which seeks to equalize the above mentioned asymmetry. The proposed investor de-duction is a tax relief for investments in shares in a startup- or small company equal to 50 percent of the acquisition cost of that investment. The venture capital deduction, which in this thesis is treated {{as an alternative to the}} inves-tor deduction, is an interest-free tax credit which significate that two-thirds of the acquisi-tion cost is deductible from taxation at the time of the acquisition. Another alternative is the UK's Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), which offers a package of tax reliefs that becomes applicable when an individual invests in a company for example a tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of acquisition. A final option is the Notional Interest Deduction (NID) which is a tax deduction for companies regarding a fictitious <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> equity. Of these models, only the NID deduction equalizes the tax asymmetry, because of that it is a relief that is comparable to the tax credit deduction for <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> capital. However entails all models, except the venture capital deduction, to make external capital more accessible by reducing the external investor's required rate of return by allowing a permanent tax relief.

40|$|Malaysia {{has been}} {{experiencing}} sustained current account surplus during post-Asian crisis period. Although current account surplus {{is not as}} harmful as deficit, it cannot be sustained forever. Moreover, if the surplus is caused by bad reasons, such as, insufficient social insurance, inefficient financial intermediation, then it is reflected in deteriorating external competitiveness through more depreciated real exchange rate. Therefore, examination of current account sustainability is of crucial importance for the long-run health of the economy. Previous studies on Malaysian current account sustainability produce diverse results and leave it as an unsettled issue open to further research. In this backdrop this paper investigates the sustainability of Malaysia’s current account balance for the period 1970 – 2010. This paper employs inter-temporal budget constraint to understand the behavior of exports and imports of Malaysian economy. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method is applied to examine the long cointegrating relation between Malaysian exports and imports plus <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> external <b>borrowing.</b> Advantage of employing the ARDL method {{is that it does}} not require the variables to be integrated to the first order. This method can be applied to a set of stationary and nonstationary variables. The paper uses annual data over the periods 1970 – 2010. Export, import and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data are in current US dollars. <b>Interest</b> payment <b>on</b> long-term external <b>borrowing</b> in US dollars is used as a proxy for <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> net foreign debt. Estimation results indicate that these two variables are cointegrated, which implies that Malaysia’s current account is sustainable in the long run. Strong sustainability requires the coefficient of cointegrating vector to be one. In addition to ARDL method, coefficient of cointegrating vector is estimated by two other methods, namely, fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and dynamic OLS (DOLS). All three estimations show that the long-run coefficient is greater than one. This indicates that in the long-run export increases more than import plus <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> external <b>borrowing.</b> Therefore, if the excess export earnings in the long run cannot be utilized productively current account surplus may not sustain. It is, therefore, concluded that Malaysian current account is weakly sustainable. This findings call for policy intervention at macro level to make efficient utilization of excess saving to boost economic growth through promoting social insurance, facilitating efficient financial intermediation and encouraging private investment...|$|R

40|$|Our goal at Deseret Land and Livestock is to {{maximize}} long-term profit. Our profit {{is a function}} of the following factors: the prices we receive for our production, our amount of production, the costs of production, and the productive capabilities of our land and labor. Prices, production, and cost are managed on an annual basis. The long-term outcome of one’s management is determined by their attention and skill in enhancing the capability of land and labor. These factors of profit can vary tremendously within and between years. For example, prices for 400 - 500 pound steer calves from 1979 - 1989 varied nearly $. 58 /pound over the period and on average the prices varied $. 17 /pound within any given year during this time, with a maximum within year difference of $. 26 /pound (Cattle-Fax 1991). Our range forage production has varied in the same 10 year period from less than two weeks of active growth to over three months. Finally fuel and <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>borrowed</b> money costs have oscillated dramatically over this same period with all costs tending to increase. The tremendous variability of both the biological and financial environments in which ranchers do business make it a very high risk business. No single fixed strategy, no matter how good, will maximize long-term profitability. We believe that in this type of business environment the key to success is to have the flexibility to adapt. We calve late because it provides us with the best fit between the cattle’s nutritional requirements over their production cycle and the ranch’s naturally produced forage. This match has helped us become a low cost operation, has reduced our susceptibility to inflationary pressures on cost, has increased our production, and has broadened our marketing opportunities. Over the last twelve years, we decreased our total cost per pound of calf produced from over $. 90 to $. 62. We have gone from a cow/calf operation to a cow/calf/yearling operation. Finally we now look for marketing opportunities year-round instead of having to sell the calves each fall...|$|R
