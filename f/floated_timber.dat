50|$|Dereiçi is {{situated}} in a valley near Mount Qoros, which reaches a height of 1500 meters. Crops grown in the Dereiçi area include grain, grapes, tree fruit and vegetables. Along the slopes, grapes are cultivated. Earlier, a logging industry <b>floated</b> <b>timber</b> down the river Tigris to Mosul in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} {{inherited}} {{by the children}} of John Beauregard Barnes. A son, John Rice Barnes, and his wife, Elizabeth Hawk Barnes, raised their family of 12 children in the house. In {{addition to being a}} farmer, J. R. Barnes was a logger who cut and <b>floated</b> <b>timber</b> on the Holston River to Knoxville, accompanying the timber on the river in a flatboat.|$|E
5000|$|Originally named [...] "Rouge River", the river's {{appellation}} was {{altered in}} the 19th century {{due to the}} printing error of a Wisconsin mapmaker.As a frontier waterway, the historic Rogue River was of major importance to local tribes and traders. During the lumber era in the latter 19th century its waters <b>floated</b> <b>timber</b> to the mills of the Grand River valley, and the riverboat Algoma plied its way northward along Rogue giving {{its name to the}} Kent county township of Algoma.|$|E

50|$|The Setesdal Line was {{a narrow}} gauge steam railway built in 1896 which went across Iveland on its route between Vennesla and Byglandsfjord in Bygland. The Setesdal Line's {{operation}} was terminated in 1962 {{and the track}} was removed between Byglandsfjord and Beihølen. When it was constructed, it revived the lumber industry. Large quantities of planks, poles, and timbers were brought by horse to the Iveland station and forwarded by railroad to Kristiansand. This resulted in better prices since it provided competition with the <b>floated</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|E

60|$|A wave, towering {{far above}} its fellows, was indeed approaching. Higher and higher it rose. There {{was a wild}} cry from the wreck as it surged over it. When it had passed, the sea was covered with <b>floating</b> <b>timbers,</b> but the vessel was gone.|$|R
5000|$|Exploitation of {{the forest}} {{dates back to the}} thirteenth century, and there is an ancient {{tradition}} of raftsmen <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> down the Loue to the Saône and the Rhone, and thence to the Mediterranean.

50|$|Lepas anatifera, {{commonly}} known as the pelagic gooseneck barnacle or smooth gooseneck barnacle, is a species of barnacle in the family Lepadidae. These barnacles are found, often in large numbers, attached by their flexible stalks to <b>floating</b> <b>timber,</b> the hulls of ships, piers, pilings, seaweed and various sorts of flotsam.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} used {{primarily}} to <b>float</b> <b>timber</b> south for export. Strong currents make the river even less valuable {{as a means}} of transport in eastern Burma. Its basin does not have the same richness for agriculture as the Irrawaddy because there is no soil flowing down from the Shan Hills.|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} before he {{recovered}} consciousness. As soon as he did so, he crawled {{on his hands and}} knees to the edge of the cliff, and looked down. The Swan had disappeared. Not a sign of her remained, not so much as a <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> showed on the surface of the water.|$|R
5000|$|When the Ottawa River {{first began}} {{to be used for}} <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> en route to markets, squared timber was the {{preference}} by the British for resawing, and it [...] "became the main export". Britain imported 15,000 loads of timber from Canada in 1805, and from the colonies, 30,000 in 1807, and nearly 300,000 in 1820.|$|R
60|$|The Prairie proper ends at Calgary, {{among the}} cattle-ranches, mills, breweries, and three million acre {{irrigation}} works. The river that <b>floats</b> <b>timber</b> {{to the town}} from the mountains does not slide nor rustle like Prairie rivers, but brawls across bars of blue pebbles, and a greenish tinge in its water hints of the snows.|$|R
50|$|Planes minutus is {{exclusively}} pelagic, inhabiting a {{wide variety}} of substrates, including Sargassum weed, <b>floating</b> <b>timbers</b> and the hulls of ships. It is often found in association with turtles, especially the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta. It had been thought that the crab fed on the turtle's faeces, but it is now thought to fill a cleaning role.|$|R
50|$|Vermillion {{lake was}} created when the logging company {{now known as}} Domtar placed a dam at the outflow portion of the Vermillion river. This created a stop flow of water {{flooding}} the area and creating the lake. The logging company used the lake to <b>float</b> <b>timber</b> to a collection station. Logging no longer occurs near the lake.|$|R
50|$|Namsen (Nååmesje) is {{the biggest}} river in Nord-Trøndelag county, in {{the central part of}} Norway. The 228 km long river flows through the {{municipalities}} of Røyrvik, Namsskogan, Grong, Overhalla, and Namsos. It traditionally has been used for <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> down from the forests to the town of Namsos, where the sawmills were located. Today parts of the Namsen are regulated by several dams.|$|R
60|$|Deep down I plunged, {{and swam}} far under water, {{to avoid a}} stroke from <b>floating</b> <b>timber,</b> and then I rose and glanced up-stream. All the air was {{fiercely}} lit with the blaze of the burning barge; a hand and arm would rise, and fall ere I could seize it. A hand was thrown up before me, the glinting fingers gripping at empty air. I caught the hand, swimming strongly with the current, for so the man could not clutch at me, and if a drowning man can be held apart, it is no great skill to save him. In this art I was not unlearned, and once had even saved two men from a wrecked barque in the long surf of St. Andrews Bay. Save for a blow from some great <b>floating</b> <b>timber,</b> I deemed that I had little to fear; nay, now I felt sure of the Maid's praise and of a rich ransom.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Forest Service {{permitted}} commercial {{logging in}} the Swan Valley starting in 1907. Early logging {{activity in the}} valley was accompanied by attempts to <b>float</b> <b>timber</b> down the Swan River, which was difficult because of the river's narrow and winding course. As a result, most of the timber ended up piled on the banks and along sandbars, forming log jams that persist to this day.|$|R
60|$|This {{time there}} was no mistake. It was a hail hardly more than a whisper, but yet so {{distinct}} as to prevent any possibility {{that it was a}} trick of the imagination. One would have said it came from the sea directly beneath the brig's stern, and Jim's face grew pale with fear as he looked quickly around without seeing so much as a <b>floating</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|R
50|$|Belarus's 3,000 {{streams and}} 4,000 lakes are major {{features}} of the landscape and are used for <b>floating</b> <b>timber,</b> shipping, and power generation. Major rivers are the west-flowing Western Dvina and Nyoman rivers, and the south-flowing Dniapro River with its tributaries, the Berezina, Sozh, and Prypyat rivers. The Prypyat River {{has served as a}} bridge between the Dnepr, flowing to Ukraine and the Vistula in Poland since the period of Kievan Rus'.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the county}} of Forcalquier {{stretched}} all along the Durance, from Cavaillon to La Roche-de-Rame, close to Embrun. From the 12th to the 19th century, the river was used for <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> downstream, in particular by the monks of Boscodon, who were given the privilege in 1191 to use the river.) The timber {{was used in the}} towns of the southern plains and in the shipyards.|$|R
5000|$|To {{the north}} of Derry Lodge is a point on the burn called Derry Dam. A sluice was built here early in the 19th century by Alexander Davidson who used it to help <b>float</b> <b>timber</b> down the glen. Further north the Lochan Uaine is in a high corrie to the west where William Smith, an 18th century deer stalker, wrote a poem which later became a {{well-known}} song [...] "Allt an Lochain Uaine".|$|R
25|$|The Susquehanna Boom was {{a system}} of cribs and chained logs in the West Branch Susquehanna River, {{designed}} to catch and hold <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> until it could be processed {{at one of the}} nearly 60 sawmills along the river between Lycoming and Loyalsock Creeks in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The Susquehanna Boom was originally built under the supervision of James H. Perkins, and operated from 1851 to 1909, when it shut down for lack of timber.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} as Anders Jensen in Hokksund as {{a son of}} fisher Jens Jakob Paulsen (1832-1865) and Regine Christensdatter (1831-1913). After basic {{schooling}} he worked in <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> and <b>timber</b> trade, commencing merchantry in his homedistrict Øvre Eiker in 1898. In 1902 {{he moved to the}} farm Horgen in Nedre Eiker, running {{it for the rest of}} his life.|$|R

50|$|The Kapok Assault Bridge for {{infantry}} {{was developed}} for the British Army, using kapok filled canvas <b>float</b> and <b>timber</b> foot walks. America created their own version.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 19th century, {{during the}} early days of colonization, the Bear Brook was used by loggers for <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> to sawmills, a few of which {{operated}} in Carlsbad Springs from 1854 to 1905. It was also used by settlers for transportation to their homesteads. However the brook was too small and dry in the summer, and its use for transportation was quickly discontinued upon completion of Russell Road. All the surrounding mature forests have been logged, and consequently the brook drains faster.|$|R
50|$|The Umba is {{also used}} for <b>timber</b> <b>floating.</b>|$|R
5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|R
5|$|Lock Haven's economy, {{from the}} city's {{founding}} in 1833 {{until the end}} of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. Loggers used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to <b>float</b> <b>timber</b> to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.|$|R
25|$|The Susquehanna Boom was {{a system}} of cribs and chained logs in the West Branch Susquehanna River, {{designed}} to catch and hold <b>floating</b> <b>timber</b> until it could be processed {{at one of the}} nearly 60 sawmills along the river between Lycoming and Loyalsock Creeks in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Susquehanna State Park is located within just a small section of what was once the boom. The Susquehanna Boom was originally built under the supervision of James H. Perkins, and operated from 1851 to 1909, when it shut down for lack of timber.|$|R
