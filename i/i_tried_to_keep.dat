But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Madsen {{planned to}} create a docudrama-style film but when he {{discovered}} Ketty was a Russian spy and had {{a love affair with}} Flammen he changed his mind. This finding [...] "forced me to make the film a much more stylish, more noirish piece of work." [...] "Even so, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a soft touch style-wise out of respect for the film's subject," [...] said Madsen. He tried to make it feel real by [...] "eliminating the distance to 1944" [...] and directing the film as if it were set in the present.|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it {{in the back of my}} mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E

40|$|Paintings and {{drawings}} are the physical representations of my {{dialogue with the}} world around me. Art is how I connect to what is too large, or too vague, or too personally meaningful to express in any other way. 	Space and its transformation by light and color have always been central to this dialogue. I am particularly intrigued by spatial ambiguity. Space exists for us only in how it relates to us and so, space changes. One viewpoint or state of mind might make space seem freeing, while another makes the same space feel confining. Barriers are sometimes delineated, sometimes obscured. At other times, they are broken. This has a political implication which appears in my work as fissures, fences, compression, and collapse. The space of my inner self, the space outside, and {{the space between the}} two are relationships that drive what I paint and draw. My art is the place where I acknowledge the cracks in the ice and where <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from falling through when the ground opens up. Shifting planes are where <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my balance while peeking through the cracks and over the edge...|$|R
