40|$|ABSTRACT—Recent {{cladistic}} analyses {{have all}} suggested a diapsid origin of ichthyosaurs. However, an intermediate evolutionary {{stage of the}} lower <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of ichthyosaurian skull between basal diapsids and derived ichthyosaurs has been absent from the fossil record. Here we describe the cranial skeleton of a new mixosaurid ichthyosaur specimen with a well-preserved lower <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> from the Anisian Guanling Formation of eastern Yunnan. It {{is characterized by the}} most primitive lower <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> within known ichthyosaurs. The primitive characters of the lower <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> include both external and internal separation between the jugal and the quadratojugal, an anterior process of the quadratojugal, an apparent posteroventral process of the jugal, and a large lower temporal opening surrounded by the jugal, the postorbital, the squamosal, and the quadratojugal. The lower <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of this specimen provides the most direct evidence to the diapsid origin of ichthyosaurs. It also suggests that the disappearance of the lower temporal fenestra is caused initially by the reduction of the lower temporal arcade rather than the enlargement of the surrounding bones...|$|R

30|$|Reptiles have {{achieved}} highly diverse morphological and physiological traits {{that allow them}} to exploit various ecological niches and resources. Morphology of the <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of the reptilian skull is highly diverse and historically it has been treated as an important character for classifying reptiles and has helped us understand the ecology and physiology of each species. However, the developmental mechanism that generates diversity of reptilian skull morphology is poorly understood. We reveal a potential developmental basis that generates morphological diversity in the <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of the reptilian skull by performing a comparative analysis of gene expression in the embryos of reptile species with different skull morphology. By investigating genes known to regulate early osteoblast development, we find dorsoventrally broadened unique expression of the early osteoblast marker, Runx 2, in the <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of the head of turtle embryos that do not form temporal fenestrae. We also observe that Msx 2 is also uniquely expressed in the mesenchymal cells distributed at the <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of the head of turtle embryos. Furthermore, through comparison of gene expression pattern in the embryos of turtle, crocodile, and snake species, we find a possible correlation between the spatial patterns of Runx 2 and Msx 2 expression in cranial mesenchymal cells and skull morphology of each reptilian lineage. Regulatory modifications of Runx 2 and Msx 2 expression in osteogenic mesenchymal precursor cells are likely involved in generating morphological diversity in the <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> of the reptilian skull.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{suggests}} that white matter integrity may play an underlying pathophysiological role in schizophrenia. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), {{as measured by}} Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), is a neuronal marker and is decreased in white matter lesions and regions of axonal loss. It has also {{been found to be}} reduced in the prefrontal and <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> in patients with schizophrenia. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows one to measure the orientations of axonal tracts as well as the coherence of axonal bundles. DTI is thus sensitive to demyelination and other structural abnormalities. DTI has also shown abnormalities in these regions. Methods MRS and DTI were obtained on 42 healthy subjects and 40 subjects with schizophrenia. The data was analyzed using regions of interests in the Dorso-Lateral Prefrontal white matter, Medial Temporal white matter and Occipital white matter using both imaging modalities. Results NAA was significantly reduced in the patient population in the Medial <b>Temporal</b> <b>regions.</b> DTI anisotropy indices were also reduced in the same Medial <b>Temporal</b> <b>regions.</b> NAA and DTI-anisotropy indices were also correlated in the left medial <b>temporal</b> <b>region.</b> Conclusion Our results implicate defects in the medial temporal white matter in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, MRS and DTI are complementary modalities for the study of white matter disruptions in patients with schizophrenia. </p...|$|R
40|$|The brain’s {{remarkable}} {{capacity for}} language requires bidirectional interactions between functionally specialized brain regions. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate interregional interactions {{in the brain}} network for language while 102 participants were reading sentences. Using Granger causality analysis, we identified inferior frontal cortex and anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> to receive widespread input and middle <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> to send widespread output. This fits well {{with the notion that}} these regions {{play a central role in}} language processing. Characterization of the functional topology of this network, using data-driven matrix factorization, which allowed for partitioning into a set of subnetworks, revealed directed connections at distinct frequencies of interaction. Connections originating from <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> peaked at alpha frequency, whereas connections originating from frontal and parietal regions peaked at beta frequency. These findings indicate that the information flow between language-relevant brain areas, which is required for linguistic processing, may depend on the contributions of distinct brain rhythm...|$|R

40|$|Pain is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} with a strong affective-emotional component {{in addition to a}} sensory-discriminative one. This causes the activation of multiple brain areas, which process different aspects of pain simultaneously. We investigated the effects of diazepam (DZ) on a well-known pattern of brain regions activated by cold, tonic pain stimuli. Quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed by single photon emission tomography (SPET) and the Xe- 133 inhalatory method, at rest and during tonic pain activation in eight normal, right-handed, male volunteers. The cold pressor test (CPT) was performed by immersion of the left hand in cold water twice, first during CPT alone, and again 30 min after intravenous administration of diazepam (CPT+DZ). During CPT we observed a significant CBF increase in the right thalamus, primary sensory-motor cortex (S 1 /M 1), frontal and <b>temporal</b> <b>regions,</b> and in the left <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). During CPT+DZ, the average CBF was significantly lower than during the CPT state (- 11 %, P< 0. 05). After normalisation, during CPT+DZ we again observed a significant CBF increase in the right thalamus, S 1 /M 1 and frontal regions, and in the left ACC, though not in the <b>temporal</b> <b>regions.</b> DZ administration first causes a global reduction in CBF, then modifies the pattern of brain activation. During CPT, activation of the <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> has been interpreted as part of the affective-emotional component of pain response. DZ seems to affect the "pain-related" pattern of activation by abolishing the CBF increase in the <b>temporal</b> <b>regions,</b> without, however, modifying the pain perception or determining a sedating effect...|$|R

40|$|Previous neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{reported}} that learning multisensory associations involves the superior <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> (Tanabe et al, 2005).

Eighteen right-handed college-aged Japanese participants learned associations between meaningless pictures and words (Vw), meaningless sounds and words (Aw), and meaningless sounds and visual words (W). During fMRI scanning, participants were presented with old and new words and were required to judge whether the words {{were included in the}} conditions of Vw, Aw, W or New. We found that the left superior <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> showed greater activity during the retrieval of words learned in Aw than in Vw, whereas no region showed greater activity for the Vw condition versus the Aw condition (k > 10, p <. 001, uncorrected).

40|$|Spiral-in/out {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) methods acquire one image before the echo time (TE) and a second image after TE during each scan.

In this study, task activation with the spiral-in/out method was compared to that with conventional spiral-out acquisitions at two field strengths (1. 5 and 3. 0 T) using episodic memory encoding, verbal working memory, and affective processing tasks in eight human volunteers. With the conventional spiral-out sequence, greater signal dropout is observed in lateral and medial prefrontal, amygdalar, and medial <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> at 3 T relative to 1. 5 T, whereas such dropout at 3 T is reduced or mitigated with the spiral-in/out method.

40|$|Objective To use novel {{methods to}} examine age {{associations}} across an integrated brain network in healthy older adults (HOA) and individuals with late-life depression (LLD). Graph theory metrics describe the organizational configuration {{of both the}} global network and specified brain regions. Methods Cross-sectional data were acquired. Graph theory was used to explore diffusion tensor imaging–derived white matter networks. Forty-eight HOA and 28 adults with LLD were recruited from the community. Global and local metrics in prefrontal, cingulate, and <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> were calculated. Group differences and associations with age were explored. Results Group differences were noted in local metrics of the right prefrontal and <b>temporal</b> <b>regions,</b> but {{no significant differences were}} observed on global metrics. Local (not global) metrics were associated with age differently across groups. For HOA, local metrics across all regions correlated with age, whereas in adults with LLD, correlations were only observed within <b>temporal</b> <b>regions.</b> In keeping with hypothesized regions impacted by LLD, stronger hubs in right <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> were observed among HOA, whereas LLD individuals were characterized by robust hubs in frontal regions.

40|$|Episodic memory {{retrieval}} {{most often}} recruits multiple separate {{processes that are}} thought to involve different <b>temporal</b> <b>regions.</b> Previous studies suggest dissociable regions in the left lateral parietal cortex {{that are associated with}} the retrieval processes. Moreover, studies using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) have provided evidence for the temporo-parietal memory networks that may support the retrieval processes. In this functional MRI study, we tested functional significance of the memory networks by examining functional connectivity of brain activity during episodic retrieval in the <b>temporal</b> and parietal <b>regions</b> of the memory networks. Recency judgments, judgments of the temporal order of past events, can be achieved by at least two retrieval processes, relational and item-based. Neuroimaging results revealed several temporal and parietal activations associated with relational/item-based recency judgments. Significant RSFC was observed between one parahippocampal region and one left lateral parietal region associated with relational recency judgments, and between four lateral <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> and another left lateral parietal region associated with item-based recency judgments. Functional connectivity during task was found to be significant between the parahippocampal region and the parietal region in the RSFC network associated with relational recency judgments. However, out of the four tempo-parietal RSFC networks associated with item-based recency judgments, only one of them (between the left posterior lateral <b>temporal</b> <b>region</b> and the left lateral parietal region) showed significant functional connectivity during task. These results highlight the contrasting roles of the parahippocampal and the lateral <b>temporal</b> <b>regions</b> in recency judgments, and suggest that only a part of the tempo-parietal RSFC networks are recruited to support particular retrieval processes...|$|R
