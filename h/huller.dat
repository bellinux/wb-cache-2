25|$|The {{seeds of}} the rice plant are first milled using a rice <b>huller</b> to remove the chaff (the outer husks of the grain). At {{this point in the}} process, the product is called brown rice. The milling may be continued, {{removing}} the bran, i.e., the rest of the husk and the germ, thereby creating white rice. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the disease beriberi.|$|E
25|$|Millwright George Appel, from Sterling, Illinois, leased the mill, {{adjacent}} {{land and buildings}} in 1892. Appel, a recent German immigrant to the United States, oat <b>huller</b> and made oatmeal, corn meal, flour, and bran at the mill with his son. The mill, properly known as the Malvern Roller Mill or Malvern Milling Company, {{became known as the}} Appel Mill during this time period. The Appel family held the mill from its purchase in 1892 until 1985. Flour and meal, marketed under the Malvern Roller Mill name, was marketed in Sterling, shipped out the railroad and sold in far away location such as New York City and England.|$|E
50|$|Under {{its first}} {{research}} director, Hugo Hampp (from 1926 to 1944), the institute focussed on countering the Peronosporaceae infections of the hop plants, which were causing downy mildew, primarily {{by means of}} pesticides. Hampp's successor, Friedrich Zattler (from 1944 to 1970), shifted the focus towards breeding of mildew-resistant hop varieties. This resulted in the new varieties <b>Hüller</b> Anfang (1962), <b>Hüller</b> Aroma (1962), <b>Hüller</b> Fortschritt (1964), <b>Hüller</b> Bitterer (1970), and Hallertauer Gold (1974).|$|E
40|$|Bounding <b>hull,</b> such as convex <b>hull,</b> concave <b>hull,</b> alpha shapes etc. has vast {{applications}} {{in different areas}} especially in computational geometry. Alpha shape and concave <b>hull</b> are generalizations of convex <b>hull.</b> Unlike the convex <b>hull,</b> they construct non-convex enclosure {{on a set of}} points. In this paper, we introduce another generalization of convex <b>hull,</b> named alpha-concave <b>hull,</b> and compare this concept with convex <b>hull</b> and alpha shape. We show that the alpha-concave <b>hull</b> is also a generalization of an NP-complete problem named min-area TSP.

50|$|The double <b>hull</b> of a {{submarine}} {{is different from}} a ship's double <b>hull.</b> The external <b>hull,</b> which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer <b>hull,</b> casing or light <b>hull.</b> This term is especially appropriate for Russian submarine construction, where the light <b>hull</b> is usually made of steel that is only 2 to 4 millimetres thick, as {{it has the same}} pressure on both sides. The light <b>hull</b> can be used to mount equipment, which if attached directly to the pressure <b>hull</b> could cause unnecessary stress. The double <b>hull</b> approach also saves space inside the pressure <b>hull,</b> as the ring stiffeners and longitudinals can be located between the <b>hulls.</b> These measures help minimise the size of the pressure <b>hull,</b> which is much heavier than the light <b>hull.</b> Also, in case the submarine is damaged, the light <b>hull</b> takes some of the damage and does not compromise the vessel's integrity, as long as the pressure <b>hull</b> is intact.|$|R
30|$|When {{computing}} the convex <b>hull</b> in S. G. Akl’s algorithm, {{the upper}} <b>hull</b> {{and the lower}} <b>hull</b> are separated calculated by finding the unique edges; and then the desired final convex <b>hull</b> is the merging of the upper <b>hull</b> and the lower <b>hull.</b>|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the Birdsell Clover <b>Huller</b> was {{the most}} popular clover <b>huller</b> in the United States. A farmer who {{invested}} a few hundred dollars in a Birdsell Clover <b>Huller</b> could use the seeds on his own farm as well as sell the excess to other farms. As the midwest replaced the east as the agricultural center of the United States, machines like the Birdsell Clover <b>Huller</b> (along with the Oliver Chilled Plow, the John Deere tractor, {{and a host of other}} new farm technologies) contributed towards America’s shift from small, subsistence level farming to large, industrial farming.|$|E
50|$|By 1990, Engelberg hullers {{were still}} {{widely used in}} small mills for milling rice for local markets. The hullers are still in use {{in many parts of}} the world. As of 2011, the Syracuse-based branch of what was the Engelberg <b>Huller</b> Company {{continues}} to produce hullers and associated parts. Engelberg <b>Huller</b> Company was sold to an agricultural equipment manufacturer located in Nicholson, PA, in 1976. CEO and Owner in 1976 was James Solon. Engelberg <b>Huller</b> Co., INC is still operating a manufacturing plant in Nicholson, PA, exporting Engelberg spare parts and equipment.|$|E
50|$|The Engelberg <b>huller</b> uses steel rollers {{to remove}} the husk. Other types of <b>huller</b> include the disk or cono <b>huller</b> which uses an {{abrasive}} rotating disk to first remove the husk before passing the grain to conical rollers which polish it, this is done repeatedly since other sides of circular side of rice are nut husked. Rubber rollers {{may be used to}} reduce the amount of breakage of the grains, so increasing the yield of the best quality head rice, but the rubber rollers tend to require frequent replacement, which can be a significant drawback.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{submarines}} and submersibles, {{as well as}} {{the oldest}} ones, usually have a single <b>hull.</b> Large submarines generally have an additional <b>hull</b> or <b>hull</b> sections outside. This external <b>hull,</b> which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer <b>hull</b> (casing in the Royal Navy) or light <b>hull,</b> as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer <b>hull</b> there is a strong <b>hull,</b> or pressure <b>hull,</b> which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.|$|R
