5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of <b>harmony</b> <b>and</b> tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour <b>harmony</b> <b>and</b> player loyalty in 1948 {{was thrown into}} a {{different}} light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E

Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons.

5|$|All of Chopin's {{compositions}} {{include the}} piano. Most are for solo piano, though {{he also wrote}} two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented {{the concept of the}} instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his composition style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and <b>harmony,</b> <b>and</b> his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.|$|E

5|$|Elmo Hope {{was born}} on June 27, 1923, in New York City. His parents, Simon and Gertrude Hope, were {{immigrants}} from the Caribbean, and had several children. Elmo began playing the piano aged seven. He had classical music lessons as a child, and won solo piano recital contests from 1938. Fellow pianist Bud Powell was a childhood friend; together, they played and listened to jazz and classical music. Hope attended Benjamin Franklin High School, which was known for its music program. He developed an excellent understanding of <b>harmony,</b> <b>and</b> composed jazz and classical pieces at school.|$|E
5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of <b>harmony</b> <b>and</b> melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build <b>harmony</b> <b>and</b> melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E

2500|$|Debussy's <b>harmonies</b> <b>and</b> chord progressions {{frequently}} exploit dissonances {{without any}} formal resolution. Unlike in his earlier work, {{he no longer}} hides discords in lush <b>harmonies,</b> <b>and</b> the forms are far more irregular and fragmented. These chords that seemingly had no resolution were described by Debussy himself as [...] "floating chords", and were used to set tone and mood in many of his works. The whole tone scale dominates much of his late music.|$|R
