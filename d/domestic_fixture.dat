Eventually the club settled on the Northumberland Development Project, whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the White Hart Lane site. [...] In 2016, the northeast corner of White Hart Lane was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium.

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Bhutan {{is one of the}} weakest teams in the world from both a {{domestic}} and a national perspective, the sport continues to enjoy huge popularity throughout the country. When the World Cup trophy was brought to Bhutan prior to the 2014 World Cup as part of a ninety-country tour by FIFA, thousands gathered at Changlimithang just to glimpse it. Even though this popular support for the game exists, clubs still struggle financially, with greater interest in European leagues than domestic competition. Little to no income is generated from the paltry crowds that attend <b>domestic</b> <b>fixtures,</b> as entry is normally free. Instead clubs are reliant on the generosity and passion of individuals to finance clubs, with the football federation only able to provide clubs with Nu 100,000 per season and Nu 20,000 for travel expenses, so professional players are a rarity in the country. Attempts to bring in foreign players are often stymied by stringent immigration rules, although when applications have been successful, such as in the instance of Nigerian player Chichi, there has been a significant increase in attendances as spectators want to see the foreign player.|$|R
