40|$|Abstract Objective To examine in Peru {{the nature}} of dual {{practice}} (doctors <b>holding</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> at once – usually public sector doctors with private practices), {{the factors that influence}} individuals' decisions to undertake dual practice, the conditions faced when doing so and the potential role of regulatory intervention in this area. Methods The study entailed qualitative interviews with a sample of twenty medical practitioners based in metropolitan Lima, representing a cross-section of those primarily employed in either the private or public sectors and engaged in clinical practice or policy making. The interviews focused on: 1. individuals' experience with dual practice; 2. the general underlying pressures that influence {{the nature and extent of}} such activities; and 3. attitudes toward, and the influence of, regulation on such activities. Results Dual practice is an activity that is widespread and well-accepted, and the prime personal motivation is financial. However, there are also a number of important broad macroeconomic influences on dual practice particularly the oversupply of medical services, the deregulated nature of this market, and the economic crisis throughout the country, which combine to create major hardships for those attempting to make a living through medical practice. There is some support among doctors for tighter regulation. Conclusion Research findings suggest appropriate policy responses to dual practice involve tighter controls on the supply of medical practitioners; alleviation of financial pressures brought by macro-economic conditions; and closer regulation of such activities to ensure some degree of collective action over quality and the maintenance of professional reputations. Further research into this issue in rural areas is needed to ascertain the geographical generalizability of these policy responses. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{enhancing the}} knowledge about dual job holding. While most studies in labor economics assume {{that each person}} holds only one job, {{a significant part of}} the work force <b>holds</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> simultaneously. The first part of the dissertation empirically analyzes the determinants of wages for dual jobholders, with an emphasis on the contribution of the "on the job" human capital accumulation. In order to increase the number of observations, data from 1990 to 1994 have been pulled together, thus resulting in a panel. The usual problem associated with panel data, together with the need to control for the selection bias, makes the full information maximum likelihood estimation very challenging. New econometric techniques developed by Wooldridge (Journal of Econometrics, 1995) and Vella and Verbeek (Journal of Econometrics, 1999) are used to overcome this problem. We found some evidence that the motivation behind the decision to <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> may play an important role in determining the market return of moonlighting. Given the results of the first study, I explore the motivations that induce workers to <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> and I explicitly design a labor supply function that includes these different motivations. I identify two major motivations: I call the first motivation the "hours constraint model". The hours constraint model says that workers underemployed will seek a second job in order to fulfill the gap in their work schedule. Yet, some workers may decide to <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> simply because each job has some peculiar characteristics that makes it appealing to the worker. I call this motivation the "job portfolio model". The last part of the dissertation looks at the impact of hours regulation on the decision to <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs.</b> The understanding of this relationship is important in order to address the real impact of time-sharing policies on reducing unemployment. By enforcing stricter working week standards, labor policies aim at creating new jobs by inducing employers to shift from an intensive to and extensive use of workers. However I found that reducing the working week causes some workers to be underemployed, thus increasing the number of moonlighters...|$|R

30|$|Gender {{differences}} in moonlighting behavior and moonlighting wages have been explored by Averett (2001) {{who does not}} find substantial {{differences in}} the factors leading {{men and women to}} moonlight. Yet, the results Amuedo-Dorantes and Kimmel (2005) indicate that female moonlighters {{are much more likely to}} combine a full-time primary job with a part-time secondary job, while male moonlighters are more likely to <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> full-time <b>jobs.</b> In general, gender differences may be induced by e.g. family responsibilities and occupational segregation (Highfill et  al. 1995; Allen 1998).|$|R
30|$|Working {{overtime}} and getting overtime hours paid points to hours and earnings adjustments {{that might have}} a negative effect on moonlighting if the ‘hours-constraints’ motive prevails. Expectations regarding part-time jobs are ambiguous because such occupation might be voluntary or involuntary: if part-time jobs are accompanied with moonlighting, this might, on the one hand, hint towards an insufficient hours capacity on the first job. It might, on the other hand, support the ‘heterogeneous-jobs’ motive as working part-time on a stable and secure job might allow to take a second job that has other non-monetary amenities. Furthermore, <b>holding</b> <b>two</b> part-time <b>jobs</b> might simply be a means of workers' labor flexibility.|$|R

Around this time, approximately two thirds of the military officers based in Spain’s largest cities were involved in the practice of moonlighting. However, only a few of them made the drastic decision to leave the Army, as Gutierrez Mellado did, considering it unethical to <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> different <b>jobs</b> {{at the same time and}} led to the detriment of his military commitment.|$|R
50|$|Based on The Glass Menagerie, {{the movie}} details {{the story of}} Yalda (Negar Javaherian), a {{disabled}} girl who has a great interest for collecting glass animals and harbors a secret attraction towards her brother Ehsan's best friend Reza (Parsa Pirouzfar). Her brother Ehsan (Saber Abar), whose voiceover introduces the film, writes poetry and desperately dreams of leaving Iran. He dreams of being a writer and spends his spare time haunting cinemas and watching old movies over and over. Farideh (Fatemeh Motamed-Aria) <b>holds</b> down <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> to help support her family. Farideh is {{the only member of}} the family who interacts with the brutal conditions of Iran and willingly takes the challenge. Farideh is trying her best to find a prompt suitor for her introvert daughter Yalda.|$|R
30|$|There {{are also}} other {{possible}} moonlighting motives. While 10 – 15 % of moonlighters want to ‘gain experience {{to build up}} a business’, more than   15 % simply ‘enjoy {{the work on the}} second job’ (ibid.). These findings hint towards additional motives for moonlighting other than hours-constraints. There consequently are a few studies that extend the initial theoretical background by ideas that are subsumed under the so-called ‘heterogeneous-jobs’ motive. In general, this refers to jobs that are not perfect substitutes. Typical examples are the university professor who uses her expertise in consulting or the musician who cannot make a living from her performances only and thus holds a regular job to keep up to her expenses. Mothers of young children are another example since they may <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> part-time <b>jobs</b> that suit their time-allocation needs of arranging child care better than one full-time occupation.|$|R

Mendoza took an unpaid leave from her job as a project coordinator with the city of Chicago when she went to Springfield for legislative business, usually collecting only half of her published $73,000 salary in that position as a result. She replied: “It is an obvious example that the governor is a pathological liar.

40|$|I {{explore the}} {{theoretical}} foundations and the empirical {{relevance of the}} idea that entrepreneurship in developing countries could arise out of poor or non-existent alternatives. In the first chapter, I use an occupational choice model to show that the observed large increase in the rate of business ownership in rural Thailand during the 1997 Asian crisis can be explained by a negative shock to the labor market. According to my GMM estimates, a 47 % fall in the outside option of entrepreneurship is required to explain the observed increase in business ownership from 17 % to 37 % between 1997 and 1998. I find that endogenously starting a business enabled households to offset about 40 % of the income loss during the crisis, but also that low entrepreneurial productivity limits the extent to which pro-business policies can stand in as unemployment insurance for the average household. In the second chapter, joint with A. Karaivanov, we explicitly model and distinguish between voluntary and so-called involuntary entrepreneurship, which arises for those who prefer the non-business occupation (e. g., wage work) but cannot obtain it (with some probability that we estimate), due to labor market frictions. We also allow for credit constraints and analyze their interaction with the labor market constraint. We estimate the model via GMM using data from semi-urban Thailand from 2005, and find that 11 % of all households in our sample (approximately 17 % of all households running a business) are classified as involuntary entrepreneurs. While there are large potential income gains, especially for poorer households, from relaxing either the labor market or credit constraints, involuntary entrepreneurship can only be significantly reduced by addressing the labor market constraint. In the final chapter, I structurally estimate a model in which risk neutral agents maximize total income by optimally allocating capital and labor into entrepreneurship, subject to credit and time constraints. I estimate the model via GMM using 2005 Thai urban data, where about 20 % of business owners report a second occupation. I find that while most entrepreneurs that <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> are skill-constrained (the first-best scale of the business does not exhaust the time-constraint), there is a small fraction that are credit-constrained. These two groups within the multiple occupation group are also predicted to be considerably heterogeneous in terms of initial wealth, schooling and entrepreneurial talent...|$|R
30|$|Our primary {{estimation}} sample includes 1, 850, 757 non-student {{wage and}} salary workers (on their primary job), ages 18 – 65, for 1998 through 2013, located in 258 MSAs throughout the USA (this accounts for roughly {{three quarters of the}} US workforce). 10 In this sample, the (unweighted) MJH rate is 5.0  %, with 1, 757, 547 single job holders and 93, 210 multiple job holders (few of these <b>hold</b> more than <b>two</b> <b>jobs).</b> 11 As explained when we discuss Table  1, weighting lowers the MJH rate to 4.7  %. Workers self-employed in their primary job but with a {{wage and salary}} second job are counted by BLS as multiple job holders, but we exclude them from our sample given that earnings (and other) information is not provided for their self-employment job. This large national sample of workers over 16  years provides us with substantial statistical power and the ability to examine differences both across labor markets and over time.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the labour quality {{explanation of the}} employer size?wage gap: larger firms pay higher wages because they employ more skilled workers. Most previous studies control for unobserved skills of workers using longitudinal data and the fixed effects estimator thus relying on a questionable assumption of time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity. This paper releases this assumption by using a sample of workers who simultaneously <b>hold</b> <b>two</b> jobs; hence, identification is achieved by differencing across <b>two</b> <b>jobs</b> held {{at the same time}} rather than in different periods. A caveat of this approach is possible heterogeneity of the two jobs; this issue is discussed in details in the paper. Based on data from the UK Quarterly Labour Force Survey, this study finds little support for the labour quality explanation: controlling for unobserved skills in the sample of moonlighters does not reduce the estimate of the wage gap...|$|R

40|$|In July 2001 the Center for Impact Research (CIR) {{completed}} a needs assessment, Barriers to English Language Learners in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which detailed {{the needs of}} immigrant working adults for English instruction and determined the barriers they faced in learning English. CIR's 2001 report documented {{the fact that many}} of these employed immigrants take advantage of overtime, <b>hold</b> down <b>two</b> <b>jobs,</b> and are often subject to changing or rotating work schedules that make attendance at regularly scheduled classes difficult. Evening English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes that occur twice a week lasting between one-and-a-half to three hours also present difficulties, because they interfere with parenting and family duties; fatigue of the attendees after a long day's work also makes learning problematic. Some Friday evening and Saturday morning classes are available, but seldom are there any classes on Sundays. ESOL providers report that they are unable to schedule weekend classes because of the lack of trained and qualified teachers who are willing to work on Saturdays and Sundays. Volunteer tutors could assist ESOL learners, but they too are reluctant to make commitments for weekend hours. The metropolitan Chicago ESOL system faces an additional problem in that it cannot meet the needs of those immigrants who are interested in, and able to attend ESOL classes. CIR's analysis of demographic data finds an estimated total population of potential English Language Learners 18 years of age or older in the Chicago metropolitan area in 2000 at 277, 700. According to the Illinois Community College Board, in Fiscal Year 2001 68, 815 adults in the Chicago metropolitan area received some ESOL instruction through programs funded by the Board, meaning that only about one-quarter of the need was able to be met. Sixty-two percent of these learners were in beginning ESOL classes. Many area ESOL providers report long waiting lists for ESOL classes, and some say they are implementing lotteries for classroom places. How then, can ESOL learning be reorganized to enable adult learners who are employed to upgrade their English language skills? Can ESOL services be offered along a continuum, with systems providing various services, geared to immigrants with differing levels of commitment to learning English, as well as changing or rotating schedules and time limitations? How can effective learning opportunities be offered in the home, at the workplace, and in accessible community locations, such as shopping centers and churches...|$|R
50|$|Jean {{forms an}} {{unlikely}} friendship with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and supports Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) following his nervous breakdown. When he recovers {{and decides to}} open up a new restaurant he appoints Jean as his sous-chef. However the stress of <b>holding</b> down <b>two</b> <b>jobs,</b> coupled with Ian's constant bullying, results in Jean quitting, especially when she falsely accuses Ian of sexually harassing her. Drowning her sorrows with Shirley and Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer), Jean realises that she has left her handbag at the restaurant and they break in at night to retrieve it. Shirley and Bianca continue to get drunk and a fire soon breaks out; the sprinkler system puts it out but floods the restaurant. The women escape unseen, but Jean struggles with her guilt. She confesses to Kat, who convinces her to keep quiet but when Jean volunteers to help clean up the restaurant with Ian she confesses to him. Ian threatens to call the police, but he later decides against it. Jean takes up an allotment, where she meets Ollie Walters (Tony O'Callaghan). Ollie asks Jean on a date but she is reluctant upon finding out he is a retired police officer, but Kat and Alfie convince her to go. She confesses about her recent crimes to Ollie on their second date, but he tells her it does not matter as she was not charged so she can forget about it. Their date goes well and afterwards Jean invites Ollie to spend the night with her. Eventually, Jean tells Ollie about her bipolar disorder, despite worrying that he would reject her. He researches the illness but Jean realises that he does not really want to be with someone who has a mental illness, so they break up. She tries to reunite with him later but discovers he is retiring to Brighton. She attends his retirement party but leaves before he sees her. Ollie comes to visit Jean asking if she would move to Brighton with him, but Kat tells Jean not to go as she is needed in Walford. However Kat later regrets this and tells Jean she should go. Jean then leaves Walford with Ollie {{to start a new life}} in Brighton after saying an emotional farewell to Kat and Alfie.|$|R
