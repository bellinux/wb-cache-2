500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} during a hiatus time in The Who's touring schedule. The top single off the album, [...] "Giving it All Away", reached number {{five in the}} UK and the album made the Top 50 in the United States. He also released a single in 1973, [...] "Thinking" [...] with B-side [...] "There is Love" [...] which features Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin on guitar. Bizarrely, the British release, with considerable airplay of [...] "Giving it All Away" [...] (first lines [...] "I paid all my dues so I picked up my shoes, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walked away") coincided with news reports of The Who being sued for unpaid damage to their hotel on a recent tour, including a TV set being {{thrown out of the}} window.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, On the Waterfront {{received}} glowing {{reviews from}} critics {{and was a}} commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2million in rentals at the North American box office in 1954. In his July 29, 1954, review, The New York Times critic A. H. Weiler praised the film, calling it [...] "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American films forever and added it to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. In his autobiography, Brando was typically dismissive of his performance: [...] "On the day Gadg showed me the complete picture, I was so depressed by my performance <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> left the screening room... I thought I was a huge failure." [...] After Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the statue was stolen. Much later, it turned up at a London auction house, which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereabouts.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> slow-like <b>and</b> {{followed}} 'im. I wasn't a bit curious. Not a bit. But {{if a man}} {{asks for}} my 'elp I always give it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> then <b>and</b> {{approached}} her, with {{a strange}} sort of anxiety. I {{looked down at her}} round, strong neck, then stooped low enough to peep at her face. And I began to tremble a little myself.|$|R
60|$|I confided all to my aunt when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home; and {{in spite}} of all she could say to me, went to bed despairing. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> despairing, <b>and</b> went out despairing. It was Saturday morning, and I went {{straight}} to the Commons.|$|R
2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I can laugh about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My first instinct when I got the ball was to fall down. Then I heard everyone yelling, 'Get up! Get up!' So <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> here comes someone sneaking underneath me, and he hit the ball." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{walked to}} the window, and came back again and stood before her.|$|E
60|$|At this point, finding Hans hopeless, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walked away, {{leaving him}} to finish our preparations.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> bright <b>and</b> {{early the}} next morning and got a tiptop breakfast, which Alexander Abraham condescended to eat. When the {{provision}} man came into the yard I called to him from the window to bring me a box of soap in the afternoon, and then I tackled the sitting-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{directly}} {{everybody was}} asleep last night--it wasn't till after one, {{as there was}} a rag on--Moriarty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> dressed, <b>and</b> climbed <b>up</b> into the gallery. Ye know the gallery windows? They open at the top, an' it's rather hard {{to get out of}} them. But we managed it, and dropped on to the gravel outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have done}} with frivolity. This morning I was awakened by Mrs. Sutherland at the door. [...] "There's a ship ashore at Shaltigoe!" [...] As my senses slowly flooded, I heard the {{whistling}} and the roaring of wind, and the lashing of gust-blown and uncertain flaws of rain. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> dressed, <b>and</b> went out. The mizzled sky and rain blinded you.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{started to}} go into my study. She half rose, and her sewing fell to the floor.|$|E
60|$|I am dark, {{with brown}} eyes. Just then I detested Max. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said I {{was going to}} get some milk for Fatima.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> took my hat. She patted {{me on the}} shoulder. I {{could have}} {{throttled}} her at that moment. And yet she was right.|$|E
60|$|ISABEL. I don't quite know--they were so far off. But {{this one}} was, oh, so big! {{and it had}} great wings, as wide as--twice over the ceiling. So, when it was picking <b>up</b> Sindbad, Florrie <b>and</b> I thought it wouldn't know if we got on its back too: so <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> first, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> pulled <b>up</b> Florrie, <b>and</b> we put our arms round its neck, and away it flew.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always get}} <b>up</b> before breakfast <b>and</b> read {{the morning paper}} {{whenever}} I happen to be within the radius of a Hoe cylinder or a Washington hand-press. The next morning <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early, <b>and</b> found a Lexington daily {{on the front porch}} where the carrier had thrown it. The first thing I saw in it was a double-column ad. on the front page that read like this: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fought like a lion," [...] ses Sam. [...] "Twice they 'ad me down, <b>and</b> twice <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> agin <b>and</b> {{hammered}} 'em. They both of 'em 'ad knives, but {{my blood}} was <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I didn't {{take no more}} notice of 'em than if they was made of paper. I knocked 'em both out o' their hands, and if I hit 'em in the face once I did a dozen times. I surprised myself." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{interval}} of silence, and then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> went to the fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet.|$|E
60|$|Bestowing another caress on him <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{went back}} to the house, {{thinking}} sadly as I walked that the bright weather had not yet greatly improved my spirits.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} {{walk up and down}} the room, while she watched me with a silent calm which was incomprehensible. In vain I summoned my faculties to meet it.|$|E
50|$|Following her {{stand up}} success, Underwood took {{a number of}} minor acting roles {{including}} Bad Mouth Bessie in the 1998 film <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> the Hook <b>Up,</b> <b>and</b> Catfish Rita in the 2005 film Beauty Shop.|$|R
60|$|I didn't answer 'im. I {{just turned}} round, and, arter giving a man wot stood {{in my way}} a punch in the chest, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> on deck <b>and</b> on to the wharf, and said my little say all alone to myself, behind the crane.|$|R
60|$|I was awoke by a {{sustained}} sound as of an orator speaking in an unknown tongue, {{and found myself}} in a sunny-shadowy loft, whither I suppose I must have been carried in my sleep. In a delicious languor between sleeping and waking I listened with imperturbable curiosity awhile to that voice of the unknown. Indeed, I was dozing again when a different sound, enormous, protracted, abruptly aroused me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> hot <b>and</b> trembling, not yet quite my own master, to discover its cause.|$|R
6000|$|He vanished; his footsteps, and the tap of {{his stick}} grew fainter and fainter. They died out. He was gone. Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> hastened after him. I soon stopped--what {{was there to}} say? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I could not," [...] Father Lucien agreed. [...] "That was not strange, because light {{snow was}} falling when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{the wind was}} fresh. Still I found this; it shows I was not dreaming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will hold}} {{you for a}} while, you old loony," [...] I said to myself. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> lit my pipe, for I was needing a smoke. I walked around a bit, congratulating myself on my {{brilliant}} idea.|$|E
5000|$|I {{shot down}} my first Japanese Zero at Guadalcanal. But I didn't see one coming <b>up</b> behind me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> shot <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{knocked out of}} the sky. I didn't bail out - they'll shoot {{you out of your}} {{parachute}} and if you go into the water the sharks will eat you. I was full of shrapnel wounds and had a dead stick - I'd lost the engine - but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to Guadalcanal. I was a lucky boy.|$|R
6000|$|The {{cigarette}} box, {{which she}} had taken up without removing her eyes from me, flew {{out of her hand}} and opening in mid-air scattered cigarettes for quite a surprising distance all over the room. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> at once <b>and</b> wandered off picking them up industriously. Doña Rita’s voice behind me said indifferently: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No matter," [...] {{returned}} Brooks cheerfully. [...] "I'll {{take the}} blame of it with the others. You see they'll {{have to have a}} scapegoat--and I'm just the man, for <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> the dance! <b>And</b> as I'm going away, I suppose I shall bear off the sin with me into the wilderness." ...|$|R
60|$|One {{summer morning}} the {{mosquitoes}} played {{for me with}} sleep, and won. It was half-past four, and as it had often been my humor to see Venice at that hour, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sallied forth for a stroll through the city.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mummy, there's a wreck!" [...] {{the former}} cried in excitement. [...] "I heard {{something}} an hour ago, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I've been {{sitting by the}} window, watching. I saw the lifeboat go out, and they're signalling now for the other one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was a kind}} of {{a manager}} of the place, and I reckon he'd seen me in there a good many times. He had a face like a fish and an eye like Judas, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> put one arm around his neck.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> down on {{my knees}} and prayed aloud, {{pleading}} that our Heavenly Father would let me know the right words.Around 2:00 a.m., I awakened and began to think again about the song. Words came to my mind. … <b>I</b> immediately <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> began to write the words down as they had come to me. Three verses and a chorus were soon formed.I gratefully surveyed the work, drank of the message of the words, and returned to my bedroom where I knelt before my Father in Heaven to say [...] "Thank you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{none of you}} fellows knew {{anything}} about the business," [...] said Harry. [...] "Kate <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> the company, <b>and</b> we needn't have had a Board of Directors at all, if we hadn't wanted to. If any of you boys had known anything about telegraphs we would have given you an office." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{very long}} while since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> so late, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't quite know how I came to be lying here," [...] he said. [...] "I suppose I fell asleep beside the fire, but in that case it's a little {{difficult}} to understand how <b>I</b> could have <b>got</b> the blanket and tucked myself in." ...|$|R
