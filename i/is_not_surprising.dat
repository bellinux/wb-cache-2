5|$|Considering Ragnvald's background, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he rose {{to become}} {{an officer of the}} Varangian Guard: he was a wealthy {{chieftain}} who brought many ambitious soldiers to Greece.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{then that}} Kaiser, Hunka, and Bianchini (1971) {{concluded}} that the affective symptoms of depression are less specific and appear to shift from loading on one dimension to another {{depending on the type}} of sample being studied.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, perhaps it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that {{the cure for}} {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
50|$|As a Liberal, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> when Hutchinson {{came out}} in support of Irish Home Rule.|$|R
25|$|So it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he <b>was</b> {{asked to}} serve within the new founded Austrian Scout organisation.|$|R
50|$|These {{differences}} in binding <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> since FGF ligand {{is known to}} bind to {{the second and third}} immunoglobulin domain of the receptor.|$|R
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{where there}} was an {{increasing}} interest in {{the remains of the}} city's pagan past, where scholars turned from reading Medieval Church Latin to Classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of St Augustine, the presence, in the Sistine Chapel of five pagan prophets <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Given {{that this}} seat had been Liberal {{since it was}} created in 1885, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the Conservatives did not contest the seat. Walter Moore stood as an Independent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or may be twal; just as likely." [...] And Mr. Gowran {{shook his}} head at his {{mistress}} in a most uncomfortable way. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that she should hate him.|$|R
50|$|Author Saul Bellow once {{observed}} that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> {{with all the}} revision that goes into a work, that an author might appear better on the page than in real life.|$|R
5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that their players {{dominated}} the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs {{at a much}} higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were {{a large part of the}} success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E

5000|$|... "It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he <b>was</b> {{sometimes}} {{charged with}} being domineering, even dictatorial. But {{by the great}} majority of Christians, both laymen and clergy, he was held in respect that approached awe." ...|$|R
5|$|It was {{customary}} {{when proposing}} a disputation {{to have the}} theses printed by the university press and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the Ninety-five Theses have survived, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as Luther was not famous {{and the importance of}} the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the Theses, only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the Theses on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the Theses to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all. Regardless, the Theses were well-known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{emotional}} support connection and happiness dogs provide it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that people want}} to honor and reward them with goodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of subjective tinnitus are often obscure. While it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that direct {{trauma to the}} inner ear can cause tinnitus, other apparent causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint dysfunction) are difficult to explain.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> his {{marriage}} with Beatrice should prove disastrous. Rushing into wedlock {{as he had}} done, at the ripe age of seventeen, he had known nothing of his woman, nor she of him. When his mind and soul set to develop, as Beatrice could not sympathize with his interests, he naturally inclined away from her, so that now, after twenty years, he was almost a stranger to her. That <b>was</b> <b>not</b> very <b>surprising.</b>|$|R
30|$|According to the results, {{the model}} in Eq. (17) shows that time has no {{significant}} effect on the oxidation of SO 2. These observations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> and, in fact, match the results one at a time [31].|$|R
60|$|Prescott {{admitted}} that he had not done so, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising.</b> There <b>was</b> little to distinguish the gap between the nut bushes from others that opened up all round; but Stanton seemed satisfied that he was right.|$|R
25|$|The film {{industry}} in Azerbaijan {{dates back to}} 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan {{was among the first}} countries involved in cinematography: it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that this new medium soon showed up in cosmopolitan nouveau-riche Baku {{at the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy {{was inaugurated}} as a zonal competition. It {{was named after}} Ranji's nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59). With Bombay in its catchment, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the West Zone won six of the first nine titles.|$|E
25|$|Precisely {{because he}} had {{submitted}} to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by Máel Mórda mac Murchada. Given {{the circumstances under which}} Máel Mórda had been appointed, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.|$|E
30|$|The t tests {{did find}} some {{significant}} differences. The web-generated questions were {{more relevant to}} students’ knowledge {{than the other two}} types of questions. This difference <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> because the web-mining method tended to collect questions from students.|$|R
30|$|The Awareness and Perception {{variables}} {{showed a}} statistical significant {{relationship with the}} predictor variable CLAS. These results <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> since it <b>is</b> expected that upper division students would have had more experiences related to research than freshmen or sophomores.|$|R
25|$|The division's {{performance}} in battle {{under the circumstances}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising.</b> It <b>was</b> unprepared for offensive operations against {{what turned out to}} be some of the strongest Japanese fortified positions in the South Pacific, and was severely hampered by completely inadequate fire support.|$|R
25|$|Pynson became King's Printer to Henry VII (and {{subsequently}} to Henry VIII) in 1506, {{an office}} that carried not only great prestige {{but also an}} annuity of two pounds, later raised to four pounds. Since this was a prestigious lifetime position, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he was naturalised in 1513.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the model}} of his teacher, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky’s student works such as the Symphony in E-flat, Opus 1 (1907), Scherzo fantastique, Opus 3 (1908), and Fireworks (Feu d'artifice), Opus 4 (1908), call for large orchestral forces. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> as the works were as much {{exercises}} in orchestration as in composition.|$|E
25|$|Given his record, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that the}} other Party leaders were {{suspicious}} of Beria's motives. Khrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov, but he was initially unable to challenge them. His opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous uprising against the East German Communist regime broke out in East Berlin.|$|E
60|$|After that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that Isabel {{should ask}} for a lift in our car {{as far as the}} Lurky Committee Room, and that she should offer me quite sound advice EN ROUTE upon the {{intellectual}} temperament of the Lurky gasworkers.|$|R
25|$|A learned man, Hungerford placed much {{emphasis}} on education. Hence, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that his main focus in Congress was serving on the Committee of Education and Labor. After his short stint on Capital Hill, he returned to Corning, New York to resume his banking business.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{postnatal}} depression have consistently found {{stressful life events}} to be risk factors and few studies have found no association. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> therefore, that the phenomenon of stress was mentioned by most practitioners and was strongly implicit in responses from the mothers groups.|$|R
