5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised {{that she would not}} be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 1952, despite {{advice from}} {{those close to}} him, the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya. On the morning of 6 February, George VI was found dead <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died from a {{coronary}} thrombosis in his sleep {{at the age of}} 56.

The airplane's autopilot system lands the plane at Boston's Logan Airport, where various federal agencies create {{a task force to}} investigate what occurred during the flight. F.B.I. Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> a motel, where Scott says that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham is added to the interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the {{de facto}} Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, {{finishing}} second overall. He {{was named to the}} 2006 Winter Olympic team along with Johnny Weir and Matthew Savoie. At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became sick with the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> the Olympic village, receiving fluids from IVs. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo.|$|E
25|$|After Texas gained independence, Bean {{continued}} to live around Nacogdoches until 1843, {{when he returned to}} Jalapa, Veracruz and his first wife. He died <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> her estate in 1847, at age 63. His second wife and the mother of his children, Candace Midkiff, died in 1848. She is buried in Selman-Roark Cemetery at Linwood.|$|E

25|$|Deposits most {{susceptible}} to liquefaction are young (Holocene-age, deposited {{within the last}} 10,000 years) sands and silts of similar grain size (well-sorted), <b>in</b> <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> least metres thick, and saturated with water. Such deposits are often found along stream beds, beaches, dunes, and areas where windblown silt (loess) and sand have accumulated. Some examples of soil liquefaction include quicksand, quick clay, turbidity currents, and earthquake induced liquefaction.|$|R
25|$|The narrator murders a man using {{a candle}} that emits a {{poisonous}} vapor. The victim enjoyed reading <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> night and, using the candle for illumination, dies in his poorly ventilated room. No evidence is left behind, causing the coroner {{to believe the}} man's death {{is an act of}} God. The narrator inherits the man's estate and, knowing he can never be caught, enjoys the benefits of his murderous act for many years.|$|E
25|$|The actual Edward I was {{ruthless}} and temperamental, but {{the film}} exaggerates his character for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife Eleanor of Castile, and as a religious man he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Also, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> his home.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Radio Academy named Michael {{the most}} played artist on British radio {{during the period}} 1984–2004.

Michael's first tour in 15 years, the worldwide 25 Live tour, spanned three tours {{over the course of}} three years (2006, 2007, and 2008). In the early hours of 25 December 2016, Michael, aged 53, was found dead <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> his Oxfordshire home. A coroner's report attributed his death to natural causes.|$|E

500|$|A {{larger than}} life character, Miller {{is the subject of}} many stories, often apocryphal. One story had Don Bradman {{answering}} {{a knock on the door}} late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit. Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he was <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> curfew and was now going out. His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, [...] "...one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick". As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this [...] "...almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1944, Allied attacks on railway {{networks}} had thoroughly frustrated Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Göring was not at all happy with the inability to stop Allied operations over Germany, and he questioned the commitment of several fighter wing leaders who were not flying and personally leading their units on a regular basis. On 11 May 1944, 1,000 B-17 and B-24 bombers of the 8th Air Force attacked vital railway networks in north east Belgium and eastern France, escorted by an even greater number of fighters. Oesau was sick and <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> the time but, angered by Göring's insinuations, took off with two other fighters of the Headquarters Flight in his [...] "Green 12" [...] Bf 109.|$|E
500|$|Having {{defeated}} the Grand Intellect in Invasion of the Vorticons and saved the Earth, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze is still forced {{by his parents}} to eat his vegetables at dinner. After being sent to bed, he falls asleep and wakes up in his pajamas in bed {{on top of a}} hill. Giant helmet-wearing potato men tell him that their king Boobus Tuber has brought him to their land with his Dream Machine, and Keen is now his slave. Keen puts on his Commander Keen helmet and defeats the vegetables, but finds that his raygun is now out of charge. Another child in chains runs up to him and asks Keen to defeat Boobus Tuber and save them all from the Dream Machine, and Commander Keen agrees to do so. After journeying through several outposts and cities of Tuberia, defeating various types of vegetable creatures, and collecting Boobus Bombs along the way to attack Boobus Tuber with, he reaches the castle on top of Mount Tuberest. Upon defeating Boobus Tuber and turning off the Dream Machine, Keen wakes up <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> home, where his mother informs him it is national [...] "I Hate Broccoli" [...] day.|$|E

500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would lie <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> night thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|John FitzAlan {{the father}} had been a {{prominent}} soldier in the Hundred Years' War under King Henry V, and the son followed in his father's footsteps. On 23 April 1430, the younger FitzAlan departed for France in the company of the Earl of Huntingdon. [...] There he soon {{made a name for himself}} as a soldier, under the command of the king's uncle, John, Duke of Bedford. In June he took part in the Siege of Compiègne, where Joan of Arc had recently been captured. Later, he raised the siege of Anglure with the help of the Burgundians. On 17 December 1431, he was present when Henry VI was crowned King of France in Paris, where he distinguished himself at the accompanying tournament. FitzAlan's military success led to several important appointments of command; in November 1431, he was made lieutenant of the Rouen garrison, and shortly after also captain of Vernon. [...] In January 1432 he was appointed captain of Verneuil. [...] On the night of 3 February he was taken by surprise while <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> the Great Tower of Rouen Castle, when a band of French soldiers from nearby Ricarville managed to take the castle. [...] Arundel was hoisted down the walls in a basket; and made his escape. [...] The assailants could not hold the castle, because Marshall Boussac refused to garrison the town; Guillaume de Ricarville was forced to surrender twelve days later. In April 1432, FitzAlan was rewarded for his actions so far by initiation into the Order of the Garter.|$|E

2500|$|Brando's {{first screen}} role was a bitter {{paraplegic}} veteran in The Men (1950). He {{spent a month}} <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> the Birmingham Army Hospital in Van Nuys {{to prepare for the}} role. The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther wrote that Brando as Ken [...] "is so vividly real, dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete" [...] and noted, [...] "Out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut." ...|$|E

After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing.|$|E

Harry sported red-painted toenails and tattoos {{on the bottom of}} his feet. The coroner said that Josephine had died at least two hours before Harry. There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for days about the murder-suicide or double suicide pact—they could not decide which.|$|E
