5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> several days.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{onset of}} DCS can occur rapidly after a <b>dive,</b> <b>in</b> {{more than half}} of all cases {{symptoms}} do not begin to appear for at least an hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E

5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented <b>dive,</b> <b>in</b> which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not relevant in this usage.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{responsibility}} for recreational diving service providers is usually limited {{as far as}} possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and {{has been the subject of}} considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> buddy pairs.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E

5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who dared not <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E

5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{arrived in}} Fukuoka having been chosen by {{broadcaster}} TV Asahi as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4×100m freestyle relay being held after the 400m freestyle {{on the first}} night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy {{when he reached the}} 200m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93s behind at the final turn, a final 50m burst in 24.36s saw him cut a further 0.42s from his world record. The relay saw him <b>dive</b> <b>in</b> fractionally ahead of American Jason Lezak after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87s. In the 800m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, lowering his world record by over two seconds. The 200m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1min 44.06s in the process, prompting van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft. Thorpe's winning streak was interrupted in the 100m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4×200m freestyle relay. Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians more than six seconds in arrears. Having overtaken Klim as Australia's leading 100m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4×100m medley relay team on 28 July. After Matt Welsh, Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs, Thorpe's change left him half a body length behind the new 100m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5m. This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships, and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200–400–800 treble. His performances formed the basis for Australia's gold medal win over the United States 13–9. It was also {{the first time since the}} 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet. Thorpe's achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics, which he played down.|$|E
