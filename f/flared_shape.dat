The timescale and profile of the optically thin emission are shown to be determined, in this model, by the shock formation radius, the thickness of expelled fluid slab and the variation of the front's parameters due to its transverse expansion. For a range of reasonable conditions, a variety of <b>flare</b> <b>shapes</b> can be produced, varying from roughly symmetric with exponential rises and decays, as often seen in blazars, to highly asymmetric with a fast rise and a much slower, power law decay, as seen in GRB afterglows. The onset, duration, and fluence of low-frequency (below the initial turnover frequency) and hard gamma-ray (above the initial gamma-spheric energy) outbursts are limited by opacity effects; the emission at these energies is quite generally delayed and, in the case of sufficiently short length outbursts, severely attenuated. The observational consequences are discussed. One distinctive prediction of this model is that in a single, powerful source, the upper cutoff of the gamma-ray spectrum should be correlated with the timescale of the outburst and with the amplitude of variations at long wavelengths (typically radio to millimeter) ...|$|R

We thus initiated a multi-faceted study, involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), phase contrast MRI, computational and experimental fluid dynamics methodologies, focused on {{the second stage of}} the procedure. Twenty three-dimensional computer and rapid prototype models of 2 nd stage TCPC anatomies were created, including idealized parametric geometries (n = 6), patient-specific anatomies (n = 7), and their virtual surgery variant (n = 7). Results in patient-specific and idealized models showed that the Glenn connection template is hemodynamically more efficient with (83 % p = 0. 08 in patient-specific models and 66 % in idealized models) lower power losses compared to hemi-Fontan template, respectively, due to its direct end-to-side anastomosis. Among the several secondary surgical geometrical features, stenosis at the SVC anastomosis or in pulmonary branches was found to be the most critical parameter in increasing the power loss.

40|$|Abstract. Isolated Herbig Ae stars can {{be divided}} into two groups (Meeus et al. 2001) : those with an almost flat {{spectral}} energy distribution in the mid-infrared (‘group I’), and those with a strong decline towards the farinfrared (‘group II’). In this paper we show that the group I vs. II distinction can be understood as arising from flaring vs. self-shadowed disks. We show that these two types of disks are natural solutions of the 2 -D radiationhydrostatic structure equations. Disks with high optical depth turn out to be flaring and have a strong far-IR emission, while disks with an optical depth below a certain threshold drop into the shadow of their own puffed-up inner rim and are weak in the far-IR. In spite of not having a directly irradiated surface layer, self-shadowed disks still display dust features in emission, in agreement with observations of group II sources. We propose an evolutionary scenario in which a disk starts out with a <b>flaring</b> <b>shape</b> (group I source), and then goes through the process of grain growth, causing the optical depth of the disk to drop and the disk to become self-shadowed (group II source).

40|$|The {{interaction}} between fully nonlinear water waves {{in a wave}} tank and fixed or floating structures with vertical and flared side surfaces is investigated. The higher-order boundary element method is used to solve the mixed boundary value problem in an Eulerian formulation at each time step. The time stepping scheme updates the boundary conditions on the free water surface and body surface, based on a Lagrangian description. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of the calculation, the domain decomposition technique is implemented, with continuity conditions enforced on the interface between adjacent subdomains by an iterative procedure. For the calculation of wave forces acting on structures, some auxiliary functions are used, instead of predicting the time derivative of the potential directly. By means of these auxiliary functions, the coupled fluid-structure interaction can be decoupled easily, so that the calculation of body motions becomes independent of the hydrodynamic force. In addition, mesh regridding using the Laplace smoothing technique and interpolation are applied on the free surface to avoid possible numerical instabilities. Numerical results are obtained for the wave interactions with vertical cylinders and flared structures at different wave numbers, in which the bodies are fixed, freely floating in one direction and totally freely floating, respectively. The effect of different <b>flared</b> <b>shapes</b> on the forces, wave run-up and body motions is also studied.

40|$|Based on one-month long MMT time-series {{observations}} of the open cluster M 37, we monitored light variations of nearly 2500 red dwarfs and successfully identified 420 flare events from 312 cluster M dwarf stars. For each flare light curve, we derived observational and physical parameters, such as <b>flare</b> <b>shape,</b> peak amplitude, duration, energy, and peak luminosity. We show that cool stars produce serendipitous flares energetic enough to be observed in the r-band, and their temporal and peak characteristics are almost {{the same as those}} in traditional U-band observations. We also found many large-amplitude flares with inferred Δ u > 6 mag in the cluster sample which had been rarely reported in previous ground-based observations. Following the ergodic hypothesis, we investigate in detail statistical properties of flare parameters over a range of energy (E_r ≃ 10 ^ 31 - 10 ^ 34 erg). As expected, there are no statistical differences in the distributions of flare timescales, energies, and frequencies among stars of the same age and mass group. We note that our sample tend to have longer rise and decay timescales compared to those seen in field flare stars of the same spectral type and be more energetic. Flare frequency distributions follow power-law distributions with slopes β∼ 0. 62 - 1. 21 for all flare stars and β∼ 0. 52 - 0. 97 for stars with membership information (P_mem≥ 0. 2). These are in general agreement with previous works on flare statistics of young open clusters and nearby field stars. Our results give further support to the classical age-activity relations.

40|$|Context. Galactic {{structure}} {{studies can}} be used as a path to constrain the scenario of formation and evolution of our Galaxy. The dependence with the age of stellar population parameters would be linked with the history of star formation and dynamical evolution. Aims. We aim to investigate the structures of the outer Galaxy, such as the scale length, disc truncation, warp and flare of the thin disc and study their dependence with age by using 2 MASS data and a population synthesis model (the so-called Besançon Galaxy Model). Methods. We have used a genetic algorithm to adjust the parameters on the observed colour-magnitude diagrams at longitudes 80 deg <= l <= 280 deg for |b| <= 5. 5 deg. We explored parameter degeneracies and uncertainties. Results. We identify a clear dependence of the thin disc scale length, warp and <b>flare</b> <b>shapes</b> with age. The scale length is found to vary between 3. 8 kpc for the youngest to about 2 kpc for the oldest. The warp shows a complex structure, clearly asymmetrical with a node angle changing with age from approximately 165 deg for old stars to 195 deg for young stars. The outer disc is also flaring with a scale height that varies by a factor of two between the solar neighbourhood and a Galactocentric distance of 12 kpc. Conclusions. We conclude that the thin disc scale length is in good agreement with the inside-out formation scenario and that the outer disc is not in dynamical equilibrium. The warp deformation with time may provide some clues to its origin. Comment: 19 pages.

These <b>flare</b> <b>shapes</b> {{are similar to those of}} low-mass PMSs. The X-ray spectra are successfully reproduced by an absorbed one or two-temperature thin-thermal plasma model. The temperatures are in the range of kT ~ 1 - 5 keV, which are significantly higher than those of main-sequence OB stars (kT < 1 keV). These X-ray properties are not explained by wind driven shocks, but are more likely due to magnetic activity. On the other hand, the plasma temperature rises as absorption column density increases, or as HAeBes ascend to earlier phases. The X-ray luminosity reduces after stellar age of a few x 10 ^ 6 years. X-ray activity may be related to stellar evolution. The age of the activity decay is apparently near the termination of jet or outflow activity. We thus hypothesize that magnetic activity originates from the interaction of the large scale magnetic fields coupled to the circumstellar disk. We also discuss differences in X-ray properties between HAeBes and main-sequence OB stars. Comment: 51 pages, 17 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{hypothesis}} that observed X-ray/extreme ultraviolet emission from coronae of magnetically active stars is entirely (or to a large part) due to the superposition of flares, using an analytic approach to determine the amplitude distribution of flares in light curves. The flare-heating hypothesis is motivated by time series that show continuous variability suggesting {{the presence of a}} large number of superimposed flares with similar rise and decay time scales. We rigorously relate the amplitude distribution of stellar flares to the observed histograms of binned counts and photon waiting times, under the assumption that the flares occur at random and have similar shapes. Our main results are: (1) The characteristic function (Fourier transform of the probability density) of the expected counts in time bins ∆t is φF(s,∆t) = exp{−T − 1 ∫ ∞ − ∞ dt [1 − φa(s Ξ(t,∆)) ]}, where T is the mean flaring interval, φa(s) is the characteristic function of the flare amplitudes, and Ξ(t,∆t) is the <b>flare</b> <b>shape</b> convolved with the observational time bin. (2) The probability of finding n counts in time bins ∆t is Pc(n) = (2 π) − 1 ∫ 2 π 0 ds e−ins φF(s,∆t). (3) The probability density of photon waiting times x is Pδ(x) = ∂ 2 xφF(i,x) /〈r 〉 with 〈r 〉 = ∂xφF(i,x) |x= 0 the mean count rate. An additive independent background is readily included.
