I have described research of other distinguished authors that wrote about children’s idea of evaporation, condensation and <b>water</b> <b>circulation.</b> I have summarized Piaget’s cognitive evolution theory and described socially cognitive conflict as an early learning strategy in natural sciences. Part of my thesis is dedicated to natural sciences in kindergarten; I write {{about the role of}} constructivism in early natural sciences that is based on Piaget’s principles of assimilation, accommodation and equilibration. In the empirical part of my thesis I introduced a study on 15 children aged 5 – 6 years. I used a half-structured interview to test children’s idea of <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> in nature. Using 6 different demonstrations I have then presented to them processes of evaporation, condensation and <b>water</b> <b>circulation.</b> Then I repeated the same interview and compared answers before and after demonstrations. The results have shown that although children are aware of <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> in nature, almost half of them understood <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> better afterwards.

40|$|During {{ventilation}} induced lung injury (VILI) experiments, anesthetized mice {{lose the}} ability to regulate their core body temperature. Without maintaining homeostasis, the experimental data may be compromised due {{to changes in the}} rodent’s internal functions. Traditional heating techniques utilize a <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> heating system that is unable to fit inside flexiVent ventilator testing chambers. The objective of this project is to design and build an automatic thermoregulatory feedback system to regulate the core body temperature of a mouse inside individual testing chambers throughout the duration of the experiment. The project deliverables include a functioning prototype that achieves safe and effective thermoregulation of small rodents with flexiVent compatibility and evidence of desired function. The design constitutes a Raspberry Pi 2 B microcomputer connected to a temperature sensor, an electric heating element, and touch-control display with software that maintains homeostasis. The electric heating pad with an <b>external</b> <b>water</b> blanket was chosen over a <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> heating system and a far-infrared heating system due to its large degree of control and ability to be implemented in a physically isolated testing chamber. Other similar designs are limited by size, ability to heat rodents within the flexiVent chamber, and automation. This product ultimately eliminates the need for researchers to manually monitor the core body temperature of the test subject and allows for extended ventilation periods utilizing the flexiVent ventilation system.

As an example are given results of computer simulation of <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> in seals′ breeding pools situated in Marine Station at Hel, belonging to Oceanographic Institute, Gdansk University. A mathematical model of three main pools was prepared with {{taking into account}} their inflow and outflow water supply points. Next, the object indication (tracer) tests were done {{with the use of}} mathematical modelling as well as in-situ measurements. For description of flow field in steady conditions a simplified model of 2 D flow in the form of Helmholtz biharmonic equation of stream function, recalculated then into velocity vector components, was used. The equation, supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions, was solved numerically by using the finite differences method. The spreading of a substance dissolved in water (tracer) was analyzed by solving 2 D equation of transient advecting - dispersing transport. To solve it the finite volumes method was applied. The applied model was verified by conducting the indication tests {{with the use of the}} rhodamine WT as a tracer.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{importance}} of considering tidal dynamics when modelling the general circulation in the Messina Strait, a narrow passage connecting the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian subbasins in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The tides and the induced <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> in this Strait {{are among the most}} intense oceanographic processes in the Mediterranean Sea. The quantification of these effects can be particularly relevant for operational oceanographic systems aimed to provide short-term predictions of the main hydrodynamics in the Western Mediterranean subbasins. A numerical approach based on the use of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model was followed to reproduce the tides propagation and the wind-induced and thermohaline <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> within the Strait and in surrounding areas. A set of numerical simulations was carried out to quantify the role of the Strait dynamics on the larger-scale <b>water</b> <b>circulation.</b> The obtained results confirmed {{the importance of}} a correct representation of the hydrodynamics in the Messina Strait even when focusing on predicting the <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> in the <b>external</b> sea traits.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>circulation</b> {{patterns}} in a tropical mangrove-fringed bay with seagrass and coral reef {{are driven by}} tides that generate strong reversing tidal currents. The wind, which has an onshore component, generates a net clockwise-rotating eddy. The dominant tidally driven <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> pattern, coupled {{with the effects of}} onshore wind and alongshore current generated by wave breaking, promotes the coastal trapping of turbid brackish water and its inherent nutrient content. This brackish water inundates the mangrove swamp and seagrass beds but not the coral reef ecosystem. Weak stratification prevails during the wet season in the upper parts of Kidogoweni Creek as a result of freshwater influx from rivers. In the dry season, well-mixed homogeneous water is found in most regions of the bay. A small zone of hypersaline water (salinity reaching 38 PSU) is found in the upper region of the mangrove-dominated creeks during the dry season. The connection between the mangrove swamp, with its wide salinity variations, and seagrass beds is apparently through river plumes and tidal effects. The link between seagrass beds and coral reefs is mainly through tidal influences. Research on <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> in tropical regions is im-portant because hydrodynamic processes influence the sustainability of marine ecological systems.

The aim of {{the author of the}} present work was to study the intensity of <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange in Dneprodzerzhinsk reservoir, the horizontal and vertical components of the water cycle and the economic use of the water body. On the basis of the components of the <b>water</b> balance the <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange in the reservoir has been studied taking into account the yearlong water content during the whole period of the reservoir operation, viz. during the water-aboundant year 1970, the law-water year 1972 and the very much law-water year 2015. Intensity factors and indicators of <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange for each month of the year, and for the months of the maximum and minimum intensity of the <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange during a unit of time, as well as the main factor influencing on the water exchange, viz. the lateral inflow in the reservoir have been determined. The maximum intensity of the <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange in the reservoir during a very dry year has deteriorated in the spring and autumn periods of its operation fourfold as compared with the one of the highwater year. It is determined that the higher the intensity of the <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange is, the less the indicator of the <b>external</b> <b>water</b> exchange during a unit of time is and the more intensively an exchange and self-purification of the water in the reservoir are being fulfilled.
