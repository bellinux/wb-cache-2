40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} static nonlinear finite-elementmodel of a 22 -day-old newborn {{middle ear}} is presented. The model includes {{the tympanic membrane}} (TM), malleus, incus, and two ligaments. The effects of the middle-ear cavity {{are taken into account}} indirectly. The geometry is based on a computed-tomography scan and on the published literature, supplemented by histology. A nonlinear hyperelastic constitutive law is applied to model large deformations. The middle-ear cavity and the Young’s modulus of the TM have significant effects on TM <b>volume</b> <b>displacements.</b> The TM <b>volume</b> <b>displacement</b> and its nonlinearity and asymmetry increase as the middle-ear cavity volume increases. The effects of the Young’s moduli of the ligaments and ossicles are found to be small. The simulated TM volume changes do not reach a plateau when the pressure is varied to either − 3 kPa or + 3 kPa, which is consistent with the nonflat tails often found in tympanograms in newborns. The simulated TM <b>volume</b> <b>displacements,</b> by themselves and also together with previous ear-canal model results, are compared with equivalent-volume differences derived from tympanometric measurements in newborns.

The simple conservation of breast tissue is no longer adequate to qualify for BCS completion.

Oncoplastic BCS can be performed {{in one of the}} following two ways: 1) <b>volume</b> <b>displacement</b> techniques and 2) volume replacement techniques. This study reports <b>volume</b> <b>displacement</b> surgical techniques, which allow the use of remaining breast tissue after BCS by glandular reshaping or reduction techniques for better cosmetic results.

40|$|Liebherr mobile harbor cranes use {{electrical}} generators {{to provide}} electrical power for load attachment {{devices such as}} container spreaders or magnets. Upcoming exhaust and noise emission standards and energy saving considerations lead to a broad diesel engine speed range. The challenging design aspect is to ensure a constant speed of the asynchronous generator by the hydraulic drive system. In addition, electrical load profiles of inductive consumers usually have DT 1 system characteristics with very small time constants. They evoke fast torque variations interfacing the hydraulic transmission. Liebherr mobile harbor cranes, see Figure 1, usually have a closed hydraulic circuit containing a hydraulic pump with a high <b>displacement</b> <b>volume</b> that is adjusted electronically in accordance to the current diesel engine speed. Regarding the energy saving aspects, a further minimization of the diesel engine speed leads to a larger pump size with increasing torque losses. Depending on the pressure setting, the volume flows can be reduced in constant pressure grids. Especially in part-load operation this results in better efficiency compared to closed hydraulic circuits by minimizing the <b>displacement</b> <b>volume</b> of hydraulic components. To obtain a stable generator speed, {{it is essential to}} adjust the <b>displacement</b> <b>volume</b> of the hydraulic unit for equalizing its input torque with the Figure 1 : LHM 800 Group 10 - Mobile Hydraulics | Paper 10 - 5 199 generator load torque.

Rotor profile plays the key role in the performance of such machines. This paper analyses difference in performance of 2 – 3 lobe combination of twin-screw pumps with different rotor profiles. A-type profile formed of involute–cycloid curves and D-type formed of cycloid curves are typical representatives for 2 – 3 type screw pumps. The investigation is performed by use of a full 3 -D computational fluid dynamics analysis based on a single-domain structured moving mesh obtained by novel grid generation procedure. The real-time mass flow rate, rotor torque, pressure distribution and velocity field were obtained from 3 D computational fluid dynamics calculations. The performance curves were produced for variable rotation speeds and variable discharge pressures. The computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing the simulation results of the A-type pump with the experimental data. In order to get the performance characteristics of D-type profile, two rotors with D-type profile were designed.

Radiopaque markers were surgically attached to the lower three ribs of the rib cage and to the midcostal region of the diaphragm in six dogs of ∼ 8 kg body masses, and the locations of these markers were determined by a biplane fluoroscopy system. Three-dimensional software modeling techniques were used to compute <b>volume</b> <b>displacement</b> and surface area of the midcostal diaphragm and the lower three ribs during quiet spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation, and bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at different lung volumes spanning the vital capacity. Volume displaced by the diaphragm relative to that displaced by the lower ribs is disproportionately greater under mechanical ventilation than during spontaneous breathing in the supine position (P < 0. 05). At maximal stimulation, diaphragm <b>volume</b> <b>displacement</b> grows disproportionately larger than rib <b>volume</b> <b>displacement</b> as lung <b>volume</b> increases (P < 0. 05). Surface area of both the diaphragm and the lower ribs during maximal stimulation of the diaphragm is reduced compared with that at spontaneous breathing (P < 0. 05).
