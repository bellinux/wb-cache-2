5|$|Bart wanders onto a U.S. Army {{base and}} manages to hijack a tank. He cuts {{a swath of}} {{destruction}} through the town and eventually stops at the school. There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under <b>his</b> <b>cap.</b> Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping <b>his</b> <b>cap</b> to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a bright green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without <b>his</b> <b>cap,</b> he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
50|$|He earned <b>his</b> first <b>cap</b> on 10 September 1997 in a 1-0 defeat to Albania in Zurich. <b>His</b> second <b>cap</b> {{came in a}} 3-0 home loss to Germany on 27 March 1999 in a Euro 2000 qualifier. The rest of <b>his</b> <b>caps</b> {{were all}} friendlies. His first start for Northern Ireland came in Belfast on 26 April 2000, <b>his</b> sixth <b>cap</b> - the Northern Irish beat the Hungarians 1-0.|$|R
50|$|Emerson earned <b>his</b> first <b>cap</b> for pre-partition Ireland against England in October 1919. He {{would earn}} a further 10 caps for Ireland, scoring once. Five of <b>his</b> <b>caps</b> were earned at Burnley while the {{remaining}} six he won while on Glentoran's books. <b>His</b> six <b>caps</b> while at Glentoran makes {{him the most}} capped player in the club's history.|$|R
50|$|James McAulay earned <b>his</b> fourth <b>cap</b> against England and Michael Paton earned <b>his</b> second <b>cap</b> against Wales.|$|R
5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer. While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped <b>his</b> <b>cap.</b> Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914 Beadles, along {{with two of his}} older brothers, Ewart and Ernie, enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, even though he was only 16 years old at the time, under the permitted age of enlistment. While his regiment was stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a bugle boy. In 1915, his unit took part in the landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman. During this time, Beadles performed an action that would later see him awarded the Serbian Gold medal for gallantry. He received the honor for saving the life of a Serbian observer officer who had been wounded in no man's land and was unable to make it back to the line. Under heavy rifle and artillery fire, Beadles helped the officer back, having <b>his</b> <b>cap</b> and epaulettes shot off in the process but remaining unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and <b>his</b> <b>cap</b> drift away in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E
50|$|Having already {{played for}} the U19 Republic of Ireland he earned <b>his</b> first <b>cap</b> with team mate Padraig Amond for the Republic of Ireland U-21s game in Austria on 19 August 2008, <b>his</b> second <b>cap</b> in Bulgaria, and <b>his</b> third <b>cap</b> in Portugal.|$|R
25|$|Dylan Hartley earned <b>his</b> 50th <b>cap</b> for England, and Sam Whitelock earned <b>his</b> 50th <b>cap</b> for New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|He {{acquired}} <b>his</b> first <b>cap</b> against Wales {{during the}} 1951-52 season. He won <b>his</b> second <b>cap</b> in April 1957.|$|R
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed <b>his</b> <b>cap</b> down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
5|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was his least {{successful}} of the series. He was bowled second ball by a yorker from Lindwall and England struggled to remain competitive throughout the match. In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. Hutton used Trevor Bailey to bowl negatively and slow Australia down; his tactics, including time-wasting {{and the use of}} leg theory, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn. It is possible that the idea came from Bailey himself, but the Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity. In contrast, English critics believed the tactics were justified. Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia's first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked <b>his</b> <b>cap</b> onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82. In reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners and England scored the necessary 132 runs to win their first series against Australia since 1932–33 and their first such home series win since 1926. Wisden praised Hutton's strategy and tactical sense, and he was widely acclaimed in the press, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett, the Australian captain, maintained. Hutton scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37 in the Tests, but found it mentally tiring to lead England. Meanwhile, some Yorkshire observers felt he should do more to improve discipline at the county. In the whole summer, he scored 2,458 runs at an average of 63.02.|$|E
5|$|Umar and {{his senate}} {{identified}} this act as misuse of state treasure, {{though not as}} punishing as to lose one's office, Khalid was already warned not act as alone, he should seek permission from his commander or Caliph for such actions. He immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Abu Ubaidah asking him to bring Khalid in front of the congregation, his turban, and take off <b>his</b> <b>cap.</b> Umar wanted Abu Ubaida to ask Khalid from what funds he gave to Ash'as: from his own pocket or from the state treasury? If he confessed to having used the spoils, he was guilty of misappropriation. If he claimed that he gave from his own pocket, he was guilty of extravagance. In either case he would be dismissed, and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties. Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother, and so said that he was not capable of doing it. Instead, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa, where he was charged publicly. Khalid stated that he gave money from his own pocket and thus was declared innocent in that charge. However, when he went to Abu Ubaida, he told him that he had been dismissed on the order of Umar and is required to go back to Medina.|$|E

5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required {{the tip of a}} broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was to get him out on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing <b>his</b> <b>cap</b> turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E
5|$|With Klim {{recently}} {{returning from}} a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4×100m freestyle relay. The 200m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1min 44.71s. Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off <b>his</b> <b>cap,</b> punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4×200m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin {{but was unable to}} pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13s earlier. Thorpe found himself {{on the other side of}} a close result when he qualified last for the 100m freestyle by 0.01s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history. After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships.|$|E
