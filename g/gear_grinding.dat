40|$|Abstract: <b>Gear</b> form <b>grinding</b> is a finish {{machining}} method for hard tooth {{surface with a}} form wheel. Wheel dressing is an important process in <b>gear</b> form <b>grinding,</b> and affects the precision of the ground gear directly. Based on the envelope theory the mathematical model of the dressed wheel surface {{was built in the}} case of wheel dressing errors. Then the real profile of the ground tooth in the transverse plan was solved and its deviations from the designed profile were evaluated. Finally the effects of each dressing error on the precision of the ground gear were analyzed using the proposed mathematical model. The results provided theoretical foundation for the precision control during manufacturing a <b>gear</b> form <b>grinding</b> machine. A grinding experiment was implemented using the <b>gear</b> form <b>grinding</b> machine and the ground gear was measured by a three-coordinate measuring machine. The measure result indicated that the accuracy grade of the ground gear achieved 4 (ISO 1328 - 1 : 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in generating <b>gear</b> <b>grinding</b> is the determination of cutting forces due to their significant influence on {{the dynamics of the}} grinding process. Thus, optimizing the cutting forces can lead to an increased quality of ground gears and a minimized wear behavior of the grinding worm. Currently, the knowledge of the generating grinding process is limited and research is based mostly on empirical studies. A theoretical model which help to predict the cutting forces is missing. This paper presents an initial approach for calculating the complex contact conditions in generating <b>gear</b> <b>grinding</b> as well as cutting forces and key values to characterize the process. This approach gains more and more importance especially for large module gears, to reduce manufacturing costs. By means of the calculated forces, the manufacturing process can be optimized {{and the quality of the}} manufactured gear can be increased...|$|E

40|$|During large-size gear topological {{modification}} by form <b>grinding,</b> the helical <b>gear</b> {{tooth surface}} geometrical shape will be complex {{and it is}} difficult for the traditional scanning measurement to characterize the whole tooth surface.

40|$|SUMMARY The paper {{sets out}} to {{describe}} how a servo mechanism may be applied to generative <b>gear</b> <b>grinding</b> machines and an appropriate specification is drawn up. The system involves separate motor drives to the two shafts, the angular positions of which are monitored with radial diffraction gratings. One of the signals is frequency divided to achieve the speed ratio between the two shafts, the resultant similar frequency signals being phase compared, any difference producing an error signal thus completing the servo loop. Hydraulic motors are used as prime movers. The transfer functions of the loop are developed and compared with measured open loop results. It is clearly shown that with the components at present available the loop cannot be made stable. The specification of more appropriate hardware is discussed and future work outlined, but the conclusion is reached that this system cannot be used for its primary purpose on a generative <b>gear</b> <b>grinding</b> machine...|$|E

The remedy for [...] "Noise #1" [...] was to overfill the transmission with Saturn Manual Transmission Lubricant from the stock 1.8 quarts to 2.6 quarts. Although this seemed to work for many customers, many other complaints still surfaced and in 2003 General Motors released another TSB urging customers that still have the rattling noise in their transmissions should bring their vehicles in to their nearest General Motors affiliated dealer for a more complex fix. This time, GM Technicians had concluded that gears one and two required additional thrust loads and proceeded to install a wave washer between the blocking ring and speed gears for gears three and four. This indeed fixed the rattle issue once and for all, but has more recently been lamented in many online communities as causing a bigger problem than it solves, as many customers that received this fix reported third and fourth <b>gears</b> <b>grinding</b> {{from time to time}} while shifting. Afterwards, many owners of these vehicles have concluded that leaving the transmission alone was for the best, as the rattling noise has been proven to be harmless.|$|R
