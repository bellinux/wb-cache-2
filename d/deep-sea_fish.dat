5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, Pietschmann befriended {{zoologist}} Franz Steindachner {{and became}} his assistant {{in the fish}} collection of the Museum of Natural History in Vienna. That same year he studied <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> in the Barents Sea, and in 1909 he participated in an expedition to Greenland. He {{was part of an}} expedition to Mesopotamia in 1910 where he collected specimens. Pietschmann then headed an expedition to Armenia in 1914. After a brief visit in Austria, he returned to the Ottoman Empire to help the war effort.|$|E
25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound and at Lystrup Enge spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown giant squid feed on <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> and other squid species. They catch prey using the two tentacles, {{gripping}} it with serrated sucker rings on the ends. Then they bring it toward the powerful beak, and shred it with the radula (tongue with small, file-like teeth) before it reaches the esophagus. They {{are believed to be}} solitary hunters, as only individual giant squid have been caught in fishing nets. Although the majority of giant squid caught by trawl in New Zealand waters have been associated with the local hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) fishery, hoki do not feature in the squid's diet. This suggests giant squid and hoki prey on the same animals.|$|E

500|$|The royal forests {{continued}} to diminish {{in size and}} decline in economic importance {{in the years after}} the Black Death. Royal enforcement of forest rights and laws became harder after 1348 and certainly after 1381, and by the 15th century the royal forests were a [...] "shadow of their former selves" [...] in size and economic significance. In contrast, the English fishing industry {{continued to}} grow, and by the 15th century domestic merchants and financiers owned fleets of up to a hundred fishing vessels operating from key ports. Herring remained a key fishing catch, although as demand for herring declined with rising prosperity, the fleets began to focus instead on cod and other <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> from the Icelandic waters. Despite being critical to the fishing industry, salt production in England diminished in the 15th century due to competition from French producers. The use of expensive freshwater fish ponds on estates began to decline during this period, as more of the gentry and nobility opted to purchase freshwater fish from commercial river fisheries.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the renovated}} Bathysphere, Beebe and Barton began {{preparing}} for their planned descent {{of half a}} mile. [...] Their ship once again was the Ready, this time towed by a tug called the Powerful. [...] During their first test dive, they demanded to be pulled up after descending only four feet because the sphere had begun to leak; they soon discovered this was because Tee-Van had neglected to fasten all of the bolts that hold the hatch shut. [...] Another problem occurred on their second test dive, during which they discovered that {{the lower end of}} the rubber hose holding the power cable and phone line had begun to deteriorate, and they spent the rest of the day reversing the hose's direction so that the end which was deteriorating would be the end above the water. [...] For a third test dive, they sent down the Bathysphere unoccupied but with Barton's camera, which had not yet captured any footage of deep-sea animals, pointed at the center window. [...] Most of the footage from Barton's camera was unintelligible, but it captured one image of a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish,</b> and more importantly it came up dry.|$|E

60|$|Again, there lingers in the Cam, and a {{few other}} rivers of north- eastern Europe, that curious fish the eel-pout or 'burbot' (Molva lota). Now he is utterly {{distinct}} from any other fresh-water fish of Europe. His nearest ally is the ling (Molva vulgaris); a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish,</b> even as his ancestors have been. Originally a deep-sea form, he has found his way up the rivers, even to Cambridge, and there remains. The rivers by which he came up, the land through which he passed, ages and ages since, have been all swept away; and he has never found his way back to his native salt-water, but lives on in a strange land, degraded in form, dwindling in numbers, and now fast dying out. The explanation may be strange: but it is the only one which I can offer to explain the fact--which is itself much more strange--of the burbot being found in the Fen rivers.|$|E
