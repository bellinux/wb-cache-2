40|$|Nicotine {{contributes}} to the onset and progression of several pulmonary diseases. Among the various pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by nicotine, oxidative stress and cell death are reported in several cell types. We found that chronic exposure to nicotine (48 h) induced NOX 1 -dependent oxidative stress and apoptosis in primary pulmonary cells. In murine (MLE- 12) and human (BEAS- 2 B) lung epithelial cell lines, nicotine acted as a sensitizer to cell death and synergistically enhanced apoptosis when cells were concomitantly exposed to hyperoxia. The precise signaling pathway was investigated in MLE- 12 cells in which NOX 1 was abrogated by a specific inhibitor or stably silenced by shRNA. In the early phase of exposure (1 h), nicotine mediated intracellular Ca(2 +) fluxes and activation of protein kinase C, which in its turn activated NOX 1, leading to cellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress. The latter triggered the intrinsic apoptotic machinery by modulating the expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax. Overexpression of Bcl- 2 completely prevented nicotine's detrimental effects, suggesting Bcl- 2 as a <b>downstream</b> <b>key</b> regulator in nicotine/NOX 1 -induced cell damage.

Characteristic scale {{lengths of}} nonthermal X-rays from the SN 1006 NE rim, which are {{observed}} by Chandra, are interpreted {{in the context}} of the diffusive shock acceleration on the assumption that the observed spatial profile of nonthermal X-rays corresponds to that of accelerated electrons with energies of a few tens of TeV. To explain the observed scale lengths, we construct two simple models with a test particle approximation, where the maximum energy of accelerated electrons is determined by the age of SN 1006 (age-limited model) or the energy loss (energy loss-limited model), and constrain the magnetic field configuration and the diffusion coefficients of accelerated electrons. When the magnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal, the magnetic field should be in the range of 20 – 85 µG and highly turbulent both in upstream and downstream, which means that the mean free path of accelerated electrons is on the order of their gyro-radius (Bohm limit). This situation can be realized both in the age-limited and energy loss-limited model. On the other hand, when the magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal, which can exist only in the age-limited case, the magnetic field is several µG in the upstream and 14 – 20 µG in the downstream, and the upstream magnetic field is less turbulent than the <b>downstream.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|AIMS: Myocardial {{fibrosis}} critically {{contributes to}} cardiac dysfunction in inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM). Activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling is a key-step in promoting tissue remodelling and fibrosis in iDCM. Downstream mechanisms controlling these processes, remain elusive. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) was induced in BALB/c mice with heart-specific antigen and adjuvant. Using heart-inflammatory precursors, {{as well as}} mouse and human cardiac fibroblasts, we demonstrated rapid secretion of Wnt proteins and activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in response to TGF-β signalling. Inactivation of extracellular Wnt with secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP 2) or inhibition of Wnt secretion with Wnt-C 59 prevented TGF-β-mediated transformation of inflammatory precursors and cardiac fibroblasts into pathogenic myofibroblasts. Inhibition of T-cell factor (TCF) /β-catenin-mediated transcription with ICG- 001 or genetic loss of β-catenin also prevented TGF-β-induced myofibroblasts formation. Furthermore, blocking of Smad-independent TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK 1) pathway completely abrogated TGF-β-induced Wnt secretion. Activation of Wnt pathway {{in the absence of}} TGF-β, however, failed to transform precursors into myofibroblasts. The critical role of Wnt axis for cardiac fibrosis in iDCM is also supported by elevated Wnt- 1 /Wnt- 5 a levels in human samples from hearts with myocarditis. Accordingly, and as an in vivo proof of principle, inhibition of Wnt secretion or TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription abrogated the development of post-inflammatory fibrosis in EAM. CONCLUSION: We identified TAK 1 -mediated rapid Wnt protein secretion as a novel <b>downstream</b> <b>key</b> mechanism of TGF-β-mediated myofibroblast differentiation and myocardial fibrosis progression in human and mouse myocarditis. Thus, pharmacological targeting of Wnts might represent a promising therapeutic approach against iDCM in the future...|$|R

Allicin, the main effective component of garlic, has {{a broad spectrum}} of pharmacological properties. The hypothesis that allicin could relieve REV-induced immune dysfunction was investigated in vivo and in vitro in the present study. The results showed that dietary allicin supplementation ameliorated REV-induced dysplasia and immune dysfunction in REV-infected chickens. Compared with the control groups, REV infection promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10, interferon (IFN) -γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), whereas, allicin reversed these changes induced by REV infection. The decreased levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IL- 2 were observed in REV-infected chickens, which were significantly improved by allicin. Allicin suppressed the REV-induced high expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA 5) and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor kappa B p 65. REV stimulated the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p 38, the <b>downstream</b> <b>key</b> signaling molecules of MAPK pathway, while allicin retarded the augmented phosphorylation level induced by REV infection. The decreased phosphorylation level of ERK was associated with REV replication, suggesting that ERK signaling is involved in REV replication, and allicin can alleviate the REV-induced immune dysfunction by inhibiting the activation of ERK. In addition, REV infection induced oxidative damage in thymus and spleen, whereas allicin treatment significantly decreased the oxidative stress induced by REV infection, suggesting that the antioxidant effect of allicin should be at least partially responsible for the harmful effect of REV infection. In conclusion, the findings suggest that allicin alleviates the inflammation and oxidative damage caused by REV infection and exerts the potential anti-REV effect by blocking the ERK/MAPK pathway...|$|R

Our previous finding in patients showed that anti-insulin resistance treatments are associated with improved HER 2 + breast cancer survival of diabetic women. However, there were no transgenic mouse models to study the correlation and explain the detailed mechanism. We generated a mouse model of HER 2 + breast cancer with DM 2 by crossing leptin receptor point mutation (Lepr db/+) and MMTV-ErbB 2 (neu) mice. The MMTV-ErbB 2 /Lepr db/db mice had a poor survival rate compared with MMTV-ErbB 2 /Lepr +/+ mice, and the log rank test of the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that they were significantly different (P = 0. 0004). In addition, we evaluated the impact of different anti-diabetic medications on cancer-specific survival. MMTV-ErbB 2 /Lepr db/db mice administrated with metformin or rosiglitazone showed improved overall survival, cumulative tumor incidence, and reduced tumor progression. Anti-insulin resistance treatments can also reverse the Warburg effect by reducing lactate/pyruvate ratio through 13 C-pyruvate imaging. Cell lines isolated from MMTV-ErbB 2 /Lepr db/db mice also showed reduced levels of both oxygen consumption and lactate production upon metformin treatment. Metformin treatment not only inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in Human HER 2 + breast cancer cell lines, but also repressed c-MYC mRNA expression, increased proteasome-dependent degradation, and reduced the <b>downstream</b> <b>key</b> glycolysis enzyme PKM 2. Moreover, anti-insulin resistance treatments dramatically change the microenvironment by reducing serum insulin levels and this systematic effect attenuated the mTOR/AKT signaling pathway in tumor samples from MMTV-ErbB 2 /Lepr db/db mice.
