5|$|Damien Leith {{was also}} {{conscious}} of the lyrics we wrote. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> few emotional ballads which contained strong lyrics, but had left out the songs he thought were too depressing.|$|E
5|$|During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer made {{no mention}} of it in the first draft of Inside the Third Reich, and it was only on the urgent advice of his {{publisher}} that <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his {{personal}} style, {{inspired by the}} organic shapes of nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry. To this <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.|$|E
5000|$|Three treatises of Summa Totius Logices {{to which}} <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> {{appendix}} ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> {{inch or so}} {{of water}} to the little dose in each glass.|$|R
5000|$|Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} prayer {{after each}} decade. The following prayers {{are for the}} joyous mysteries: ...|$|R
5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
5|$|The {{ideas that}} {{underpin}} our modern world–meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on–were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> rational and efficient local administration, {{an end to}} rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws {{since the fall of}} the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, {{said to have}} been covered with a gilded roof. Among those completed were the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, the Arch of Titus and the Colosseum, to which <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> fourth level and finished the interior seating area.|$|E
5000|$|Jose, {{pronounced}} /z/ like [...] "rose," [...] is <b>a</b> Cornish name. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> accent, eɪ as in José.|$|R
5000|$|Hunter plays a {{slightly}} different version on his album (released only in LP format) Jack O'Roses. <b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> final verse: ...|$|R
50|$|Watts {{finished}} {{his senior season}} after coming back from an injury with 66 total tackles (42 solo), and 3.5 tackles for loss. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> interception, a pass break-up, a forced fumble and 2.5 sacks.|$|R
5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton then scored his maiden {{first-class}} {{century of}} 117 {{in less than}} four hours in the following match, against the touring South Africa, helping his team to 3/430 in their runchase. The hosts were 18 runs short of victory when time ran out. Although Fingleton made only five in New South Wales' second match against the South Africans, Fingleton was selected for the Test series against the same team. This came after only ten matches for his state. Starting with the Second Test, he was twelfth man for three consecutive Tests, and as a result, did not play any cricket for six weeks before <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> pair of 40s in a win over arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{first-class}} debut against Middlesex {{at the beginning}} of the 1998 season, in which Key scored 15, he proceeded to play a near-complete season. He scored his first first-class century against Durham, scoring 101 in an innings victory. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> second century (115) against Nottinghamshire, before rejoining the England under-19 squad for the series against Pakistan under-19s. He struggled in the one-day series, scoring just 36runs in three matches, but finished as the top run-scorer in the youth Tests; with 377 at an average of 62.83.|$|E
50|$|He studied {{business}} at Saint John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota. In his second year, <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> arts minor, {{with an emphasis}} on films.|$|R
5000|$|Jacob {{edited the}} [...] "Hekal ha-Kodesh" [...] of Moses b. Maimun Albas, to which <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> {{introduction}} and supplied notes (Amsterdam, 1653).|$|R
50|$|Brach throws {{mostly just}} two pitches: a four-seam fastball at 90-94 mph and a slider at 80-85. Occasionally, <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> {{splitter}} to lefties.|$|R
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to form by striking 141 against Gloucestershire before taking 3/9, his first three-wicket haul at first-class level, to help Australia take a nine-wicket win. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> second century {{in as many}} innings with 118 in an innings win over Northamptonshire. Harvey then struck 122 in the rain affected Third Test at Manchester; he helped Australia take a 42-run first innings lead, but was out for a duck in the second innings. Australia collapsed to 8/35 and were saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> 17-point, 10-rebound double {{double in}} the 2012 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament in a loss to Texas. In Iowa State's opening game of the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, White posted 15 points and 11 rebounds in a victory over Connecticut. His season {{concluded}} with a 23-point, 9-rebound, 4-assist and 3-steal performance in a loss to Kentucky. White fouled {{out for the first}} time in his career in the game and ended the season with 11 double-doubles. White finished the season as the team leader in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, making him the only player in Division I basketball to do so.|$|E
5|$|Marchant {{began at}} the Chelsea Amateur Cycling Club, which did not even have a banked cycling track and was trained by Norton and Maurie Cramer. Marchant rose to {{prominence}} by winning the 500metres (m) time trial at the 1955 Victorian Championships for juniors in only his second year of competition. He then won the 5 mile title and the 500m time trial at the Australian Junior Championships. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> silver medal in the sprint.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} with Blackburn Rovers <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> England B cap to the England Under 21 honours he picked up whilst at Norwich.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> short line of {{text for}} the tenor and bass chorus parts in {{measures}} 44 through 51 {{of the fourth}} Lesson ("One, release us.").|$|R
50|$|He won the Hungarian 200 metres in 1981, {{as well as}} {{the indoor}} 60 metre title also. In 1983 <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> indoor Hungarian 200 also.|$|R
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 2013, Costa {{marked his}} UEFA Champions League debut with two goals against Austria Wien, the first coming after a fine {{individual}} effort in an eventual 3–0 group stage away win. On 19 February 2014, {{in the first}} knockout round's first leg, he scored the game's only goal at Milan, netting seven minutes from time after a corner kick from Gabi; <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> further two in the second match, helping to a 4–1 victory that put Atlético into the quarter-finals {{for the first time}} in 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Raven and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko {{continued}} their feud after Turning Point. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution he would choose a new opponent to challenge Raven. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> stipulation that if Raven won he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, but if Raven lost, {{he would be}} fired from TNA. Raven faced Sean Waltman at the show in a Raven's Rules match. Raven lost the match after interference from Zybysko. Due to the stipulation attached, Raven was fired in the storyline.|$|E
5000|$|He won the Leinster Minor Football Championship {{title with}} Laois in 1967 and in 1969 <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> Leinster U21 Football Championship title to his honours.|$|R
25|$|Igreja do Bom Jesus (1743), a {{magnificent}} Baroque church in Matosinhos, {{just north of}} Porto. Here <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> element of horizontality (rather rare in Portuguese architecture).|$|R
25|$|Maurice Godelier {{has further}} {{elaborated}} on Annette Weiner's ideas on inalienable possessions in The Enigma of the Gift. He derived two theses from Weiner, to which <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> third.|$|R
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, Rippy had {{completed}} all of the gameplay music, including end credits, battle themes, and ambient world tracks. In the game's skirmish mode, the music reflects the environment rather than the warring factions. To ensure that {{the character of the}} music changed depending on the environment, he followed self-imposed rules; one environment could feature guitars, but not piano, for instance. To musically unify each world, <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> short introductory piece containing common elements. In contrast with the skirmish mode, the campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and the human ship Spirit of Fire. Rippy's most intensive work period was January 2008, when he began writing music for the game's cinematics; by this point, he had been working on the score for nine months. Rippy finished the score by February 2008, and, after three months, all tracks were ready to be recorded.|$|E

50|$|Klaudat flew a Fokker D.VII {{painted in}} the {{squadron}} colors of blue tail and red nose. To that <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> overpainted personal marking of a Uhlan lance sporting {{a black and white}} banner.|$|R
50|$|In the 1820s {{the house}} was remodelled by Charles Baring of the London {{merchant}} banking family. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>an</b> extra floor to Rawleigh Dawkin’s house and a parapet running the whole length of the south front.|$|R
