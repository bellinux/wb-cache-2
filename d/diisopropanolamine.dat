40|$|AbstractHyperbranched polyesteramides (DA 2), {{prepared}} from hexahydrophthalic anhydride (D) and <b>diisopropanolamine</b> (A) {{have been}} characterized, {{by use of}} matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), field desorption (FD) -MS, and electrospray ionization (ESI) -MS. MALDI of polyesteramides produces protonated molecules. The spectra show a complex chemical composition distribution and end-group distribution which {{are mainly composed of}} two series of homologous oligomers DnAn+ 1 − mH 2 O and DnAn − mH 2 O, where m = 1 – 2. Signals from protonated molecules DnAn+ 1 and DnAn are almost absent in the MALDI spectrum, whereas these ions are responsible for the base peak of DnAn+ 1 − mH 2 O and DnAn − mH 2 O (m = 1 – 2) clusters in the ESI spectrum. The absence of –OH end-groups signals in the MALDI spectrum is due to a metastable decay of protonated DnAn+ 1 and DnAn ions in the ion source of the MALDI mass spectrometer prior to ion extraction. In-source decay results in the formation of protonated lower DnAn+ 1 − mH 2 O and DnAn − mH 2 O oligomers and their corresponding neutrals, leading to wrong conclusions concerning the relative end-group distribution {{as a function of the}} degree of polymerization and the chemical composition...|$|E

Though the absorbent is recycled through the system, some carry over into water stream is unavoidable. Due to high solubility and toxicity of the absorbent, simple removal process or conventional wastewater treatments are inefficient {{to treat the}} contaminated water. The photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds were reported to be efficient for treatment or persistent pollutant. In this paper, the synthesized TiO 2 was modified with Cu, Fe or Cu-Fe via wet impregnation method. Characterization of the prepared photocatalysts were conducted using BET analyzer, X-ray diffractometer, transmission electron microscope, diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectrophotometer, and point of zero charge determination. The band gap of the photocatalysts was reduced to as low as 2. 55 eV (1. 8 Cu- 0. 2 Fe/TiO 2) compared to bare TiO 2 with a band gap of 3. 11 eV. The performance of the photocatalysts for photodegradation of <b>diisopropanolamine</b> (DIPA) was studied using a batch glass reactor under simulated sunlight. The bimetallic photocatalyst 1. 8 Cu- 0. 2 Fe/TiO 2 displayed the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) and DIPA removals of 67 % and 92 %, respectively. Based on the photocatalytic degradation data, all the photocatalysts were found to follow pseudo−first order kinetic with 1. 8 Cu- 0. 2 Fe/TiO 2 giving the highest apparent rate constant, kapp = 16. 5 × 10 - 3 min- 1...|$|E

Amine solution such as <b>diisopropanolamine</b> (DIPA) is used to remove the CO 2 and H 2 S in natural gas processing.

The objective of this study are to investigate the flux of water and permeate, and rejection of DIPA solution across reverse osmosis, nanofiltration and ultrafiltration membrane which known as AFC 99, AFC 40 and CA 202 respectively. This paper studies the effect of cross-flow velocity on permeate flux and the effect of feed concentration on observed rejection of DIPA solution across AFC 99, AFC 40 and CA 202 over the operating pressure. The results showed a significant role of cross-flow velocity on membrane performance from aspect flux obtained and phenomenon of concentration polarization that would increase the transport resistance of permeate flow. The highest flux can be achieved by high cross-flow velocity. While for rejection study, rejection of all membranes increase with increase of pressure yet decrease with concentration...|$|E

The density and viscosity were estimated {{as a function}} of temperature, CO 2 loading, pressure, and molecular weight of mixtures. In this regard, the actual data points were collected from the literature. Genetic Algorithm (GA) was employed to determine hyper variables of the LSSVM approach and Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was employed to optimize bias and weight values of the ANN model. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) was used to determine membership parameters of the ANFIS approach and related parameters of the SVM were optimized using GA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop modelling of industrial processes by improving the thermodynamic representation of the equilibrium between phases. For this purpose an extensive experimental work was performed, comprising of vapour-liquid, gas-liquid and solid-liquid equilibrium measurements. Vapour liquid equilibrium of binary mixtures of butane + alcohols was measured with a static total pressure apparatus due to the importance of hydrocarbon and alcohol mixtures in the production of biofuels. The same equipment was used to measure binary systems of diethyl sulphide + C 4 - hydrocarbons of importance in refinery applications. The activity coefficients of these systems were modelled with activity coefficients models. The absorption of carbon dioxide in alkanolamine solutions is the leading technology for the removal of carbon dioxide during refining of gas and oil. In recent years, this technology has gained importance also for carbon capture from large point sources. The scarcity of experimental data for some alkanolamine systems affected the accuracy of thermodynamic models. Several experimental techniques were developed to supply new experimental data for aqueous solutions of <b>diisopropanolamine</b> (DIPA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). The solubility of carbon dioxide in solutions of these amines was measured with a static total pressure apparatus for gas solubility, and with a bubbling apparatus. The density of carbonated aqueous DIPA was also measured and modelled. The vapour-liquid equilibrium of water + DIPA and water + MDEA was measured with a static total pressure apparatus. The solid-liquid equilibrium of the same systems was measured with a visual method and a Differential Scanning Calorimeter. The activity coefficients of aqueous DIPA and MDEA solutions were modelled using NRTL, thus providing the first model of this sort for DIPA.

40|$|The thesis aims to {{synthesize}} hyperbranched poly(urea-urethane) polymers (HPU) in one-pot method using commercially available monomers which are 2, 4 -toluylene diisocyanate (TDI) as aromatic diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and 2 (3 -isocyanatopropyl) cyclohexylisocyanate (IPCI) as aliphatic diisocyanates. Those proposed diisocyanates were reacted with diethanolamine (DEA) or <b>diisopropanolamine</b> (DIPA). Conditions of polymerisation reactions were optimised. Complete structural analysis using 1 H and 13 C NMR for the obtained aromatic polymers was carried out. Degree of branching up to 70 % was calculated. Aliphatic polymers have spectra with overlapped signals therefore, no full structural analysis was possible. Molar masses were determined using SEC/RI detector {{which shows that}} the prepared polymers have Mw values between 1600 g/mol and 106000 g/mol. Thermal analysis for different polymer systems showed that aliphatic HPU are more thermally stable and have values of glass transition temperature higher than aromatic ones. Modification of the end groups in the prepared hyperbranched polymers was carried out using three different modifiers and degree of modification up to 100 %. Linear polymers {{based on the same}} diisocyanate monomers were prepared to compare the properties of hyperbranched systems with their linear analogs. Measurements of solution viscosity showed that HPU have lower solution viscosity values than their linear analogs of comparable molar masses. Rheological measurement of some polymer samples of different systems were carried out and showed that our hyperbranched systems exhibit a more elastic behavior than the linear polymers. Surface studies for thin films prepared from different polymer systems (hyperbranched, linear and modified) were carried out and the obtained thin films were characterized using light microscope, microglider, GC-MS, and AFM. Contact angle measurements showed that HPU have a relatively hydrophilic character. The modified polymers have higher contact angle values than the unmodified ones {{due to the lack of}} OH end groups. Networks based on aliphatic and aromatic HPU were prepared through the reaction of HPU with trimer of 1, 6 -diisocyanatohexane and characterised by DSC, GC-MS, DMA and AFM.

40|$|Sulfolane (tetrahydrothiophene 1, 1 -dioxide, C 4 H 8 O 2 S) is {{a highly}} water-soluble, non-ionizable, organic {{compound}} used along with <b>diisopropanolamine</b> in the SulfinolTM process to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas. Sulfolane has been identified in wetland vegetation near a sour gas processing facility in Alberta, Canada, and extensive uptake of sulfolane by cattails has also been demonstrated in a laboratory environment. Consequently, {{it has been suggested}} that plants could play an important role in the natural attenuation of sulfolane in contaminated wetlands. This assumes that the sulfolane is metabolized and/or sequestered in the plant and not released back into the environment during winter dieback. To address the potential release issue, individual cattails (Typha latifolia) were grown hydroponically in 500 -mL glass containers containing one of three initial sulfolane concentrations (8, 40, or 200 mg/L) for a specified duration (7 to 28 days). Half the cattails were used to quantify uptake as a function of time and exposure concentration and the other half were used to evaluate the potential release of sulfolane into the hydroponic solution. Non-exposed cattails and non-planted systems containing sulfolane served as controls. The cattails used to evaluate the potential release of sulfolane were frozen directly in their individual containers at the end of the appropriate exposure period. After being frozen for a minimum of 72 hours, the containers were thawed and the amount of sulfolane released was monitored. At the end of the 28 -day uptake period, sulfolane leaf tip tissue concentrations as high as 3600, 1050, and 165 mg/kg dry weight were found for the cattails initially exposed to 200, 40, and 8 mg/L sulfolane, respectively. The percentage of sulfolane subsequently released by the cattails after the freeze-thaw treatment declined as a function of the duration exposed. The percentages of sulfolane released measured in the water after 72 hours in addition to the plant tissue extractions were 71 %, 54 %, 27 %, and 12 % for the 40 mg/L concentration at 7 -, 14 -, 21 -, and 28 -day exposure periods, respectively. Other concentrations showed the same decreasing trend for increasing exposure periods. The declining release as a function of time suggests metabolism and/or sequestration of the sulfolane within the plant. The significant uptake and limited release of sulfolane from mature plants indicate that wetland plants could play an important role in its natural attenuation...|$|E
40|$|Global warming {{has become}} one of the world’s most {{important}} challenges over the last decades and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are determined to be a major contributor. Various carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies are available worldwide but post combustion CO 2 capture with chemical absorbents is considered today to be the most advanced and mature technology for mitigating CO 2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. Implementing CCS has the potential of reducing and reversing the effects of CO 2 on global warming and climate change. In reactive absorption, carbon dioxide chemically reacts to form chemical bond and is thereby moved from a gas to a liquid phase. The chemical reaction is reversible and CO 2 is released from the solvent during regeneration by raising the temperature. Thereby almost pure CO 2 is collected, compressed and sent to storage and the regenerated solvent is sent for re-use. Amines are usually employed as absorbents for CO 2 capture and monoethanolamine (MEA), <b>diisopropanolamine</b> (DIPA), N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 2 -amino- 2 - methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP) are commonly used. However, due to problems associated with alkanolamines, such as their degradation in oxygen rich atmospheres, considerable energy need for solvent regeneration, environmental issues and recycling efficiency, the quest to find alternative candidates is very important. In this work spectroscopic methods, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), are used, to both qualitatively and quantitatively characterize a range of absorbents for CO 2 capture including primary, secondary, tertiary or blended amine systems in addition to amine-amino acid absorbents. Liquid phase speciation is one of the most important experimental data for thermodynamic and kinetic modeling of absorption systems. First a comprehensive standard method for liquid phase speciation in amine and amino acid-CO 2 -H 2 O systems by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is presented and validated against measurements on monoamine, diamine and amine-amino acid systems. This method was then used for all our measurements presented in the current work. These measurements provide valuable information about the parameters that should be considered when studying different amine, amine-amino acid-CO 2 -H 2 O system by NMR spectroscopy. Carbamate stability is a very important parameter for determining the absorption capacity and regeneration energy requirement. Therefore, 13 C-NMR was employed to study the carbamate formation and to estimate the apparent carbamate stability constant in aqueous solutions of CO 2 and sterically hindered amine, 2 -amion- 2 -methyl-propan-ol, (AMP) at different temperatures. In order to determine the apparent carbamate stability constant of AMP, a method for separating amine/protonated amine and bicarbonate/carbonate was developed and presented in our work. The apparent carbamate stability constant was reported to be loading and temperature dependency. Phase change solvents for CO 2 capture was another important topic where our research was also focused. Liquid phase speciation of blended aqueous solutions of DEEA/MAPA/CO 2 /H 2 O as well as unblended MAPA/CO 2 /H 2 O and DEEA/CO 2 /H 2 O system is presented here. One of the most important information we can gain from 13 CNMR spectroscopy is the ability to distinguish between primary, secondary, di-carbamate and carbonate/bicarbonate species. Blended system of DEEA/MAPA can form two liquid phases after being loaded with CO 2 and both phases were analyzed quantitatively by NMR spectroscopy. Qualitative and quantitative NMR experiments to investigate the liquid phase speciation in amino acids (Glycine, L-Alanine, Taurine, L-Serine and L-Proline) neutralized by equimolar quantities of monoethanolamine amine (MEA) and 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 - propanol (AMP) were performed at 25 °C for different CO 2 loadings. AMP was found to have better performance in neutralizing the amino acids and enhancing the bicarbonate/carbonate formation. Further, studies were performed to develop calibration models for prediction of various systems using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Multivariate data analyses were performed to develop the models. Online analysis of monoethanolamine solvent in a pilot plant was demonstrated by application of the developed model using a mobile setup for extractive sampling to an FTIR analyzer. These results showed the possibility of developing a comprehensive multivariate calibrated model such as Partial Least Square (PLS) for on-line prediction and is well suited for analysis of amine solvents, both in the lab and for online process monitoring.
