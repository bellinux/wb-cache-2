5|$|During peacetime and war, {{the command}} {{structure}} of the Northern Army remained the same. However, <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of great conflict and crisis, the raising of large militias required the appointment of many new officers with various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of peace. Large divisions were led by a General (Jiangjun 將軍) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided {{into a number of}} regiments commanded by a Colonel, and sometimes by a Major. Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains, who ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, while companies were further divided into platoons.|$|E

5|$|The companions, {{including}} the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards. The {{ranks of the}} companions were greatly increased {{during the reign of}} Philip II when he expanded this institution to include Upper Macedonian aristocrats as well as Greeks. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king. A small amount of evidence also suggests that an assembly of the army <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of war and a people's assembly <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of peace existed in ancient Macedonia. The first recorded instance dates to 359 BC, when Philip II called together a number of assemblies to address them with speech and raise their morale following the death of Perdiccas III of Macedon in battle against the Illyrians.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

The šajkača worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non-reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram.|$|E

Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains. Platoons were the smallest units of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, koalas are {{unevenly}} distributed and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced. Koalas {{can be found in}} habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate. In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of drought and extreme heat.|$|E
5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators.

Conflicts between coyotes can arise <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of food shortage.|$|E

He is also called upon <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of pestilence. He is often depicted as a mature, bearded man wearing a royal crown and holding a long sword or banner.

5|$|The Algodones Dunes, which border old Cahuilla shorelines, {{were formed}} by sand blown from Lake Cahuilla. This theory was first {{formulated}} in 1923. The process occurred either {{immediately after the}} lake reached modern highstands, or during earlier higher stands. Most likely, sand was transported to the dune field <b>during</b> <b>times</b> where the lake receded and its bed was exposed to wind. Various stages of Lake Cahuilla may correspond to waves of migrating dunes.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of long-distance radio listening {{began in the}} 1920s when shortwave broadcasters were first established in the US and Europe.

It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a {{possible}} disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain and substantial disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: <b>during</b> <b>times</b> of higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus {{would have been much}} more extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.|$|E
