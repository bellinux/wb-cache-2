500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, Puck! Puck! I guessed {{you right}} from {{when you talked}} about the salt. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>do</b> it?' Una cried, {{swinging}} along delighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how pretty! There is Rover, and Kitty and the robins, and me! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>do</b> it, ma'am?" [...] said Marjorie, with a {{wondering}} {{glance at}} the long paint-brush, which had wrought what seemed a miracle to her childish eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{she begged}} earnestly. [...] "Be reasonable! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I marry <b>you?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think that I <b>could</b> live with <b>you</b> {{up there in}} the hills?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't that," [...] {{she said}} slowly. [...] "That was very brave, and very wonderful. It's Mr. Mallory I'm {{thinking}} of. O Billy! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it?' I asked Lyte afterwards. 'You {{knew he had}} you beaten when he drew two cards. Besides, {{you never}} looked at your own draw.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Bab, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it? Ma {{was frightened}} dreadfully," [...] said Betty, gently {{tugging at the}} striped leg, as Sancho poked his head in for another shoe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir, I cannot see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> otherwise," [...] said Aurelia, {{who could}} not bear to hear his tone of self-reproach.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You {{do not yet}} {{appreciate}} how grave it was,’ he replied. ‘It was necessary for you that your cousin should go, and go at once. You yourself had to leave to-night under cover of darkness, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> that with the Viscount in the next room? He must go, then; he must leave without delay. And that was the difficulty.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Long indeed; and that's {{exactly why}} I was {{originally}} so keen for moving you. Hadn't you shown us enough <b>how</b> beautifully <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> without it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{very fair}} indeed,' said the sister, {{scarcely}} moving her lips in her great attention. 'Now again, and again, and again. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{it in the}} time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I marvel {{little they}} were {{sometimes}} stoned!" [...] says I. [...] "But you miserable girl, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it? Why should {{you care to}} tantalise me with a moment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all a mistake, he didn't send it. Oh, Jo, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it?" [...] and Meg hid {{her face}} in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite broken.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CLANDON (sinking on the {{saddlebag}} {{seat on the}} hearth). Oh, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> make me <b>do</b> such a silly thing, Finch! I haven't danced {{since the}} soiree at South Place twenty years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{do not yet}} {{appreciate}} how grave it was," [...] he replied. [...] "It was necessary for you that your cousin should go, and go at once.

6000|$|She looked wistfully at him; {{it was on}} {{the rise}} from a season of deep {{depression}} with him. [...] "No, Si," [...] she said; [...] "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Jane, {{what is this}} I hear?--Going to the post-office in the rain!--This {{must not}} be, I assure you.--You sad girl, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there {{to take care of}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of the cheque,' {{broke in}} Mr. Edmonstone, 'and {{of all the}} rest, and of your {{providing}} for the little girl. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it with that pittance of an allowance of yours? And Master Philip saying you never had any money! No wonder, indeed!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like it! I'm so glad, so proud, I haven't {{any words}} strong and {{beautiful}} enough to half express my wonder and my admiration. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, Mac?"

6000|$|... "No. I don't see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>do</b> any of it. Come now, Freddy, ''fess up.' You've {{been playing}} the gentleman in this enterprise and all this make-up is for our benefit, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose you}} meant to hurt Henry," [...] said the mother. [...] "You always {{pretended to be}} so fond of him, and he thought the world of you. But I don't see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. I presume it was all right." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My {{only wish}} {{is to leave}} your house," [...] cried Kate, with an angry flash in her deep blue eyes. [...] "You are a cruel, wicked, hypocritical old man. You have deceived me about Mr. Dimsdale. I read it in your son's face, and now I read it in your own. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it--oh, {{how could you have}} the heart?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me, what's this, what's this!" [...] he said, {{rubbing his}} head and walking about with his good-humoured vexation. [...] "What's this they tell me?

6000|$|... 'My dear Mr. Hawtrey,--I {{was highly}} pleased {{to receive a}} note from you. Though I never doubt of the hearty sympathy and {{co-operation}} of all Eton friends (<b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so with such an annual subscription list?), yet it is very pleasant and more than pleasant to be reminded by word or by letter that prayers and wishes are being offered up for Melanesia by many good men throughout the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{goodness}} me," [...] said Mrs. Poyser, who {{had looked}} back {{while her husband}} was speaking, [...] "look where Molly is with them lads! They're the field's length behind us. <b>How</b> <b>COULD</b> <b>you</b> let 'em <b>do</b> so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the children as you.

6000|$|... "Then you got my letter, Charlie?" [...] Sir Marmaduke asked, {{when the}} first {{greetings}} were over. [...] "And yet, I <b>do</b> not see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> so. It is little over a fortnight since I wrote, and I had not looked for you for another month yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Vane was convulsed. [...] "I had {{precisely}} those misgivings! But Lemuel hadn't. He {{asked me}} what the number of our pew was, and I hadn't the heart--or else I hadn't the face--to tell him he mustn't sit in it. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think it's so very scandalous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear! well now, I {{really thought}} you were {{thinking}} of her. And I'll tell you this, Sir Lionel; {{if you want a}} wife to look after you, you couldn't do better than think of her--a nice, good-tempered, cheerful, easy, good-looking woman; with none of the Littlebath nastiness about her;--and a little money too, I've no doubt. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> better than think of her?"

6000|$|... "No, no don't {{let them}} see you! Don't let anyone know! Stay here till Uncle comes, and he'll take care of you. Oh, Charlie! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it!

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} would not, Charles. You chose the best man, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> otherwise? But {{it would not}} do! I {{determined}} that {{the time had come}} when I should reveal myself to my son, the more so as there were many signs that my most unnatural existence had seriously weakened my health. Chance, or shall I not rather say Providence, had at last made clear all that had been dark, and given me the means of establishing my innocence. My wife went yesterday to bring my boy at last to the side of his unfortunate father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Granger," [...] she said, [...] "I owe you a debt I {{never can}} repay--my dear husband's life.
