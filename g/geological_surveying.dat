25|$|In 1992, a {{redevelopment}} {{plan in the}} West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of <b>geological</b> <b>surveying</b> and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic Go-tiau-kang area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was a growing {{awareness of the need}} to protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.|$|E
