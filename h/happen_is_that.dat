2500|$|For {{the band}}'s three New York performances, {{the band members}} wore exactly the same clothes to {{facilitate}} seamless editing of the film, except for John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page who wore different sets of attire {{on some of the}} nights, which created continuity problems. Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] and the [...] "Celebration Day" [...] remaster. In an interview from 1997 Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no. [...] "I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'.

2500|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half stars out of five saying [...] "What doesn't <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{satisfying}} overall album flow, {{and when it comes to}} production, the highlights are mentioned above with the rest of the album sounding mixtape rough or just plain old. It might not be the grand arrival showcase that was expected but Papoose hasn't fallen off the [...] "ones to watch" [...] list quite yet, even when he's been on there longer than most anyone else." [...] Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a 6.5 of 10, saying [...] "The Nacerima Dream is as strong as any of Papoose's mixtapes, combining effective storytelling with displays of advanced lyricism is everything rap fans have come to expect from him. Much like fellow lyricists Canibus and Ras Kass, Papoose has been let down by some second-rate, mixtape-ish production. Whether it is a product of being stuck in mixtape territory for so long or having to work on a limited budget, The Nacerima Dream is neither dream nor nightmare. Whether you are a fan of Papoose or need convincing, you'll find something on here that you'll enjoy.|$|E
2500|$|One adviser {{suggested}} {{that students who}} are wait-listed [...] "work the wait list" [...] by staying {{in touch with the}} admissions office to make sure they know the student will attend if accepted, and possibly take steps such as forwarding new grades and making a subsequent college visit, or send a one-page letter or 60-second video describing a strong desire to attend and the reasons. A former dean of admissions at Franklin and Marshall College suggests that students not view the wait list letter as a [...] "polite denial" [...] but rather as a possible opportunity. A second report in 2011 confirmed this, and it {{suggested that}} private colleges without [...] "billion-dollar endowments or 40,000 applicants" [...] were finding that the period from May to the start of classes in fall was a time of uncertainty, with many institutions seeking new applicants, and unsure how many of the applicants that had promised to attend would, in fact, show up in the fall. What can <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> institutions {{at the top of the}} [...] "food chain" [...] accept students from their wait lists, and these students in turn sacrifice their deposit to schools lower down the chain, generating vacancies and uncertainty. A downside to wait lists is that by the time a student is accepted, there may be much less money available for scholarships or grants. There was a report in The Wall Street Journal of a few colleges, such as Franklin & Marshall, that deliberately waitlisted overqualified students on the assumption that, even if accepted, they would almost certainly not enroll. The alleged purpose was to boost the admissions yield rate––the percentage of students who accept a college's admissions offer––as a means to improve the college's overall performance on the influential US News college rankings.|$|E
