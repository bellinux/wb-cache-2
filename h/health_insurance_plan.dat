25|$|But in the Senate, Cruikshank {{had to work}} {{quickly to}} avoid disaster. Sen. Russell B. Long (D-Louisiana) offered an {{amendment}} in the Senate Finance Committee that would have turned Medicare into a catastrophic <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>plan,</b> rather than a general insurance program. Long misused a proxy vote from Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Arkansas) to help win passage of the amendment, and misled Sen. Paul Douglas (D-Illinois) that he could vote to approve the amendment because another vote would be held later after costs had been calculated (a vote Long {{had no intention of}} seeking). Knowing that the Long amendment would not pass the House nor be backed by the AFL-CIO, Cruikshank convinced Douglas to exercise his parliamentary rights and ask for reconsideration of the Long amendment. Efforts were made to find a compromise between the Long amendment and the original bill, but backers of the original bill felt they had already compromised too much. Working with Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-New Mexico), Cruikshank mustered a majority in the Finance Committee in favor of the original bill. The deciding vote came from Sen. Harry F. Byrd (D-Virginia, who had openly voted against Medicare in the past. Cruikshank made the critical decision to ask Anderson {{to go ahead with the}} vote after receiving assurances that Byrd would vote for the bill in committee but would, on principle, vote against the bill on the Senate floor.|$|E

25|$|On 20 April 2015, The Express Tribune {{claimed that}} Sharif {{administration}} misled the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the actual tax charged on {{the issuance of}} bonus shares, as collection from supposedly the biggest source of income tax in the year stands at a mere Rs. 1billion. As against the actual income tax rate of 5% {{on the value of}} bonus shares, the government has told the IMF that it levied a 10% tax, which will generate revenue equal to 0.1% of gross domestic product or Rs. 29billion. On 27 March 2016, around 2,000 far-right protesters led by Sunni Tehreek staged a sit-in at D-Chowk in front of the parliament in Islamabad, causing a partial halt to the capital city. The protestors demanded the implementation of Sharia in the country and declaring Mumtaz Qadri a martyr. The protestors also burned down cars and city main public transit station and injured journalists and bystanders. The government on the 28th called in the army to control the law and order. By 29th the crowd had shrunk to 700 protestors, however the government remained reluctant to use force against the protesters. On 30 March 2016, the protesters ended their protest after government assured not to amend in blasphemy laws. On 7 April 2016, The Express Tribune in an editorial claimed that Sharif's multibillion-rupee <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>plan</b> seems to be failing already because of poor planning, claiming that the basic health infrastructure doesn't allow for such a plan.|$|E

There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid $75,000 while those who joined afterwards were paid $50,000. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever {{took advantage of the}} privilege. NeXT's <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>plan</b> offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.
