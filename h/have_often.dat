5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD <b>have</b> <b>often</b> produced inconsistent results.|$|E
5|$|Historians <b>have</b> <b>often</b> {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees}} of positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E

50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been {{described}} as gigantic flying snake which produced strange whistling sounds, while its gaze could paralyse an intended victim and permit it to suck its blood. It <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been reported {{as the cause of}} sucking blood from sheep.|$|R
60|$|He {{made this}} exclamation on hearing {{his own name}} pronounced, and finding himself clasped about the skirts by two little boys, whose faces he <b>had</b> <b>often</b> washed, and whose suppers he <b>had</b> <b>often</b> cooked, on board of that noble and fast-sailing line-of-packet ship, the Screw.|$|R

5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them. Investigators <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons testing, {{uranium mining}} and export, {{and nuclear power}} <b>have</b> <b>often</b> {{been the subject of}} public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in Australia has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Norway has evolved {{in response to}} changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts. While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} {{regarded}} as a difficult work upon its release, and its experimental stylistic, structural, and thematic idiosyncrasies <b>have</b> <b>often</b> provoked emotional judgments from critics, ranging from fascination to repulsion. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E
5|$|Unlike First Nations {{people and}} Inuit, {{there has been}} no {{distinction}} between status and non-status, and the Métis, their heritage and Aboriginal ancestry <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to Kogami's character <b>has</b> <b>often</b> {{been positive}} {{due to his}} traits and role in the series while his rivalry with Makishima <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been praised.

5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been favourable, {{there have been}} criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5000|$|The European jaguar <b>has</b> <b>often</b> {{been thought}} to be a forest-dwelling cat, similar in habits to the modern jaguar, {{although}} recent work suggests that the association between the European jaguar and forested habitats is not as strong as <b>has</b> <b>often</b> been assumed.

5|$|At the {{national}} competition, Schools compete based on size and {{are divided into}} three divisions (I, II, and III). However, this separation is only limited to overall team score and overall individual score. Nine overall team medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for each division. Similarly, 27 overall individual medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity in each division. The rest of the medals—for example, gold in art for Honors, or silver in math for Varsity—are awarded to the top scoring persons regardless of division. In addition, winning teams <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been invited to meet the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes <b>have</b> <b>often</b> proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works <b>have</b> <b>often</b> been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{fundamental}} differences, Ginsburg considered Scalia {{her closest}} colleague on the Court. The two justices <b>have</b> <b>often</b> dined and attended the opera together. In her spare time, Ginsburg {{has appeared in}} several operas in non-speaking supernumerary roles such as Die Fledermaus (2003) and Ariadne auf Naxos (1994 with Scalia, and 2009), and spoke lines penned by her in The Daughter of the Regiment (2016).|$|E
5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times <b>have</b> <b>often</b> accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
