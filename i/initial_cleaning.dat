The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the <b>initial</b> <b>cleaning</b> and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|E

50|$|Although {{healing of}} the soft tissues will begin {{immediately}} following removal of the microbial biofilm and calculus that cause the disease, scaling and root planing {{is only the first}} step in arresting the disease process.

Immediately following treatment, the patient will need to maintain excellent oral care at home. With proper homecare, which includes but is by no means limited to brushing twice daily for 2-3 minutes, flossing daily and use of mouthrinse, the potential for effective healing following scaling and root planing increases. Commitment to and diligence in the thorough completion of daily oral hygiene practices are essential to this success. If the patient fails to change the factors that allowed the disease to set in - for example, not flossing or brushing only once a day - the infection will likely recur.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the British Museum began {{extensive}} programme of cleaning its collection of classical marble sculptures by {{the application of}} a solvent to remove atmospheric grease and a mud-pack to suck out dirt from the porous surface. The mud-pack consisted of a natural clay-like material called Sepiolite, and the procedure was known as the Sepiolite Method. By 1966 much of the reserve collection of marbles had been cleaned and only the Elgin Marbles remained. These were, however, a sensitive issue because of the cleaning scandal in the late 1930s when craftsmen had over enthusiastically scraped at natural deposits on some of the surfaces with copper tools. When the scandal broke it led to the retirement of the keeper of the Greek and Roman Department (on medical grounds!) and the resignation of an Assistant Keeper who chose to leave the Museum rather than lose seniority. Memories of this incident were still remarkably fresh in 1966 and the masons' assistants who had been doing the routine cleaning thus far were reluctant to continue with the Elgin Marbles. <b>Initial</b> <b>cleaning</b> was carried out by Andrew Oddy and a senior conservator called Hannah Lane who demonstrated that the sepiolite method did not adversely affect the marble. What it did do was to leave the surface looking rather 'milky' {{as a result of the}} removal of dirt from the surface. It was thus decided to apply a very dilute solution of a water-soluble polyethylene glycol wax. Because it is water-soluble, it is easily removed, but it did not stop a conservation scientist in Greece alleging that the British Museum had impregnated the Elgin Marbles with plastic! ...|$|E

5000|$|On 11 November 1944 Maryon was {{recruited}} {{out of retirement}} by the Trustees of the British Museum {{to serve as a}} Technical Attaché. Maryon was tasked with the conservation and reconstruction of material from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, an excavation in which he had previously expressed interest; as early as 1941, he wrote a prescient letter about the preservation of the ship impression to the museum's Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities. Nearly four years after his letter, he was assigned [...] "the real headaches - notably the crushed shield, helmet and drinking horns." [...] Composed in large part of iron, wood and horn, these items had decayed in the 1,300 years since their burial and left only fragments behind; the helmet, for one, had corroded and then smashed into more than 500 pieces. [...] "Minute work requiring acute observation and great patience," [...] these efforts occupied several years of Maryon's career. Much of Maryon's work has seen subsequent revision, [...] "but by carrying out the <b>initial</b> <b>cleaning,</b> sorting, and mounting of the mass of the fragmentary and fragile material he preserved it, and in working out out his reconstructions he made explicit the problems posed and laid the foundations upon which fresh appraisals and progress could be based when fuller archaeological study became possible."

The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the <b>initial</b> <b>cleaning</b> and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

These components can be contaminated with machining coolant, shop dirt, and fingerprints during normal processing and handling. These contaminants must be removed to achieve acceptable bond quality. As environmental concerns become more important in manufacturing, elimination {{of the use of}} hazardous materials is desired. For this reason, another process (not using nitric-hydrofluoric acid solution) to clean titanium parts before bonding was sought. <b>Initial</b> <b>cleaning</b> trials were conducted at Honeywell to screen potential cleaning techniques and chemistries. During the <b>initial</b> <b>cleaning</b> process screening phase, Pratt and Whitney provided Honeywell with machined 3 inch x 3 inch x 1 inch titanium test blocks.

The sample test blocks were ultrasonically cleaned in alkaline solutions and AUGER analysis was used by Honeywell FM and T to validate their cleanliness. This information enabled selection of final cleaning techniques and solutions to be used for the bonding trials. To validate Honeywell's AUGER data and to verify the cleaning processes in actual situations, additional sample blocks were cleaned (using the chosen processes) and then bonded.

Individual wedges independently detach and reattach during sliding, resulting in high levels of shear and normal adhesion during drag.

Chemical <b>cleaning</b> of the Si wafers was performed for 10 min with a hot (75 °C) solution of NH 4 OH, H 2 O 2 and H 2 O mixed in a volume ratio of 1 : 1 : 4. After that, the wafers were rinsed in deionized water and dried by centrifugation. The wafers were then cut {{into a number of}} rectangular samples of 9 cm 2 area. Some of samples were used to deposit copper on the surface of original bulk Si for comparative study with PS. Just before PS formation or immersion deposition of copper, each experimental sample was etched in 5 % HF solution for 30 s to remove the native oxide. Immediately after oxide removal, the Si sample was placed in an electrolytic cell made of Teflon. The active opening of the cell had a round shape and an area of 3 cm 2. Uniform PS layers were formed by electrochemical anodizing of silicon samples in a solution of HF (45 %), H 2 O, and (СН 3) 2 СНОН mixed in a 1 : 3 : 1 volume ratio. A spectrally pure graphite disk was used as contact electrode to {{the back side of the}} samples during the electrochemical treatment. Platinum spiral wire was used as cathode electrode. Anodizing was performed at a current density of 60 mA/cm 2 for 20 s. After PS formation, the HF solution was removed, and the electrolytic cell was thoroughly rinsed in (СН 3) 2 СНОН to remove products of the reactions from the pores.|$|R
40|$|The "Planning in the Early Medieval Landscape project (PEML) project, {{funded by}} the Leverhulme Trust, has {{organized}} and collated a substantial quantity of images, and has used this as {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that Anglo-Saxon building construction was based on grid-like planning structures based on fixed modules or quanta of measurement. This dataset was created and analyzed to provide some statistical contributions to the debate concerning this hypothesis. In practice the PEML images correspond to data arising {{in a wide variety of}} different forms (post-holes, actual walls, indications of linear structure arising from hedge and road lines, etc). Ideally one would wish accurately to reduce each image to a measurement-based dataset that could be analysed statistically to bear on the historical debate. In practice it does not seem feasible to produce a single automatic method which can be applied uniformly to all such images; even the <b>initial</b> chore of <b>cleaning</b> up an image (removing extraneous material such as legends and physical features which do not bear on the planning hypothesis) typically presents a separate and demanding challenge for each different image. Moreover care must be taken, even in the relatively straightforward cases of clearly defined ground-plans (for example for large ecclesiastical buildings of the period), to consider exactly what measurements might be relevant. This dataset supplies data corresponding to pilot statistical analyses concerning three different situations. These establish not only the presence of underlying structure (which indeed is often visually obvious), but also provide an account of the numerical evidence supporting the deduction that such structure is present. A full written report is supplied in our article "Perches, Post-holes and Grids", available separately in the WRAP archive...|$|R
