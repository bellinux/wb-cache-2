40|$|International audienceMass {{spectrometry}} based proteomics {{is widely}} used to study cellular processes in model organisms. However, it has not much been applied in environmental research because {{it was thought that}} free proteins would not be sufficiently stable in the environments. Based on recent observations that protein can readily be detected as a component of <b>dissolve</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon,</b> this article gives an overview about the possible use of proteomic methods in ecology and environmental sciences. At this stage, there are two areas of interest: (1) the identification of phylogenetic groups contributing to the DOC pool, and (2) identification of the origin of specific enzymes that are important for ecosystem processes. In this paper methods of mass spectrometry based proteomics were applied to identify proteins from DOC and water samples from different environments. It is demonstrated, that environmental proteomics is capable to distinguish the active set of organisms of different horizons of soils, and from various sources of surface water. Currently the limitation is given by the present knowledge of the genome of soil organisms. In addition, environmental proteomics allows to relate protein presence to biogeochemical processes, and to identify the source organisms for specific enzymes. Taking laccases as an example, it is shown that this enzyme is excreted into soils by a whole range of organisms from different phylogenetic groups. Further applications, such as in pollution reseach are conceivable. In summary, environmental proteomcis opens a new area of research between the fields of microbiology and biogeochemistry...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{determining}} the additives being suitable for stabilization/solidification of sludge (produced during wastewater treatment) by fly ash. Fly ash, fly ash with Portland cement, and fly ash with lime were tested as the binders. Different quantities of Portland cement or lime added to fly ash as a binder were mixed with sludge produced during wastewater treatment. Carbon black {{was added to}} the mixture of the sludge with a binder in 1, 2, 3 wt% to reduce DOC (<b>dissolve</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon)</b> leachability. The prepared mixtures were left in laboratory conditions for 28 days to solidify. Then the effectiveness of sludge stabilization was evaluated by water-leaching test carried out on specimens according to Czech regulations. The specimens in distilled water of the water/solid ratio of 10 / 1 were mixed together and shaken for 24 hours. Due to high content of organic compounds in the sludge, the DOC content in water leachate was chosen as a relevant criterion. Stabilization/solidification of sludge by means of fly ash decreased the leachability of DOC from 2, 320 mg/dm 3 to 164 mg/dm 3 in water leachate of a mixture with 40 wt% of sludge. Addition of a carbon black (1 wt%) decreased the leachability of DOC by almost three times (61 mg/dm 3 for the mixture with 40 wt% of sludge). Addition of Portland cement or lime to fly ash did not give any remarkable effect on the decrease in DOC leachability from wastewater sludge...|$|R
