5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter-gatherers of Khoisan descent. Although {{most of these}} early inhabitants {{are believed to have}} been either overwhelmed, driven away or, in some cases, assimilated by later migrants to the area, physical traces of their occupation survive in certain <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> <b>groups</b> inhabiting modern-day Jubaland {{and other parts of the}} south. The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile, Aweer, the Wa-Ribi, and especially the Wa-Boni. By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo (Wardai) and Ajuuraan (Ma'adanle) had already formed settlements of their own in the sub-region.|$|E
5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> <b>groups,</b> such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} different institutions on ethnic minorities’ political participation. Based {{on the results of}} a hierarchical cross-country comparison, we found that individuals belonging to <b>ethnic</b> <b>minorities</b> were less likely to participate in national elections than members of the majority groups within the same country. We tested whether this negative effect of belonging to an <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> on political participation could be attenuated by inclusive institutions such as suffrage rights, horizontal power-sharing institutions (Proportional electoral system PR, effective proportionality, the number of government parties) or vertical power-dividing institutions in terms of federalism (subnational elections and subnational authority) attenuated the negative effect of belonging to an <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> <b>group.</b> The results of multilevel analyses showed that suffrage rights attenuate the negative effect of minority status on political participation. In contrast, power dividing enhances the negative effect of belonging to an <b>ethnic</b> <b>minority</b> <b>group</b> on political participation...|$|R
