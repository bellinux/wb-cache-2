The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an <b>ellipticity</b> of 0.70±0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z=0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's redshift of z=0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may {{have been associated with}} an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their <b>ellipticity,</b> ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|NGC 772 is {{a spiral}} galaxy with an {{integrated}} magnitude of 10.3, located southeast of β Arietis and 15 arcminutes west of 15 Arietis. It {{is a relatively}} bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and <b>ellipticity</b> in an amateur telescope. It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its surface brightness, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a class SA(s)b galaxy, which means {{that it is an}} unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly. The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many star forming regions; this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies. NGC 772 has a small companion galaxy, NGC 770, that is about 113,000 light-years away from the larger galaxy. The two galaxies together are also classified as Arp 78 in the Arp peculiar galaxy catalog. NGC 772 has a diameter of 240,000 light-years and the system is 114 million light-years from Earth. Another spiral galaxy in Aries is NGC 673, a face-on class SAB(s)c galaxy. It is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms. It has no ring and a faint bulge and is 2.5 by 1.9 arcminutes.

40|$|The slow inward {{flow of the}} hot gas in {{elliptical}} galaxy cooling flows {{is nearly impossible to}} detect directly due to instrumental limitations. However, in rotating galaxies, if the inflowing gas conserves angular momentum, it will eventually form a disk. The X-ray signature of this phenomenon is a flattening of the X-ray isophotes in the inner 1 - 10 kpc region. This effect is observable, so we have searched for it in X-ray observations of six rotating and non-rotating early-type galaxies, obtained mainly with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI imagers. The <b>ellipticities</b> of the X-ray emission never increase toward the central region, nor are the X-ray <b>ellipticities</b> significantly greater than the <b>ellipticities</b> for the optical stellar emission. Central <b>ellipticities</b> in excess of 0. 5 were expected in rotating ellipticals whereas values of 0 - 0. 2 are measured.

It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more thin film layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their reflection properties, not only are the predicted magnitude of the p and s polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the p and s reflections, as well as change of polarization <b>ellipticity</b> (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied.

Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its <b>ellipticity</b> changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E

A comparison with optical images and photometry shows that the hot gas morphology has surprisingly {{little in common with}} the shape of the stellar distribution. We observe no correlation between optical and X-ray <b>ellipticities</b> in the inner regions where stellar mass dominates over dark matter. A shallow correlation would be expected if the gas had settled into hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential. Instead, observed X-ray <b>ellipticities</b> exceed optical <b>ellipticities</b> in many cases. We exclude rotation as the dominant factor to produce the gas <b>ellipticities.</b> The gas appears disturbed, and hydrostatic equilibrium is {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Nearly all hydrostatic models can be ruled out at 99 % confidence, based of their inability to reproduce the optical-X-ray correlation and large X-ray <b>ellipticities.</b> Hydrostatic models not excluded are those in which dark matter either dominates over stellar mass inside the inner half-light radius or has a prominently cigar-shaped distribution, both of which can be ruled out on other grounds. We conclude that, even for rather X-ray faint elliptical galaxies, the gas is at least so far out of equilibrium that it does not retain any information about the shape of the potential, and that X-ray derived radial mass profiles may be in error by factors of order unity.

25|$|Lenticular galaxies share {{kinematic}} properties {{with both}} spiral and elliptical galaxies. This {{is due to}} the significant bulge and disk nature of lenticulars. The bulge component is similar to elliptical galaxies in that it is pressure supported by a central velocity dispersion. This situation is analogous to a balloon, where the motions of the air particles (stars in a bulge's case) are dominated by random motions. However, the kinematics of lenticular galaxies are dominated by the rotationally supported disk. Rotation support implies the average circular motion of stars in the disk is responsible for the stability of the galaxy. Thus kinematics are often used to distinguish lenticular galaxies from elliptical or spiral galaxies. The distinction between spiral galaxies and lenticular galaxies is often simpler to analyze as the dividing line is often set at a particular bulge-to-disk ratio. Determining the distinction between elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies often relies on the measurements of velocity dispersion (σ), rotational velocity (v), and <b>ellipticity</b> (ε). In order to differentiate between lenticulars and ellipticals, one typically looks at the v/σ ratio for a fixed ε. For example, a rough criterion for distinguishing between lenticular and elliptical galaxies is that elliptical galaxies have v/σ < 0.5 for ε = 0.3. The motivation behind this criterion is that lenticular galaxies do have prominent bulge and disk components whereas elliptical galaxies have no disk structure. Thus, lenticulars have much larger v/σ ratios than ellipticals due to their non-negligible rotational velocities (due to the disk component) in addition to not having as prominent of a bulge component compared to elliptical galaxies.|$|E

The <b>ellipticity</b> parameter is an alternative parameterization of an ellipse's eccentricity , or the <b>ellipticity</b> angle, χ=arctanb/a=arctan1/ε as is shown in the figure. The angle χ is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincaré sphere (see below) is equal to ±2χ.
