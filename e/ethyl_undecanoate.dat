40|$|In {{this report}} a phase diagram is {{determined}} by heat flux DSC of the binary mixture <b>Ethyl</b> <b>undecanoate</b> and Ethyl tridecanoate. Our hypothesis for equilibrium phase behaviour is that the components <b>Ethyl</b> <b>undecanoate</b> and Ethyl tridecanoate do have the same crystal form and they have restricted miscibility in that form. However, {{the results of the}} DSC measurements are complex and are not unambiguous. We determined a simple phase diagram and calculated it with the program Winifit. The calculated phase diagram with the program shows good similarity with the one obtained by the experiments. The excess Gibbs energy parameters of the solid state are determined with Winifit, being A = 5000 J. mol- 1 and B = 0, 1. The mole fraction of the critical point XC is calculated as XC = 0, 43. The critical temperature C T at XC = 0, 43 is also calculated, being C T = 307, 2 K. For better understanding the crystal structures have to be examined in greater detail. On the left-hand side and on the right-hand side of the phase diagram they have to be the same...|$|E
40|$|Arrays of aligned carbon {{nanotubes}} {{formed by}} self-assembly on a Si (100) surface are described. The {{surface of a}} Si (100) wafer has been modified by reaction of hydride-terminated Si (100) with ethyl undecylenate to give <b>ethyl</b> <b>undecanoate</b> self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) which were linked by stable silicon–carbon covalent bonds. The ester terminus of the monolayer was converted to an alcohol whereupon shortened carbon nanotubes were covalently attached using carbodiimide coupling. The formation of the SAM and its subsequent modification with nanotubes has been followed using a series of techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), IR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.

40|$|Arrays of aligned single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWCNTs) {{have been}} {{attached to a}} Si (100) surface using two approaches. The first method uses a self-assembled <b>ethyl</b> <b>undecanoate</b> monolayer (SWCNTs-SAM structure), while the second sees the nanotubes attached directly to an ultrathin SiO 2 layer (SWCNTs-SiO 2 structure). The optical and electrochemical properties of two nanotube arrays were compared by fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The {{results show that the}} SWCNTs-SiO 2 structure has strong coupling between the attached SWCNTs and the silicon substrate, but the coupling gets smaller with increasing size of attached SWCNT bundles. The SWCNTs-SAM structure shows poor conductivity and electrochemical reversibility. The SWCNTs-SiO 2 structure does appear to be a very useful substrate for use in further applications.

40|$|A simple {{chemical}} {{strategy is}} described to produce branched alkyl chains on Si(111) from {{the reaction of}} an ester-terminated silicon surface. The stability of the silicon surfaces with linear and branched monolayers is characterized by electrochemical impedance, Kelvin probe, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The direct observation of surface states in capacitance-voltage plots {{can be used to}} monitor the growth of electrically active defects associated with oxidation of the silicon substrate. We find that the total surface state density of the freshly made surfaces increases in the following order: Si-B < Si-UDE < Si-C 10 (where B is the branched structure, UDE is <b>ethyl</b> <b>undecanoate,</b> and C 10 is decyl) in aqueous and organic solvent/electrolyte systems. After 24 h in the electrolyte solution, the surface state densities increase but the order remains the same. The branched structure is significantly more resistant to oxidation. These observations are consistent with the results of other characterization techniques including HREELS and surface photovoltage and indicate that the branched alkyl chain-modified surfaces are considerably more stable, especially in aqueous electrolytes, making them suitable for future use in biological sensor applications.
