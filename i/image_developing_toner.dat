According to the film texture, image constructive units number that interfere the image resolution are not increased more than a certain limitation in area unite. This innovation is to present an imaging system that to compare with common similar system has precedence such as highly image resolution, image edge sharpnessenhancement, contrast improvement, patient does reduction, rapid processing and cost decrease. The "Xero" technique is different physical method for imaging procedures in which instead of using the photochemical function, electrostatic effect has been used. The latent electrostatic <b>images</b> <b>develop</b> through <b>toner</b> powder, Because the toner powder particles are fine grain {{as small as a}} few compound molecules, Consequently, in the new method, image constructive units number which are described as the toner powder particles are much many more in number than crystals of radiographic films. Xeroradiophotography system is designed and constructed based on xero physical phenomenon in which image can be formed by taking advantage of both, X-Ray and visible light complex procedure for the purpose of X-Rays quality and patients body tissue side effect reduction at the time of exposure. This system has already been made as the first archetype in the world that is possible for optimum improving soon...|$|R

40|$|Image {{quality and}} the {{mechanisms}} involved in digital dry toner electrophotography {{are influenced by the}} interactions between the printing machine, toner and paper in the last two steps where the paper is involved, i. e., in transferring the <b>developed</b> <b>image</b> <b>toner</b> to the paper, and in fusing the image to be fixed permanently on the paper surface. This study discusses the role of paper in these two steps in different technologies and its effect on the printing mechanisms and image quality. The control of optical, electrostatic and mass and heat transfer phenomena in the printing process are affected by the unevenness of the properties of paper due to its heterogeneous structure and its sensitivity to humidity conditions and printing process parameters. In this research, a set of experiments was conducted to understand the electrostatic behaviour of paper in toner transfer and thermal behaviour in toner fusing. The results show that not only image quality is affected by the variability of paper properties, but also the mechanisms of toner transfer and fusing. Accordingly, the research suggests that the paper should be included as part of the printing mechanism, performance (printability and runnability), and image quality. Consequently, if there is a change in paper properties due to a change in ambient conditions or the use of another grade for a specific application, the process parameters can be adjusted to compensate for these changes {{in order to meet the}} requirements for image quality. It was found that the variability in image quality in terms of colours (the requirement for different toner layers), grey scale (halftone structure) and the location of the image in the xy-plane is affected when rendered through the electrophotographic process. The fast mechanical speed in printing machine direction drives the toner transfer and fusing mechanisms differently from the cross machine direction. As a result, a certain image element such as a line will have different quality in these two printing directions, or if the line is placed in the length or width direction of the page. The conclusion was that the electrophotographic process should be designed to reduce or even to neglect the effect of paper when printing a high-quality colour image in a high-speed process. This can be achieved by eliminating the contact with paper from the image side in both transfer and fusing by adopting the technologies of toner jumping transfer and non-contact flash fusing. These technologies have special requirements for chemical and physical toner properties, such as modification for equal absorbance of the flash radiation by CMYK colours, a suitable melting viscosity and surface energy, and a small and narrow toner particle size and shape distribution to unify the charge-to-mass ratio of the toner, which is important for transfer quality and efficiency. To ensure high print quality for different applications, some of the transfer and fusing parameters need to be automatically adjusted according to substrate specific properties and levels of image coverage...|$|R

40|$|Silver halide {{solvents}} {{are commonly}} used in the first developer of a reversal process to obtain brighter highlights and a higher effective speed. An investigation was carried out {{to determine the effect}} of a low and high level of solvent on the sensitometric char acteristics as well as the covering power, granularity, modulation transfer function (MTF) and the information storage capacity of Plus-X reversal film 7276. The investigation was designed such that the only variable in the systems studied was the first developer. D- 67, i. e., D- 19 containing two grams liter^- 1 of potassium thiocyanate, was chosen as the high solvent first developer. D- 19 with twenty-five grams liter^- 1 of sodium sulfite, designated D 19 - 25 in this investigation, was the low solvent first developer. Four systems were studied: 1) negative <b>images</b> <b>developed</b> in a low solvent developer (D 19 - 25) 2) positive <b>images</b> <b>developed</b> in D- 19 using a low solvent first developer (D 19 - 25) 3) negative <b>images</b> <b>developed</b> in a high solvent developer (D- 6 7) 4) positive <b>images</b> <b>developed</b> in D- 19 using a high solvent first developer (D- 67) The information storage capacity for each system was calculated from the signal to noise ratio across the spatial frequency range of zero cycles mm^- 1 to twenty-five cycles mm^- 1. The signal to noise ratio was determined from the gamma value of the D-log H curves, the MTF and the Wiener spectrum ordinate value derived from the granularity. Comparisons between the systems were made for each parameter as well as the information storage capacity. The comparisons were made two different ways: 1) at equal densities and 2) at equal exposures. No significant differences attributable to the solvent were found in the granularity, MTF and the information storage capacity when the ccmparisons were made at density levels of 0. 50, 1. 00 and 1. 50 above base plus fog. Differences were seen in the covering power of each system. Slower speed and dark highlights, as evidenced in the positive D-log H curves, were obtained using D 19 - 25 as the first developer. In creasing the exposure to compensate for the lower speed would not correct the dim highlights. This indicated that perhaps a more viable comparison could be made at equal exposure levels. Differences were observed in the covering power, granularity and information storage capacity when the comparisons were made at equal exposure levels. The covering power did not appear to influence the information storage capacity results since the trends were not the same. The covering power of the D- 67 negative system was lower than the D 19 - 25 negative system due to solution-physical development effects. The covering power of the positive systems were not different. The covering power values obtained for the positive systems were about forty- five percent higher than the covering power values. The granularity affected the information storage capacity re sults the most. As the granularity increased across the exposure range the amount of information detected decreased. Larger dif ferences were observed between the positive systems than the negative systems. Positive <b>images</b> <b>developed</b> in D- 67 showed cleaner highlights, i. e., a lower D_min. level on the D-log H curve, a higher effective speed, about a ten percent decrease in granularity and an increase of about eighteen percent in the information storage capacity. Processing in a high solvent first developer provided a distinct advantage over development in a low solvent developer in terms of the parameters investigated in this study...|$|R
