5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but {{like the rest of}} the playing squad, was told he could find a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{successes in}} Germany {{had made him}} popular with the soldiers. He had <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} blow to Rome's enemies, quelled an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome. His actions had increased his fame, and he had become very popular with the Roman people. Tiberius took notice, and had Germanicus recalled to Rome and informed {{him that he would}} be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.|$|E
5|$|In 1259, Geoffrey {{participated in}} the princely army that joined the Achaean–Epirote–Sicilian {{alliance}} opposing the Empire of Nicaea. The allied forces, riven by distrust between the Latins and the Epirote Greeks, were <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> crushing defeat in the Battle of Pelagonia. Prince William {{and most of his}} barons, including Geoffrey, were captured {{in the aftermath of the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|In a {{political}} and economic referendum held in November 1987, 67% of the eligible voters participated {{and most of them}} approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically stringent passage requirements self-imposed by the regime. The referendum debacle <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> blow to the process of market-oriented economic reforms, which had been pursued by Polish governments since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|It was {{estimated}} that a complete lockout had cost an upwards of $1 billion in lost television advertisement revenue. The lockout had <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> sizable {{blow to the}} current licensed product market which {{was estimated}} at $2.7 billion, and had created a big loss in television ratings for networks that cover NBA games such as the regional sports networks, TNT and ESPN.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> double {{blow to the}} state's economy, {{which had}} {{significantly}} improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, blacks left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation. In 1940, Texas was 74 percent Anglo, 14.4 percent black, and 11.5 percent Hispanic.|$|E

5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years he would serve on the always-virulent {{south-eastern}} border, where he made his home in the city of Illńce. In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> crushing defeat to Toğay bey's (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pułkowniks in Koniecpolski's army, and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame. That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit, but he still held the rank of a porucznik of hussars.|$|E

5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E
5|$|He {{played a}} major role, often as the top {{commander}} of the Commonwealth forces, in the Wallachian campaign of 1599–1600, the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–11, the Polish–Muscovite War of 1605–18, and the Polish–Ottoman War of 1620–21. His most famous victory was the Battle of Kircholm in 1605, in which he <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> major defeat to a Swedish army {{three times the size}} of his own. He died on the front lines during the battle of Chocim, in the besieged Khotyn Fortress, a few days before the Ottomans gave up on the siege and agreed to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|In {{a special}} congressional {{election}} held June 20, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats. Confederate sympathizers won only the Jackson Purchase region, which was economically linked to Tennessee by the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Believing defeat {{at the polls}} was certain, many Southern Rightists had boycotted the election; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000. Confederate sympathizers were <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in veto-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the House and 27–11 in the Senate. From then on, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.|$|E

Players are <b>dealt</b> <b>an</b> incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt {{to the center of}} the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a three-card hand. This variant was inspired by Texas hold-'em poker.|$|R
5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the Horns of Hattin, {{near the}} village of Hattin. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E
5|$|One of Koniecpolski's {{greatest}} victories {{occurred during}} a winter 1644 campaign against Tatars. With a large army of some 19,000 soldiers (60% of them, magnates' private armies; Koniecpolski's own forces numbered 2,200) he <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> crushing defeat to Toğay bey's forces near Ochmatów on 30 January 1644. Many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice {{over the water}} gave way. The Battle of Ochmatów, the Commonwealth's greatest victory over the Tatars {{in the first half}} of the 17th century, brought international fame to Koniecpolski, who had not only predicted the time and place of their attack but had destroyed their forces before they could deploy their usual tactic of splitting their main forces into multiple highly-mobile units (czambuls).|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Oberhof sprint in January 2010, Neuner injured her back during warm-up {{and had to}} withdraw. She {{returned}} in Ruhpolding where she came in third in both the sprint and the mass start race. In her first relay of the season, she <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> blow to the German team by incurring two penalty loops, with Germany finishing fourth eventually. With some top competitors missing in Antholz at the last World Cup before the 2010 Winter Olympics, Neuner won two events—the first individual race of her career {{as well as the}} sprint, giving her 16 career World Cup wins. She also came in second in the pursuit, which marked her seventh consecutive podium finish.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{citizens}} {{had only}} three days from 23 - 25 January to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes for the new currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, long queues formed in front of Soviet savings banks, {{even though it was}} also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices. This reform also <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
5|$|The Galilean moons were {{discovered}} in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's discovery showed {{the importance of the}} telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. More importantly, the incontrovertible discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth <b>dealt</b> <b>a</b> serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, or the geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.|$|E
