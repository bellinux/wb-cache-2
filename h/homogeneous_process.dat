Later, the milk may be given stronger heat treatment to be preserved longer. Cooling thermized milk before reheating is necessary to delay/prevent the outgrowth of bacterial spores. When the milk is first heated, spores can begin to germinate, but their growth can be halted or delayed when the milk is refrigerated, depending on the microorganisms' growth requirements. Germinated spores are sensitive to subsequent heating, however since germination is not a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>process,</b> not all spores will germinate or be inactivated by subsequent heating.|$|E

Systems with an {{arbitrary}} number of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>processes</b> occur in many applications. The Parameterized Model Checking Problem (PMCP) {{is to determine}} whether a temporal property is true of every size instance of the system.

40|$|Abstract: Among {{various types}} of rolling chatter, third-octave-mode chatter is {{considered}} the most critical because it generates large gauge variations in the rolled materials and may damage the rolling mill. In this three-part paper, a new chatter model that combines a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>process</b> model with suitable mill structure models is presented. Based on this model, the system’s stability is investigated {{in the light of}} various mechanisms that may lead to the onset of third-octave-mode chatter. Stability criteria for each mechanism are established in terms of relevant rolling process parameters, and their influences on overall system stability are demonstrated. Part 1 deals with the general formulation of single- and multiple-stand chatter models...|$|E

The random vibration environment introduces the need for selecting a statistical process that best describes the random loads and permits computation of the dynamic response parameters of interest. Furthermore, it requires a formulation of design constraints that would minimize the conservativeness in the design and retain computational viability.
