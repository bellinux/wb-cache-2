500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a <b>design</b> <b>point</b> of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{significant}} <b>design</b> <b>point</b> {{was that}} the city itself was nestled in between Mount Ainslie and Mount Bimberi and used their collective picturesque amenity as visual foci for the street layout and to convey civic power. Hence, the Griffins aligned democracy with the most powerful force of all: nature. Consequentially, given it was so severely overshadowed, the traditional methodology of using grand architecture to convey power was rendered less significant. This approach was strongly influenced by Pierre Charles L’Enfant's 1792 design for Washington, D.C. L’Enfant's design included wide, tree-lined avenues that would visually connect significant topographical sites over the city. He therefore drew on the picturesque by ensuring views of the landscape and notably the wilderness of the unchartered west, which beckoned [...] " [...] democracy's westward expansion.".|$|E
40|$|Two {{multipoint}} design {{procedures were}} applied to reduce the wave drag of a baseline airfoil at two <b>design</b> <b>points.</b> The first procedure iteratively averages two intermediate airfoil shapes, each one redesigned {{at one of the}} two <b>design</b> <b>points,</b> to develop an improved airfoil. The second procedure iteratively averages two pressure distributions, each one obtained from an intermediate airfoil redesigned at one of the two <b>design</b> <b>points,</b> to develop an improved airfoil.

40|$|The use of Bayesian methodologies {{for solving}} optimal {{experimental}} design problems has increased. Many {{of these methods}} {{have been found to}} be computationally intensive for design problems that require a large number of <b>design</b> <b>points.</b> A simulation-based approach that can be used to solve optimal design problems in which one is interested in finding a large number of (near) optimal <b>design</b> <b>points</b> for a small number of design variables is presented. The approach involves the use of lower dimensional parameterisations that consist of a few design variables, which generate multiple <b>design</b> <b>points.</b> Using this approach, one simply has to search over a few design variables, rather than searching over a large number of optimal <b>design</b> <b>points,</b> thus providing substantial computational savings. The methodologies are demonstrated on four applications, including the selection of sampling times for pharmacokinetic and heat transfer studies, and involve nonlinear models. Several Bayesian design criteria are also compared and contrasted, as well as several different lower dimensional parameterisation schemes for generating the many <b>design</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

40|$|Continuously Variable Transmissions {{have the}} {{potential}} to change robotics. When used in a drive train in combination with a spring, they could significantly reduce energy consumption. However, so far these advantages have been shown in theory only. To exploit the concept of a Continuously Variable transmission to its full potential it should have certain properties and be designed with some critical <b>design</b> <b>points</b> in mind. In this work, we propose three properties that a Continuously Variable Transmission needs to have and two critical <b>design</b> <b>points</b> that should be optimised in a design. We propose a novel concept of a lever with a movable pivot where the pivot always moves along the lever. A realisation of this concept is discussed and evaluated with respect to the required properties and critical <b>design</b> <b>points.</b> We conclude that the realisation has the required properties and that the performance on the critical <b>design</b> <b>points</b> can be improved by improving the mechanical design...|$|R

40|$|Performing a {{computer}} experiment {{can be viewed}} as observing a mapping between the model parameters and the corresponding model outputs predicted by the computer model. In view of this, experimental design for computer experiments {{can be thought of as}} devising a reliable procedure for finding configurations of <b>design</b> <b>points</b> in the parameter space so that their images represent the manifold parametrized by such a mapping (i. e., computer experiments). Traditional space-filling designs aim to achieve this goal by filling the parameter space with <b>design</b> <b>points</b> that are as "uniform" as possible in the parameter space. However, the resulting <b>design</b> <b>points</b> may be non-uniform in the model output space and hence fail to provide a reliable representation of the manifold, becoming highly inefficient or even misleading in case the computer experiments are non-linear. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm that fills in the model output manifold uniformly [...] -rather than the parameter space uniformly [...] -so that one could obtain a reliable understanding of the model behaviors with the minimal number of <b>design</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R
