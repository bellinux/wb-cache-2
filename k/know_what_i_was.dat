500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking about when I wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} a tour to promote Evanescence's previous album, The Open Door, Amy Lee {{said that she}} [...] "just sort of took off and didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do next." [...] According to Lee, she was unsure at the time when—or if—Evanescence would continue. After {{taking a break from}} music for 18 months, she decided she wanted to work with the band members and it [...] "became more of a group project". Lee admitted to an identity crisis: [...] " [...] Fallen happened really fast, and it was just go, go, go for a couple years, and we went right into writing and wrote the next record. By the time we finished touring with The Open Door, I just needed to go, 'Who am I as an adult? During her hiatus, Lee began painting, attended concerts and museums and listened to folk and indie music.|$|E
500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E

500|$|Forbidden Zone {{featured}} Bright's first work on film, and {{his only}} {{work as an}} actor (under the name [...] "Toshiro Baloney"). A {{founding member of the}} Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.|$|E
500|$|On November 8, 2006, the {{day after}} she filed for divorce from Federline, Spears {{recorded}} [...] "Radar" [...] with Ezekiel Lewis and Patrick M. Smith of The Clutch at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Lewis had {{wanted to work with}} her {{for a long time and}} was motivated to produce something for her that was going to [...] "help her project become a great project to come back with". Smith stated that the team tried to create a record [...] "for the Britney Spears that we know and love" [...] and that it did not [...] "touch on anything that was really dealing with all the stuff that she was dealing with." [...] Both commented that although Spears arrived late to the recording sessions, she caught them off guard with her efficiency and professionalism, with Lewis adding, [...] "It was absolutely nuts, and she took directions very well. [...] I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> expecting because we went in to cut that record {{the day after}} she filed divorce from Kevin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{instrumentation}} {{was recorded}} by Bloodshy & Avant at Bloodshy & Avant Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In November 2006, Spears recorded [...] "Radar" [...] with Ezekiel Lewis and Patrick M. Smith of The Clutch at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Lewis {{had wanted to}} work with her {{for a long time and}} was motivated to produce something for her that was going to [...] "help her project become a great project to come back with".

[...] I don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> expecting because we went in to cut that record the day after she filed divorce from Kevin [...]" [...] The song was later mixed by Niklas Flyckt at Mandarine Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. [...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, according to Lewis. [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was released instead and [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as the fourth single. In July 2008, a CD single was released in countries such as New Zealand and Sweden. However, a wider release was scrapped when Spears began recording new material for her sixth studio album, Circus. On May 7, 2009, the song was announced as the fourth single from Circus.|$|E
2500|$|According to Scott Speedman, {{the actor}} who portrays Michael in the franchise, about how his [...] "personal lack of gun {{knowledge}} worked in his favor"; [...] "I get to carry a gun once in the movie and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, and that was appropriate. I'm the [...] "girlfriend". Every time I've got this shocked look {{on my face and}} she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror. When I was watching it I was like, [...] "Wow, how weird."

2500|$|In {{the last}} hours, Buford was {{attended}} by his aide, Captain Myles Keogh, and by Edward, his black servant. Also present were Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Alexander and General Stoneman. His wife Pattie was traveling from Rock Island, Illinois, but would not arrive in time. Near the end, he became delirious and began admonishing the servant, but then, {{in a moment of}} clarity, called for the man and apologized: [...] "Edward, I hear that I have been scolding you. I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. You have been a faithful servant, Edward." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Waterston, Anderson did {{not have}} a clear goal while on set but it did not feel chaotic. Brolin {{expressed}} similar feelings saying that [...] "It was crazy, chaotic but really, really gratifying." [...] Brolin also stated that there was [...] "a really strange lack of pretense" [...] but that Anderson would work with the actors when they felt something was not working. Pieterse stated that Anderson allowed [...] "freedom and flexibility to really dive into your character and shape the scene". Wilson said [...] "Sometimes I wouldn't necessarily <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. We were encouraged to kind of do anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|His mother {{enrolled}} him in Southwest Bible Institute, in Waxahachie, Texas, so that {{he would}} be exclusively singing evangelical songs. But Lewis daringly played a boogie-woogie rendition of [...] "My God Is Real" [...] at a church assembly, which ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show, Lewis played some [...] "worldly" [...] music. The next morning, the dean of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them. Lewis said that Green should not be expelled because [...] "he didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second season}} doubled the running {{time of the}} first from 11 minutes to 22 minutes; {{according}} to Weidenfeld in an interview with USA Today, this was done in accordance with the network's expanding timeslot. Neely stated that [...] "I think we decided, in concert with the network, that it would benefit the show. The show kept growing, and our storytelling style and structure just needed more room. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing when I was writing in the 11-minute format; I was just cramming 22 minutes in there." [...] Weidenfeld considered the first season [...] "essentially 10 mini-pilots" [...] converging into a larger show. He stated that the network thought the increase in length led to a [...] "perfect fit" [...] for the show's expanding universe. He stated that he and his crew had developed up to 300 named characters which will be inserted throughout the series.|$|E
