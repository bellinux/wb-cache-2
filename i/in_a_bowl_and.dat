25|$|Kotlety (minced cutlets, meatballs), {{are small}} pan-fried meat balls, not {{dissimilar}} from Salisbury steak {{and other such}} dishes. Made primarily from pork and beef (sometimes also from chicken or fish), they are easily made and require little time. Ground beef, pork, onions and bread are put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> mixed thoroughly until it becomes relatively consistent. Once this effect is achieved, balls are formed and then put into a hot frying pan to cook.|$|E

2500|$|Ergodic {{theory is}} often {{concerned}} with ergodic transformations. [...] The intuition behind such transformations, which act {{on a given}} set, {{is that they do}} a thorough job [...] "stirring" [...] the elements of that set [...] (e.g., if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> if a spoonful of syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout. [...] At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.) [...] Here is the formal definition.|$|E

2500|$|Because Maya {{society was}} {{organised}} as independent city states, the local {{political and religious}} elites could independently initiate human sacrifices as they saw fit. De Landa notes that a common cause for temple sacrifices in many cities was the occurrence of [...] "pestilences, dissensions, or droughts or the like ills". (p.91) In such cases, slaves were usually purchased and after a variety of rituals were anointed with blue dye and either shot with arrows through the heart or held on an altar while the priest swiftly removed the heart using a ceremonial knife. In either case the heart {{was presented to the}} temple idol, which was also anointed with blood. According to Bancroft, one tribe sacrificed illegitimate boys twice a year, again by removing the heart, but collecting the blood <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> scattering it to the four cardinal compass points within the temple.|$|E

6000|$|Moy (pronounce Moÿ) was a {{pleasant}} little village, gathered round a château in a moat. The air was perfumed with hemp from neighbouring fields. At the Golden Sheep we found excellent entertainment. German shells from the siege of La Fère, Nürnberg figures, gold-fish <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> all manner of knick-knacks, embellished the public room.

60|$|I {{ran over}} the little bright brook {{that came from}} the weedy, bottom pond. The stepping-stones were white in the sun, and the water slid sleepily among them.

Within, everything was so still and cool that my steps hung heavily along the path. The bracken held out arms to me, and the bosom of the wood was full of sweetness, but I journeyed on, spurred by the attacks of an army of flies which kept up a guerrilla warfare round my head till I had passed the black rhododendron bushes in the garden, where they left me, scenting no doubt Rebecca's pots of vinegar and sugar.|$|E

6000|$|A farm {{in spring}} is all birth-young things {{coming out of}} bud and shell, and human beings {{watching}} over the process with faint excitement feeding and tending what has been born. So still the young man sat, that a mother-goose, with stately cross-footed waddle, brought her six yellow-necked grey-backed goslings to strop their little beaks against the grass blades at his feet. Now and again Mrs. Narracombe or the girl Megan would come and ask if he wanted anything, and he would smile and say: [...] "Nothing, thanks. It's splendid here." [...] Towards tea-time they came out together, bearing a long poultice of some dark stuff <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> after a long and solemn scrutiny of his swollen knee, bound it on. When they were gone, {{he thought of the}} girl's soft [...] "Oh!"--of her pitying eyes, and the little wrinkle in her brow.

He said Nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom they had acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have courage and do his best to learn, and at that {{all the people in the}} door-way murmured encouragingly. He said the night--for the blind call their day night--was now far gone, and it behooved everyone to go back to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to sleep, and Nunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food. They brought him food, llama's milk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> rough salted bread, and led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing, and afterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused them to begin their day again.

If {{we are to be}} made fools of in this fashion by the peepings and mutterings of Kaffir witch-doctors we had better give up and die at once to go and live among the dead, whose business it is to peep and mutter. Our business is to dwell in the world and to face its troubles and dangers until such time as it pleases God to call us out of the world, paying no heed to omens and magic and such like sin and folly. Let that come which will come, and let us meet it like men and women, giving glory to the Almighty for the ill {{as well as for the}} good, since both ill and good come from His hands and are part of His plan.

6000|$|... "I {{was weak}} and hungry, {{and my mind}} kept on {{behaving}} like a beetle on a pin, tremendous activity and nothing done {{at the end of}} it. Come round just where it was before. There was sorrowing for the other chaps, beastly drunkards certainly, but not deserving such a fate, and young Sanders with the spear through his neck wouldn't go out of my mind. There was the treasure down there in the Ocean Pioneer, and how one might get it and hide it somewhere safer, and get away and come back for it. And there was the puzzle where to get anything to eat. I tell you I was fair rambling. I was afraid to ask by signs for food, for fear of behaving too human, and so there I sat and hungered until very near the dawn. Then the village got a bit quiet, and I couldn't stand it any longer, and I went out and got some stuff like artichokes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>and</b> some sour milk. What was left of these I put away among the other offerings, just to give them a hint of my tastes. And in the morning they came to worship, and found me sitting up stiff and respectable on their previous god, just as they'd left me overnight. I'd got my back against the central pillar of the hut, and, practically, I was asleep. And that's how I became a god among the heathen--a false god no doubt, and blasphemous, but one can't always pick and choose.|$|E
6000|$|There was a god {{in heaven}} named Citlalatonac, and a goddess, Citlalicue. When {{we speak of}} [...] "heaven" [...] we must {{probably}} think of some such world of ordinary terrestrial nature above the sky as that from which Ataentsic fell in the Huron story. The goddess {{gave birth to a}} flint-knife, and flung the flint down to earth. This abnormal birth partly answers to that of the youngest of the Adityas, the rejected abortion in the Veda, and to the similar birth and rejection of Maui in New Zealand. From the fallen flint-knife sprang our old friends the magnified non-natural beings with human characteristics, [...] "the gods," [...] to the number of 1600. The gods sent up the hawk (who in India and Australia generally comes to the front on these occasions), and asked their mother, or rather grandmother, to help them to make men, to be their servants. Citlalicue rather jeered at her unconsidered offspring. She advised them to go to the lord of the homes of the departed, Mictlanteuctli, and borrow a bone or some ashes of the dead who are with him. We must never ask for consistency from myths. This statement implies that men had already been in existence, though they were not yet created. Perhaps they had perished in one of the four great destructions. With difficulty and danger the gods stole a bone from Hades, placed it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>and</b> smeared it with their own blood, as in Chaldea and elsewhere. Finally, {{a boy and a girl}} were born out of the bowl. From this pair sprang men, and certain of the gods, jumping into a furnace, became sun and moon. To the sun they then, in Aztec fashion, sacrificed themselves, and there, one might think, was an end of them. But they afterwards appeared in wondrous fashions to their worshippers, and ordained the ritual of religion. According to another legend, man and woman (as in African myths) struggled out of a hole in the ground.(1) ...|$|E
