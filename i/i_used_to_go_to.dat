500|$|Although he socialized {{with his}} {{teammates}} and sometimes gambled, Sunday {{was never a}} heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, [...] "I never drank much. I was never drunk but four times in my life. ... <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade." [...] Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E
500|$|Roshan then {{collaborated with}} {{director}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) {{in which he}} had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, [...] "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things." [...] He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they [...] "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.|$|E
2500|$|After {{abandoning the}} dream of {{becoming}} a football goalkeeper, Pavarotti spent seven years in vocal training. Pavarotti's earliest musical influences were his father's recordings, most of them featuring the popular tenors of the day – Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Tito Schipa, and Enrico Caruso. Pavarotti's favourite tenor and idol was Giuseppe Di Stefano and he was also deeply influenced by Mario Lanza, saying: [...] "In my teens <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mario Lanza movies and then come home and imitate him in the mirror". At around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir.|$|E

2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{his other}} films, Bhansali {{preferred}} shooting at a studio. Bhansali says, [...] "I like to construct sets and then light it up. It {{is a part}} of my story telling. My story needs a setting and I like to create that ambiance." [...] Hence he chose Filmcity, Mumbai to shoot the movie. Before the actual filming started, Hrithik Roshan spent time with a lot of patients to understand his role better and get into the skin of his character. He revealed that he used to [...] ".. spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things. So if I have benefited from this experience so much, I am sure that when people see the film and understand the character, they will get a lot to learn".|$|E
2500|$|My {{studio is}} crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being {{overcome}} by it all—it {{was just too}} much. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed every night thinking 'Tomorrow, I'm going to write the tune. Tomorrow {{is going to be}} the day', but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a lot of time together , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] said we had to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk myself out of [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E

60|$|True enough. I well {{knew that}} Captain Riga would not trouble himself much, if I did take French leave of him.
