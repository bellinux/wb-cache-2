40|$|A <b>distinguishing</b> {{coloring}} of a graph G is a coloring of the vertices so {{that every}} nontrivial automorphism of G maps some vertex to a vertex with a different color. The <b>distinguishing</b> number of G is the minimum k such that G has a <b>distinguishing</b> coloring where each vertex is assigned a color from { 1,..., k}. A list assignment to G is an assignment L = {L(v) }v∈V (G) of lists of colors to the vertices of G. A <b>distinguishing</b> L-coloring of G is a <b>distinguishing</b> coloring of G where the color of each vertex v comes from L(v). The list <b>distinguishing</b> number of G is the minimum k such that every list assignment to G in which |L(v) | = k for all v ∈ V (G) yields a <b>distinguishing</b> L-coloring of G. We prove that if G is an interval graph, then its <b>distinguishing</b> number and list <b>distinguishing</b> number are equal...|$|R
