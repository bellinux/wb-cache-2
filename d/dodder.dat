5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant <b>dodder</b> (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E

5000|$|The {{life cycle}} of the Cuscuta starts with seed germination. The {{seedlings}} cannot survive {{for long periods of}} time hence, they find the appropriate plant stem by recognizing plant chemo-attractants. Cuscuta campestris is known for restraining the growth of their host plants and even inhibiting their flowering. This causes the host cell to eventually die. This mechanism gives them the ability to control other populations of weeds like Mikania micrantha. Another mechanism by which these <b>dodders</b> recognize which plants to use as hosts depends on the light that's reflected off the plant's surface. Cuscuta campestris is highly attracted to [...] "far red light", which is a wavelength that is reflected by most plant surfaces. <b>Dodders</b> that were exposed to unfiltered light were able to attach to their host before their energy had been totally exhausted, but <b>dodders</b> that were only exposed to red light lost their way. This could be a technique by which to control C. campestris infestations if exposed to red light within the early stages of development.|$|R
5|$|The Wicklow Way forms part of European walking route E8 {{which runs}} from Dursey Island in County Cork to Istanbul in Turkey. The Irish section {{incorporates}} the Wicklow Way, the South Leinster Way, the East Munster Way, the Blackwater Way {{and parts of}} the Kerry Way and the Beara Way. There is an unmarked link route from Dublin Port (where the E8 connects to Liverpool by ferry) which follows the River <b>Dodder</b> to Rathfarnham and on to the Wicklow Way trailhead at Marlay Park via Saint Enda's Park. Similarly, an unmarked road walk connects Clonegal with the trailhead of the South Leinster Way in Kildavin, County Carlow.|$|E
5|$|First passing {{just south}} of Ireland on August25, the storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and brought strong winds, significantly affecting the coastline where winds of 65mph (105km/h) were reported. Rainfall spread across the entire country, peaking at 11.0in (280mm) in Kippure. There, a station reported more than 7.8in (200mm) in 24hours, which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at Casement Aerodrome were set with 1.63in (41.5mm) and 2.61in (66.2mm), respectively. The rainfall left some areas flooded, particularly in the Dublin area where 451buildings were inundated, some up to a depth of 8ft (2.4m). Preliminarily, it was described as the worst flooding in the history of Dublin. Two small rivers, the <b>Dodder</b> and the Dargle, overflowed their banks due to the rainfall. The River Dargle overflowed in Bray, flooding some areas up to a depth of 5ft (1.5m) and forcing about 1,000people to evacuate; several special-needs people were evacuated by boat. The flood, which originated about one mile north of the town, damaged over 500houses and brought down several trees. Despite local politicians promising for flood protection after the flood, the town remained vulnerable to such flooding at least 20years after the storm. The River <b>Dodder,</b> which also overflowed, nearly exceeded the reservoir dam in Bohernabreena in South Dublin. Additional spillways were later added in the event of another similar flood. In the Wicklow Mountains, the rainfall resulted in significant runoff, which caused erosion along the Cloghoge River. The passage of the storm left heavy crop damage, part of a larger period of poor agriculture in the country. Throughout the country, the storm caused at least thirteen deaths, four of which were drownings in flooded rivers; one death was caused by a heart attack while being evacuated from flooding. Two months after the storm struck, the government of Ireland allocated IR£6,449,000 (1986IEP, $8,650,000 1986USD) to repair roads and bridges damaged by the weather system.|$|E

50|$|The plant begins {{life when}} it germinates from the {{seed in the}} ground, the vine growing and {{flailing}} about before latching onto nearby vegetation. The root then dies and the plant lives by suckering along the stems and branches of plants. Although it resembles the <b>dodders</b> of the genus Cuscuta, it is unrelated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dodder's</b> main tributaries after Glenasmole, in {{and prior}} to which many streams join, are the Jobstown (or Tallaght) Stream, the Owendoher River and its {{tributary}} the Whitechurch Stream, the Little Dargle River (with Castle Stream and other tributaries), the Slang or Dundrum River, the Swan River (or Water), {{and the small}} Muckross Stream.|$|R

60|$|On the {{following}} day I botanized in the neighbourhood, with but poor success. An oblique-leaved fig climbs the other trees, and generally strangles them: two epiphytal Orchideae also occur on the latter, Vanda Roxburghii and an Oberonia. <b>Dodders</b> (Cuscuta) of two species, and Cassytha, swarm over and conceal the bushes with their yellow thread-like stems.|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{field studies}} {{were carried out}} in Hungary to get a picture of the host range and host choice of the Cuscuta species under natural conditions. We {{examined}} both parasitised and unparasitised plant species and found some aspects in which they are different. Compiling the host spectra of the various Cuscuta species based on herbaria, literature and our own observations, we can say that <b>dodders</b> infest at least 26 % of the vascular flora of the country. In our study, the Hungarian Cuscuta species parasitised all plants that had a coverage of more than 25 % in the sampling sites. We prepared a list of the most frequent host species for the parasites and revealed the importance of exclusive hosts. The results suggest that the habitat differences of the Cuscuta species can be responsible for the different host ranges. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} reason why <b>dodders</b> parasitise plants from various life-forms in different proportions is not (only) the active host choice, but the characteristic features of the habitats...|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} Cassytha are {{regarded}} as pests in various regions, though as a rule {{they are not as}} serious a problem as the true <b>dodders.</b> Some even yield a welcome harvest of fruit, or are valued for their perceived medicinal or aphrodisiac properties, partly because, like many members of the Lauraceae, some are fragrant when bruised. Their stems make useful strings for construction of thatched roofs and certain styles of lei and the like.|$|R
60|$|Taking a key whereof I {{knew the}} repository, I mounted three {{staircases}} in succession, reached a dark, narrow, silent landing, opened a worm-eaten door, and dived into the deep, black, cold garret.

40|$|Cuscuta spp. (<b>dodders)</b> are rootless, holoparasitic herbs with {{filiform}} stems {{attached to}} the host by numerous haustoria. In Canada, Cuscuta gronovii {{is the most common}} native species of the genus followed by Cuscuta campestris and C. umbrosa. Cuscuta epithymum and C. epilinum, both introduced species in Canada, occur occasionally. Infestation by Cuscuta spp. can result in serious yield losses and <b>dodders</b> are listed as noxious weeds in British Columbia, Ontario and Québec, and as restricted weeds in Alberta. These plants have evolved special adaptations to ensure their success: germination occurs late in the season when potential hosts are already established; seedlings selectively forage in plant communities and they may survive relatively long periods during the autotrophic stage. Invasion occurs via extremely elaborate mechanisms designed to match the biological processes of their host and bypass defense mechanisms. The principal means of dispersal of Cuscuta weeds world-wide (including Canada) has been through contaminated seeds of previously infested forage legumes. In other areas (e. g., Israel), C. campestris has developed resistance to ALS inhibitors (chlorsulfuron, and sulfometuron-methyl) and AABI herbicides.

25|$|An {{industrial}} revolution, {{especially in}} the production of paper, began on the Owendoher and <b>Dodder</b> rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills.

25|$|Throughout {{the greater}} part of the 13th century a state of {{comparative}} peace existed at Tallaght, but subsequently the O'Byrnes and O'Tooles, in what would become County Wicklow, took offensive action and were joined by many of the Archbishop's tenants. As a result of this the land was not tilled, the pastures were not stocked and the holdings were deserted. In 1310 the bailiffs of Tallaght got a royal grant to enclose the town.

25|$|Several {{of these}} rivers have been dammed to create {{reservoirs}} to provide drinking {{water for the}} residents of Dublin and its environs. The first of these was the River Vartry, dammed to create the Vartry Reservoir near Roundwood in the 1860s. A second dam was added in 1924 to increase capacity. The River <b>Dodder</b> feeds the two Bohernabreena reservoirs in the northern foothills of the Wicklow Mountains at Glenasmole in County Dublin, which were constructed between 1883 and 1887 to supply water to the townland of Rathmines. The Poulaphouca Reservoir, on the River Liffey near Blessington, was constructed between 1938 and 1940. There are also two hydroelectricity plants at Poulaphouca, constructed during the 1940s. A pumped storage hydroelectricity plant was constructed at Turlough Hill between 1968 and 1974. Water is pumped up from Lough Nanahangan, a natural corrie lake, into an artificial reservoir on Tomaneena mountain and released at times of peak electricity demand.|$|E
50|$|C. compacta is a {{heterotrophic}} {{parasitic plant}} meaning they attach themselves around other plants and remove their nutrients.
