5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
25|$|The deal {{turned out}} to be rather unnecessary, as the Conservatives opted to ensure the government's {{survival}} on the motion of confidence surrounding the original budget, expressing support to the tax cuts and defence spending therein. When Parliament voted on second reading and referral of the budget and the amendment on May 19, the previous events kept the government alive. The original budget bill, C-43, passed easily, as expected, but the amendment bill, C-48, resulted in an <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes,</b> and the Speaker of the House broke the tie to continue the parliament. The government never got as close to falling after that date. Third reading of Bill C-48 was held late at night on an unexpected day, and several Conservatives being absent, the motion passed easily, guaranteeing there would be no election in the near future.|$|E
2500|$|A vote is held {{to resolve}} a {{question}} when it is put to the House of Representatives. The House first votes by voice vote; the Speaker or Deputy Speaker puts the question, and members respond either [...] "Aye" [...] (in favour of the motion) or [...] "No" [...] (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces {{the result of the}} voice vote, but if his or her assessment is challenged by any Member, a recorded vote known as a division follows. If a division does occur, members enter one of two lobbies (the [...] "Aye" [...] lobby or the [...] "No" [...] lobby) {{on either side of the}} chamber, where their names are recorded by clerks. At each lobby are two tellers (themselves members of Parliament) who count the votes of the Members. Once the division concludes, the tellers provide the results to the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, who then announces them to the House. If there is an <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes,</b> the Speaker or Deputy Speaker has a casting vote.|$|E

50|$|The {{electoral process}} {{is perhaps the}} most {{valuable}} category to determine the state of a democracy. Firstly by looking just at the actual process of voting; how easy or difficult it is to cast a ballot in a district. States which enforce tough voter ID laws may be undermining the qualities of an ideal state, simply by making it generally more difficult to cast a vote. Furthermore, specifically targeted voter ID laws may make the voting process unfair to a particular group of people. Finally, the <b>voting</b> power <b>of</b> all citizens may vary depending on the dilution of rural versus urban votes. Laws surrounding who is allowed to cast a vote, as well as who is barred from the process affects the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>voting</b> process. The voting process can be also analyzed by looking at the general process which goes into voting. Easy access, as well as early notification to voting booths, waiting times at polls can both mobilize and discourage people from voting. Early polling, and online voter registration can make the process more accessible to more of the electorate. The ability of the deputy returning officer can also affect the electorates' vote by potentially rendering votes non-countable through poor explanation <b>of</b> the <b>voting</b> process. Finally the overall voter turnout is crucial to the state of democracy because the final statistic is in direct relation to all factors promoting, and eroding the democratic process.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to respond to two {{influential}} analyses regarding the concept of liberty, those of Benjamin Constant and Isaiah Berlin (and, indeed, those who have followed them), in relation to Classical Athens and participatory democracy. I argue that, contrary to what has, since Constant, often been suggested, far from ‘calling’ liberty the power to invade, and direct, the lives of Athens’ citizens, Athenian democrats construed liberty as a negative concept, as the absence of dependence upon the will of a tyrant or a group of oligarchs, a condition which, it is argued, negates the idea that (to put it in Athenian terms) one can live as one will. I demonstrate this through an excavation of a long forgotten Athenian democratic concept of liberty, found in Classical texts (historical, literary, oratorical and philosophical), which stressed that one could hope to be free as an individual only by living under conditions <b>of</b> political <b>equality</b> found where all participate equally, though <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> and <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> free speech, in a direct democracy. Further, I attempt to situate this in the context of recent work on the idea of liberty in the neo-classical tradition, most notably by Quentin Skinner and Philip Pettit, and I suggest that, despite important similarities, the two concepts ought to be viewed as distinct. I argue that by construing the idea of liberty as a spectrum of differing conceptions we might gain a useful tool for analysing our contemporary world. In chapter two I lay the groundwork for my discussion through four preliminary investigations. Firstly, I discuss the opinions of those Constant accused of endorsing ‘the liberty of the ancients’ to see how their opinions of Athens and participatory democracy fit into his analysis. Secondly, I discuss the relationship between Berlin and Constant, arguing that the connection between the two is not one of simple conformity as, again, is often suggested or implied. Thirdly, I discuss Constant’s argument in a wider context, and argue that Constant said little new, but elaborated upon an already fairly common distinction between the liberty found in the ancient world and the liberty supposedly cherished by the moderns. Fourthly, I pre-empt my discussion of liberty in Classical Athens by outlining the neo-classical conception of liberty, as excavated by Skinner and Pettit, prior to suggesting, in chapter three, that this idea (with, as I have said, notably differences in its Athenian context) actually began life in ancient Greece, when it is now commonly thought that it began life in Rome. In chapter four I further pursue this investigation by discussing how the equation of participatory democracy with Berlin’s notion of positive freedom is misleading. I argue that, historically, the doctrine Berlin isolated as being at the centre of the positive idea of freedom (which he linked to justifications of tyranny and totalitarianism) has enjoyed a closer relationship with representative, as opposed to participatory, democracy, contrary to what is commonly suggested.
