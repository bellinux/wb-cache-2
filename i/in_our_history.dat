5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

25|$|Steamtown National Historic Site {{was created}} in 1986 to {{preserve}} the history of steam railroading in America, concentrating on the era 1850 through 1950.

Our site does touch on the history of railroad preservation, specifically <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>History</b> Museum. The work of F.

25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into a new nation - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history,</b> {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years older than his historic age, so he is probably not the historical figure but an analog. In Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the butterfly effect.|$|E

Confronted with the terrifying novelty of being a multicultural country, Denmark took a step not merely to the right but to the far right." [...] Professor Anders Linde-Laursen wrote that while the controversy [...] "should be understood as an expression of a growing Islamophobic tendency in Danish society," [...] this is just latest manifestation of a long-standing, and particularly deep conflict between traditionalists and agents of modernity in Denmark, and should not be seen as a major departure for Danish society.|$|E
500|$|In cities {{throughout}} the nation, {{the years immediately}} {{following the end of}} monarchy witnessed the spread of music containing lyrics that reflected popular sentiments favorable to the Emperor. Examples include: [...] "Pedro the Second left/to the kingdom of Lisbon./The monarchy is over/and now Brazil is adrift." [...] and [...] "The mother of Deodoro said: This son was once mine/Now he is cursed/by me and by God." [...] The Brazilian historian Ricardo Salles argued that among the [...] "great—and few—names <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> [...] that hold a place in the popular imagination, is certainly the figure of Dom PedroII." [...] The phenomenon of continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to an unextinguished and generally held belief that he was a [...] "wise, benevolent, austere and honest ruler." [...] The positive view towards PedroII, and nostalgia for his reign, only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor's overthrow. He never ceased being a popular hero, and would gradually become, once again, an official hero.|$|E

500|$|Judas Priest's [...] "Dissident Aggressor" [...] is {{the first}} cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman {{described}} the track as [...] "more just {{like one of those}} odd songs {{that a lot of people}} didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history,</b> in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there." [...] The Slayer boxset Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featured, along with four songs of the album, an early version of the title track, recorded at Hanneman's home.|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The {{fact of the matter is}} that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the first time <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E
