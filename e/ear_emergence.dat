Cytokinin-like activity was resolved on Sephadex LH- 20 eluted with 35 or 20 % ethanol and estimated in kinetin in equivalents from the soybean callus bioassay. The cytokinin-like activity increased in tubers larger than 5 - 7. 5 mm diameter and reached a maximum in tubers 15 - 20 mm diameter. The amount per tuber was greatest {{in the largest}} size category analysed (40 - 50 mm diameter). The amount of sugar and starch per tuber also increased after tuber formation. There was {{a positive correlation between}} the highest concentration of cytokinin-like {{activity and}} the reported period of intense cell division, The cytokinin-like activity per pistil and per unit weight increased between <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> and pollination. On a per grain basis the activity increased to a high level 14 days after <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> (four days post-anthesis) but subsequently decreased to an undetectable level by 21 days. On a per unit weight basis the concentration was high but fluctuated between 10 and 14 days after <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> before decreasing.

Zeatin riboside remained at a relatively low level at all stages of development. The highest level of cytokinin-like activity correlated with the reported onset of normal cell divisions in the endosperm.

Irrigation treatments included well - watered, drought stress at vegetative stage, <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> stage, seed filling stage and vegetative and seed filling stages which were considered as main- plots. The first five mentioned genotypes were considered as sub-plots. Drought stress. caused a great reduction in grain yield and WUE at <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> stage.

Comparison of genotypes indicated that since K-C-M. 4 had a greater number of ears and K-C-M. 9 had heavier seeds that had higher grain yield. These two genotypes had the highest WUE and their harvest indices were relatively higher.

Sponsorship: This research was funded by BBSRC (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council) under the Resource Allocation and Stress in Plants initiative (RASP project RSP 07828) and by Advanta Seeds. We have genetically modified maize plants to delay leaf senescence. A senescence-enhanced promoter from maize (PSEE 1) was used to drive expression of the Agrobacterium cytokinin biosynthesis gene IPT in senescing leaf tissue. Three maize lines expressing IPT from PSEE 1, Sg 1, Sg 2 and Sg 3, were analysed in detail, representing mild, intermediate and extreme expression, respectively, of the delayed-senescence phenotype. Backcross populations segregating for {{the presence or absence of}} the PSEE 1 XbaIPTNOS transgene also simultaneously segregated for the senescence phenotype. At the time of <b>ear</b> leaf <b>emergence,</b> individuals of lines Sg 1 and Sg 2 segregating for the presence of the transgene carried about three fewer senescing leaves than control (transgene-minus) segregants, and IPT transcript levels were higher in leaves at incipient senescence than in young leaves. Leaves of transgenic Sg 3 plants were significantly greener than controls and progressed directly from fully green to bleached and dead without an intervening yellowing phase. IPT transcript abundance in this line was not related to the initiation of senescence. Extended greenness was accompanied by a delay in the loss of photosynthetic capacity with leaf age. The delayed-senescence trait was associated with relatively minor changes in morphology and development. The phenotype was particularly emphasized in plants grown in low soil nitrogen. The reduced ability of the extreme transgenic line Sg 3 to recycle internal nitrogen from senescing lower leaves accounted for significant chlorosis in emerging younger leaves when plants were grown in low nutrient conditions. This study demonstrates that the agronomically important delayed-senescence ('stay-green') trait can be engineered into a monocot crop, and is the first example outside Arabidopsis of senescence modification using a homologous senescence-enhanced promoter.

One of the best ways of water management on field is to choose the proper variety which could be chosen indirectly by the traits affecting the grain yield. Materials and Methods In order to study the effect of drought stress in vegetative and reproductive stages in 14 corn hybrids, an experiment was conducted at the experimental field of Seed and Plant Improvement Institute of Karaj, in 2009. The Research Station located in 50 °, 55 ´ eastern latitude and 35 °, 47 ´ northern longitude with 1254 height above mean sea level (AMSL). The soil texture of the location was loam-clay with pH= 7. 5 and the Electrical Capacity (EC) = 0. 7 dsm- 1. The experiment was carried out using split-plot in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The main plots consisted of three levels of irrigation regimes (irrigation after 70, 100 and 130 mm cumulative evaporation from evaporation pan class A) and sub-plots included 14 new corn hybrids Includes eleven new hybrids such as (K 47 / 2 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×MO 17 ، K 3653 / 2 ×K 19 ، KLM 76004 / 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×K 3545 / 6 ، K 3653 / 2 ×MO 17 ، K 74 / 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×K 3545 / 6 ، K 47 / 3 - 1 - 2 - 7 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×MO 17 ، K 47 / 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×K 3544 / 1 ، KLM 76004 / 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×K 3544 / 1 ، K 47 / 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×K 3544 / 1 ، KLM 77029 / 8 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 ×MO 17 and KLM 76005 / 2 - 3 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ×MO 17) and three hybrid control (KSC 704, KSC 720, KSC 700). Irrigation time was determined using daily evaporation rate of standard class A evaporation pan. To determine the volume of water per irrigation, a sample of each plot from depth of root development was prepared before irrigation. The samples were kept in oven 80 °C for 24 hours. The weight of soil moisture content was calculated and the volume of water per irrigation was calculated using equations 1 and 2. 1 : H = ρb (F.

While <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> time was similar between the parents, there was significant transgressive segregation in the population.

QTL of smaller effect were also detected on chromosomes 1 A, 4 A, 4 B, 5 A, 5 B, 7 A and 7 B. A novel QTL for flag leaf glaucousness of large, repeatable effect was detected in six field experiments, on chromosome 3 A (QW. aww- 3 A) and accounted for up to 52 percent of genetic variance for this trait.

40|$|Differences amongst wheat cultivars in {{the rate}} of {{reproductive}} development are largely dependent on differences in their sensitivity to photoperiod and vernalization. However, when these responses are accounted for, by growing vernalized seedlings under long photoperiods, cultivars can still differ markedly in time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence.</b> Control of rate of development by this ‘third factor’ has been poorly understood and is variously referred to as intrinsic earliness, earliness in the narrow sense, basic vegetative period, earliness per se, and basic development rate. Certain assumptions are made in the concept of intrinsic earliness. They are that differences in intrinsic earliness (i) are independent of the responses of the cultivars to photoperiod and vernalization, (ii) apply only to the length of the vegetative period up to floral initiation (as suggested by several authors), (iii) are maintained under different temperatures, measured either in days or degree days. As a consequence of this, the ranking of cultivars (from intrinsically early to intrinsically late) must be maintained at different temperatures. This paper, by the re-analysis of published data, examines {{the extent to which these}} assumptions can be supported. Although it is shown that intrinsic earliness operates independently of photoperiod and vernalization responses, the other assumptions were not supported. The differences amongst genotypes in time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence,</b> grown under above-optimum vernalization and photoperiod (that is when the response to these factors is saturated), were not exclusively due to parallel differences in the length of the vegetative phase, and the length of the reproductive phase was independent of that of the vegetative phase. Thus, it would be possible to change the relative allocation of time to vegetative and reproductive periods with no change in the full period to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence.</b> The differences in intrinsic earliness between cultivars were modified by the temperature regime under which they were grown, i. e. the difference between cultivars (both considering the full phase to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> or some sub-phases) was not a constant amount of time or thermal time at different temperatures. In addition, in some instances genotypes changed their ranking for ‘intrinsic earliness’ depending on the temperature regime. This was interpreted to mean that while all genotypes are sensitive to temperature they differ amongst themselves in the extent of that sensitivity. Therefore, ‘intrinsic earliness’ should not be considered as a static genotypic characteristic, but the result of the interaction between the genotype and temperature. Intrinsic earliness is therefore likely to be related to temperature sensitivity. Some implications of these conclusions for plant breeding and crop simulation modelling are discussed...|$|E

This study aims to give {{a detailed analysis of}} the succession of traits DEE and TPM to gather updated information on the genetic control of contrast by combining traits varieties. We studied six generations originating from 6 hybrid combinations of "early " and "late " with respect to the varieties of both traits. It was determine the type of inheritance and coefficients of heritability. To identify real opportunities for breeding of early forms recurrent combinations with each of the parental varieties are made. Data suggest complex interactions between genes for both traits. An inspection for the presence of epistas by applying the well-known 3 -parameter test, is calculated. For additional information components of genetic diversity were calculated. In crosses in which is found non-allelic interaction is applied 6 - parameter model, that explains the specific nature of these interactions on a cross. The combination of varieties with different dates of <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> and maturation succession of both traits is partially dominant to the complete domination of the "late" parent. Performing backcross procedure changes significantly in direct proportion to recurrent that in late varieties causes heterosis. At 2 / 3 of the combinations studied non-allelic interaction are set at both traits. On the inheritance of every trait share a non-allelic interactions between genes that are specific for each cross and defy generalization. The direction of the inheritance to the later date suggests that the breeding of the early forms is preferable by making recurrent crosses.

Plants were labelled at tillering and at <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> on plots under conventional (CONV) and integrated (INT) management. The latter was characterised by reductions in nutrient input, soil tillage and use of biocides.

Root decay in spring barley was higher than in wheat, and was higher in CONV (55 %) than in INT (49 %). Since most of the roots were produced around tillering, these values were used as estimates of accumulated annual root decay.

40|$|Much of the {{non-irrigated}} corn {{grown in}} Nebraska and surrounding states is frequently subjected to moisture stress. Moisture stress on corn during the vegetative {{stage of growth}} indirectly affects grain yield by reducing plant height and photosynthetic area.

The {{influence}} of nitrogen fertilization and harvesting practices on biomass production, chemical composition and nutritional value were studied on Andropogon gayanus Kunth forages set in Sudanese agroclimatic zone of Burkina Faso. The first year was spent {{to establish an}} adequate plant population, by transplantation of Andropogon gayanus stumps; then, four nitrogen doses were applied on experimental blocs during the second year: a) 0 N-units/ha (0 kilos of urea/ha) as Control, b) 18. 5 N-units/ha (40 kilos of urea/ha), c) 37 N-units/ha (80 kilos of urea/ha) and d) 76 N-units/ha (150 kilos of urea/ha).

40|$|The {{discovery}} of aquaporins {{has provided a}} new basis for studying and interpreting water relations in plants. However, slow {{progress has been made}} in elucidating the functional. facets of the aquaporin-mediated water pathway in whole plant systems. White increasing experimental evidence suggests that these proteins are directly involved in mediating water homeostasis at varying environmental conditions, only a few attempts have been made to understand their contribution to overall water transport at different devetopmental stages. By using a chemical inhibitor (HgCl 2) Of aquaporins function, here we present in planta evidence for both diurnal and developmental regulation of aquaporin activity in wheat. We demonstrate that the greatest sensitivity of water flux to pharmacological blockage occurs at the stage of <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> and does not coincide with the phenological. stage at which the greatest plant water uptake occurs (milky ripeness). The relationship transpiration flux (Q) vs. soil-leaf water potential difference (Delta Psi(soil-leaves)) revealed a gradual decrease of plant resistance to water flux from tittering to milky ripeness, both in HgCl 2 -treated and untreated control plants. However, the mercury-inhibition of water flux began to gradually increase at <b>ear</b> <b>emergence,</b> suggesting that a larger portion of water moves through aquaporins from this developmental stage on. Although the intercept of the Delta Psi(soil-leaves) /Q regression line, i. e. the Delta Psi required to initiate the water flux through the soil-plant-air continuum, was generally not affected by mercury treatment, a significant mercury effect on the intercept was observed at the stage of ear formation. These findings may have important implications for predicting which strategy plants utilize to optimize water use during their life cycle...|$|E

In. D. Sokolovi?, C. Huyghe, & J. Radovi? (Eds.), Quantitative Traits Breeding for Multifunctional Grasslands and Turf. (pp. 267 - 271). Springer, Netherlands. Leaf elongation rate (LER) {{is a key}} component of forage grass dry matter yield. Leaf lamina initiate rapid expansion during the winter at a time that coincides with lengthening days but this extension is not associated with any large environmental shifts such as an increase in light intensity or temperature. The rate increase precedes any anatomical indication of floral initiation in apical meristems (double ridge formation) by around two to three weeks. We measured LER in a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pair-cross mapping family that has been extensively mapped with more than 1 200 SNP markers generated by Illumina?s Infinium platform. These have been anchored to the seven Lolium linkage groups as defined by Triticeae nomenclature with seven micro-satellite markers originally developed by ViaLactia Biosciences. Measurements were made in the winter/spring during extending daylength, after full natural vernalisation. The plants? leaves were beginning to expand rapidly with leaf extension rates varying between approximately 0. 4 mm and 1. 1 mm h- 1. We obtained a significant correlation between LER and both apical meristem elongation and <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> (the date at which inflorescences emerge above the flag-leaf ligule) measured in two separate seasons.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this work}} was to examine to what degree development in wheat is modified by increased temperature when other environmental factors are also varied. The genotypes used were an early season wheat, Hartog, and a closely related mid-season line, Late Hartog. Plants were grown throughout in temperature regimes of 25 / 1 S°C or 17 / 7 "C and photoperiods of 9, 11, 13 or 15 h with 9 h of natural summer radiation. Seeds were vernalised for 0, 2 or 4 weeks. Increased temperature extended the thermal time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence,</b> particularly in Late Hartog, and particularly under short days after plants had been vernalised for 4 weeks. Phyllochron intervals on the main shoot were increased by higher temperature, as were spikelet numbers in Late Hartog under long photoperiod. However, in Hartog and in Late Hartog exposed to short days, spikelet numbers were reduced by increased temperature. Long seed vernalisation significantly reduced leaf and spikelet number in Late Hartog but only at the higher temperature. Fewer spikelets were produced per leaf at short photoperiod. The apparently complex interactions between temperature, photoperiod, genotype, and seed vernal-isation on development are {{explained in terms of}} their effects on the timing of floral initiation and the related numbers of primordia accumulated on the apex at that stage. We hypothesise that, in the absence of source limitation, delays in floral initiation such as occur through shortening of photoperiod can increase numbers of leaves and spikelets, though at a decreasing rate with increasing delay. When source is limiting, as under higher temperature and unchanged or reduced radiation, long delays result in a greater reduction in the rate of production of organs and their final number. We further propose that much of the change may be associated with the interplay between the plastochron and phyllochron intervals. Published data are examined to show that high temperatures delay <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> in other genotypes both in controlled environments and in the field...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of improving our understanding of the genetic basis of the superior grain yield of an elite bread wheat breeding line, RAC 875, under drought and heat stressed Mediterranean-type climates in southern Australia. Here, these abiotic stresses present a significant barrier to production. Kukri is a locally adapted variety which achieves acceptable grain yield under more favourable conditions, but relatively low grain yields under severe stress. A cross between the two lines resulted in an F₁ derived doubled haploid population consisting of 368 individuals. The population was initially used for the genetic dissection of time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> and flag leaf glaucousness, with the latter trait hypothesised to explain a significant proportion of RAC 875 ’s relative drought and heat tolerance. Whilst parents of the population achieved similar time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence,</b> segregation for Ppd-B 1 and Ppd-D 1 a created large variation for this trait within the population. Two novel minor loci were detected for time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> (Q. Eet. aww- 1 A and Q. Zad. aww- 4 A), in addition to another eight known, minor loci. Five novel loci were detected for flag leaf glaucousness (Q. W. aww- 3 A, Q. W. aww- 3 B, Q. W. aww- 3 D, Q. W. aww- 4 D and Q. W. aww- 5 B), with one in particular (Q. W. aww- 3 A) accounting for up to 52 percent of the genetic variance for this trait. Sixteen field experiments were sown across southern Australia between 2006 and 2010, where average site grain yields ranged from 314 to 5275 kg ha⁻¹. Kernels per square metre was the trait most correlated with grain yield, while spikelet fertility, which had a significant positive correlation with grains per square metre in all experiments and the subsequently derived environment clusters, was also related to grain yield. Nine loci were detected for grain yield independent of time to <b>ear</b> <b>emergence</b> and plant height. Five of these loci co-located with loci for kernels per square metre and only one of these nine loci were associated with any of the loci for flag leaf glaucousness and this genetic effect was opposite (i. e. Kukri allele resulting in large glaucousness value and lower grain yield). The RAC 875 allele at QTL on chromosomes 1 B and 7 A (Q. Yld. aww- 1 B and Q. Yld. aww- 7 A- 2) was associated with greater grain yield, kernels per spikelet and kernels per square metre. These two loci were detected in environment clusters where heat stress was a differentiating factor and it was concluded that these may therefore be associated with heat stress tolerance. Another QTL of large effect was consistently detected on chromosome 6 A (Q. Tkw. aww- 6 A), with the RAC 875 allele positively affecting grain size, flag leaf width and stem water soluble carbohydrate content but resulting in lower kernels per spikelet and therefore kernels per square metre. Experiments were also sown to assess the performance of the population in north-west Mexico under well watered, high yield potential conditions, as well as drip irrigated drought treatment and late planted but well watered conditions to expose the experiments to heat stress. This resulted in three very distinctive treatments and subsequently detected different genetic regions controlling grain yield. Two distinct QTL were detected for grain yield and canopy temperature on chromosome 3 B, under irrigated (Q. Yld. aww- 3 B- 1) and irrigated, drought and heat stressed treatments (Q. Yld. aww- 3 B- 2). The latter QTL accounted for up to 22 percent of the genetic variance for grain yield and 20 percent of the genetic variance for canopy temperature under the heat stress treatment. However, all three treatments failed to detect any major QTL of common effect to southern Australia. This study highlighted the complex genetic basis of grain yield and physical grain quality in drought and heat stressed conditions, as well as the importance of conducting QTL dissection in the target environment. However, key loci detected offer potential for marker development and deployment of marker assisted selection within wheat breeding programmes targeting southern Australia. In the longer term, this should help improve the rate of genetic gain for grain yield, increasing production by growers in the Mediterranean type climate of southern Australia. Thesis (Ph. D.)
