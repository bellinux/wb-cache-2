25|$|The Battle of Montereau (18 February 1814) {{was fought}} during the War of the Sixth Coalition between an Imperial French army led by Emperor Napoleon and a corps of Austrians and Württembergers {{commanded}} by Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg. While Napoleon's army mauled an Allied army under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the main Allied army commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg advanced {{to a position}} dangerously close to Paris. <b>Gathering</b> <b>up</b> his outnumbered forces, Napoleon rushed his soldiers south to deal with Schwarzenberg. Hearing of {{the approach of the}} French emperor, the Allied commander ordered a withdrawal, but 17 February saw his rear guards overrun or brushed aside.|$|E
25|$|As in 1643, Rupert {{was soon}} {{on his way}} to the north to {{retrieve}} the fortunes of his side. Moving by the Welsh border, and <b>gathering</b> <b>up</b> garrisons and recruits snowball-wise as he marched, he went first to Cheshire to give a hand to Byron, and then, with the utmost speed, he made for Newark. On 20 March 1644, he bivouacked at Bingham, and on the 21st, he not only relieved Newark but routed the besiegers' cavalry. On the 22nd, Meldrum's position was so hopeless that he capitulated on terms. But, brilliant soldier as he was, the prince was unable to do more than raid a few Parliamentary posts around Lincoln. After that, he had to return his borrowed forces to their various garrisons, and go back to Walesladen, indeed with captured pikes and muskets, to raise a permanent field army.|$|E

The Euro Beach Soccer League (dropping the pro from the title in 2004 as {{it was no longer}} reflecting of the company name) has remained BSWW's main asset, <b>gathering</b> <b>up</b> to 27 nations to compete in recent editions compared to just 7 in the first event in 1998 in a summer-long event. The Pro Beach Soccer Tour has also been renamed to the BSWW Tour for the same reasons, continuing exhibition events to promote the sport as far wide and remote as Réunion and Cape Verde with around 10 tour events a year.

25|$|Emperor Napoleon invaded Spain {{with a huge}} army in late 1808, {{scattered}} the Spanish forces, {{and seized}} Madrid. However, {{the appearance of a}} British army commanded by John Moore caused the French emperor to order his army to pursue the British into northwest Spain. With their enemies spread thin, the Spanish armies began to revive. In late December 1808, the Army of the Center led by Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado advanced slowly toward Madrid, causing alarm among the scanty French forces guarding the capital. The cautious Infantado sent his lieutenant Venegas with a strong vanguard to annoy the French. After Venegas won a minor action at Tarancón, Victor concentrated his corps and marched against him in mid-January 1809. Without instructions or support from Infantado, Venegas unwisely tried to hold a strong position at Uclés. Victor overwhelmed the Spanish defenders with one division and herded many of them into the arms of his second division which had marched around their flank. <b>Gathering</b> <b>up</b> Venegas' survivors, Infantado led his crippled army into the mountains but not before losing much of his artillery. Blamed for the fiasco, Infantado was relieved of command. The next action in the area was the Battle of Ciudad Real in March.|$|E
25|$|Appleby Castle {{surrendered}} to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still {{hanging on to the}} flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or {{to find out what was}} behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that the Duke of Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him at Nottingham, and <b>gathering</b> <b>up</b> the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert. On 12 August he was at Wetherby, Lambert with horse and foot at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave, Hamilton at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby. On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.|$|E

At the bottom of the wall around Brown's position lay 15 to 20 North Korean dead. Earlier in the day, about 08:00, Kennedy had visited Brown and had seen five North Korean dead that Brown had killed with BAR fire. Subsequently, Brown exhausted his automatic rifle ammunition, then his few grenades, and finally he used his entrenching tool to knock the North Koreans in the head when they tried to climb over the wall. Brown had been slightly wounded in the shoulder early in the morning, but had bandaged it himself and refused to leave his position.|$|E
500|$|Khachaturian {{is cited}} by musicologists as a {{follower}} of Russian classical traditions. According to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he [...] "carried forward {{into the twentieth century}} the colourful, folk-inspired style of such nineteenth-century Russian composers as Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky". Like the members of The Five, especially Alexander Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov, whose works to some extent served him as a model, Khachaturian drew heavily upon [...] "Eastern" [...] and [...] "Oriental" [...] material in creating compositions in various classical genres and styles of European origin. But Khachaturian's cultural identity and rigorous musical training within the Soviet establishment allowed him to penetrate more deeply to the essence of Eastern and Caucasian music and to incorporate it more fully in his mature work, including the ballets. [...] "Never dissociating himself from the traditions of Russian music, he came to be regarded in Moscow as a mouthpiece of the entire Soviet Orient, <b>gathering</b> <b>up</b> all the diverse traditions into a grand generalization," [...] concludes Marina Frolova-Walker.|$|E

500|$|Thompson's only {{credit of}} 2002 was a vocal {{performance}} in Disney's Treasure Planet, {{an adaptation of}} Treasure Island, where she voiced Captain Amelia.

As part of an ensemble cast that included Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Colin Firth, she played a middle-class wife who suspects her husband (played by Alan Rickman) of infidelity. The scene in which her stalwart character breaks down was described by one critic as [...] "the best crying on screen ever", and in 2013, Thompson mentioned that she gets commended for this role more than any other.

500|$|His restive nature, however, did not diminish. As a young man, Saint-Just was [...] "wild, handsome, [...] transgressive".

He is said to have proposed marriage to her; she is said to have desired it. Though no hard evidence exists regarding their relationship, official records show that on 25 July 1786, Thérèse was married to Emmanuel Thorin, the scion of a prominent local family. Saint-Just was out of town and unaware of the event, and tradition portrays him as brokenhearted.
