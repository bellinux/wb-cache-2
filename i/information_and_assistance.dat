25|$|Gameplay is semi-linear; most of {{the main}} quests can be {{performed}} in different orders, but only from within a group of given quests. For example, in Act I, the player can choose to tackle a series of kidnappings or investigate a spate of murders, but no other main quests are made available until both quests are complete. There are also optional side-quests, which {{do not have to}} be completed immediately. There are more NPCs than in the first game, and the player can interact with many of them. Depending on which character the player is using, these NPCs may or may not provide <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>assistance.</b> Weapons, armor and items are only available for purchase from one location throughout the game, a shop in Baldur's Gate, although the stock changes at the commencement of each act, with the weapons increasing in expense and power. The HUD features the option to use either a transparent map that covers {{most of the}} screen, or a mini-map, with the player also given the option to turn the map off entirely.|$|E

2500|$|Michell {{was a man}} of [...] "wide {{latitude}} in religious belief". He was described by a contemporary as [...] "a little short man, of black complexion, and fat", and was [...] "esteemed a very ingenious Man, and an excellent Philosopher." [...] During his years at Thornhill, he welcomed many distinguished visitors, including Benjamin Franklin, Joseph Priestley (the discoverer of oxygen), and Henry Cavendish (the discoverer of hydrogen). Michell wrote to Franklin in 1767 describing his first visit to Thornhill. Priestley, who lived in Leeds for a time, saw Michell [...] "pretty often", by his own account, with Michell supplying Priestley [...] "with metals for his chemical experiments and with <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>assistance,</b> including proofreading, for his book on the history of optics". Michell also helped the engineer John Smeaton [...] "revise the text of his book on the Eddystone Lighthouse, now regarded as a 'classic of engineering literature.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The American Dental Association (ADA) has {{asserted}} that dental amalgam {{is safe and}} has held that, [...] "the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical". Under the comments of the American Dental Association before the FDA's Dental Products Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the ADA supports the 2009 FDA ruling on dental amalgam. ADA states that [...] "dental amalgam has an established record of safety and effectiveness, which the scientific community has extensively reviewed and affirmed." [...] The ADA also supports the 2017 EPA wastewater regulation and is providing <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>assistance</b> to its members in implementation of amalgam separators. The ADA asserts the best scientific evidence supports the safety of dental amalgam. Clinical studies have not established an occasional connection between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in the general population.|$|E
2500|$|Main Street {{is lined}} with shops selling {{merchandise}} and food. The decor is early-20th century small-town America, inspired by Walt Disney's childhood and the film Lady and the Tramp. City Hall contains the Guest Relations lobby, where cast members provide <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>assistance.</b> A working barber shop gives haircuts for a fee.

The Main Street Confectionery sells sweets priced by their weight, such as candied apples, crisped rice treats, chocolates, cookies and fudge. Most windows bear the name of people who were influential at Disney parks. An example of a classic Main Street, U.S.A. attraction is the [...] narrow gauge Walt Disney World Railroad, which transports guest throughout the park, making stops at Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, and Frontierland. The railroad's previous stop at Mickey's Toontown Fair was replaced by the Fantasyland stop in 2012.

60|$|Nor are my {{obligations}} {{confined to}} British naturalists. Dr. Aug.

Dana, I am much indebted for several long letters, containing original and valuable information on points connected with the anatomy of the Cirripedia. To Mr. Conrad I am likewise indebted for <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>assistance.</b> Both the celebrated Professors, Milne Edwards and Müller, have lent me, from the great public collections under their charge, specimens which I should not otherwise have seen. To Professor W. Dunker, of Cassel, I am indebted for the examination of his whole collection. I have, in a former publication, expressed my thanks to Professor Steenstrup, but I must be permitted here to repeat them, for a truly valuable present of a specimen of the Anelasma squalicola of this work. I will conclude my thanks to all the above British and foreign naturalists, by stating my firm conviction, that if a person wants to ascertain how much true kindness exists amongst the disciples of Natural History, he should undertake, as I have done, a Monograph on some tribe of animals, and let his wish for assistance be generally known.|$|E
