5|$|A {{number of}} other {{characters}} in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne <b>from</b> <b>Car</b> 54, Where Are You?).|$|E
5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light <b>from</b> <b>car</b> headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Several {{construction}} details characterized passenger equipment. Passenger trains {{were expected}} to run at higher speeds than freight service, and therefore passenger trucks evolved to allow superior ride and better tracking at those speeds. Over time, in most cases provision was made for passengers and train staff to move <b>from</b> <b>car</b> to car; therefore platforms and later vestibules were used to bridge the gap.|$|E
25|$|Other designs, {{including}} {{rolling stock}} made by Colorado Railcar, Budd, Pullman-Standard, Bombardier {{and others have}} an entrance on the lower deck rather than an intermediate level. Amtrak Superliners are double-decker cars of this variety, with the entrance a step or so up from the lowest station platform level, or {{at the level of}} slightly higher platforms, and allow passage <b>from</b> <b>car</b> to car on the upper level.|$|E
25|$|While moats are {{no longer}} a {{significant}} tool of warfare, modern architectural building design continues to use them as a defence against certain modern threats, such as terrorist attacks <b>from</b> <b>car</b> bombs and armoured fighting vehicles.

Modern moats may also be used for aesthetic or ergonomic purposes.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} tactics. Dippers forage {{underwater}} in fast-moving streams. Common grackles {{have been observed}} to follow farmers’ plows to glean the grubs exposed in the fresh soil. Similarly, {{on the island of}} Borneo, the Bornean ground-cuckoo will follow wild pigs and sun bears as they turn up soil while foraging in the forest. Brewer's blackbirds are often seen in parking lots, where they pick off dead insects <b>from</b> <b>car</b> grilles. Some hummingbirds are known to take prey items from spiderwebs.|$|E
25|$|The first {{purpose-built}} {{pedestrian street}} in Europe is the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam, opened in 1953. The first pedestrianised shopping centre in the United Kingdom was in Stevenage in 1959. A {{large number of}} European towns and cities have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s. These are often accompanied by car parks {{on the edge of}} the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, park and ride schemes. Central Copenhagen is one of the largest and oldest: It was converted <b>from</b> <b>car</b> traffic into pedestrian zone in 1962.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} center, {{there are several}} {{elevated}} expressways to lessen traffic pressure on surface streets, but the growth car use has made demand far outstrip capacity, with heavy congestion being commonplace. There are bicycle lanes separate <b>from</b> <b>car</b> traffic on many surface streets, but bicycles and motorcycles are banned from many main roads including the elevated expressways. Recently, cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks {{to the emergence of}} a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo.|$|E

25|$|The {{pressurized}} air {{comes from an}} air compressor in the locomotive and is sent <b>from</b> <b>car</b> to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars. The principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence {{the loss of the}} force applying the brakes. This could easily cause a runaway train. Straight air brakes are still used on locomotives, although as a dual circuit system, usually with each bogie (truck) having its own circuit.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} Science {{magazine}} by John Bohannon describes {{some of the}} criticisms, {{as well as some}} responses from the Lancet report's lead author Gilbert Burnham. According to Bohannon and Johnson, the Lancet paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths <b>from</b> <b>car</b> bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published Lancet paper is oversimplified.|$|E

25|$|For a climactic finale, De Palma {{staged a}} chase from the {{platform}} of the Harlem-125th Street (Metro-North) Station to the escalators of Grand Central Terminal. For the shoot, trains were re-routed and timed so that Pacino and his pursuers could dart <b>from</b> <b>car</b> to hurtling car. The {{length of the}} escalator scene during the climactic shoot out at Grand Central Station caused a headache for editor Pankow.

25|$|The {{city has}} also {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing {{to the rest of}} China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, will not only supply Chongqing with power once completed but also allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging <b>from</b> <b>car</b> to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.|$|E
25|$|While herbicide-use {{has been}} {{proposed}} as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, {{it is not the}} only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data. The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding, and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, implies there is a disconnect between these life stages, that must be growing. One expert has proposed that a large and growing threat to migrating monarchs is mortality <b>from</b> <b>car</b> strikes.|$|E
