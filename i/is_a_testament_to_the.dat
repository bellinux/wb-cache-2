5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill in town and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a Pax Byzantina in these heartland territories.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E

25|$|The {{years between}} its first {{sighting}} by Sprent {{and the first}} successful summit expedition almost 50 years later saw a mixture of hardy pioneer adventurers trying to bag the peak. The thick horizontal scrub, mixed with ancient cool temperate rainforest which dominates the area {{proved to be the}} barrier between men and the mountain. Together with the harsh weather generated by the roaring forties the mountain did not give itself easily. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wildness of the Tasmanian South West that it took almost 50 years to reach its heart and jewel.|$|E
25|$|As Sydney rapidly expanded, {{following}} World War II, Carlingford underwent rapid urbanisation. James Ruse Agricultural High School, {{established in}} 1959, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agricultural history of Carlingford {{as well as}} the rapid pace of urbanisation; which soon made the school, and its large farm, somewhat of an anomaly amongst the 1970s and 1980s housing which dominate the suburb. More recently, in the 1990s, the government policy of urban consolidation has seen the development of high-density units and apartment blocks around the town centre and the train station. There have also been redevelopments of older houses into medium-density townhouses, and duplex housing.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September 2013 President of the Cypriot House of Representatives Yiannakis Omirou and the Knesset Speaker Yuli-Yoel Edelstein {{signed a}} {{protocol}} {{of cooperation between}} their countries' Parliaments.

25|$|Released to theaters on December 19, 1997, Titanic grossed less in {{its first}} weekend ($28.6million) than in its second ($35.4million), an {{increase}} of 23.8%. This is unheard of for a widely released film, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movie's appeal. This was especially noteworthy, considering that the film's running time of {{more than three hours}} limited the number of showings each theater could schedule. It held the No. 1 spot on the box-office charts for months, eventually grossing a total of $600.8million in the United States and Canada and more than $1.84billion worldwide. Titanic became the highest-grossing film of all time, both worldwide and in the United States and Canada, and was also the first film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film from 1998 until 2010, when Cameron's 2009 film Avatar surpassed its gross.|$|E
25|$|The Tongue River has a road {{running along}} {{almost all of}} its length, as do the major tributaries, but the {{predominance}} of gravel roads over paved roads <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remoteness of the region. In the Tongue River valley, starting from Miles City and going up the river there are about 30 miles of pavement to the community of Garland, then 35 miles of gravel, followed by about 7 miles of paved road into Ashland, where U.S. Highway 212 is encountered. South of Ashland, continuing up the valley, there is another 20 miles of paved road, then another 38 miles of gravel roads to the pavement above the Tongue River Reservoir, followed by 10 miles of pavement to the Montana/Wyoming state line. In Wyoming a network of paved roads follow the Tongue river westward to Ranchester and Dayton, where the Tongue {{comes out of the}} Big Horn Mountains. A road from Dayton goes up the Tongue for a short distance into the mountains, after which contact with the Tongue River and its mountain branches is by hiking trail.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E

500|$|While direct {{measurement}} {{of the most violent}} tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional anemometers would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by mobile Doppler radar units, which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301 ± 20 mph (484 ± 32 km/h) in the F5 Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma, tornado which killed 36 people. Though the reading was taken about [...] above the ground, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power of the strongest tornadoes.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Vic Fontaine was received with mixed reviews by both critics and the public. While Keith DeCandido disliked {{the idea of}} the Fontaine program in his review of [...] "His Way" [...] for Tor.com, saying that [...] "It's silly, it's frivolous, it raises all kinds of ethical conundrums that the show never shows the remotest interest in investigating", he said that he enjoyed Darren's performance, which caused him to smile every time Darren spoke. Zack Handlen praised the 1960s scenes in [...] "His Way" [...] for The A.V.

500|$|In a Gamasutra feature, Patrick Redding of Ubisoft attested that [...] "the {{fact that}} so many of System Shock {{features}} are now virtually de rigueur in modern sci-fi shooters <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence exerted by this one game." [...] GameSpy argued that the game [...] "is the progenitor of today's story-based action games, a group with titles as diverse as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil, and even Half-Life." [...] Eurogamer called the System Shock series [...] "the benchmark for intelligent first-person gaming", and noted that it [...] "kick-start the revolution which ... has influenced the design of countless other games." [...] Steven Wright for Glixel said in a 2017 essay that System Shock still is important to gaming today, and that the only reasons it is not considered a [...] "Mt. Olympus of gaming" [...] is due to its lower sales compared to titles like Half-Life that sold in the millions, and that {{at the time it was}} released, it was difficult for players to adjust to the complex systems in the game compared to straightforward first-person shooters.|$|E

Ryan Davis of GameSpot said, [...] "t's a little surprising how well the formula holds up in Diamond and Pearl, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strong fundamentals of the series {{as well as the}} quality of the execution." [...] The games' Wi-Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews. 1UP.com called the addition of wireless connectivity the games' [...] "biggest improvements". GameSpot and GameSpy both listed the addition of online play as one of the positive points of the games and called the system [...] "robust" [...] and [...] "probably the most significant new feature." [...] ComputerAndVideoGames.com said of the Global Trade Center, [...] "Suddenly, Pokémon feels properly alive {{for the first time since}} playgrounds were abuzz with monsters in the late '90s – and you'll instantly forgive Game Freak their technical stubbornness the first time you switch on your DS and find the level 100 Munchlax you craved is on your cart." ...|$|E

Young readers will find this a journey worth taking." [...] Kirkus Reviews found the novel to be a [...] "Thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure", praising how the adventure tests the main characters' courage as they learn the truth of both worlds. Vicky Smith from Horn Book Magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of Gracehope well structured. While, Smith found the city's origin unbelievable, she recognized that few people would care about that and compared the threat in First Light similar to the one in The City of Ember. Jenifer Hubert from Booklist also compared the novel to The City of Ember and to Neal Shusterman's Downsiders. Hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world, but still felt that [...] "the icy setting and global-warming theme are well realized".|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
