40|$|For a {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) cellular-cored sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, there exists an optimum cell size {{to achieve the}} maximum heat transfer with the prescribed pressure drop when the length is fixed and the two plates are isothermal. However, in engineering design, {{it is difficult to}} find 2 D cellular materials with the ideal cell size because the cell size selected must be from those commercially available, which are discrete, not continuous. In order to obtain the maximum heat dissipation, an innovative design scheme is proposed for the sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger which is divided into multiple stages in the direction of fluid flow where the 2 D cellular material in each stage has a specific cell size. An analytical model is presented to evaluate the thermal performance of the multistage sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger when all 2 D cellular materials have the same porosity. Also, a new parameter named equivalent cell size (ECS) is defined, which is dependent on the cell size and length of cellular material in all stages. Results show that the maximum heat dissipation design of the multistage sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger can be converted to make the ECS equal to the optimal cell size of the single-stage exchanger...|$|R

40|$|In Korea, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in the remodeling of aged apartment buildings. Traditionally, the <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> in Korea is a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> that utilizes radiation. But if a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> is installed in an aged apartment during its remodeling, some problems may occur. They include failure to secure enough ceiling height, to reduce level of floor impact noise and possibility that the load on the existing structure is increased. In other words, a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> {{may not be in}} compliance with the Korea building codes when it is used in remodeling of such apartment structures. Therefore, a prefabricated floor heating system which is thin and lightweight is suggested as an alternative to a wet type floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel.</b> In this research, first, the building codes that restrict, directly and indirectly, the prefabricated floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> for an apartment remodeling were investigated. Second, the available thickness of panel was calculated so that it complies with the building code, and it was found {{that there is a need}} to develop a new prefabricated floor <b>heating</b> <b>panel</b> that can be installed in an aged apartment to be remodeled.
