The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> back into the line-up.|$|E
25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid his face in his hands, then stood up as Putin patted <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.|$|E
500|$|Upon seeing {{reproductions of}} the painting, the villagers did not {{interpret}} it {{as a call}} to change their ways. Instead, they were flattered by Predić's decision to depict them. [...] "To local audiences in particular", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "such lighthearted didacticism entwined with a familiar and beloved world was immensely satisfying". It is said that {{on one of his}} visits home, Predić went to the local pub and encountered the patrons examining a calendar with a reproduction of his painting inside it. A number of patrons—some of whom were included in the composition—tapped <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> in drunken stupor and commended him on how accurately he had captured them. What Filipovitch-Robinson calls Predić's [...] "well-meaning and subtle moralizing" [...] had thus been rendered ineffectual.|$|E

500|$|At Fastlane, after The Authority (Big Show, Seth Rollins, and Kane) {{defeated}} Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan and Ryback, Orton {{returned and}} saved Ziggler, Rowan and Ryback from a post-match beatdown. He later gave an RKO to Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury (J Security) and Kane. The next night on Raw, The Authority {{tried to convince}} Orton {{to come back to}} the [...] "family", but Orton did not give an answer straight away until he saw them backstage. During a tag team match later that night, Orton became frustrated and upset after Rollins tagged himself into the match. After the match, Orton made his way towards Rollins in the ring, but was briefly interrupted by Jamie Noble who got an RKO for his troubles. Then Orton, much to Rollins' surprise, picked him up and only patted <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> leaving his alignment at the time in question. On the March 9 edition of Raw, Orton insulted several members of The Authority, only to pass it off as a joke. During a 2-on-1 handicap match in which he teamed with Seth Rollins against Roman Reigns, he abandoned Rollins, allowing Reigns to get the victory. Following this, Orton viciously beat Rollins, eventually executing an RKO through the broadcast table. On the March 16 episode of Raw, a match between the two was made official for WrestleMania 31 on the condition that Orton would meet Rollins later on that same night in the ring. The bout never took place as every member of The Authority made their way to the ring to attack Orton. Their attempt to avenge Rollins was thwarted by Sting, who aided Orton in holding them off. Orton defeated Rollins at the event. After the loss, Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. With Rollins as the new champion, Orton defeated Roman Reigns and Ryback in a triple threat match on the April 6 episode of Raw to become the #1 contender to face Rollins at Extreme Rules, but he failed to win the title from Rollins in a steel cage match that saw per the stipulation his RKO banned and Kane as the gatekeeper. At Payback, Orton failed to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship when he was defeated by Rollins in a fatal four-way match that also included Dean Ambrose and Reigns.|$|E
