40|$|Abstract- <b>Inventory</b> <b>changes</b> {{can help}} econometric models {{to balance the}} supply and the demand side and to endogenize {{utilization}} variables without resorting to an arbitrary potential output level. Both results stem from formu-lating inventory-augmented production functions in which <b>inventory</b> <b>changes</b> act as a stationary ECM between value added and inputs {{on one side and}} value added and Þnal sales on the other. This happens because factors or prices may adjust too slowly to productivity and sales shocks.

40|$|Apparently random {{financial}} fluctuations often exhibit {{varying levels}} of complex-ity, chaos. Given limited data, predictability of such time series becomes hard to infer. While efficient methods of Lyapunov exponent computation are devised, knowledge about the process driving the dynamics greatly facilitates the complex-ity analysis. This paper shows that quarterly <b>inventory</b> <b>changes</b> of wheat in the global market, during 1974 - 2012, follow a nonlinear deterministic process. Lya-punov exponents of these fluctuations are computed using sliding time windows each of length 131 quarters. Weakly chaotic behavior alternates with non-chaotic behavior over the entire period of analysis. More importantly, in this paper, a cubic dependence of price <b>changes</b> on <b>inventory</b> <b>changes</b> leads to establishment of deterministic Duffing-Oscillator-Model(DOM) as a suitable candidate for examin-ing inventory fluctuations of wheat. DOM represents the interaction of commodity production cycle with an external intervention in the market. Parameters obtained for shifting time zones by fitting the Fourier estimated time signals to DOM are able to generate responses that reproduce the true chaotic nature exhibited by the empirical signal at that time. Endowing the parameters with suitable mean-ings, one may infer that temporary changes in speculation reflect the pattern of inventory volatility that drives the transitions between chaotic and non-chaotic behavior. ...|$|R
