25|$|Alwar is {{the first}} major city when {{travelling}} from Delhi en route to Rajasthan. Its heritage is a major draw for tourists. The fort of Alwar, known as Bala fort, is about 595 meters high. It was constructed in the tenth century, making it the oldest building in the city. Despite {{being one of the}} princely states of Rajputana, the rulers here had left no stone unturned in building many forts. Seeing the fort of Baala, there is an impression that sometimes {{it would have been a}} very inaccessible fort, where there would have been many turrets, a large gate, a temple and a residential area. There is a state museum in the City Palace, where there is a rare collection of miniature paintings. Near the corner are Mousi's umbrella, Vinay Palace, Vijay Mandir Palace and Moti Dungri. In other tourist spots, the lake is situated in Silasedh Lake and Jaisamand Lake. Sariska, which is at a distance of 36 kilometers, after rain, for its green trees and greenery of bushes, is seen differently. In its beautiful valley, visions are visible with blue cow, chital, wild pig, other animals. Sariska is counted in old Tiger-projects. Due to poaching sighting tigers has unfortunately become rare. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> discouraged but go Sariska, which is still full of beautiful natural scenery and colorful birds. Historical significance of the nearby Biratnagar or Barrath, is due to the stupa and established inscription made by Emperor Ashoka the Great. According to legendary belief, Pandavas spent some time in their ignorance here. There is a large number of religious devotees on the Pandupole-Bhardhari Loktirtha. You can also experience unlimited peace by traveling here. Alwar is also famous for its famous sweet kalakand (Mauva of Alwar), this milk made from milk is not only nearby but also famous. The items made of paper-potter are also very much appreciated here.|$|E

Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott's house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay him and told him to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> off, I will make you." [...] Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually owe him any money.|$|E

[...] The gamma accelerator then blasts riders with superhuman strength, catapulting them out from the gamma ray accelerator. Following this, riders experience the same track layout from the original hulk ride with new track pieces and an original score composed by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy.|$|E

500|$|The elderly Ian Smith {{lived in}} an unassuming house in Harare where, {{according}} to David Blair, [...] "the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea". He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994. He insisted {{that he would never}} leave Zimbabwe. [...] "Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> afraid," [...] a friend reported him saying. [...] "Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone." [...] He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, The Great Betrayal, to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister, and praised Nelson Mandela, calling him Africa's [...] "first black statesman". Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. [...] "They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news," [...] Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country's whites admired Smith, however; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.|$|E

In a scene inside Flanders' kitchen, a note which reads [...] "1 COR 6:9-11" [...] can be seen. This refers to the Bible, First Corinthian, chapter 6, verses 9 to 11: [...] "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

According to Scully, the staff received [...] "several angry letters" [...] from people for the scene. After the cartoon, an advertisement for Mr. Sparkle, a character that first appeared in the season 8 episode [...] "In Marge We Trust", can be seen on the television screen. Barney, while impersonating Homer, says [...] "That boy ain't right", a line frequently used by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated television series King of the Hill. The giant monsters attacking at the end of the episode are Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, all of which are famous from Japanese monster movies. The scene was included as a reference to the 1998 action science fiction film Godzilla, in which three of the main The Simpsons cast members (Azaria, Cartwright and Shearer) had a live-action role.|$|E
