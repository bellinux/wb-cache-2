25|$|In November 2009, The Economist {{estimated}} that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax)</b> would add $215 {{billion per year}} to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Peter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry {{and that it would}} likely not exist without it. In other words, taxpayers might be more inclined to change behavior or the system itself if they were paying $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. To put this amount in perspective, the federal government collected $1,146 billion in income taxes in 2008, so $200 billion represents a 17.5% increase in the effective tax rate.|$|E
25|$|Both {{stamp duty}} and SDRT {{remain in place}} today, albeit with {{continued}} relief for intermediaries, so that over 70% of transactions are <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax.</b> SDRT accounts {{for the majority of}} revenue collected on share transactions effected through the UK's Exchanges. On average almost 90% of revenues stem from the SDRT. Only a minor part comes from Stamp Duty. Revenue is pro-cyclical with economic activity. In terms of GDP and total tax revenue the highest values were reached during the dot.com boom years around the end of the 20th century, notably in 2000–01. In 2007–08, SDRT generated €5.37 billion in revenue (compared to 0.72 billion of the standard stamp duty). This accounts for 0.82% over total UK tax revenue or 0.30% of GDP. In 2008–09 the figure dropped to €3.67 billion (0.22% of GDP), due to reduced share prices and trading volumes {{as a result of the}} financial crisis.|$|E

500|$|The {{first known}} {{reconstruction}} of the temple was recorded in a grant made by Kotte Kingdom King Parakrakrama Bahu VI (1412/1415 - 1467). The grant was made in Grantha script in Sanskrit. [...] In his thirty-eighth regnal year (1450 or 1453) he summoned the chief priest of the temple, Vijasamagava Panditha(r), and reaffirmed the lands {{that had belonged to}} the Siva temple. The villages mentioned as belonging to the temple are Ilupaideni(ya), Kottaipitti and Tittakatai. Revenue accrued from this land grant was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax.</b> The grant was inscribed on a granite slab and installed as part of the renovated temple. The conquest of Jaffna kingdom by Sapumal Kumaraya, a military leader sent by the Kotte king in 1450, was celebrated in the Kokila Sandesaya ("Message carried by Kokila bird") written in the 15th century by the principal monk of the Irugalkula Tilaka Pirivena in Mulgirigala. The book contains a contemporary description of the country traversed by the road taken by the cookoo bird, from Tenavaram, Tevan Thurai (referred to as Devi Nuwara - [...] "City of Gods") in the south to Nallur ("Beautiful City") in the North of Sri Lanka. It mentions the Munneswaram temple. The second set of grants to be recorded were by another Kotte King, Parakramabahu IX (1509–1528), who donated extensive lands to the temple and recorded the deed in a copper plate inscription.|$|E
500|$|The {{ball was}} {{designed}} to cater for [...] "very, very high-class people" [...] according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. In the 1960 event, prizes given included a Ford Thunderbird car, a Chinchilla coat, a Renault Dauphine, a TV Hi-Fi system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags and a pedigree poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers. Every guest {{was said to have}} gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes were given out. Over its history, the ball, which was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax,</b> earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the American Cancer Society, with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people were paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated [...] "We charge the most, give the most, and make the most – it's a success formula". Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer.|$|E

2500|$|Beaumont {{gained a}} strong {{commercial}} advantage over his rivals {{by setting up}} a subsidiary company to present classic plays: he successfully maintained that this operation qualified as [...] "educational", and was thus <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax.</b> With productions such as The Importance of Being Earnest, with Gielgud and Edith Evans, and Hamlet, with Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, Beaumont made large profits from this ostensibly charitable enterprise. Gielgud was a strong influence on Beaumont's aesthetic development, and they maintained a mutually beneficial association which survived despite a personal crisis when Gielgud's then partner John Perry fell for and moved in with Beaumont. Perry remained personally and professionally involved with Beaumont {{for the rest of}} the latter's life, and all three remained on close terms. Another close associate was Noël Coward. [...] In his play Present Laughter, he caricatured himself and his friends, including Beaumont, portrayed as [...] "Henry Lyppiatt", the shrewd man of business. Despite the heavy entertainment tax paid on productions by the main Tennent organisation, Beaumont made substantial profits from such new plays as Coward's Blithe Spirit, which ran for 1,997 performances.|$|E
60|$|The proper {{officers}} of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by {{the law of the}} United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency of so far modifying the act as to <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the lower}} animals Dr. Prosper Lucas has {{collected}} {{a long list}} of inherited injuries. A few instances will suffice. A cow lost a horn from an accident with consequent suppuration, and she produced three calves which were hornless {{on the same side of}} the head. With the horse, there seems hardly a doubt that exostoses on the legs, caused by too much travelling on hard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records the case of a man who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off, and which in consequence grew crooked, and his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly crooked. A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage, lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia, and his two sons were microphthalmic on the same side. (12/59. This last case is quoted by Mr. Sedgwick in 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April, 1861 page 484. For Blumenbach see above-cited paper. See also Dr. P. Lucas 'Traite de l'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 page 492. Also 'Transact. Linn. Soc.' volume 9 page 323. Some curious cases are given by Mr. Baker in the 'Veterinary' volume 13 page 723. Another curious case is given in the 'Annales des Scienc. Nat.' 1st series, tome 11 page 324.) In all cases in which a parent has had an organ injured on one side, and two or more of the offspring are born with the same organ affected on the same side, the chances against mere coincidence are almost infinitely great. Even when only a single child is born having exactly the same part of the body affected as that of his injured parent, the chances against coincidence are great; and Professor Rolleston has given me two such cases which have fallen under his own observation,--namely of two men, one of whom had his knee and the other his cheek severely cut, and both had children born with exactly the same spot marked or scarred. Many instances have been recorded of cats, dogs, and horses, which have had their tails, legs, etc., amputated or injured, producing offspring with the same parts ill-formed; but as it is not very rare for similar malformations to appear spontaneously, all such cases may be due to coincidence. It is, however, an argument on the other side that [...] "under the old excise laws the shepherd-dog was only <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> when without a tail, and for this reason it was always removed" [...] (12/60. 'The Dog' by Stonehenge 1867 page 118.); and there still exist breeds of the shepherd-dog which are always born destitute of a tail. Finally, it must be admitted, more especially since the publication of Brown-Sequard's observations, that the effects of injuries, especially when followed by disease, or perhaps exclusively when thus followed, are occasionally inherited. (12/61. The Mot-mot habitually bites the barbs off the middle part of the two central tail-feathers, and as the barbs are congenitally somewhat reduced on the same part of these feathers, it seems extremely probable, as Mr. Salvin remarks, 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1873 page 429, that this is due to the inherited effects of long-continued mutilation.) ...|$|E
