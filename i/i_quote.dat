2500|$|Mr. President, {{yesterday}} {{in a statement}} you admitted that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, but justified the invasion by stating [...] <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> [...] "he retained the knowledge, the materials, the means, and the intent to produce weapons of mass destruction, and could have passed this knowledge to our terrorist enemies." [...] Do you sincerely believe {{this to be a}} reasonable justification for invasion when this statement applies to so many other countries, including North Korea? ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{session of}} the United Nations Security Council was convened, in which UN Under-Secretary-General B. Lynn Pascoe gave a {{briefing}} about the refugee situation and Edmond Mulet briefed about the situation relating to the mandate of UNOMIG. Following statements by Georgia and the United States, the Russian ambassador said: [...] "Unfortunately, I have {{to point out that}} the content of the briefing by Mr. Pascoe shows that the Secretariat and its leadership have not been able to adopt an objective position showing a thorough grasp of the substance of this conflict, as should be expected from the leadership of such an authoritative international organization." [...] The Ambassador for the United States stated: [...] "Foreign Minister Lavrov told United States Secretary of State Rice that the democratically elected President of Georgia — and <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> — 'must go'. <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> again: 'Saakashvili must go'. This is completely unacceptable and crosses the line." [...] The Russian ambassador responded by saying, [...] "On Ambassador Khalilzad’s interesting reference to a confidential diplomatic telephone call between our Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Secretary of State, I must say at the outset that regime change is an American expression. We do not use such expressions." [...] After the meeting, CNN reported, [...] "But Churkin drew a rebuke from other Security Council members, including its current president, after he questioned the objectivity of a top U.N. official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in Georgia". Sergey Lavrov later claimed that Russian [...] "peace enforcement" [...] operation was not linked to the removal of Saakashvili from office. He said Condoleezza Rice [...] "incorrectly interpreted" [...] the phone conversation between them. He added if an agreement on non-use of military force is signed, [...] "peace will be restored independently of the further fate of Saakashvili".|$|E

2500|$|If {{our dreams}} for Zionism are {{to end in}} the smoke of assassins' pistols and our labours for its future to produce only {{a new set of}} gangsters worthy of Nazi Germany, many like myself will have to reconsider the {{position}} we have maintained so consistently and so long in the past. If there is to be any hope of a peaceful and successful future for Zionism, these wicked activities must cease, and those responsible for them must be destroyed root and branch. [...] In Palestine the executive of the Jewish Agency have called upon the Jewish community—and <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> their actual words: 'To cast out the members of this destructive band, deprive them of all refuge and shelter, to resist their threats, and to render all necessary assistance to the authorities in the prevention of terrorist acts, and in the eradication of the terrorist organisation.' These are strong words, but we must wait for these words to be translated into deeds.|$|E
2500|$|The 7 RAR mascot and nickname, [...] "the Pigs", has a {{long and}} celebrated history within the {{battalion}}. According to Corporal Roy Savage:The single men of 3 RAR were sent to Puckapunyal {{to form a new}} battalion, 7 RAR. I arrived there on 11th November 1965. At first there were only regular soldiers. We used to keep the boozer open all weekend having the cooks bring our meals there. Anyway, on my second week there the new CO (Colonel Eric Smith) decided to inspect his new battalion area on a Sunday. He immediately closed the boozer. The next day he called a muster parade of the whole battalion and commenced to tell us what he thought of us. Half way through his speech he said and <b>I</b> <b>quote,</b> 'You are nothing but a mob of pigs'. Then from the back rank someone called out 'oink oink'. From that time onwards we became the Pig Battalion.|$|E
