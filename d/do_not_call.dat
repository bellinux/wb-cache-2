5|$|In February 2010, local councillors from Kent and Pas-de-Calais {{announced}} {{they were in}} talks to establish a frequent local rail service between the regional stations along the route. Trains would leave Lille and stop at Calais, Ashford and Stratford before reaching London St Pancras. Currently, Ashford and Calais have an infrequent service and Eurostar trains <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> at Stratford. The initiative is part of Calais' branding {{as part of the}} UK in order to benefit from the 2012 London Olympics but is supported {{on both sides of the}} channel to bring in more commuters.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track connection, tracks ST-1 and ST-2, {{is planned}} between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E

The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|Monday to Saturday {{services}} are half-hourly {{in each direction}} until 20:00, with an hourly service provided after 20:00 and on Sundays. The first weekday service departs at 05:20 from Tweedbank with the last service leaving Edinburgh at 23:54. Departure times from Edinburgh are usually at 24 and 54 minutes past the hour, while from Tweedbank trains depart at 28 and 58 minutes past the hour; individual timings may vary by a minute or so. The trains starting close to on the hour <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> at Stow except in the peaks and evenings; the Sunday service stops at Stow. Most services operate between Edinburgh and Tweedbank {{except for a few}} morning peak services that continue to Glenrothes with Thornton via the Fife Circle Line and a few evening peak services that originate at Glenrothes with Thornton.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E
25|$|The use by {{marketers}} {{of customer}} {{information has been}} criticized. In the United States, there has been widespread community anger against telemarketers {{which led to the}} United States National <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Call</b> Registry (2003). Similar issues have been raised in other countries leading to setting up of <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> lists, such as Canada's National <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Call</b> List (2004), and Australia's <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Call</b> Register (2006). Some people also object to the display of caller ID on the called party's phone, especially if this finishes being used for commercial purposes by the recipient or sold on to a third party. Some people turn off the caller ID feature on their phone.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the United Methodist Church, there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley's Methodist movement. Some, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the AME Zion Church, the Free Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church (formerly Wesleyan Methodist Connection), the Congregational Methodist Church and First Congregational Methodist Church are explicitly Methodist. The Primitive Methodist Church is a continuing branch of the former British Primitive Methodist Church. Others <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> themselves Methodist, but are related to varying degrees. The Evangelical Church was formed {{by a group of}} EUB congregations who dissented from the merger which formed the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church has also taken steps to strengthen ties with its fellow Methodist churches, as well as other Protestant denominations in the United States. Since 1985, the UMC has been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. A Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger.|$|E
