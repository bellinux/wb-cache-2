Further fighting ensued as they pushed on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December.

In 1813, Hinde was placed in charge of prisoners captured at this battle.|$|E

The ‘Coastal Group’ was meanwhile <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> on Odessa. By early 9 October Army was <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> on Taganrog, after a failed attempt by Southern Front’s three armies to hold a line between Pavlograd and the Sea of Azov had been shattered by an outflanking maneuver by Von Kleist’s newly renamed First Panzer Army. The resulting Battle of the Sea of Azov shattered 9th Army, virtually destroying it.|$|R

5|$|Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} 2:24:43, {{the only time}} in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to <b>fall</b> <b>back.</b> The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa. Abebe won that race in a time of 2:23:14.8.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to <b>fall</b> <b>back.</b> Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E

Half of the engineers' boats were too far west {{to be used}} (43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation process. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing {{it to be a}} resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E

5|$|If the hastati {{failed to}} break the enemy during their engagement, they would <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break through, they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line {{were some of the}} least {{dependable}} troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line.|$|E
5|$|In August, Admiral Sir Thomas Graves led a fleet from New York {{to attack}} de Grasse's fleet. Graves {{did not realize}} how large the French fleet was, and neither did Cornwallis. The British fleet was {{defeated}} by de Grasse's fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, and forced to <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> to New York. On September 14, Washington arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After a pause in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E

5|$|Pitched battles were {{conducted}} in a similar fashion: the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of {{training}} in Australia, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea in August 1942 as the Australians sent reinforcements to the Kokoda Track to fight against Japanese forces that had been advancing towards Port Moresby. After the Japanese exhausted their supplies and began to <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> towards their beachheads on the north coast, the 2/14th saw further action around Gona. In September 1943, after a period of re-organisation in Australia, the battalion took part in the advance on Lae as the Allies went on the offensive in New Guinea, before taking part in the fighting in the Markham and Ramu Valleys of the Finisterre Range campaign. The battalion's final involvement in the war came in the landing on Balikpapan in 1945. The 2/14th was disbanded after the war, in early 1946.|$|E
