5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E

5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
6000|$|It involves, therefore, always, {{ideas of}} power and dexterity, but also of restraint; and the delight you take in it should involve the {{understanding}} of the difficulty the workman dealt with. You perhaps doubt the extent to which this feeling justly extends, (in the first volume of [...] "Modern Painters," [...] expressed under the head [...] "Ideas of Power.") But why is a large stone in any building grander than a small one? Simply because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise <b>it.</b> So, also, an engraved line is, and ought to <b>be,</b> recognized as <b>more</b> grand than a pen or pencil line, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to execute <b>it.</b>|$|R

25|$|Stringent {{adherence}} to the grid plan can cause steep inclines since the topology {{of the land is}} not taken into account.

50|$|Folk poetry presumably flourished {{alongside}} classical poetry, {{and reflected}} the common man's life with its levity, humor and irony.

25|$|Cross-note tunings {{include a}} minor third, so giving a minor chord with open strings. Fretting the minor-third string {{at the first}} fret {{produces}} a major-third, so allowing a one-finger fretting of a major chord.

25|$|Grover Boydston {{conducted}} the first demographic study of Neurotics Anonymous in 1974.
