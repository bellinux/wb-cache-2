40|$|A robust {{phenotypic}} plasticity {{to ward off}} adverse environmental conditions determines performance and productivity in crop plants. <b>Flax</b> (<b>linseed),</b> is an important cash crop produced for natural textile fiber (linen) or oilseed with many health promoting products. This crop is prone to drought stress and yield losses {{in many parts of}} the world. Despite recent advances in drought research in a number of important crops, related progress in flax is very limited. Since, response of this plant to drought stress has not been addressed at the molecular level; we conducted microarray analysis to capture transcriptome associated with induced drought in flax. This study identified 183 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with diverse cellular, biophysical and metabolic programs in flax. The analysis also revealed especially the altered regulation of cellular and metabolic pathways governing photosynthesis. Additionally, comparative transcriptome analysis identified a plethora of genes that displayed differential regulation both spatially and temporally. These results revealed co-regulated expression of 26 genes in both shoot and root tissues with implications for drought stress response. Furthermore, the data also showed that more genes are upregulated in roots compared to shoots, suggesting that roots may play important and additional roles in response to drought in flax. With prolonged drought treatment, the number of DEGs increased in both tissue types. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR, thus supporting the suggested functional association of these intrinsic genes in maintaining growth and homeostasis in response to imminent drought stress in flax.

The treated F 1 was characterized in detail applying SEM, FTIR, TGA and single fiber tensile test for its promising application in composites as natural materials. The proper condition of alkali treatment was explored and determined to be 2 % of NaOH for 1 h at 80 oC. Under this condition, the mechanical property of the fiber was 10 % better than that of untreated F 1, and the non-cellulose portion removing ratio was more than 25 % without hurting fiber structure...|$|R
50|$|<b>Flax</b> (or <b>linseed)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically {{available}} botanical sources of omega-3 fatty acid which is high in protein and ALA (alpha-linolenic acid). The use of flaxseed in layer mash in chicken egg production has been shown to raise omega-3 levels beyond that of pastured chicken. Recently, research has been conducted involving the use of ground flax seeds as a fat supplement in cattle rations. Being high in protein and fats, it can replace other protein-dense foods such as soy. It is believed that the inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids in the diets of beef producing cattle will bring an increase in health to the animals and to the quality of carcass upon slaughter. Some studies have found that feeding flax seeds may increase the omega-3 content and improve marbling in the carcass of the animal at slaughter while others have found no differences. Flax seeds suppress inflammatory effects from bovine respiratory disease (BRD) often affecting stressed cattle due to production practices such as transport and processing. BRD can lead to lung tissue damage and impair the performance of the cattle leading to a low final body mass at slaughter or premature death. Another effect of feeding flax in cattle ration is an observed increase in the daily dry matter intake. This was observed in feeding a total dietary content of omega-3 fatty acids of under 10% of total feed.|$|R

40|$|Background: Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the largest}} health burdens in the world, leading to stroke, {{coronary}} heart disease, myocardial infarct, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and renal failure. There are many pharmaceutical medications on the market for blood pressure management. Many of these medications have undesirable side effects or are expensive. Dietary intervention with omega- 3 fatty acids has become a popular alternative to medication for blood pressure (BP) control. The cardiovascular benefits of omega- 3 fatty acids consumed via fish oil have been well established. More research is being done to establish the mechanism and efficacy of other dietary sources containing fatty acids. It has been suggested that foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) may have cardio protective properties. Dietary flaxseed {{is one of the}} foods of interest being it contains the highest level of ALA. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, dietary flaxseed may be an effective and safe alternative for BP management. Methods: An exhaustive search was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, and Web of Science using the keywords: <b>flax,</b> flaxseed, <b>linseed</b> oil, blood pressure, and hypertension. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. A search on the NIH clinical trials site reveals there is one trial currently registered relating to the antihypertensive effects of dietary flaxseed. Results: Two studies met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. The first study, FLAX-PAD, was a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled study (RCT) utilized to examine the effects of dietary flaxseed on systolic BP and diastolic BP in patients newly diagnosed with PAD. This study demonstrated the antihypertensive effects in patients consuming dietary flaxseed. Researchers also revealed the relationship between plasma ALA levels and blood pressure. The second study was a prospective, two-group, parallel-arm design RCT to examine the effects of dietary flaxseed on blood pressure in middle-aged dyslipidemic men. This study revealed a significant reduction in blood pressure in individuals receiving the intervention. Conclusion: Daily consumption of 30 g of milled flaxseed or 15 mL of flax oil per day has shown an antihypertensive effect on select patient populations.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute - Animal Science & IndustryKelly J. K. GettyFats {{and oils}} are an {{important}} topic in the margarine and spreads industry. The selection of these ingredients can be based on many factors including flavor, functionality, cost, and health aspects. In general, fat {{is an important component}} of a healthy diet. Fat or oil provides nine calories per gram of energy, transports essential vitamins, and is necessary in cellular structure. Major shifts in consumption of fats and oils through history have been driven by consumer demand. An example is the decline in animal fat consumption due to consumers’ concern over saturated fats. Also, consumers’ concern over the obesity epidemic and coronary heart disease has driven demand for new, lower calorie, nutrient-rich spreads products. Fats and oils can be separated into many different subgroups. “Fats” generally refer to lipids that are solid at room temperature while “oils” refer to those that are liquid. Fatty acids can be either saturated or unsaturated. If they are unsaturated, they can be either mono-, di-, or poly-unsaturated. Also, unsaturated bonds can be in the cis or trans conformation. A triglyceride, which is three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone, can have any combination of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Triglycerides are the primary components of animal and vegetable fats and oils. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in these fats and oils has a great impact on their functionality. Common fats and oils include butterfat, beef tallow, fish oils, soybean oil, rapeseed (canola) oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, <b>linseed</b> (<b>flax)</b> oil, and safflower oil. Typical fat and oil modification techniques include hydrogenation, interesterification, alternative hydrogenation, fractionation, blending, farm/field practices and genetic modification, and the use of fat replacers. There are many processing techniques that can be utilized in margarine and spreads production. The process can be optimized for each margarine or spreads product. There are many fats and oils in margarine and spreads formulations. Familiarity with commonly used fats and oils in regards to availability, cost, nutrition, chemistry, and functionality are important when creating a cost-effective, functional margarine or spreads product...|$|R
