500|$|... "Mansize Rooster" [...] {{is said to}} {{be about}} a young boy with a large penis, {{although}} this is not obvious from the lyrics. Gaz Coombes once stated in an interview that [...] "the most embarrassing moment in pop <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> album where it goes: 'Oi Mum! Got any mandies?'" [...] This was one of the many exclamations made between tracks on I Should Coco in the sped-up voices of the band members. It was said before the song [...] "We're Not Supposed To" [...] began.|$|E

He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism. In 1961, Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, and within two decades, the [...] "construction of a communist society" [...] in the USSR would be completed [...] "in the main".|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the quotes}} from the film that became popular were: [...] "En Vazhi Thani Vazhi." [...] (English: My way is a unique way); [...] "Poda Andavane Namapakam Irukan’’ (English: God <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side); [...] "Adhigama Aasaipadra Aambalaiyum, Adhigama Kobapadra Pombalaiyum, Nalla Vazhndhadha Sarithirame Kidaiyathu" [...] (English: There is no history {{of a man who}} desires too much or a woman who gets too angry living well), [...] "Kashtapadama Edhuvum Kidaikkathu. Kashtapadama Kidaikirathu Ennikkum Nilakkathu" [...] (English: One can gain nothing without working hard for it. Those which are gotten without hardwork will not be there forever); and [...] "Anger is the cause of all miseries. One should know how to control it, {{otherwise}} life will become miserable." [...] One of Rajinikanth's climactic dialogues in the film [...] "En Vazhi Thani Vazhi" [...] was used as the title of a 2015 film directed by Shaji Kailas. It was also used as the title of a 2010 book on branding by Sridhar Ramanujam. Scenes from the film were parodied in various other films, notable of which are Thirupathi Ezhumalai Venkatesa (1999), En Purushan Kuzhandhai Maadhiri (2001), Annai Kaligambal (2003), Sivaji (2007). Vel (2007), Siva Manasula Sakthi (2009), Malai Malai (2009), Vanakkam Chennai (2013), and All in All Azhagu Raja (2013). Padayappa was also parodied in the Star Vijay comedy series Lollu Sabha, in an episode appropriately named Vadayappa.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 December Radu Bălan and Ștefan Gușă [...] visited {{workers in}} the city’s factories, but failed {{to get them to}} resume work. On 20 December massive columns of workers entered the city. About 100,000 protesters {{occupied}} Piața Operei (Opera Square – today Piața Victoriei, Victory Square) and chanted anti-government slogans: [...] "Noi suntem poporul!" [...] ("We are the people!"), [...] "Armata e cu noi!" [...] ("The army <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side!"), [...] "Nu vă fie frică, Ceaușescu pică!" [...] ("Have no fear, Ceaușescu is falling!”) ...|$|E

[...] "Democracy yes, dictatorship no!", [...] "Romeo, friend, the people are with you!" [...] People from the religious sector, women's organisations, politics and government gave speeches in favour of the rule of law. Jorge Yllescas Olive said [...] "Hondurans have saved our country, justice <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side and we are demonstrating it to the world."

2500|$|Rioting {{followed}} the arrest. Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest. However, to his shock, the crowd booed as he spoke. Mass protests followed, with about 100,000 protesters occupying Operei Square chanting anti-government protests: [...] "Noi suntem poporul!" [...] ("We are the people!"), [...] "Armata e cu noi!" [...] ("The army <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side!"), [...] "Nu vă fie frică, Ceauşescu pică!" [...] ("Have no fear, Ceauşescu will fall"). [...] The Romanian military changed sides, turning on [...] Ceauşescu, who was executed {{after a brief}} trial three days later.|$|E
2500|$|Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. France and Britain, {{which were}} obligated by treaty to protect Poland, responded with notes of protest {{requesting}} the Germans withdraw. Following French-British indecision, Britain acted alone {{moving forward with}} a two-hour ultimatum at 9:00am on September 3, which France was then forced to follow, issuing its own ultimatum. Nevertheless, despite declarations that {{a state of war}} now existed with Germany, the inter-Allied military conferences of September 4–6 determined there was no possibility of supporting an eastern front in Poland. France subsequently requested Britain not bomb Germany, fearing military retaliation against the French populace. It was determined to do nothing, so as to not provoke a transfer of German forces to the western front. Chamberlain declared on September 12 [...] "There is no hurry as time <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side." [...] The abandonment of Poland was complete.|$|E
2500|$|Without {{official}} government support {{the most radical}} advocates of manifest destiny increasingly turned to military filibustering. Originally filibuster {{had come from the}} Dutch vrijbuiter and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the New-York Daily Times [...] "the fever of Fillibusterism <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> country. Her pulse beats like a hammer at the wrist, and there's a very high color on her face." [...] Millard Fillmore's second annual message to Congress, submitted in December 1851, gave double the amount of space to filibustering activities than the brewing sectional conflict. The eagerness of the filibusters, and the public to support them, had an international hue. Clay's son, diplomat to Portugal, reported that Lisbon had been stirred into a [...] "frenzy" [...] of excitement and were waiting on every dispatch.|$|E

2500|$|In 258, Sun Chen deposed {{the second}} Wu emperor Sun Liang and {{replaced}} the latter with Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu was unhappy that Sun Chen monopolised state power so he plotted with the minister Zhang Bu to eliminate Sun Chen. Zhang Bu told the emperor, [...] "Ding Feng {{may not be}} proficient in administrating civil affairs, but he is an outstanding strategist and is capable of making important decisions." [...] Sun Xiu then summoned Ding Feng for a meeting and said to the latter, [...] "Sun Chen usurps state power and is plotting treason. I want {{you to help me}} eliminate him." [...] Ding Feng replied, [...] "The Chancellor (Sun Chen) and his brothers have many supporters. Not everyone in the imperial court <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side. We cannot confront them directly. I suggest that Your Majesty order your soldiers to kill him during the Laba Festival." [...] Sun Xiu followed Ding Feng's plan and pretended to invite Sun Chen to the palace to celebrate the Laba Festival. When Sun Chen stepped inside, Ding Feng and Zhang Bu signalled to the imperial guards to kill him. For his contributions, Ding Feng was promoted to the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍) and received the additional appointments of Left and Right Protectors of the Capital (左右都護).|$|E
