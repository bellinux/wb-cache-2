50|$|<b>First</b> <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> (1NF) is a {{property}} of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in <b>first</b> <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> if {{and only if}} the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain. The first definition of the term, in a 1971 conference paper by Edgar Codd, defined a relation to be in <b>first</b> <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> when none of its domains have any sets as elements.|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{method is}} described for computing the unique generator of the algebra of first integrals {{associated with a}} large class of Hopf-zero singularity. The set of all volume-preserving classical <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of this singularity is introduced via a Lie algebra description. This is a maximal vector space of classical <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> with <b>first</b> integral; this is whence our approach works. Systems with a non-zero condition on their quadratic parts are considered. The algebra of all first integrals for any such system has a unique (modulo scalar multiplication) generator. The infinite level volume-preserving parametric <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of any non-degenerate perturbation within the Lie algebra of any such system is computed, where it can have rich dynamics. The associated unique generator of the algebra of first integrals are derived. The symmetry group of the infinite level <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> are also discussed. Some necessary formulas are derived and applied to appropriately modified Rössler and generalized Kuramoto [...] Sivashinsky equations to demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical results. An approach (introduced by Iooss and Lombardi) is applied to find an optimal truncation for the <b>first</b> level <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of these examples with exponentially small remainders. The numerically suggested radius of convergence (for the first integral) associated with a hypernormalization step is discussed for the truncated <b>first</b> level <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of the examples. This is achieved by an efficient implementation of the results using Maple...|$|R

A database that's in the <b>first</b> <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> is vulnerable to all types of anomalies, while a database that's in the domain/key normal form has no modification anomalies. Normal forms are hierarchical in nature.

40|$|Abstract: Normalization and {{functional}} dependency are most fundamental part in relational database. The normalization rules {{are designed to}} prevent update anomalies and data inconsistencies. The <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> defines in relation database theory represent the guidelines for record design. The guidelines corresponding to <b>first</b> through fifth <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> are presented. Normalization process depends on the single analytical tool called as functional dependency. The concept of functional dependency is useful in design and analysis of relational database. By applying the functional dependencies to relational database we can represent the relation in various <b>normal</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
40|$|A formal {{model for}} {{defining}} transformations of languages of designs {{in terms of}} the grammars which generate them is described in detail. <b>First,</b> a <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> for grammars is presented which distinguishes two basic determinants of the compositional structure of designs in a language: spatial relations and the order in which they are employed to generate designs. These two constructive mechanisms are used to specify each rule in a <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> grammar. An internal formal property of a <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> grammar called its recursive structure is also characterized. Rules of transformation are then defined which map the rules of a given <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> grammar onto rules of new grammars by changing independently the two components of rules in the original grammar. The new grammars produced specify new languages of designs. Of particular interest are those transformations which preserve the recursive structure of the original grammar. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{relation}} {{that is in}} <b>first</b> <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> (1NF) {{must meet}} additional criteria {{if it is to}} qualify for second normal form.

A non-prime attribute of a relation is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanism}} of limit-cycle excitation is investigated for an aeroelastic system with structural nonlinearities. The analysis is performed on a simplified acroelastic model retaining only two structural modes (first bending and first torsional modes) and with a simplified description of both unsteady loads due to wing oscillation and external gust excitation. Two cases are considered, without and with gust excitation. In the <b>first</b> case, <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> analysis is employed to give an approximation of the basin of attraction of stable limit cycles {{in the space of}} initial conditions. In the second case, a critical gust intensity for a given gust gradient leading again to undamped oscillations is identified. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In [18] {{the authors}} {{developed}} {{a method for}} computing <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of dynamical systems with a coupled cell network structure. We now apply this theory to one-parameter families of homogeneous feed-forward chains with 2 -dimensional cells. Our main result is that Hopf bifurcations in such families generically generate branches of periodic solutions with amplitudes growing like ∼ |λ | 12, ∼ |λ | 16, ∼ |λ | 118, etc. Such amplified Hopf branches were previously found in a subclass of feed-forward networks with three cells, <b>first</b> under a <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> assumption [15] and later by explicit computations [8], [13].

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the Turing-Hopf bifurcation arising from the reaction-diffusion equations. It is a degenerate case and where the characteristic equation has a pair of simple purely imaginary roots and a simple zero root. <b>First,</b> the <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> theory for partial differential equations (PDEs) with delays developed by Faria is adopted to this degenerate case {{so that it can}} be easily applied to Turing-Hopf bifurcation. Then, we present a rigorous procedure for calculating the <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> associated with the Turing-Hopf bifurcation of PDEs. We show that the reduced dynamics associated with Turing-Hopf bifurcation is exactly the dynamics of codimension-two ordinary differential equations (ODE), which implies the ODE techniques can be employed to classify the reduced dynamics by the unfolding parameters. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to an autocatalysis model governed by reaction-diffusion equations; for such model, the dynamics in the neighbourhood of this bifurcation point can be divided into six categories, each of which is exactly demonstrated by the numerical simulations; and then according to this dynamical classification, a stable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution has been found...|$|R
