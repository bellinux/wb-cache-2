25|$|You're {{sitting in}} the stands {{and you can see}} he's a big guy, but when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{him for the first time}} face-to-face, I go, 'Wow, this is a big man.' He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a pretty good idea how to hit.|$|E
500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him and we did 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
2500|$|One day in 1977 [...] {{he ran a}} {{race for}} me at Calder. [...] <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him after he finished. He put his hand up to wave, {{and there was a}} {{powerful}} explosion. [...] A bolt of lightning came out of the sky and hit him.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1874: [...] "Another, if possible, {{still more}} {{beautiful}} day, after a slight frost. — After writing started at 11 with Beatrice to try & {{walk up to}} the falls of the Glassalt, which I had not done since 20 years! There was not a breath of wind & a very powerful sun. I managed to get up & was wonderfully little out of breath. Brown helped me up the steepest parts, which are rather trying. The falls were not particularly full, but always very fine. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the very top, just above, them, & rested a little on the heather. The descent was far easier, but the path was very rough in parts & I had recourse to Brown's strong arm to steady me. It is 4 miles to the top & back, & I felt quite proud, that I could accomplish it so well. — In the afternoon drove with Beatrice & Janie E. nearly as far as Birkhall & back, taking our tea at the Linn of Muich. A splendid frosty evening." [...] Likewise in 1877: [...] "Walked with Beatrice {{up to the top of}} the Glassalt falls, where the icicles where hanging ...|$|E
2500|$|Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for {{the first}} time at Mumbai's Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954, on Peck's {{stopover}} from a schedule at Sri Lanka after shooting for The Purple Plain. He knew of the [...] "Indian Star" [...] as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, he nodded and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged to you, Mr. Ascough," [...] he said. [...] "Yours, after all, is the {{common-sense}} {{view of the}} affair. If you like <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the station. <b>I</b> am going that way. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{stay and}} dine with Hortense; {{she will be}} glad of your company. I shall return in good time. We will have a little reading in the evening. The moon rises at half-past eight, and <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the rectory with you at nine. Do you agree?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> my {{ball and}} paused. I {{looked at the}} professor. He looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the last}} batch had {{disappeared}} {{with the last}} box <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him, and said, [...] "Now, Andrews, you take hat, we go Gaboon." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{heart beat}} rapidly as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the gate. How would the good lady {{who had done}} so much for Kate and myself receive me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One is {{as bad as}} the other," [...] Rupert said in {{a broken}} voice. [...] "This is awful, Easton. <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> your camp again. Would you mind seeing the colonel of his {{regiment}} or the officer of his troop, and find out what you can about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{as easy as}} easy," [...] {{declared}} the other. [...] "Tomorrow evening, in a new rig-out, <b>I</b> <b>walks</b> you <b>up</b> <b>to</b> your house and asks for you to show you to yourself. Of course, I'm sorry you ain't in, and perhaps we walks in to wait for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Barriere de l'Etoile, {{sufficiently}} dazed by {{my flight}} {{to have a}} pleasant doubt {{of the reality of}} everything about me; of the lively crowd, the overhanging trees, the performing dogs, the hobby-horses, the beautiful perspectives of shining lamps: the hundred and one enclosures, where the singing is, in gleaming orchestras of azure and gold, and where a star-eyed Houri comes round with a box for voluntary offerings. So, I pass to my hotel, enchanted; sup, enchanted; go to bed, enchanted; pushing back this morning (if it really were this morning) into the remoteness of time, blessing the South-Eastern Company for realising the Arabian Nights in these prose days, murmuring, as I wing my idle flight into the land of dreams, 'No hurry, ladies and gentlemen, going to Paris in eleven hours. It is so well done, that there really is no hurry!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Broadway. I saw a cop on the corner. The cops take kids up, women across, and men in. I {{went up to}} him.|$|E
60|$|I {{threw the}} {{pole and line}} away, and then Rectus and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the hotel. We forgot all about Celia, who was left to go home when she chose.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him. I {{took hold}} of him by the lapel of his coat. It was a dirty lapel, as I {{remember}} even now, but I didn't mind that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What does it matter, when {{my things}} are put up?' said the young man. 'There is no crowd at this moment; {{there will be}} cabins to spare. I'm waiting for a telegram--that will settle it. <b>I</b> just <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the club {{to see if it}} was come--they'll send it there because they think the house is closed. Not yet, but I shall go back in twenty minutes.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> at once <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the window}} of their car and knocked at it. Delora leaned forward and {{recognized}} me at once. His face, for a moment, seemed dark with anger. He let down the sash.|$|R
60|$|I {{was still}} arguing {{it back and}} forth, and getting no great clearness, when I came into the round-house and saw the Jacobite eating his supper under the lamp; and at that my mind was made up all in a moment. I have no credit by it; it was by no choice of mine, but as if by compulsion, that <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the table and {{put my hand on}} his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the oak-tree, {{and then}} I {{found that the}} bear was still firmly {{attached}} to it. His chain had been fastened loosely around the trunk; he had climbed up to the branch and pulled the chain with him.|$|E
6000|$|I {{dressed and}} drank several {{cups of the}} coffee, all the while [...] "thinking with my head," [...] as the Zulus say. Then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the kraal to see Umbezi, whom I found just {{coming out of his}} hut, yawning.|$|E
6000|$|The Amahagger captains did {{not seem}} pleased with this plan which I think was too bold for their fancy, and began to murmur together. Seeing that I must assert my {{authority}} at once, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them and said to their chief man, ...|$|E
6000|$|People {{have been}} paying a mighty price for tickets--as much as [...] fifteen guineas has been offered, I hear. <b>I</b> had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the [...] gates; the number of coaches {{struggling}} outside prevented my driving [...] near. It was {{as bad as the}} battle of Vitoria itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "The two boats {{landed at}} the same moment. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{straight}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Anabela and Fergus. Her eyes rested upon me for an instant; then she turned them, full of feeling and confidence, upon Fergus. I knew I could not speak, but I was desperate. In speech lay my only hope. I could not stand beside Fergus and challenge comparison {{in the way of}} beauty. Purely involuntarily, my larynx and epiglottis attempted to reproduce the sounds that my mind was calling upon my vocal organs to send forth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, hush!" [...] {{said the}} Paladin, {{breaking}} {{in with an}} air of disdain; [...] "the way you people talk, a person would think there's something heroic about standing up and facing down that poor remnant of a man. Why, it's nothing! There's small glory to be got in facing him down, I should say. Why, I wouldn't want any better fun than to face down a hundred like him. If he was to come along here now, <b>I</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him just as I am nowI wouldn't care if he had a thousand axesand say" ...|$|R
60|$|Not caring {{to go back}} to the train, I {{entered the}} waiting-room and took in all there was to be seen. At one end of the place was a news stand, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this to look at the picture papers that were displayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "With this {{sensible}} resolve <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Fieldhead {{one night}} last August. It {{was the very}} eve of my departure for Birmingham; for, you see, I wanted to secure Fortune's splendid prize. I had previously dispatched a note requesting a private interview. I found her at home, and alone.|$|E
60|$|The {{first person}} I {{met on the}} pier was Rectus. He had had his supper, and had come down to watch for me. I was so angry that I would not speak to him. He kept by my side, though, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the house, excusing himself for going off and leaving me.|$|E
5000|$|An {{eyewitness}} {{reported to}} TMZ that [...] "Tommy got it pretty bad." [...] The incident {{was confirmed by}} Palms Hotel and Casino public relations representative Larry Fink. MTV Host Sway Calloway said [...] "Tommy Lee was sitting by P-Diddy and Kid Rock just got off stage and from what <b>I</b> saw he <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Lee and just decked him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last night I dreamed I was in church," [...] he said. [...] "I {{thought it}} was full of people, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the aisle <b>to</b> your pew and set down, as unconcerned as a pig on ice. And then I found that I hadn't a stitch of clothes on--NOT ONE BLESSED STITCH. Now"-- Peter dropped his voice--"what is bothering me is this--would it be proper to tell a dream like that before the girls?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, content you, Sir Squire," [...] {{said the}} King. [...] "There are some dangers which {{when they are}} braved, disappear, and which yet, {{when there is an}} obvious and {{apparent}} dread of them displayed, become certain and inevitable. When <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> boldly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a surly mastiff, and caress him, it is ten to one I soothe him to good temper; if I show fear of him, he flies on me and rends me. I will be thus far frank with thee.--It concerns me nearly that this man returns not to his headlong master in a resentful humour. I run my risk, therefore. I have never shunned to expose my life for the weal of my kingdom. Follow me." ...|$|R
