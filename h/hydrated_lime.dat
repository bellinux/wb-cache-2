However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole.

40|$|Blended lime-cement mortars are {{commonly}} used in conservation practices {{even though they may}} show lack of adequate strength and durability for certain cement-lime compositions. This paper focuses on understanding the hardening reactions and their influence on the strength development, microstructure and porosity for the cement-lime mortars in various compositions. Mortars composed of 30 %, 50 % and 70 % ce-ment replacement with <b>lime</b> <b>hydrate</b> and <b>lime</b> putty by mass were studied. Cement hydration has been found to contribute to the early stage strength development while carbonation is mostly favoured after 3 days and con-tributes to the strength development until 180 days. The degree of carbonation is much more pronounced with increasing lime content and porosity of the mortars and the reaction is still in progress at 90 days. All the blended mortars revealed lower compressive and flexural strength than that of the reference cement mortar due to their lower cement content and higher porosity. Long-term compressive strength development has been achieved after 180 days while flexural strength for certain mortar compositions does not increase beyond 28 days. Unlike cement mortar, the mortars blended with <b>lime</b> <b>hydrate</b> and <b>lime</b> putty exhibit an elastic-plastic deformation before failure occurs, which is preferred for repair mortars to adapt to differential settlements and to allow more deformation under critical stresses in the masonry. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} is {{a composite}} material consisting of an asphalt binder and mineral aggregate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to develop a}} second generation in-duct sorbent injection technology as a cost-effective compliance option for the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Specific performance targets are 90 % SO{sub 2 } removal and 60 % sorbent utilization efficiency. After initial results indicated that the Advanced Coolside process had a potential of exceeding these targets, research focused on the Advanced Coolside process. For Task 4, Data Analysis and Computer Modeling, the objective was to develop two computer models. The first computer model would correlate sorbent properties with hydration parameters, while the second would correlate desulfurization performance with the sorbent properties. A two-level factorial program was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} selected hydration process variables on some of the physical and chemical properties of the hydrates produced and on their SO{sub 2 } reactivity. A bench-scale hydrator was used to convert quicklime samples to <b>hydrated</b> <b>limes</b> under controlled processing conditions. Two quicklimes were <b>hydrated</b> [...] Mississippi <b>Lime</b> and Black River Lime. Significant differences in physical properties of these hydrates were observed. However, no relationship between the measured physical properties and the SO{sub 2 } reactivity was observed. Within the scope of this work, SO{sub 2 } reactivity is not a function of quicklime source. When compared with commercial hydrates prepared from the same quicklime, the hydrates produced in the bench-scale unit showed significantly lower surface areas and SO{sub 2 } reactivities.
