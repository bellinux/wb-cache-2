40|$|An {{appreciation}} of the well-known common law ‘definition’ of charity leads to the conclusion that, although not {{referred to as the}} law of charity within China itself, the Law of Donation to Public Welfare Projects of the People’s Republic of China can be understood as having a similar operation to the common law of charity. This paper will examine that Law. First, however, it examines the centrally charitable spirit articulated in China’s oldest and most dominant philosophy, Confucianism. It also sets out briefly the history of the attempted realisation of a charitable spirit by the Chinese Communist party, in its combination of a modern socialist system with the influential traditional ideas of China society. The paper then analyses the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> of China’s public welfare project law, and uses a particular project, the Hope Project, as an important illustration of the practical operation of Chinese charity law...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis is the {{multilayered}} view of regional hospitals on their contractual relationship with health insurance companies. The thesis draws information from two case studies of regional hospitals in Central Bohemia. These case studies have allowed me to map {{the whole process of}} establishing a contractual relationship with health insurance companies from the first contact to the final conclusion of the contract for a particular year. Through mapping the process I have identified a number of problematic areas that are encountered when concluding contracts. Thesis has also concentrated on the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> of the payment regulation which, to a large extent, determines the final form of the contractual relationship. One of the goals of the thesis is the identification of key problems stemming from the parameters of the contractual relationship and payment mechanism. These problems are analyzed on the level of hospitals, individual specialized units, and in relation to the provision of health care to patients...|$|E

At the same time it is pointed out on the incompleteness of special legal norms, as well as its non-compliance with the principles set out by the general norms on easements.

40|$|Owing to {{the drastic}} {{development}} of the information and Internet technologies, large amount of information and documents can be easily accessed through the electronic network. In addition to the efficiency of document acquisition, another typical issue for document management is the document content extraction. In order to provide the critical contents of a document to the knowledge requester, a thesaurus indicating the keyword correlation is required for accurate content extraction. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic keyword correlation analysis based on the keyword frequency and keyword location of each document in the repository. In addition, by application of the keyword correlation, an approach for document keyword extraction is developed. A platform for establishment of enterprise knowledge center is also developed to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed methodologies. The algorithms explored in this research can be applied in the industry to reduce the reliance on the knowledge engineers or domain experts for thesaurus <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> document <b>content</b> extraction. In practice, the methodologies {{can be incorporated into}} the enterprise document/knowledge management systems for efficient and effective document searching, indexing <b>and</b> <b>content</b> recognition...|$|R

40|$|Low {{temperature}} at stand <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> high {{temperature at}} reproductive stage {{are involved in}} reduction of grain yield of spring maize. A field study was therefore conducted to evaluate different physiological strategies for improving performance of spring maize under temperature extremes. Seed priming and foliar spray with 3 % moringa leaf extract (MLE) and 100 mg L- 1 kinetin solution alone or in all possible combinations with each other at three growth stages (knee height, tasseling and grain filling stage) and hydropriming was compared with control. Seed priming plus foliar spray of MLE and kinetin significantly improved stand establishment especially under early sown crop as indicated by reduced mean emergence time (MET), improved emergence index (EI) and final emergence percentage (FEP). Similarly increased chlorophyll contents, crop growth rate, leaf area index, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, relative water <b>content</b> <b>and</b> decreased membrane permeability were recorded in both early and optimum sowing conditions in MLE priming plus foliar spray treatment. All these improvements were harvested {{in the form of}} increased yield and harvest index compared with control treatment. Overall crop sown at optimum time performed best but exogenous application of MLE through seed priming and foliar spray maximally improved the performance of early sown maize crop which is attributed more likely due to improved stand <b>establishment,</b> chlorophyll <b>and</b> phenolic <b>contents,</b> increased leaf area duration and grain filling period. It can be concluded that seed priming with MLE along with its foliar spray could increase production of maize under temperature extremes...|$|R

40|$|Acid sulfate soils (ASS) {{are one of}} the {{stressor}} factors that cause many mangrove restoration projects to fail. Achieving successful rehabilitation in an ASS affected area requires an understanding of the geochemical conditions that influence the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> growth of mangrove seedlings. This study evaluated the effect of tidal inundation on geochemical conditions on sub layer to better understand their impacts on the density, <b>establishment,</b> <b>and</b> growth of mangrove seedlings. This study also examined the geochemical conditions under which mangrove seedlings can establish naturally, and/or be replanted in abandoned aquaculture ponds. The study area was in an area of abandoned aquaculture ponds situated in the Mare District, adjacent to Bone Bay, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The pH, pHfox, redox potential, organic content, water soluble sulfate, SKCl, SPOS, and grain size of the soil from the sediment core at + 10 - 15 cm depth near roots were measured using. Pyrite analysis were conducted for the top and sub sediments. The density, <b>establishment,</b> <b>and</b> the relative root growth of Rhizophoraceae were also determined. Free tidal inundation at abandoned pond sites improved the sediment quality. The high density, <b>establishment,</b> <b>and</b> growth of mangrove seedlings were characterized by freely drained areas with a higher pH (field and oxidisable), lower organic <b>content,</b> <b>and</b> high proportion of silt/clay. Higher density and growth also correlated to reduced environments. Sulfur species did not influence the density, <b>establishment,</b> <b>and</b> growth of the seedlings directly. The supply of propagules from the mangrove stands, or access from good waterways were also important for seedlings to establish naturally...|$|R
