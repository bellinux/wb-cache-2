5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E

25|$|On 11 November 2013, former American {{ambassador}} to Bulgaria James Pardew {{was allowed to}} enter the premises of the occupied Sofia University. This raised eyebrows among the students opposed to the occupation, who demanded an explanation given that access had been denied to university administrators, academics and students not in favour of the occupiers' approach. The main spokesman for the occupying students Ivaylo Dinev claims that Pardew was not permitted to go inside the university building by student security (as the students were not fully convinced in the sincerity of his motives), but <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> to three of the student representatives inside the university premises.|$|E
25|$|While Zakharov <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> out {{on several}} key issues, she {{remained}} {{bound by the}} principles of party discipline. In 1988, she was critical of the proposals that became the Higher Education Contribution Scheme {{while they were in}} caucus, although she promptly dropped the matter when the majority supported the changes. This again occurred with planned price increases to various Medicare services in 1992, when Zakharov used her position as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to cut committee hearings short, to the chagrin of the opposition parties. She did, however, manage to win some small concessions through the committee's final report, and somewhat embarrassed Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe in the process.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 2014, it was {{reported}} by the San Antonio Express-News that Mark Davis met with officials {{from the city of}} San Antonio, Texas, to discuss the possibility of relocating the Raiders to San Antonio. Davis confirmed that he <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> with San Antonio city officials while visiting San Antonio to honor former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch's induction into a local Hall of Fame, but did not comment on whether he was considering relocation to San Antonio. If the Raiders had relocated to San Antonio, the Alamodome would almost certainly have been used as a temporary home until a new NFL stadium was built. The Raiders decided against moving to San Antonio, first proposing unsuccessfully to return to its previous home in Los Angeles, then ultimately receiving permission to relocate to Las Vegas by 2020.|$|E

25|$|After India, Grant toured Burma, Siam (where Grant {{met with}} King Chulalongkorn), Singapore, and Cochinchina (Vietnam). Leaving Hong Kong, the Grants visited Canton, Shanghai, and Peking, China, where he criticized the autocratic {{attitude}} of Westerners living in China toward the Chinese, {{comparing it to}} that of former slave owners toward freedmen striving for independence. He declined to ask {{for an interview with}} the Guangxu Emperor, but <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> with the head of government, Prince Gong, and Li Hongzhang, a leading general. They discussed China's dispute with Japan over the Ryukyu Islands, and Grant agreed to serve as a mediator saying “any course short of national humiliation or national destruction is better than war.”. After crossing over to Japan on Richmond and meeting the Emperor Meiji, Grant, keeping his word, tried to convince Japan to make peace with the Chinese suggesting the formation of a joint commission to settle the disputed territory. Although the commission never materialized, Grant's on spot diplomacy diffused the situation. Grant became the first ex-president to engage in personal diplomacy abroad. Japan having the superior military, annexed the disputed islands a few weeks after Grant left the country.|$|E

However, not realizing with whom she was speaking, Samantha mistakenly hung up after only a brief conversation.

[...] Again {{in an interview with}} ONE News, Stollery reiterated {{that he was going to}} retain rights to [...] "ScienTOMogy", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call.

500|$|This {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jon Vitti, his second writing credit of the series since joining {{the staff at the}} beginning of the seventh season.

The episode marked Amy Ryan's last physical appearance on the series, although she <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> in [...] "Goodbye, Michael". Ryan later said in an interview with New York that [...] "The script was so sweet anyway that it made us all have a good cry" [...] especially adding the fact that it was her final appearance. She also expressed her confidence that the series could survive without Carell and that it was the right move for him to leave. Vitti later submitted the episode for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but it was not nominated.|$|E

500|$|Determined {{not to use}} any big Hollywood names, King {{looked at}} many European actors before {{settling}} on British actor Rupert Friend. They were aware of him from the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice. Vallée noted, [...] "I had an image of Albert in my mind, before we cast Rupert, and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he was just right. He {{had a very good}} understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right, with the accent and his deportment. He really looks the part, he looks so romantic!" [...] Co-producer Dennis O'Sullivan called Friend [...] "our Scarlett O'Hara search". They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her. Friend's height (6ft 1in) also played a factor in their choice. Friend believed [...] "Albert was a true unsung hero. A great reformer, a doting husband and father, a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty." [...] The actor also thought their relationship was not [...] "a gooey love story"; rather, their arguments showed it [...] "wasn't an easy road by any means". Friend strove to immerse himself in the role, and learned the prince's particular characteristics, such as the way he rode a horse, walked, and played the piano. He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent, with the intention of [...] "put in as much German as possible, because Victoria and Albert <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> German to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed [...] "not surprising", West stated: [...] "He tells Bailey that it's her {{that will eventually}} be Chief when she’s ready.

While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they <b>did</b> <b>speak</b> to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and maybe a little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he <b>did</b> <b>speak,</b> was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E
