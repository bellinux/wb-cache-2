40|$|Cotton, {{which is}} grown for its fiber and oil, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and strategic crops in the world, especially in Iran. This study was done to evaluate the effects of different levels of soil moisture and <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients on quantitative and qualitative traits of cotton. Tests were done at the agricultural research station of Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch, in a split plot layout with three replications in 2009. Farm irrigation treatments were as follows; irrigation after 80 and 160 mm evaporation from evaporation pan class "A" were set as the main factors and <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients; control (pure water spray), two and three <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients were set as sub-factors. To assess the effects of treatments during the growing season of female cottonseed plants’ germination parameters, seeds from F 1 generation were replanted in both the farm and the laboratory in the following year (2010) and correlated tests were done. According to results, irrigation after 80 mm evaporation increased seed oil percentage up to 16 % compared to irrigation after 160 mm evaporation. Results for seed protein percentage, recorded a 17 % increase in the irrigation treatment of 160 mm evaporation over the irrigation treatment after 80 mm evaporation. Irrigation during female parents’ growing season had significant effects on percentage and rate of germination, seedling fresh and dry weights, shoot length and seed vigor. For example, in the farm germination test, the irrigation treatment of 80 mm evaporation increased germination percentage and rate of germination by 14 % and 17 %, respectively. Almost, similar results were observed for <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients. The highest germination percentage (91. 67 %) and rate of germination (2. 115) were linked to the treatment of three <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients; meanwhile, the lowest amounts 84. 17 % and 1. 755 % were related to the control. The interaction of irrigation regimes and <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients significantly affected the rate of germination at 5 % probability level in the farm germination tests. The highest rate of germination (2. 267) was recorded for the irrigation treatment of 80 mm evaporation with three <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of micronutrients, although the lowest amount (1. 520) was recorded in irrigation after 160 mm evaporation in the control...|$|R

The insect pests of vanilla include beetles and weevils that attack the flower, caterpillars, snakes, and slugs that damage the tender parts of shoot, flower buds, and immature fruit, and grasshoppers that affect cutting shoot tips.

50|$|Controlling Prosopis spp is a {{challenging}} task. One method {{that is often}} used is mechanical control. This can be effective with high mortality rates if stems are cut at least 20 cm underground. Another method is {{through the application of}} herbicides and this is done on an individual plant basis. Basal application is effective to Prosopis spp of all sizes while <b>foliar</b> <b>application</b> is best for plants smaller than 1.5 m. Another physical option for control is through fires. Some species of mesquite are fire sensitive while others are fire tolerant. For those that are fire sensitive this method can be highly effective but those that are fire tolerant require hot and intense fires to be effective. In Australia scientists are trying biological control methods. They have introduced multiple insects but the most effective in causing high population level impact is the leaf tying moth (Evippe spp). The most recommended method for managing Prosopis, both in native and introduced ranges, is by targeting large amounts of plants either through herbicide or physical removal.

50|$|Chemical control may be {{achieved}} {{to some extent}} by <b>foliar</b> <b>application</b> {{with a number of}} herbicides, although their use is much more efficacious in highly-disturbed situations, like agricultural monocultures or urban and suburban gardens, than in complex settings, like forests and well-established meadows or prairies. Timing herbicide applications to the earliest spring may help to better protect native or desirable plants in the same locations as garlic mustard is generally active earlier than most other plants in northern temperate climates, one of the reasons it can generally outcompete native plants and displace them. However, there are native and desirable plants that are active even before garlic mustard is, and/or {{at the same time in}} early spring, such as flowers from the genera Pulsatilla and Helleborus of the family Ranunculaceae. Some native and desirable plants also are evergreen and thus vulnerable to foliar and post-emergent herbicides at all times. Chemical control methods that involve heavy equipment or human trampling can compact soils, affecting all plants negatively. Such methods can disturb wildlife and chemical solutions may cause chemical pollution such as tainted water through runoff. All non-biological methods of control must be repeated for 2-5 years to be effective—as most infestations occur in sites where a considerable seed bank has been established. Those will continue to germinate for over a decade. Surviving roots regrow and produce new seed pods, enabling the infestation to potentially be quickly reestablished. Continual reintroduction of garlic mustard to areas where it has been eradicated is also highly likely until an effective biological control situation is established, as the long-lived seeds are produced in great quantities and are readily distributed by animals and human activity.|$|E

Farmers continue to search for ways to increase soybean yields, such as applying micronutrients and using <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of fertilizer. Although micronutrients are just as essential to plant growth as macronutrients, past research has indicated most Iowa soils can supply the micronutrient needs of soybeans...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{application}} of DBCP (l, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane) and <b>foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of oxamyl (methyl N',N'-dimethyl-N-[(methylcarbamoyl) oxy]-l-thiooxamimidate) were compared {{for control of}} Tylenchulus semipenetrans in a grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) orchard, DBCP reduced nematode populations and increased fruit growth rate, fruit size at harvest, and yield compared to the untreated controls in the 2 years following treatments. <b>Foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of oxamyl reduced nematode populations and increased fruit growth rate slightly the first year, {{but not in the}} second. <b>Foliar</b> <b>applications</b> of oxamyl did not improve control attained by DBCP alone. Soil {{application of}} aldicarb [2 -methyl- 2 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde-O-(methylcarbamoyl) oxime] or DBCP to an orange (C. sinensis) orchard reduced T. semipenetrans populations in the 3 years tested and increased yield in 1 of 3 years. Aldicarb treatment reduced fruit damage caused by the citrus rust mite, Phyllocoptruta oleivora. Aldicarb, applied at 5. 7 or 11. 4 kg/ha, by disk incorporation or chisel injection, was equally effective in controlling nematodes, improving yields, fruit size, and external quality. In a grapefruit orchard, chisel-applied aldicarb reduced nematode populations and rust mite damage and increased yields in both years and increased fruit size in one year. The 11. 4 -kg/ha rate was slightly more effective than the 5. 7 -kg/ha rate. Aldicarb appears to be an adequate substitute for DBCP for nematode control in Texas citrus orchards and well-suited to an overall pest management system for Texas citrus...|$|R
