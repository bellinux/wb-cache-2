Existing models for viscosity prediction are limited by data, especially at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Studies show that the predicted viscosities of natural gases using the current correlation equations are about 15 % higher than the corresponding measured viscosities at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This project proposes to develop a viscosity prediction model for natural gases at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The project shows that commercial gas viscosity measurement devices currently available suffer {{from a variety of}} problems and do not give reliable or repeatable results.

50|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} or c-BN was first {{synthesized}} in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf at General Electric, {{shortly after the}} synthesis of diamond. The general process for c-BN synthesis is the dissolution of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in a solvent-catalyst, usually alkali or alkaline earth metals or their nitrides, followed by spontaneous nucleation of c-BN under <b>high</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> (HPHT) conditions. The yield of c-BN is lower and substantially slower compared to diamond's synthetic route due to the complicated intermediate steps.
