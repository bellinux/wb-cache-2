40|$|Hertzian {{indentation}} {{has been}} used to determine the surface residual stress levels in brittle materials. In this method, a hard sphere is pressed into the surface of the material: at a critical load a preexisting surface-breaking crack in the neighborhood of the contact will propagate. There is a threshold load below which no such crack, of whatever size, can be propagated. The presence of a residual stress in the surface will lead to a shift in this threshold load. The effects of residual stresses on the minimum load to produce Hertzian fracture are predicted for alumina and glass, assuming that the variation of the residual stress over the length of the crack is small. Two methods of analysis (one approximate, one more general) are presented that enable the residual stress to be calculated from the shift in threshold load; the only <b>further</b> <b>information</b> <b>required</b> is a knowledge of the radius of the sphere, the elastic constants of the sphere and substrate, and also the fracture toughness of the substrate (or use of a stress-free specimen as a reference). No measurement of any crack length is necessary. Experimental results are presented for the residual stress levels determined in glass strengthened by ion exchange. Indenting balls of a variety of materials with a range of elastic mismatch to the glass substrate were used, so as to evaluate the effects of elastic mismatch and interfacial frictional tractions on the results obtained. The results obtained by Hertzian indentation are consistent with residual stress levels determined by differential surface refractometry. We also present results on alumina specimens with induced surface stresses...|$|E

The mechanical properties of the ear-drum and attached structures are very poorly known, particularly with respect to isotropy, uniformity and damping. A historical review of observations of ear-drum vibration patterns shows general agreement that at low frequencies the displacements of the manubrium are smaller than those of the surrounding drum.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} carried out in which 27 and 23 {{patients}} respectively with renal space-occupying lesions were assessed by different techniques and the results compared. Instead of proceeding to renal arteriography after the lesion had been found on urography, radionuclide and ultrasound scanning were used in the first study to clarify the nature of the lesions, while in the second study computed tomography was used as well. Results were good with all three methods, although ultrasonography and radionuclide scanning cannot resolve lesions of under 2 cm in diameter and the radiation dose with computed tomography is similar to that used in renal arteriography. Probably the best method of evaluating renal space-occupying lesions after urography is to use both ultrasound and radionuclide scanning.

If a lesion is detected in the foetal mouth or neck, there may be compromise of the foetal airway. The ex-utero intrapartum (EXIT) procedure has recently been developed to allow lifesaving foetal surgery to be performed during delivery of such cases whilst relying on placental support. Detailed antenatal assessment is essential when planning the EXIT procedure, and modern imaging modalities may be implemented. We illustrate this by reporting a rare case of enteric duplication cyst arising {{from the base of the}} tongue, which was detected on routine antenatal ultrasound scan. Subsequent imaging using foetal MRI and colour Doppler ultrasound reassured us that the foetal airway was patent, and an EXIT procedure was avoided...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{is increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} component of global change that could have a wide range of impacts on marine organisms, the ecosystems they live in, and the goods and services they provide humankind. Assessment of these potential socio-economic impacts requires integrated efforts between biologists, chemists, oceanographers, economists and social scientists. But because ocean acidification is a new research area, significant knowledge gaps are preventing economists from estimating its welfare impacts. For instance, economic data on the impact of ocean acidification on significant markets such as fisheries, aquaculture and tourism are very limited (if not non-existent), and non-market valuation studies on this topic are not yet available. Our paper summarizes the current understanding of future OA impacts and sets out what <b>further</b> <b>information</b> is <b>required</b> for economists to assess socio-economic impacts of ocean acidification.
