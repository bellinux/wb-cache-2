5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the Muslim light cavalry could be effectively used against the heavy and less mobile Byzantine cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> assist in making anti-war films.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{lead the}} U.S. into the war; his 1937 Quarantine Speech denouncing {{aggression}} by Italy and Japan had met mixed responses. Welles felt freer in this regard, looking towards postwar border {{issues and the}} establishment of a U.S.-led international body that could intervene in such disputes. Roosevelt saw Welles's stronger public statements as experiments that would test the public mood in regard to U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Ross and Emily's {{marriage}} was originally planned to last, but Helen Baxendale <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> remain in America while pregnant. The writers could not script a convincing story for why Emily {{would not be}} seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written {{out in the next}} season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere.|$|E

Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E

When he {{received}} the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award {{under pressure from the}} government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> accept the Nobel Prize in Literature, as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past. However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

In view of the preparations for the Somme offensive, Haig <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> divert more forces than were necessary. Support was limited {{to a number of}} additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. It was suggested that the next counterattack be carried out with the infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E

5|$|Discovered by Alex Gordon as an unproduced {{screenplay}} by Hollywood writer Frank Quattrocchi, The Projected Man {{was directed by}} Ian Curteis; {{it would be the}} first theatrical film that he would direct. However, due to his lack of experience, he ran into several problems during filming. As the film fell behind schedule and the budget kept increasing, he was fired during the film's final stages. Producer John Croydon replaced him; however, Croydon remained uncredited as the producers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> publicise the problems which had occurred on set.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a liberal}} agitation, pro-Greek and {{inspired}} {{by what was}} then happening in that country, began to develop in France. The longer France waited, the more delicate her position vis-Ã -vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{received}} the final {{part of his}} father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> serve the Habsburg Empire because {{of the mixture of}} races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{recruits}} to Manhattan Project's Los Alamos National Laboratory, arriving in March 1943. He became acting head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) Division. There was concern amongst the project leadership about Kennedy, as he was only 26 years old at the time. An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto. Thomas agreed to co-ordinate the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> move to New Mexico. Despite his youth, Kennedy officially became CM Division leader in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The anonymous author of A Certaine Relation says that the family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.|$|E
5|$|Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in}} the U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
