5|$|The Ka-band {{subsystem}} {{was used}} for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft Ka-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. Ka-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> antenna to a single amplifier. If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost. The Ka downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the Ka-band capability {{of one of the}} SDST transponders has already failed, (and the other might have the same problem) JPL decided to halt all Ka-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.|$|E

30|$|The main {{advantage}} of the <b>higher</b> <b>gain</b> priority over the random selection priority is that the former allows for {{the best use of}} the communication channel. However, <b>higher</b> <b>gain</b> priority reduces the chance of users with a single antenna to choose the subchannel first. Hence, when <b>higher</b> <b>gain</b> priority is employed, users with a single transmit antenna are expected to receive a smaller gain compared with the gain observed by users with two transmit antennas.|$|R

The <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> antenna was used as transmit-only at 8.4GHz, the medium-gain and low gain antennas transmit at 8.4GHz and receive at 7.2GHz, and all three antennas operate with right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) radiation. One {{of each of these}} antennas was mounted {{on the front of the}} probe facing the Sun, and one of each was mounted to the back of the probe facing away from the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Noise: Amplifiers {{generate}} random voltage at {{the output}} {{even when there}} is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.|$|E

50|$|An {{antenna array}} can achieve <b>higher</b> <b>gain</b> (directivity), {{that is a}} {{narrower}} beam of radio waves, than could be achieved by a single antenna.

Some antenna arrays (such as military phased array radars) are composed of thousands of individual antennas. Arrays {{can be used to}} achieve <b>higher</b> <b>gain,</b> to give path diversity (also called MIMO) which increases communication reliability, to cancel interference from specific directions, to steer the radio beam electronically to point in different directions, and for radio direction finding (RDF).|$|R

25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{electronic}} analog computers contain {{anywhere from}} a few to a hundred or more operational amplifiers ("op amps"), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are {{a particular type of}} feedback amplifier with very <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of op amps in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, op amps with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{downlink}} signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control {{fuel on board}} the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft {{would no longer be}} able to maneuver to keep its <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the X-band TWTAs, because when one of them was operating, this kept this part of the pipework warm enough.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and less expensive to get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and less expensive to get <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E
50|$|The CD gain {{settings}} can {{be adjusted}} in most cases. However, a compromise has to be found: with <b>high</b> <b>gains</b> {{it is easier to}} approach a distant target, with low gains this takes longer. <b>High</b> <b>gains</b> hinder the selection of targets, whereas low gains facilitate this process. The operating systems Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X and Xorg have implemented mechanisms in order to adapt the CD gain to the user's needs, e.g. the CD gain increases when the user's movement velocity increases.|$|R

25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is <b>high</b> <b>gain.</b> The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relative}} {{certainty of}} the measurements and current state estimate {{is an important}} consideration, and {{it is common to}} [...] discuss the response of the filter in terms of the Kalman filter's gain. The Kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate, and can be [...] "tuned" [...] to achieve particular performance. With a <b>high</b> <b>gain,</b> the filter places more weight on the most recent measurements, and thus follows them more responsively. With a low gain, the filter follows the model predictions more closely. At the extremes, a <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> close to one will result in a more jumpy estimated trajectory, while low gain close to zero will smooth out noise but decrease the responsiveness.|$|E

In a broadside array the dipoles can again be arranged colinear (end to end), or side by side, or both. The antennas are then fed in the same phase. This creates greater gain in the direction perpendicular to the antennas, at the expense of most other directions. Unfortunately that also means that the direction opposite the desired direction also has a <b>high</b> <b>gain,</b> whereas <b>high</b> <b>gain</b> is usually desired in one single direction. The power which is wasted in the reverse direction, however, can be recovered using a large planar reflector, as is accomplished in the reflective array antenna, increasing the gain in the desired direction by another 3nbsp&dB ...|$|E
