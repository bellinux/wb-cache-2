40|$|We study {{distress}} risk premia {{around a}} bankruptcy reform that shifts bargaining power in financial distress from debtholders to shareholders. We {{find that the}} reform reduces risk factor loadings and returns of distressed stocks. The reform effect is stronger for firms with lower firm-level shareholder bargaining power. An increase in credit spreads of riskier relative to safer firms, in particular for firms with lower firm-level shareholder bargaining power, confirms a shift in bargaining power from bondholders to shareholders. Out-of-sample tests reveal that {{a reversal of the}} reform’s effect leads to a reversal of factor loadings and returns. (JEL G 12, G 14, G 33, K 39) The nature of Chapter 11 makes bargaining an important factor in distressed reorganizations, both in formal bankruptcy and in out-of-court renegotiations. Gilson, John, and Lang (1990), Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein (1994), Franks and Torous (1994), and Betker (1995) provide empirical evidence that bargaining power of equityholders in debt restructurings affects the incidence of formal and informal reorganizations, deviations from absolute priority, and <b>debt</b> <b>recoveries.</b> Consistent with Hart and Moore (1994), who sho...|$|R

40|$|First passage models, where {{corporate}} assets {{undergo a}} random walk and default occurs if the assets fall below a threshold, provide an attractive framework for modeling the default process. Recently such {{models have been}} generalized to allow a fluctuating default threshold or equivalently a fluctuating total recovery fraction $R$. For a given company {{a particular type of}} <b>debt</b> has a <b>recovery</b> fraction $R_i$ that is greater or less than $R$ depending on its level of subordination. In general the $R_i$ are functions of $R$ and since, in models with a fluctuating default threshold, the probability of default depends on $R$ there are correlations between the recovery fractions $R_i$ and the probability of default. We find, using a simple scenario where debt of type $i$ is subordinate to debt of type $i- 1 $, the functional dependence $R_i(R) $ and explore how correlations between the default probability and the recovery fractions $R_i(R) $ influence the par spreads for credit default swaps.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis, emerging markets have seen a significantly higher degree of volatility in their capital flows. At the onset, all countries experienced sudden stops and increases in risk premia. Following this initial period of uncertainty, financial markets began to differentiate between the countries, and while most developing regions have regained access to both debt and equity issuance, the pace of recovery of capital inflows has been particularly remarkable for some countries. Given the likelihood that the prevailing low interest rates in the developed world will remain for some time to come, and given the prospects of faster growth in emerging markets, it is likely that some emerging markets will experience significant surges in capital flows in the near future.

40|$|Maintaining and {{developing}} {{the area of}} freedom, security and justice is a major objective of theEuropean Community, which guarantees the free movement of persons. As a result of litigations regardingthe applications with a reduced value arising among physical or legal persons, it was felt the need for acommunity legislation that would guarantee identical conditions, both for creditors and debtors throughoutthe entire European Union territory. The European procedure regarding the <b>debts</b> <b>recovery</b> of reducedvalue facilitates the access to justice and it is characterized by simplifying and expediting the settling of thetransboundary litigations, reducing costs, the recognition and execution of the court order in a MemberState given in another Member State. This procedure is available to litigants {{as an alternative to}} theprocedures provided by the laws of Member States. The Regulation (EC) no. 861 / 2007 establishing aEuropean procedure regarding the applications with reduced value applies in civil and commercial matters inthe transboundary cases, regardless the nature of the court when the application value, without taking intoaccount the interest, expenditures and other costs, does not exceed 2000 Euro at the time of receiving theapplication form by the competent court. This procedure does not apply to revenue, customs oradministrative matters or in regard to state responsibility for acts or omissions in exercising the publicauthority, and other matters specifically referred to in the Regulation. A cause is transboundary in naturewhen one of the parties has its habitual residence in a Member State, other than the one where the courtreceives such application. The proper procedure of application resolution for the <b>recovery</b> of <b>debts</b> withreduced value is governed by the rules of procedural law of the Member State in which the proceedings areconducted, and the execution of court of law is made by state legislation in which it takes place. TheRegulation expressly provides that the court order in this matter can not be, in any form, the subject ofreexamination, in the State member in which its execution is requested. As regards the linguistic regime,the application will be written in the language or in one of the procedure languages of the court; the costsare incurred by the losing party in the application. But the court will not grant the party that won thelawsuit the expenses that were not necessary or the ones that have a disproportionate value in relation tothe application...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new formulae for the {{valuation of}} convertible debt and shows {{how it can}} be rational for convertible holders to convert not only when the debtor's equity value increases, ut also when the debtor approaches distress. Even if debt cannot be enegotiated, "conversion in distress" averts costly bankruptcy. If ankruptcy costs are high, neglecting "conversion in distress" may ntail a significant undervaluation of subordinated convertibles. Conversion in distress" makes convertible debt less sensitive than on-convertible <b>debt</b> to the <b>recovery</b> value of assets in bankruptcy.
