Effect of {{environmental}} temperatures on infection with Mycobacterium marinum (Balnei) of mice {{and a number}} of poikilothermic species. J.

In artificial medium (7 H 9 broth) M. marinum grew most rapidly from 25 to 35 C, with generation times of 4 to 6 hr. At 37 C, the generation time was 14 hr; at 20 C, 20 hr; and, at 15 C and lower, little growth was observed. In mice, <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> were found to be 36. 5 to 37. 3 C at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At an environmental temperature of 34 C, they averaged 39. 1 C; at 37 C they averaged 40. 2 C. Foot-pad temperatures were within a few degrees of ambient temperatures from 10 to 34 C. In mouse foot-pad infections, the optimal environmental temperature for infection was 20 C, and the generation time of the infecting bacilli at this environmental temperature was about 15 hr. Intravenously inoculated mice developed peripheral infections of nose, feet, and tail at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At these temperatures, they had severe pneumonic involvement, and the mice at lower temperatures tended to succumb most rapidly to systemic infection. At 34 C, the intravenously infected mice did not develop peripheral infections and there was no pulmonary involvement. Young opossums, whose <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> are only 34 to 36 C, were inoculated in the foot-pad and intravenously. Foot-pad infection developed without systemic involvement. Bats, which assume environmental temperature when at rest, were inoculated in the foot-pad. Foot-pad infections were observed but no systemic disease. The bats could be maintained for only short periods, however. Poikilothermic animals were studied. <b>Deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> were found to be nearly identical with ambient temperature. A total of 50 species of reptiles, amphibians, and fish were infected intraperitoneally in a number of experiments, as animals were available.

In experiments to determine the optimal environmental temperature for infection, cricket frogs (Acris), American chameleons (Anolis), young garter snakes (Thamnophis), and the young of three species of turtles were inoculated intraperitoneally. The optimal temperature for infection was found to be 30 C in each case, and infections at 20 C were definitely slower. The generation time of M. marinum in American chameleons at 30 C was about 19 hr; at 20 C, it was about 46 hr; and, at 10 C, the bacilli did not apparently multiply.

40|$|Objective To assess {{circadian}} {{characteristics of}} spontaneous {{physical activity and}} <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> in narcoleptic patients.   Methods Fourteen narcoleptic patients and 14 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled. Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) was recorded, followed by standard multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Then all subjects were required to wear the actigraphy (actiwatch) at home with continuous monitoring of spontaneous physical activity for 1 - 2 weeks and complete the daily sleep record. All subjects' deep body temperatures were measured at 20 time points.   Results In comparison with control subjects, PSG data suggested narcoleptic patients had significantly longer time in bed at night (P = 0. 008), decreased sleep efficiency (P = 0. 001), increased awakenings (P = 0. 000), extended wake time after sleep onset (P = 0. 000) and sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP,  P = 0. 002). MSLT data suggested decreased average sleep latency (P = 0. 000) and increased SOREMPs (P = 0. 000). Actigraphy data suggested increased nocturnal activity and nocturnal activity per hour (P = 0. 000, for all), decreased daytime activity and daytime activity per hour (P = 0. 000, for all) and increased nocturnal activity per hour/daytime activity per hour (P = 0. 000, for all). The <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> in both groups showed significant circadian rhythms.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the physiological strain on industrial workers under thermal stress on extended shifts. To continuously measure <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperatures,</b> heart rates, fluid intake, changes in hydration state and physical fatigue {{in order to}} establish acceptable levels of physiological strain. To develop a rational heat stress index compatible with these limits. To design working-in-heat protocols for a self-paced workforce. Methods: A series of studies was conducted over 77 shifts on a group of approximately 50 male volunteers working in thermally stressful environments. Continuously- recorded <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperatures,</b> heart rates, fluid consumption, urinary specific gravity and physical fatigue were measured and recorded. A new field protocol was developed to assess physical fatigue over the working shift. An original methodology was developed to allow any heat stress index to be assessed on a comparative basis with any other index. A review of the commonly used occupational heat stress indices was conducted. A new rational heat stress index was developed, based on existing biophysical relationships and recommended physiological strain limits of <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperature</b> and sweat rate. New protocols designed for self-paced work incorporating the significant risk factors for heat illness were developed and implemented in a workforce of approximately 2000 workers exposed to heat stress. The previous protocols used a shortened shift as the primary intervention to protect worker health. The subsequent protocols removed the shortened shift and replaced this with a range of other interventions. <b>Deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperature,</b> heart rate, fluid consumption, hydration state and fatigue were measured before and after the changes in protocols. Results: Comparisons of heat stress indices confirmed the wide divergence in guidance provided by many of the commonly-used indices in terms of acceptable working environments. It also highlighted a number of serious shortcomings in the most widely-used indices, especially WBGT and ISO 7933. A new, rational heat stress index called Thermal Work Limit (TWL) was developed. This included development of a computer model incorporating key thermal physiological parameters (<b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperature,</b> mean skin temperature, sweat rate, skin wettedness). There was no increase in heat stress (as indicated by average workplace environmental conditions), <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperature,</b> mean heart rate, or changes in hydration status after the changes in protocols. Average environmental conditions were severe (WBGT 30. 9 ° C, sd 2. 0 ° C, range 25. 7 - 35. 2 ° C). Environmental conditions in the study were much hotter than those considered acceptable under standards such as the ACGIH. The results showed that miners regularly exceeded those limits allowable under most current indices in terms of maximum <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperature</b> (avg 38. 3 ° C, std dev 0. 4 ° C), maximum temperature rise (1. 4 ° C, 0. 4 ° C) and maximum heat storage (431 kJ, 163 kJ), without reporting any symptoms of heat illness. A significant component of the observed elevated core temperatures was due to the normal circadian rhythm, which was measured at 0. 9 ° C (std dev 0. 2 ° C). Evidence was found that workers "self-pace" when under thermal stress. Fluid intake averaged 0. 8 l/h during exposure (sd 0. 3 l/h, range 0. 3 - 1. 5 1 /h). Average urinary specific gravity at start-, mid- and end of shift was 1. 0251, 1. 0248 and 1. 0254 respectively; the differences between start and mid-shift, mid and end-shift, and start and end-shift were not significant. However, a majority of workers were coming to work in a moderately hypohydrated state (urinary specific gravity avg 1. 024, std dev 0. 0059). Involuntary dehydration was not found to occur in the study group. This is in contrast to several other studies and some of the leading heat stress standards, which are {{based on the premise that}} workers are unable to maintain their hydration status when working in the heat, even when their fluid consumption is equal to their sweat rate. Continuous heart rates measured over a shift (avg 103 bpm, 14 % of shifts exceeding avg 110 bpm, 5 % exceeding avg 120 bpm) were in excess of those allowable under most current indices On average, workers experienced a peak 10 - minute heart rate of 140 bpm and a peak 30 -minute heart rate of 130 bpm during their shifts. There was a significant increase in fatigue in the first half of the working shift (P= 0. 001), with workers on average showing a significant recovery in the second half of their shift (p= 0. 04). Conclusions: Current heat stress indices provide little common agreement as to acceptable levels of thermal strain or stress for workers, at equivalent levels of environmental stress. IS 07933 is seriously flawed and the ACGIH WBGT guidelines are too conservative for acclimatised workers and are unlikely to become widely adopted by industries with well-acclimatised workers. Many of the existing indices show internal inconsistencies. Most of the physiological heat strain limits used in existing rational heat stress indices (in terms of <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> core <b>temperature</b> and heart rate) are conservative for self-paced, acclimatise d, non-dehydrating male workers. Involuntary dehydration is not unavoidable when acclimatised workers are exposed to thermal stress. Heat stress standards should not limit heat exposure durations for self- paced workers who have access to water on the basis of an unavoidable body water loss. Physical fatigue does occur in workers under heat stress on extended shifts; however, most workers show a significant increase in fatigue in the first half of their shift; whereas data indicates self-paced workers undergo significant recovery in terms of fatigue in the second half of the shift. As the heat exposures in this study cover a wide range of temperatures, humidity levels, wind speeds, body morphology and VO 2 max, these conclusions are applicable to most thermally stressful settings involving well-informed, well-acclimatised and self-paced male workers. The major category of work type not covered by this study is that of workers in fully-encapsulated (vapour-barrier) protective clothing. In addition, this study examined acute effects of heat stress and strain, not effects that might only be manifest with chronic exposure to heat...|$|R

For example, minimum finger temperature (Tfi,min) was lower, and the maximum finger temperature (Tfi,max) was greater during CIVD when Tb was elevated, and the onset time of the CIVD response was reduced at higher Tsk. Question remain, though, {{about the influence of}} forearm tissue temperature on CIVD at a given Tsk and Tb. On two different occasions, eleven healthy male subjects pre-conditioned their forearm tissue at two different water temperatures (Tw), 20 and 38 °C, until steady state forearm muscle temperature was achieved. After the conditioning period (129 ± 15 and 85 ± 15 min for 20 and 38 °C, respectively), the fingers of the conditioned forearm were immersed in a 5 °C water bath for 30 min. During finger immersion, Tsk and Tb were similar at each forearm skin temperature (Tsk = 34. 3 ± 0. 6 °C, Tb = 36. 8 ± 0. 2 °C), but temperature 3 cm deep into the forearm’s flexor digitorum profundus muscle differed significantly, averaging 23. 6 ± 1. 7 °C when Tw was 20 ºC and 36. 7 ± 0. 6 °C when Tw was 38 °C. Arterial blood temperature in the radial artery measured at the wrist averaged 28. 2 ± 2. 5 and 35. 6 ± 0. 9 °C for the 20 and 38 °C conditions, respectively (p < 0. 05). The two forearm conditions caused significant differences in all the CIVD parameters during the 30 min immersion in 5 °C water. During the 38 ºC condition, the onset time for the CIVD was faster and the average, maximal and minimal Tfi were higher than during the 20 ºC condition. We concluded that a low forearm tissue temperature impedes the CIVD response despite normal Tsk and Tb, possibly by decreasing the temperature of the arterial blood to the fingers. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Deep</b> {{accidental}} hypothermia (<b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> below 28 °C) is {{rare and}} has a high mortality rate. Successful resuscitation usually occurs in the young, but a prompt intervention using a portable extracorporeal cardiopulmonary circulation device can also provide a good outcome for older persons. Case presentation We report the successful resuscitation of an 82 -year-old male from deep accidental hypothermia using portable extracorporeal circulation in the emergency department. Conclusion This successful resuscitation of an 82 -year-old patient demonstrates that a prompt intervention by a medical team that trains together, using a mobile cardiopulmonary bypass device via a percutaneous approach, can potentially provide good outcomes for all victims of deep accidental hypothermia, both in the operating suites and the emergency department. </p...|$|R
40|$|PhDWhen {{the head}} was cooled for 30 minutes, sublingual {{temperature}} fell {{by as much as}} 4. 45 Â°C below oesophageal which remained steady. Insulation of the head prevented this local cooling. There was an increased flow of cold parotid saliva when {{the head was}} exposed to cold and this appeared to be the major factor which depressed sublingual temperature. The estimation of <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> from sublingual readings is meaningful only if precautions are taken to prevent local cooling of the head. Local cooling has been shown to depress temperature measured from the external auditory canal. A portable device (The Zero Gradient Aural Thermometer) was developed and used to measure external auditory canal temperature keeping the outer ear, monitored by a second thermistor, at the same level as the canal by servo-controlled heating. Measured in this way, aural temperature was always within 0. 35 Â°C of oesophageal under a variety of thermal stress. Rates of fall of <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> in 28 children swimming in cold water correlated highly with overall subcutaneous fat thickness and a higher' correlation was obtained when allowance was made for differences in surface area/mass ratios. Young swimmers who were thin and with high surface area/mass ratios were shown to be at considerable risk from death due to hypothermia when swimming in water as warm as 20. 30 C. Differences in fat distribution had a small effect on cooling rates. Cooling in air at 10 Â°C, women generally had greater falls in <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> than men even allowing for differences in surface area/mass ratio and subcutaneous fat thickness. This was mainly due to a smaller metabolic response to cold in the women...|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} effects of the thermal {{environment}} on vigilance. A reinterpretation of early and contemporary studies contradicts the existing notion that vigilance is facilitated in ambient temperatures that exceed a comfortable level. Rather, performance is degraded as thermal homeostasis of the observer is disturbed. Significant breakdown in capability becomes manifest with measurable perturbation to <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature.</b> This assertion requires that conditions induce a dynamic change, as performance is unaffected with no variation in <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> and is facilitated when the observer is established in a static hyperthermic state. An attentional account of this phenomenon is offered, which contrasts with previous arousal explanations. A common strategy in experimental psychology is to study a particular phenomenon by examining response under {{the effects of}} some perturbation or adverse condition. This tactic has the added benefit of also providing information about the action of some specific stressor or group of stressors on human capabilities. Through this approach, a unitary theoretical account of stress and performance has come to prominence, in that the singl...|$|E
40|$|Whole-body {{precooling}} {{can improve}} endurance exercise performance, {{especially in the}} heat; however there are logistical considerations that restrict the use of various precooling strategies prior to actual competition. Precooling is proposed to collectively reduce <b>deep</b> skin and <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> and in effect, increase the heat storage capacity of an athlete, thereby allowing a greater amount {{of work to be}} completed prior to attainment of a critical core temperature. While there is a sound theoretical basis for implementing precooling to improve cycling time trial performance in the heat, the practicalities of employing effective precooling strategies in the field warrant further investigation. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effectiveness of various practical precooling strategies for reducing core temperature and improving cycling time trial performance in hot (32 - 35 ºC; 50 - 60...|$|R
40|$|Hibernation is an energy-conserving {{behavior}} {{consisting of}} periods of inhibited metabolism (‘torpor’) with lowered <b>body</b> <b>temperature.</b> Torpor bouts are interspersed by arousal periods, in which metabolism increases and <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> returns to euthermia. In <b>deep</b> torpor, the <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> typically decreases to 2 – 10 °C, and major physiological and immunological changes occur. One of these alterations constitutes an almost complete depletion of circulating lymphocytes that is reversed rapidly upon arousal. Here {{we show that}} torpor induces the storage of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs {{in response to a}} temperature-dependent drop in plasma levels of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P). Regulation of lymphocyte numbers was mediated through the type 1 S 1 P receptor (S 1 P 1), because administration of a specific antagonist (W 146) during torpor (in a Syrian hamster at ∼ 8 °C) precluded restoration of lymphocyte numbers upon subsequent arousal. Furthermore, S 1 P release from erythrocytes via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) -transporters was significantly inhibited at low <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> (4 °C) but was restored upon rewarming. Reversible lymphopenia also was observed during daily torpor (in a Djungarian hamster at ± 25 °C), during forced hypothermia in anesthetized (summer-active) hamsters (at ± 9 °C), and in a nonhibernator (rat at ∼ 19 °C). Our results demonstrate that lymphopenia during hibernation in small mammals is driven by <b>body</b> <b>temperature,</b> via altered plasma S 1 P levels. S 1 P is recognized as an important bioactive lipid involved in regulating several other physiological processes as well and may be an important factor regulating additional physiological processes in hibernation as well as in mediating the effects of therapeutic hypothermia in patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Ear {{thermometers}} {{are becoming}} popular {{as a method}} for measuring <b>deep</b> <b>body</b> (core) <b>temperature.</b>  AIM—To determine the variability of a single user's tympanic membrane (ear) temperature measurements.  SUBJECTS—Forty two, afebrile, healthy children, and 20 febrile children with acute burns.  RESULTS—In afebrile children measurements made in both ears (and within {{just a few minutes}} of each other) differed by as much as 0. 6 °C. Operator measurement error, sw of three consecutive measurements, in the same ear, was 0. 13 °C. In the group of febrile, burned children, core temperature was measured hourly at a number of sites (ear, rectum, axilla, bladder). A peak in core temperature occurred approximately 10 - 12 hours after the burn. Measurement error was calculated in 14 febrile, burned children with a peak temperature in excess of 38 °C. For the left ear, measurement error was 0. 19 °C and for the right ear, 0. 11 °C. In the febrile children agreement between the ears was poor. The limits of agreement were 0. 4 °C to − 0. 8 °C. It was not possible to predict the occasions when the temperature differences between the ears would be large or small.  CONCLUSIONS—The measurement error of one recording from the next is probably acceptable at about 0. 1 to 0. 2 °C. To limit the variations in temperature of one ear to the other, measurements should be restricted to one of the ears whenever possible and the same ear used throughout the temperature monitoring period. Nurses and parents should take more than one temperature reading from the same ear whenever possible. ...|$|R
