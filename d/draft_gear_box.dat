In machine tools, the propose of a <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{is to provide}} a series of useful output speeds so that the machining operation can be carried out at its most optimum operating conditions high spindle speeds with low feed rate for roughing operations.

The probabilistic approach to design has been considered to be more rational compared to the conventional design approach based on the factor of safety.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{the control of}} {{magnetic}} gears. A decade ago (2001) the first modern prototype magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> was constructed using rare earth magnets (NdFeB). Magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have some desirable properties not found in their mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> counterparts, these include: contact-less torque transmission, lubrication-free, reduced noise and vibration, and non-destructive torque overload capability. Hitherto, no detailed investigation or analysis has been conducted {{on the effects of}} using a magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in place of a mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> As will be demonstrated in this thesis, magnetic gears possess a number of undesirable properties which must be given due consideration when designing speed and position controllers. In particular, unlike mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>boxes,</b> magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have extremely low torsional rigidity. Furthermore, the torque transfer characteristic is fundamentally nonlinear and magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have the potential to ‘slip’. On the one hand, ‘slipping’ is a great benefit as a non-destructive ‘torque fuse’; but on the other, this represents a consequential loss of control. This thesis examines the control issues that arise {{through the use of a}} specially constructed magnetic coupling integrated into an experimental test rig. The development of a linearized mathematical model of the experimental magnetic coupling is used to derive optimized classical controllers for speed and position, demonstrating outstanding theoretical and experimental results. To compensate for the possibility of ‘slip’, a methodology is presented for the detection and recovery from what is defined as ‘pole-slip’ in a magnetic coupling. To avert ‘pole-slip’, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed that prevents over-torque pole-slipping. Feedback linearization is considered for a nonlinear model of the magnetic coupling and nonlinear control laws and state transformations are derived to produce perfect linearization, for both speed and position control, over the entire operating range of the experimental magnetic coupling...|$|R

30|$|The {{mode shapes}} and {{frequencies}} {{for an individual}} draft pad and a <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> have been obtained using finite element approach. It is seen that the mode shapes of draft pads in a <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> are dominated by the first five modes (Fig.  3) of an individual draft pad. For these dominant mode shapes of an individual draft pad, different values of frequencies (Table  3) of the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> have been identified. These values are different than the various values of frequency obtained for an individual pad. These different values of frequency assumes significances as the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> is subjected to variable loading frequency due to acceleration and braking of the locomotive. Hence, a range of frequency values have been identified against which a draft pad must be tested for fatigue response. As per the schedule of technical requirements by Indian Railways [13], a draft pad is subjected to cyclic loading of 10  Hz for determining its fatigue behaviour. The values identified (Table  3) are greater than the existing value but have significance as {{the possibility that the}} frequency of cyclic load acting on the <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> in actual operation will not exceed this specified value cannot be ruled out.
