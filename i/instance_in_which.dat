This {{investigation}} leads to an <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Veronica is drugged {{and a part of}} her hair is removed by a mysterious figure.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these player versus environment (PvE) challenges, two forms of player versus player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The first type, the Wolves' Den, is an arena featuring structured four-versus-four battles; players may queue into a battle with up to three teammates to challenge another four-person team. The second type, Frontlines, is a large battleground <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> players form teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are delineated by players' allegiance {{to one of three}} Grand Companies and the team which reaches the target number of points first wins the match. Four modes are available with differing locations and rulesets, such as King of the Hill, capture the flag, and team deathmatch. Within the fiction, Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Parthenon {{definitely}} {{refers to}} the entire building {{is found in the}} writings of the 4th century BC orator Demosthenes. In 5th-century building accounts, the structure is simply called ho naos ("the temple"). The architects Iktinos and Callicrates are said to have called the building Hekatompedos ("the hundred footer") in their lost treatise on Athenian architecture, and, in the 4th century and later, the building was referred to as the Hekatompedos or the Hekatompedon as well as the Parthenon; the 1st-century-AD writer Plutarch referred to the building as the Hekatompedos Parthenon.|$|E
25|$|According to the Portuguese chronicles of Fernão Lopes, Gomes Eanes de Zurara, Rui de Pina, and Garcia Resende, {{spectacular}} stagings {{took place}} in the courts of John I of Portugal, Afonso V of Portugal, and John II of Portugal. For example, Rui de Pina refers to one <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> King John II himself played the part of The Knight of the Swan in a production which included a scene constructed of fabric waves. During the action, a fleet of carracks with a crew of spectacularly dressed actors entered the room accompanied by the sound of minstrels, trumpets, kettledrum, and artillery.|$|E
25|$|People who {{had started}} {{rebuilding}} their lives after World War I, began to see in Padre Pio a symbol of hope.

25|$|On September 1, 1995, the F line opened {{replacing}} the faster number 8 bus with {{a parade of}} PCC cars, painted to represent some of the two dozen North American cities {{that this type of}} streetcar once served. At that point in history, this was a rare <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a streetcar replaced a bus line in operation, {{rather than the other way}} around. Ridership exceeded expectation, and the need for extra cars resulted in the acquisition of ten Peter Witt style cars just being retired in the city of Milan, Italy. These cars were built in the 1920s to a design once common in North American cities, and their sister cars are still widely used on the Milan tramway network.|$|E
25|$|The same ice cores {{were also}} tested for Mercury {{deposition}} from natural and human-induced activities. This {{is the first}} known <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> ice cores {{have been used to}} determine Mercury deposition from a mid-latitude glacier in North America, as all previous studies have been derived from other sources. The majority of Mercury deposition is by way of the atmosphere and sources of the element may be from volcanic activity or from industrialization, but volcanoes contribute a small proportion of the Mercury. The ice core samples from the Upper Fremont Glacier indicated that levels of Mercury increased dramatically during the industrial revolution and have decreased significantly since the mid-1980s. It is believed that the decrease in Mercury deposition since the 1980s coincides {{with the passage of the}} Clean Air Act.|$|E
25|$|Nayyar shot to fame in November 1999, when {{he broke}} {{the record for the}} longest innings in the history of {{first-class}} cricket. He batted for 1,015 minutes in his innings of 271 against Jammu and Kashmir during a match of the 1999–00 Ranji Trophy in his home ground Chamba, breaking the previous record of 970 minutes set by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammad in a Test against the West Indies in 1958. Nayyar, captain of Himachal Pradesh, began his innings at the fall of his team's first wicket in the 11th over {{on the second day of}} the match. He reached 89 at the close of the second day's play and was batting on 170 at stumps on day three. On the fourth and final day's play, he became the first batsman from Himachal Pradesh to score a first-class double hundred and was dismissed bowled for 271 from 728 balls in the 250th over of Himachal Pradesh's innings. , Nayyar's innings remains the only <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a batsman has batted for more than 1000 minutes in an innings in first-class cricket.|$|E
