5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural <b>expectations</b> <b>are</b> associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. <b>Expectations</b> <b>are</b> that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patient <b>expectations</b> have <b>been</b> {{identified}} as a factor that may account for individual differences in recovery after total hip replacement (THR) surgery. However, patient <b>expectations</b> have not <b>been</b> studied within a valid theoretical framework. This study employed the World Health Organization's model of health, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), to classify the content of preoperative patient expectations of THR. METHODS: A European cohort of 1, 108 patients preoperatively reported 2 types of expectations. Patients reported what they anticipated surgery {{would enable them to}} do that they needed {{to be able to do}} ("need" expectation), and what they would like to be able to do ("desire" expectation) in a year's time. Free-text responses were independently classified by 2 researchers to 1 or more of the ICF constructs of impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was high (κ = ≥ 0. 87). All patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> classified to the ICF constructs. Less than 5 % of patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> {{identified as}} impairment, 58 % of "need" <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> {{identified as a}}ctivity limitations, and 45 % of "desire" <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> identified as activity limitations and participation restrictions combined. CONCLUSION: The ICF is a suitable theoretical framework to study patient expectations of THR. THR targets impairment; however, few patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> classified to the ICF definition of impairment. The majority of patient <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> classified as activity limitation or a combination of activity limitation and participation restriction. Therefore, patient expectations of surgery focus on recovering valued activities rather than reversal of bodily impairments...|$|R

25|$|What {{constitutes}} {{an act of}} infidelity depends upon the exclusivity expectations within the relationship. In marital relationships, exclusivity <b>expectations</b> <b>are</b> commonly assumed although they are not always met. When they are not met, {{research has found that}} psychological damage can occur, including feelings of rage and betrayal, lowering of sexual and personal confidence, and damage to self-image. Depending on the context, men and women can experience social consequences if their act of infidelity becomes public. The form and extent of these consequences are often dependent on the gender of the unfaithful person.|$|E

25|$|Infants whose {{mothers are}} more {{sensitive}} {{are more likely to}} display secure attachment relationships. Because the maternal figure is generally accessible and responsive to the infant's needs, the infant is able to form expectations of the mother's behaviour. Once <b>expectations</b> <b>are</b> met and the infant feels a consistency in the mother's sensitivity, the infant is able to find security in the maternal figure. Those infants whose mothers do not respond to the signals from their children or respond inappropriately to their children's cries for attention will form insecure and anxious attachments because the infants are unable to consistently depend on the maternal figures for predictable and safe responses.|$|E

25|$|Dickens was {{regarded}} as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great <b>Expectations</b> <b>are</b> also frequently adapted, and, {{like many of his}} novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.|$|E
