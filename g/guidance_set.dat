However, the formation of the coalition government in 2010 saw regional planning targets scrapped, along with growth area status.

50|$|The {{distance}} between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1,000 and 1300 ft. These were {{by far the most}} complex, extensive and expensive missile launch facilities ever deployed by the USAF. Launching a missile required fueling it in its silo, and then raising the launcher and missile out of the silo on a massive elevator. Before each launch the guidance radar, which was periodically calibrated by acquiring a special target at a precisely known range and bearing, had to acquire a radio on the missile (missile <b>guidance</b> <b>set</b> AN/DRW-18, AN/DRW-19, AN/DRW-20, AN/DRW-21, or AN/DRW-22. When the missile was launched, the guidance radar tracked the missile and supplied precise velocity range and azimuth data to the guidance computer which then generated guidance corrections which were transmitted to the missile. Because of this the complex could only launch and track one missile at a time.|$|E
50|$|Experience during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom led US {{air power}} {{planners}} to seek additional capabilities in one package, resulting in ongoing program upgrades {{to place a}} precision terminal guidance seeker in the JDAM kit. The Laser JDAM (LJDAM), as this upgrade is known, adds a laser seeker to the nose of a JDAM-equipped bomb, giving the ability to engage moving targets to the JDAM. The Laser Seeker is a cooperative development between Boeing's Defense, Space and Security unit and Israel's Elbit Systems. It is called Precision Laser <b>Guidance</b> <b>Set</b> (PLGS) by Boeing and consists of the Laser Seeker itself, now known as DSU-38/B, and a wire harness fixed under the bomb body to connect the DSU-38/B with the tail kit. During FY2004, Boeing and the U.S. Air Force began testing of the laser guidance capability for JDAM, with these tests demonstrating {{that the system is}} capable of targeting and destroying moving targets. This dual guidance system retains the ability to operate on GPS/INS alone, if laser guidance is unavailable, with the same accuracy of the earlier JDAM.|$|E

50|$|Washing up on {{a deserted}} island, Jennifer is {{completely}} alone until {{she sees the}} body of the captain in the water. As she attempts to resuscitate him, Manuel appears and also unsuccessfully tries to revive the man. They bury the captain and, under Manuel's <b>guidance,</b> <b>set</b> out to build a shelter and find food. Eventually, Jack also turns up on the island. Although things go smoothly for a little while, Jack eventually suspects Manuel of having desires on his wife and declares the man his enemy, promising to ruin his life once they get off the island. Manuel responds that Jack had better get home soon, because he can ruin Jack's life right there on the island. This puts Jennifer in the uncomfortable position of her loyalty to Jack conflicting with the realization that they both need Manuel's help to survive.

5000|$|Project Solarium [...] was an American national-level {{exercise}} {{in strategy and}} foreign policy design convened by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{in the summer of}} 1953. It was intended to produce consensus among senior officials in the national security community on the most effective strategy for responding to Soviet expansionism in the wake of World War II. The exercise was the product of a series of conversations between President Eisenhower and senior cabinet-level officials, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and George F. Kennan among them, in the Solarium room {{on the top floor of}} the White House. Through these conversations, Eisenhower not only realized that strategic <b>guidance</b> <b>set</b> forth in NSC 68 under the Truman administration was not sufficient to address the breadth of issues with which his administration was presented, but also that his own cabinet was divided enough on the correct course of action vis-a-vis the Soviet Union that United States' policy on dealing with the Soviet Union was at risk of becoming subject to internal political posturing to the detriment of US national security.|$|E
50|$|Kramer and his screenwriter Mac Benoff {{decided to}} {{compromise}} Swarthout’s time sequence {{by having the}} entire film set in the present with flashbacks into the past of all the boys, to explicate their presence at the camp. Whereas Swarthout’s novel - thematically powerful though it is- is episodic and difficult for some six-graders to follow, the Kramer film flows almost faultlessly to its tragic conclusion. The plight of the American buffalo and any other endangered species {{is at the center}} of the film’s focus. Almost predictably, the dysfunctional group, under Cotton’s <b>guidance,</b> <b>set</b> out to free a large herd of the bison, after they witness their perverted macho camp counselor “Wheaties” shooting the animals in a festive (and deeply disturbing) western lottery, which is given validation as a proper method to thin out the large numbers by eliminating the ‘weak’ or ‘sick’ buffalo. Of course, the buffalo are not the only targets of this destructive urge, as the Bedwetters-similarly-have been have also been “tamed,” “penned” and crushed in spirit. As a result of their parents’ neglect, they have been turned into psychological misfits. Ridiculed and rejected by the other boys in the camp, they are forced to cling even more strongly to their deviant behavior. The boys’ pilgrimage to free the buffalo is also a search for freedom.|$|E

[...] If it is then charged with the offence of failing to prevent bribery, it would be able to show evidence of the ‘adequate procedures’ which it will need in order to defend itself.|$|R
