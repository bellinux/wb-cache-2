5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, <b>Groucho</b> <b>Marx,</b> and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the <b>Groucho</b> <b>Marx</b> quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E
5|$|Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images. Cagney {{played a}} series of patriots, and his gangster in Angels with Dirty Faces (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is {{executed}} so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration. Breen in essence neutered <b>Groucho</b> <b>Marx,</b> removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel Over the White House where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Groucho</b> <b>Marx</b> played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E

The files were collected for various reasons. Some {{of the subjects}} were investigated for alleged ties to the Communist party (Charlie Chaplin and <b>Groucho</b> <b>Marx),</b> or in connection with antiwar activities during the Vietnam War (John Denver, John Lennon, and Jane Fonda). Numerous celebrity files concern threats or extortion attempts against them (Sonny Bono, John Denver, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Mickey Mantle, <b>Groucho</b> <b>Marx,</b> and Frank Sinatra).|$|E

25|$|Johnny Carson's {{success on}} ABC's Who Do You Trust? led NBC to {{invite him to}} take over Tonight {{a few months before}} Paar's departure.
