5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy’s intentions and directed powerful <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> support Marmont.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to repeat}} {{the success of the}} earlier First Phase Campaign, the Chinese 13th Army first {{launched}} a series of surprise attacks along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley on the night of November 25, 1950, effectively destroying the Eighth United States Army's right flank while allowing Chinese <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> move rapidly into UN rear areas. In the subsequent battles and withdrawals during the period of November 26 to December 2, 1950, although the US Eighth Army managed to avoid being surrounded by Chinese forces, the Chinese 13th Army were still able to inflict heavy losses onto the retreating UN forces which had lost all cohesion. In the aftermath of the battle, the US Eighth Army's heavy losses forced all UN <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> evacuate North Korea and to withdraw to the 38th parallel.|$|E
5|$|In April 1949, Stewart {{replaced}} Major General Norman Weir as Chief of the General Staff, New Zealand Military Forces.

This led to a clash with Prime Minister Sydney Holland in 1950 over the rate of progress of these plans for which he later apologised. He also oversaw the deployment of New Zealand <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War.|$|E

5|$|Since {{they lacked}} the <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> take Nikolaev {{in a single}} campaign, the seizure of Kinburn proved to have limited {{strategic}} effect. Nevertheless, the attack on Kinburn was significant in that it demonstrated that the French and British fleets had developed effective amphibious capabilities and had technological advantages that gave them a decisive edge over their Russian opponents. The destruction of Kinburn's coastal fortifications completed the Anglo-French naval campaign in the Black Sea; the Russians no longer had any meaningful forces left to oppose them at sea. The British and French navies planned to transfer <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> the Baltic Sea the following year to strengthen operations there. Diplomatic pressure from still-neutral Austria convinced Czar Nicholas I of Russia to sue for peace, which was concluded the following February with the Treaty of Paris.|$|E

5|$|The Turkish Armed Forces {{consists}} of the Land Forces, the Naval Forces and the Air Force.
