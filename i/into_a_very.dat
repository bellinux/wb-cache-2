5|$|George {{accepted}} {{a position at}} Hughes Aircraft to work for Howard Hughes, along with fellow bomber advocate Ira C. Eaker. Eaker and George transformed Hughes Aircraft <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> profitable military contractor, reaching $100M in sales in 1948. George expanded the company beyond the manufacture of aircraft {{to focus on the}} new field of military electronics, primarily by bringing together expert electronics designer Dean Wooldridge and engineer-businessman Simon Ramo, both hired by George in 1946. In August 1953, Ramo and Wooldridge resigned. George followed a few months later to help form the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, competing directly with Hughes by developing ballistic missile defenses. In 1958, Ramo-Wooldridge would merge with Thompson Products, to become Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, which was shortened to TRW in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Lilioid monocots (lilioids, liliid monocots, petaloid monocots, petaloid lilioid monocots) is an {{informal}} name {{used for a}} grade (grouping of taxa with common characteristics) of five monocot orders (Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large, coloured tepals. This characteristic {{is similar to that}} found in lilies ("lily-like"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From the early nineteenth century many of the species in this group of plants were put <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> broadly defined family, Liliaceae sensu lato or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 was stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> basic ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given {{how hard it}} was to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E

5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches}} from its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought much change to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, Villa were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw much change at Villa Park. By the end of the 1960s, Villa were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Megh {{continued}} to rapidly intensify while approaching {{the island of}} Socotra. It developed a small eye just 7.4km (4.6mi) in diameter by early on November8, along with a convective core just 280km (175mi) in diameter. At 03:00UTC that day, the IMD upgraded the system to an extremely severe cyclonic storm, and three hours later estimated peak 3minute winds of 175km/h (110mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). Since accurate record keeping began in the basin in 1990, this {{marked the first time}} in the Arabian Sea that there were two cyclones in one season with 1minute winds of at least 185km/h (115km/h). Between 06:0012:00UTC on November8, the eye of Megh crossed the northern coast of Socotra, with the resulting land interaction causing the eyewall to disappear and for the winds to diminish. After exiting the island, the cyclone began weakening further due to cooler water temperatures and drier air from the Arabian Peninsula to the northwest. Early on November9, the center of Megh passed 57km (36mi) north of Cape Guardafui, and further land interaction with Somalia to the south increasingly degraded the storm's structure. At 00:00UTC that day, Megh weakened <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> severe cyclonic storm.|$|E

5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E
5|$|On July19, {{the eye of}} Daniel became {{apparent}} on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye. It underwent an eyewall replacement cycle as it turned to the west-northwest, temporarily halting its intensification trend, before quickly strengthening and attaining major hurricane status on July20. Later that day, Hurricane Daniel organized <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> symmetric cyclone with a distinct eye about 30miles (50km) in diameter. Upon attaining Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone resembled the appearance of an annular hurricane; an annular hurricane is one with a large and symmetric eye, surrounded by a thick ring of intense convection, and usually is able to maintain its intensity and structure for several days. On July 21 the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. After completing the cycle, Daniel attained its peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) early on July 22. It maintained peak winds for about 18 hours, and Daniel began a weakening trend as it crossed into an area of progressively cooler water temperatures. The eye became more distinct on July 23, before the cloud tops again warmed as the winds decreased.|$|E
