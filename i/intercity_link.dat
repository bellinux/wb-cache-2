The most important public transport link to Bremen, Hamburg and Hanover is Munster station on the old Uelzen-Langwedel railway, that originally ran as the America Line from Berlin via Uelzen to Bremen and Bremerhaven. Today regional trains work the line from Bremen via Soltau to Uelzen. Long distance trains (IC) trains only run on Fridays and Sundays from Berlin and are geared predominantly to commuting Bundeswehr soldiers.

40|$|Examining {{networks}} of {{cities in the}} world rather than 'world cityness', the study offers a 'Southern' perspective on world city research. It includes places not ordinarily considered. Fourteen years of sample data on cross-border, intercity airline traffic are used as time-series relational information. The data express links between two of South Africa's principal cities and cities elsewhere in Africa and beyond. The analysis shows persistent and intensifying links, but also sporadic and unstable intercity relations. A gathering concentration on proximate city pairs is apparent. The research also reveals that urban areas commonly regarded as topping the world city hierarchy mix with smaller and less well-known African places in the rankings of connections with Johannesburg and Cape Town. The complex <b>intercity</b> <b>links</b> which constitute urban significance on the world map are not reducible to a subordinate nesting of Third World city ties in a dominant First World matrix. ...|$|R

40|$|Intercity bus {{transportation}} {{is integral to}} thenation’s surface transportation network and isparticularly important to smaller communitiesand rural areas. <b>Intercity</b> buses <b>link</b> smaller communities within a region and also link those communities to larger urban areas that offer services and opportunities otherwise not available. Intercity bus transportation also plays a critical role for smaller communities without air or passenger rail travel options—for many rural residents, intercity bus is a more affordable option than air or rail. The 1991 introduction of federal funding for intercity bus service in rural areas marked a change in policy and made intercity bus service one element in a wider approach to maintaining and improving rural public transit.
