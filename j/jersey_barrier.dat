The design of 400-series highways {{has set the}} precedent {{for a number of}} innovations used throughout North America, including the parclo interchange and a modified <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier</b> design known as the Ontario Tall Wall. As a result, they currently experience the lowest accident and fatality rate comparative to traffic volume in North America.|$|E
5|$|At this crossing, US 22 heads {{north-northeast}} into Scotch Plains, Union County, {{coming to}} an interchange with CR 655. The route continues northeast as a four- to five-lane highway, passing near Bowcraft Amusement Park. The road continues east through Mountainside, turning northeast before entering Springfield, where it has an interchange with CR 509 Spur (signed as CR 577). Past this interchange, for 1.8 miles US 22 has an unusual wide median that contains commercial businesses and numerous U-turn ramps. In this area, the road comes to a level crossing with the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad. It crosses the Rahway River into Union, where the wide median continues. The route briefly forms the northern border of Kenilworth before the median narrows back into a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier.</b> US 22 splits into two carriageways at the intersection with exits 140 and 140A of the Garden State Parkway and Route 82, site of the Union Watersphere.|$|E
5|$|East of I-287, US 22 {{continues}} east as a four-lane {{divided highway}} passing {{to the south}} of the Watchung Mountains. The route then has an interchange with CR 525, where the wide grassy median narrows to a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier.</b> The road continues through wooded surroundings and passes through a portion of Bound Brook, widening back to six lanes before meeting CR 527 at an interchange. From here, the route takes a northeasterly course, entering Bridgewater Township again and narrowing to four lanes before crossing into Green Brook Township while designated a short distance north of the Middlesex-Somerset County border. US 22 continues through business areas as a highway with jughandles, crossing CR 529. In North Plainfield, the route widens to six lanes and has an interchange with CR 531. Past this interchange, the road continues along the border of Watchung to the west and North Plainfield to the southeast before crossing Green Brook.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins as}} two one-way streets, Goodell Street (traveling west) and East Tupper Street (traveling east). Both {{intersect}} with NY5 (Ellicott Street) in Buffalo, {{from where they}} serve as a one-way couplet for three blocks before they merge to become the Kensington Expressway, a limited-access highway. It initially travels through dense urban areas {{by way of a}} cut, in which both roadways are separated only by a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier.</b> The expressway runs past the Buffalo Museum of Science, located at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, and through the middle of Humboldt Parkway in Buffalo, where the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198) leaves at the former exit for Main Street. The section of the expressway between the Scajaquada and Harlem Road (NY240) just outside the city limit is the busiest on all of NY33, handling in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day in areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{section of}} freeway between CR 525 and Drift Road (Exit 41) in Watchung was {{completed}} in 1974. The section from Drift Road to Route 24 (Exit 48) in Springfield Township was delayed because of environmental impacts to the Watchung Reservation. In order to mitigate opposition to the original plan, that was shifted closer to {{the northern edge of}} the Reservation, which required extensive cuts into the Second Watchung Mountain. Extra land was added to the Nikesite Road overpass and a separate land bridge was built to allow for animal migration. The road was also designed to use a narrower right-of-way with no median strip and just a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier</b> dividing the highway, to minimize the amount rock to be removed. This stretch of I-78 opened in 1986.|$|E
25|$|From Huguenot Avenue, {{the highway}} takes a more {{pronounced}} northeasterly track through the neighborhoods of Woodrow and Annadale, meeting Arden Avenue {{by way of}} an interchange in the latter community. The parkway continues as a four-lane limited-access highway to Greenridge, where the road merges with the northern half of Drumgoole Boulevard to create a four-lane, two-way surface street with a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier</b> in the median. The Korean War Veterans Parkway ends at the merge; however, NY909C, the unsigned reference route designation for the parkway, continues to follow Drumgoole Boulevard to its end a short distance later at an intersection with Richmond Avenue. Stubs intended to continue both directions of the parkway past Greenridge are present at the merge with Drumgoole Boulevard. The unused highways roughly parallel Drumgoole Boulevard, crossing over Richmond Avenue before abruptly becoming a small two-lane road {{just east of the}} overpasses. The road continues as a non-public asphalt roadway used for construction vehicles.|$|E

Route 4 features a right-in/right-out in the eastbound direction that provides access to County Route 507. [...] The route continues east on Broadway as a divided highway with a concrete then a grassy median, with businesses lining both sides of the roadway. At the intersection with Cyril Avenue, Route 4 runs along the border of Elmwood Park to the south and Fair Lawn to the north before entirely entering Fair Lawn, where the route passes under New Jersey Transitâ€™s Bergen County Line near Broadway Station. It intersects County Route 67 (Midland Avenue) and continues east as a divided highway with a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier</b> through commercial areas of Fair Lawn.|$|E
500|$|Past the Route 3 interchange, Route 17 {{continues}} {{north as}} a six-lane divided highway with intersections featuring jughandles.

The route runs through Carlstadt, where it crosses into Wood-Ridge. Route 17 comes to an interchange with County Route 36 (Moonachie Road) before entering Hasbrouck Heights. [...] With {{the exception of a}} short stretch in Rutherford with a median strip, this section of Route 17 is divided by a <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|E
500|$|Because it predates the Interstate Highway System, {{the road}} is not {{engineered}} to current Interstate Highway standards, and notably lacks a regulation-width median. [...] To {{reduce the risk of}} head-on collisions, the Kansas Turnpike now has a continuous, permanent <b>Jersey</b> <b>barrier</b> in the median over its entire length. [...] On opening, there was no fixed speed limit on the highway; drivers were merely asked to keep to a [...] "reasonable and proper" [...] limit, although shortly afterward signs were erected in certain stretches indicating a maximum speed of [...] From 1970 to 1974 and again since 2011, the turnpike's speed limit has been set at that limit during the earlier period applied only during daytime hours.|$|E
