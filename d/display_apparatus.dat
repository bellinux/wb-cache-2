40|$|COVET {{is a group}} {{exhibition}} that explores the rhetoric of display and the various systems, structures and methods of presentation. The exhibition scrutinizes the display objects application in within consumer culture, {{and its role in}} maintaining a desirability of the things around us. This exhibition brings together nine artists whose work disentangles the object from its framing device. When the mechanisms and techniques for staging the object are fore-grounded, the display object itself gets pushed to the background becoming secondary, obsolete and invisible. Its purpose is to generate desirability for other things, never for itself. By taking away or confiscating the objects of display, COVET concentrates instead on specific structural devices full of empty and unfulfilled promises. The primary function of display incorporating plinths, shelves and platforms, is to elevate, promote and show-off the consumable object. Through various media, including mass-produced goods, manufactured items, photography, video, installation and sculpture the works in COVET delve into our cultural investment into material goods.

Because H. oreqonensis live in a turbid water of a mud-rock habitat or in burrows of the estuary, acoustic communication is well suited to their environment. Behavioral observations of H. oregonensis, collected from Yaquina Bay, Oregon, were made in habitat replicas of the mud-rock environment. Stridulation by male crabs was elicited equally by male and female crabs but the amount of stridulation increased when all the crabs were males.

40|$|The Yop virulon enables extracellularly located Yersinia, {{in close}} contact with a {{eukaryotic}} target cell, to inject bacterial toxic proteins directly into the cytosol of this cell. Several Ysc proteins, forming the Yop secretion <b>apparatus,</b> <b>display</b> homology with proteins of the flagellar basal body. To determine whether this relationship could extend to the regulatory pathways, we analyzed the influence of flhDC, the master regulatory operon of the flagellum, on the yop regulon. In an flhDC mutant, the yop regulon was up-regulated. The transcription of virF and the steady-state level of the transcriptional activator VirF were enhanced. yop transcription was increased at 37 °C and could also be detected at a low temperature. Yop secretion was increased at 37 °C and occurred even at a low temperature. The Ysc secretion machinery was thus functional at room temperature in the absence of flagella, implying that in wild-type bacteria, FlhD and/or FlhC, or the product of a gene downstream of flhDC, represses the yop regulon. In agreement with this notion, increased expression of flhDC in wild-type bacteria resulted in the oversecretion of flagellins at room temperature and in decreased Yop secretion at 37 °C...|$|R

However, regarding N-glycosylation the processing of plant N-glycans in the Golgi <b>apparatus</b> <b>displays</b> major differences when {{compared with that of}} mammalian cells. These differences in N-glycosylation are expected to influence serum clearance rate of plant-derived monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody against the hepatitis B virus surface antigen expressed in Nicotiana tabacum leaves without KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (CB. Hep 1 (-) KDEL) and with a KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) fused to both IgG light and heavy chains (CB. Hep 1 (+) KDEL) were tested for in vivo stability in mice. Full characterization of N-glycosylation and aggregate formation in each monoclonal antibody batch was determined. The mouse counterpart (CB. Hep 1) was used as control. Both (CB. Hep 1 (-) KDEL) and (CB. Hep 1 (+) KDEL) showed a faster initial clearance rate (first 24 h) compared with the analogous murine antibody while the terminal phase was similar in the three antibodies. Despite the differences between CB. Hep 1 (+) KDEL and CB. Hep 1 (-) KDEL N-glycans, the in vivo elimination in mice was indistinguishable from each other and higher than the murine monoclonal antibody. Molecular modelling confirmed that N-glycans linked to plantibodies were oriented away from the interdomain region, increasing the accessibility of the potential glycan epitopes by glycoprotein receptors that might be responsible for the difference in stability of these molecules. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Abstract Background Many Ophidiidae {{are active}} in dark environments and <b>display</b> complex sonic <b>apparatus</b> morphologies. However, sound {{recordings}} are scarce and {{little is known about}} acoustic communication in this family. This paper focuses on Ophidion rochei which is known to display an important sexual dimorphism in swimbladder and anterior skeleton. The aims of this study were to compare the sound producing morphology, and the resulting sounds in juveniles, females and males of O. rochei. Results Males, females, and juveniles possessed different morphotypes. Females and juveniles contrasted with males because they possessed dramatic differences in morphology of their sonic muscles, swimbladder, supraoccipital crest, and first vertebrae and associated ribs. Further, they lacked the ‘rocker bone’ typically found in males. Sounds from each morphotype were highly divergent. Males generally produced non harmonic, multiple-pulsed sounds that lasted for several seconds (3. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 3 s) with a pulse period of ca. 100 ms. Juvenile and female sounds were recorded {{for the first time in}} ophidiids. Female sounds were harmonic, had shorter pulse period (± 3. 7 ms), and never exceeded a few dozen milliseconds (18 [*]±[*] 11 ms). Moreover, unlike male sounds, female sounds did not have alternating long and short pulse periods. Juvenile sounds were weaker but appear to be similar to female sounds. Conclusions Although it is not possible to distinguish externally male from female in O. rochei, they show a sonic apparatus and sounds that are dramatically different. This difference is likely due to their nocturnal habits that may have favored the evolution of internal secondary sexual characters that help to distinguish males from females and that could facilitate mate choice by females. Moreover, the comparison of different morphotypes in this study shows that these morphological differences result from a peramorphosis that takes place during the development of the gonads. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Gram-negative {{bacteria}} Chlamydia trachomatis is {{a common}} sexually transmitted pathogen that can cause severe sequelae including cause pelvic inflammatory disease and sterility. This obligate intracellular pathogen effectively manipulates host cellular functions by secreting virulence factors across its membrane bound vacuole. Identifying these virulence components and how they help in establishing an environment conducive for bacterial growth is central to understanding chlamydial pathogenesis. This is experimentally challenging {{due to a lack}} of tools to perform molecular genetic studies. In the absence of genetic tools, we developed a yeast model system to identify and characterize chlamydial proteins involved in virulence mechanisms. In this study we describe the identification of twenty-eight proteins potentially involved in modulating host cellular functions and the secretion of virulence factors into the host. Since the delivery of virulence proteins by a type three secretion (T 3 S) system is a critical step for Chlamydia, we identified the proteins that interacted with the T 3 S apparatus by yeast two-hybrid analysis. We discovered several novel interactions between and determined that the C. trachomatis T 3 S <b>apparatus</b> <b>displayed</b> a similar architecture to that of other T 3 S systems. Furthermore with these approaches we identified networks of proteins that interacted with the secretion apparatus including a novel secretion chaperone protein. We characterized Ct 260 /Mcsc one of the putative secretion and demonstrated that it represents a novel class 1 B secretion chaperone protein. Unlike other known chaperones, Mcsc directly interact with a conserved component of the T 3 S apparatus cytoplasmic domain, CdsQ. These finding represents a novel mechanism by which the secretion chaperone protein Ct 260 may increase the secretion efficiency of its effector cargo and may reveal new facets of secretory cargo recognition by T 3 S systems.

40|$|The {{formation}} and dissociation of methane gas hydrate was investigated over {{a range of}} laboratory scale systems with sample volumes of 1. 3 cm 3, 0. 059 m 3 and 0. 141 m 3. Three unique hydrate apparatuses were used to study a point source thermal dissociation method in which gas production profiles and cumulative efficiencies {{were found to be}} dependent on the initial hydrate saturation and the degree of thermal stimulation. Hydrate growth was observed to develop in a non-homogeneous manner with hydrate distribution <b>displaying</b> strong <b>apparatus</b> specific behavior. Heterogeneous hydrate distribution contributed to the production efficiencies of point source thermal stimulation and is an essential parameter when evaluating a gas hydrate reservoir. Thermal stimulation was applied to sediments with initial pore space hydrate saturations ranging from 10 % to 80 % producing maximum cumulative thermal production efficiencies ranging from 57 % to 90 %. Production performance was improved with higher initial hydrate saturation; increasing the initial hydrate saturation from 20 % to 35 % on the small scale system raised peak cumulative efficiencies from 57 - 63 % to 70 - 74 %. Increasing hydrate saturation from 10 % to 30 % in the medium scale system increased peak cumulative efficiencies from 83 % to 90 %. During thermal stimulation experiments in both the medium and large scale reactors a flow recirculation pattern developed within the pore space following an initially conduction dominated heat transfer regime. The outward propagation of the heat front from the heating element resulted in increased permeability and the release of mobile water and gas phases as the hydrate underwent dissociation. This change in flow parameters facilitated convection cells within the reactor causing increased heat transfer away from the heating element while displaying a strong upward bias. The flow development detected within the medium scale system was confirmed via history matching of numerical simulation with experimental data. Increased hydrate saturation and increased heating rate lead to a more intense flow development. Thermal stimulation methane production has been coupled with the simultaneous injection of gaseous carbon dioxide as method of enhancing gas production rates while providing a means for long term storage of carbon dioxide in the hydrate phase. The exchange process was investigated at low and high gas injection rates under conditions of both low and high thermal stimulation applied to a 50 % hydrate saturated quartz sand pack. The amount of carbon dioxide stored in the hydrate phased was greatest for the low injection-high heating condition sequestering 69 moles, and lowest for the high injection- low heating condition sequestering 13 moles. The gas exchange is improved with longer contact time between gas phase carbon dioxide and hydrate phase methane, this condition is optimized at low carbon dioxide injection rates. The availability of free water for formation of carbon dioxide is enhanced with the higher heating rates. Thus it is possible to tune the gas production rates and carbon dioxide storage potential by manipulating heating rates and gas injection rates to achieve the desired ratio between methane produced and carbon dioxide sequestered. Understanding the transition period and flow development within the pore fluid mixture should play a large role in determining the optimum placement and geometry of heating and exchange systems on industrial scale hydrate production scenarios. In addition to the optimization of thermal stimulation heating location, the profile and degree of heating rate can be tuned in order to maximize gas collection and minimize excessive heating of unproductive sediment matrix after it has been exhausted of methane hydrate. The production efficiency produced across the three experimental scales averaged between 80 and 90 % and appears to be independent of scale. The scale up of this method for industrial scale production should pay close attention to the distribution of heat during thermal stimulation {{as a result of the}} development of high convective transport that occurs in the near vicinity of the heater and in the dissociated hydrate zone. This work provides supportive evidence that thermal based hydrate dissociation can be achieved with relatively high production efficiencies and satisfactory resource recovery potentials. Further, the CH 4 -CO 2 gas exchange process was successfully coupled with point source thermal stimulation and the influence of injection rate and heating rate on carbon storage potential and methane recovery potential has been demonstrated...|$|R
