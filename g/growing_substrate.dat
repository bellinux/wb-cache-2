40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the total nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen in <b>growing</b> <b>substrates</b> of vinegar residues. Samples of 106 substrates were collected from the cultivation experiments of vinegar residue substrates. Spectra of the visible and near infrared region (350 - 2500 nm) were obtained for all samples after drying and grinding (variant A) or in a moist state (variant B). Across validation was carried out using a partial least square method which was based on the entire spectra. For parameters TN, NO 3 - and NH 4 +, precisions of the calibration and prediction models were inconsistent between variant A and B. For variant A, the prediction coefficient (r), Root Mean Squared Error of Cross-Validation (RMSECV) and the ratio of standard deviation and RMSECV (RSC) were 0. 97, 0. 64 g/kg and 4. 4 for TN, 0. 58, 15. 4 mg/kg and 1. 2 for NO 3 -, 0. 79, 0. 75 g/kg and 1. 5 for NH 4 +, respectively. For moist samples, the r, RMSECV and RSC were 0. 79, 1. 81 g/kg and 1. 6 for TN, 0. 85, 9. 95 mg/kg and 1. 9 for NO 3 -, 0. 92, 0. 45 g/kg and 2. 5 for NH 4 +, respectively. The results indicate a marked usefulness of NIRS in the nitrogen assessment and management of <b>growing</b> <b>substrates,</b> especially for TN and NH 4.

Bulbs were sown in clay pots (8 in. diameter from top and 10 in. height) on 01 - 04 - 2011. Nine treatment combinations were made in different ratios by volume from these six <b>growing</b> <b>substrates</b> and treatments for this experiment were T 0, Silt (S); T 1 silt+leaf compost (SLC); T 2 silt+farm yard manure (SFYM); T 3 silt+coco peat (SCP); T 4 silt+compost (SC); T 5 silt+perlite (SP); T 6 silt+farm yard manure+leaf compost (1 : 1 : 1); T 7 silt+coco peat+leaf compost (SCPLC); T 8 silt+perlite+leaf compost (SPLC) in 1 : 1 : 1 ratio and T 9 silt+peat moss+compost (1 : 1 : 1). Treatment T 0, which contained silt only, was considered the standard. For compost formation, garden residues (leaf pruning and clippings) were used after 90  days of decomposition process kept under 62  °C temperature in compost bin. Two grams of soluble NPK fertilizer (19 - 19 - 19) was applied to each pot once after transplantation.|$|R

40|$|Extensive green roofs are {{becoming}} a popular tool for restoring green infrastructure in urban areas, particularly biodiverse habitats such as post-industrial/brownfield sites. This study investigated the use of six recycled lightweight aggregates and combinations of them in green roof <b>growing</b> <b>substrate,</b> to determine their effectiveness for enhancing plant abundance and species diversity. In two separate experiments, we examined the roles of substrate type and depth on {{the establishment of a}} perennial wildflower mix over a 15 -month period. We found that some of the alternative substrates are comparable to the widely used crushed red brick aggregate (predominantly found in commercial green roof <b>growing</b> <b>substrate)</b> for supporting plant establishment. For some materials such as clay pellets, there was increased plant coverage and a higher number of plant species than in any other substrate. Substrates that were produced from a blend of two or three aggregate types also supported higher plant abundance and diversity. Generally, increasing substrate depth improved plant establishment, however this effect was not consistent across substrates. We conclude that recycled materials may be viable constituents of <b>growing</b> <b>substrate</b> for green roofs and they may improve green roof resilience, through increased plant cover and diversity. The results could provide evidence to support the construction of mosaic habitat types on single roofs using various substrate blends...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the influence of Cd (0, 10, 20, 40 mg Cd·dm - 3) and Pb (0, 10, 100, 200 mg Pb·dm - 3) in <b>growing</b> <b>substrate</b> and mycorrhizal colonization of root system on growth, flowering, Cd and Pb accumulation in scarlet sage shoots. Both Cd and Pb had a negative effect on mycorrhizal colonization of scarlet sage roots. The effect of Cd and Pb on the growth of scarlet sage was negligible. Cd at 40 mg·dm - 3 lowered the number of inflorescences and caused slight chlorosis of the lowermost leaves. Pb at 200 mg·dm - 3 caused drying of the lowermost leaves. Both heavy metals accelerated flowering of non-mycorrhizal plants, independently of the concentration in growing media. Cd and Pb contents in scarlet sage shoots increased with the increasing content of these heavy metals in <b>growing</b> <b>substrate</b> in both non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants.

40|$|Biochar from {{conifers}} {{wood was}} used in soilless culture as <b>growing</b> <b>substrate</b> alternative to peat for ornamental crops. Potted plants of Euphorbia × lomi Rauh cv. ‘Ilaria’ were grown with different mixtures (v:v) of brown peat and biochar in order to evaluate main physical and chemical characteristics of this biomaterial {{as well as its}} effect on plant growth, ornamental characteristics and nutrients uptake. Biochar addition to peat increased pH, EC and K content of the growing substrates, as well as air content and bulk density. Biochar content of substrates significantly affected plant growth and biomass partitioning: higher number of shoots and leaves, leaf area and leaf dry weight were recorded in plants grown in 40 % peat- 60 % biochar, with respect to plants grown in 100 % peat and secondarily in 100 % biochar. Leaf chlorophyll content was higher in plants grown in 60 % and 80 % biochar, while biomass water use efficiency was higher with 60 % biochar. Plant uptake of K and Ca increased as biochar content of the substrates increased.
