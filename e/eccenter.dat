40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is presented to}} compute efficiently the propagation of nonaxially symmetric waves induced by realistic <b>eccentered</b> sources with a mandrel in a multicylindrically layered geometry. One of the applications of such a program is in electrical well logging, where all exploration tools operate in a borehole drilled into the ground for geophysical subsurface sensing. The borehole surrounded by an invasion zone can be modeled as a multicylindrically layered geometry. The authors also present an algorithm to study the effect of eccentricity (source and mandrel not {{in the center of}} the borehole) in the presence of concentric invasion zones around the borehole. The authors' {{algorithm is}} used to study the eccentricity and invasion effects on an induction measurement and a dielectirc logging measurement.

40|$|Abstract—A {{dipole antenna}} in a {{borehole}} may be placed {{away from the}} center of the borehole, and this eccentricity produces additional complicated electromagnetic fields, which may influ-ence borehole radar signals. In this paper, we analyze an eccentric dipole antenna in a borehole for borehole radars. Our approach is an extended version of the pseudoanalytical formulation that was previously applied for analyzing an induction logging tool and a dielectric logging tool. The proposed equations are suitable for modeling the finite dipole antenna, utilizing a method-of-moments. The eccentricity of the radar sonde has two consequences. First, it modifies the antenna characteristics such as its impedance, and second, it changes the electromagnetic field inside the borehole, owing to the change of the structure of the cylindrical layers. These two changes are evaluated by the proposed algorithm and two types of experiments. The first one is a measurement of the input impedance of a monopole antenna which is in cylindrical layers on a ground plane in air. The second one is about the transmission between two antennas, one of which is <b>eccentered</b> in cylindrical layers. This experiment was done in granite at a field test site and on a ground plane in air. In the field experiments, we controlled the position of the radar sonde in a borehole and made the antenna <b>eccentered</b> artificially. We found that a 4 -cm displacement resulted in changes of 4 dB in amplitude and 4 ns in time delay. Comparing the experimental and calculated data obtained by the present method shows the validity of the proposed analytical formulation.

40|$|Abstract—Logging-while-drilling (LWD) {{borehole}} sensors {{are used}} to provide real-time resistivity data of adjacent Earth formations for hydrocarbon exploration. This allows for an proactive adjustment of the dipping angle and azimuth direction of the drill, and hence geosteering capabilities. The analysis of borehole eccentricity effects on LWD sensor response in full 3 × 3 anisotropic Earth formations is important for correct data interpretation in deviated or horizontal wells. In this paper, we present a cylindrical-grid finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model to tackle this problem. The grid is aligned to the sensor axis to avoid staircasing error in the sensor geometry, but in general misaligned to the (<b>eccentered)</b> borehole/formation interface. A locally-conformal discretization is used to compute effective conductivity tensors of partially-filled grid cells at those interfaces, involving an isotropic medium (borehole) and a full 3 × 3 anisotropic medium in general (dipped Earth formation). The numerical model is used to compute the response of <b>eccentered</b> LWD sensors in layered Earth formations with anisotropic dipping beds.

40|$|Steel casing {{corrosion}} {{analysis is}} pivotal in well integrity evaluation for ensuring environment-friendly and efficient hydrocarbon production and for well abandonment {{at the end}} of the productive life of the well. Due to their sensitivity to metal loss and depth of investigation, low frequency electromagnetics (EM) based corrosion measurements have long been considered as viable non-destructive diagnostic means. For nested multi-casing evaluation, the quantitative data inversion and analysis requires a thorough understanding and modeling of the underlying measurement physics. We propose a model-based parametric inversion methodology for quantitative evaluation of multiple nested casings using multi-spacing and multi-frequency induction measurements, to determine effective thicknesses of individual pipes and take into account variations in casing conductivity and permeabilities. Axi-symmetric finite-element forward modeling is used in the inversion loop to match the tool responses allowing us to include the sensor details in the model. The presence of casing collars and ubiquitous <b>eccentering</b> of individual casings affects the tool responses and reduce the effectiveness of elementary interpretation schemes (often based on remote field eddy current concept and aimed primarily at providing the total metal loss). To quantify the effect of casing and measurement tool <b>eccentering,</b> we performed comprehensive 3 - D finite-element modeling. The sensitivity and data resolution analysis is used to evaluate individual measurement importance and optimize the inversion based methodology. The workflow is capable of handling arbitrary number of nested casings and raises a QC flag for <b>eccentered</b> casings based on the reconstruction quality of short spacing measurements. Model covariance matrix from the inversion is used to quantify the inverted parameter uncertainty while the extended data resolution matrix concept is applied to extract information about the measurement channel reconstruction. The proposed methodology has been successfully validated on synthetic data and lab measurements...|$|R
40|$|Cased {{petroleum}} wells must be logged {{to determine}} the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the cement. Ultrasonic logging of single casings has been widely studied and is commercially available. However, ultrasonic logging in multiple-casing geometries is an unexplored topic despite its importance in plug and abandonment operations. Therefore, current logging technologies should be studied to evaluate whether they indicate the potential for multiple-casing logging. In this study, we used two finite-element models of pulse-echo logging. The first model represents logging in the transverse cross section of a double-casing well. The second model is {{a copy of the}} first, but with the outer casing and formation removed so that the pulse-echo transducer receives only a resonant first interface echo from the inner casing. By subtracting the received signals of the second model from those of the first, we can recover the third interface echo (TIE) signal representing the resonant reflection from the outer casing. This signal is used to study what information can, in principle, be drawn from TIEs in double-casing geometries, with the caveat that TIEs can only approximately be recovered in practical cases. We simulated variations of the material in the annulus beyond the outer casing, of the thickness of the outer casing, and of the <b>eccentering</b> of the outer casing. We have determined that the first two of these variations have only weak effects on the TIE, but that the <b>eccentering</b> of the outer casing can, in principle, be found using the TIE arrival time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A finite-volume (FV) {{technique}} is introduced to model directional resistivity logging sensors that employ tilted-coil antennas in 3 -D anisotropic earth formations. The algorithm {{is based on}} a coupled scalar–vector potential formulation on a 3 -D cylindrical staggered grid. The choice of discretization enforces the correct continuity equations across material boundaries, avoids spurious modes, and leads to a better conditioned system matrix. In order to model situations where the sensor tool axis does not coincide with the borehole axis (<b>eccentered</b> tools), a locally conformal FV scheme is also implemented. The proposed FV formulation is validated against pseudoanalytical solutions (in cases where the latter is applicable), showing very good agreement, and utilized to investigate the effects of the drill collar (borehole), anisotropy, and azimuthal rotations on the response of directional resistivity sensors.

40|$|We propose and {{investigate}} an "interface-flattening" transformation, hinging upon Transformation Optics (T. O.) techniques, {{to facilitate the}} rigorous analysis of electromagnetic (EM) fields radiated by sources embedded in tilted, cylindrically-layered geophysical media. Our method addresses the major challenge in such problems of appropriately approximating the domain boundaries in the computational model while, in a full-wave manner, predicting the effects of tilting in the layers. When incorporated into standard pseudo-analytical algorithms, moreover, the proposed method is quite robust, as it is not limited by absorption, anisotropy, and/or <b>eccentering</b> profile of the cylindrical geophysical formations, nor is it limited by the radiation frequency. These attributes of the proposed method are in contrast to past analysis methods for tilted-layer media that often place limitations on the source and medium characteristics. Through analytical derivations {{as well as a}} preliminary numerical investigation, we analyze and discuss the method's strengths and limitations.

40|$|Modeling and {{understanding}} the complex elastic-wave physics prevalent in fluid-elastic cylindrically-layered structures is of importance in many NDE fields, and most pertinently {{in the domain of}} well integrity evaluation in the oil and gas industry. It is believed that acoustical measurements provide one of the effective means to provide a diagnosis. Historically, the problem has been researched and addressed to a good extent for well intervals with a single steel string. For these cases, high-frequency ultrasonic imaging has been optimized and demonstrated to yield acceptable diagnosis of the annulus properties behind the first string the signal encounters. However, they fail to provide information about the outer annulus in a double or triple string geometry. To probe with more effective radial depth, lower-frequency signals are used. In a typical double-string configuration, the inner casing is <b>eccentered</b> with respect to the outer string which itself is also <b>eccentered</b> within the cylindrical hole. The annuli {{may or may not be}} filled with solid cement, and the cement may have liquid-filled channels or be disbonded over localized azimuthal ranges. The complexity of wave propagation along axial intervals is significant in that multiple modes can be excited and detected with characteristics that are affected by the various parameters in a non-linear fashion. To gain understanding of the complex wave physics and leverage it to design effective diagnosis means, we have developed modeling capabilities that address the configurations of interest. In this talk, we first establish a mathematical framework to analyze the guided wave fields in a multi-string system embedded in infinite media. We then develop and implement a Chirp Sweeping Finite Element Modeling (CSFEM) method to investigate the dispersions and modal characteristics of the complex propagating signals synthesized over an axial array of receivers. The CSFEM provides for a flexible framework to study the modal sensitivities in a multi-string system with arbitrary eccentricity, azimuthal heterogeneities, and partial bonded interfaces. We have also conducted scaled laboratory experiments to acquire reference data used to verify the range of validity of the modeling approach in predicting the guided modal characteristics of axially-propagating waves in concentric and non-concentric cylindrical structures immersed in fluid. An acoustic transmitter having four selectable, active elements at 90 degrees apart allows sourcing of all guided modes of interest and is located at one end of the string length. Received waveforms are acquired from a single receiver which is scanned axially and circumferentially inside the inner string. The acquired data set is then analyzed for spectral modal content using both Slowness-Time-Coherence and Matrix Pencil methods and compared to theoretical predictions. The comparisons indicate good agreement and provide confidence in the CSFEM capability to accurately predict the complex wave field dispersion characteristics estimated from the experimentally acquired signals in the fluid-filled double string geometries...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{physical}} property data determined aboard ship and by downhole logging correlate to a varying degree {{with each other}} depending on lithology and the parameter determined. Compressional-wave velocity values determined on board are of low reliability because they are heavily affected by drilling disturbance. The disturbance is probably related {{to the opening of}} microcracks during drilling. For porosity (and inversely related wet-bulk density) the pattern of divergence between laboratory and downhole measurements seems to be related to lithology. Major differences between on-board and in-situ determinations occur in mud-dominated intervals and are probably due to inaccurate logging measurements. These probably result from tool stand-off in the soft sediments rather than mineralogical effects. The sonic log-derived porosities appear to be accurate, independent of lithology, although this conclusion must remain tentative because of poor core recovery within the silt-rich turbidite intervals. An independent check of the accuracy of the various techniques for measuring porosity and wet-bulk density is provided by the compression test results. These results are in good agreement with all logging data in silt-dominated intervals and in good agreement with sonic log data and laboratory data only in the mud-dominated sections. These results indicate that, until the techniques for <b>eccentering</b> the neutron and density tools are improved, only the sonic and resistivity logs should be used for porosity determinations in these high-porosity sediments. Because the applicability of the resistivity and sonic-velocity transforms for logging signals remain uncertain, core measurements are necessary for calibrations...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of aging oil field in the North Sea is increasing, {{the number of}} plug and {{abandonment}} (P&A) jobs which has to be conducted on the wells going out of production, e. g. to prevent hydrocarbons from leaking out of the reservoirs, are increasing with it. In the planning of a P&A job, the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the sealing material in a cased well must be logged. In this thesis some of the ultrasonic evaluation tools currently used {{to ensure that a}} well cementing job has been properly executed will be presented together with two of the widely used techniques in ultrasonic logging, in particular the pulse-echo technique and the pitch-catch technique. Even though the ultrasonic pitch-catch technique is widely used in well logging and is commercially available, little research has been done on the use of this technique in an environment with multiple casings. A finite-element simulation model were constructed for a double-casing environment, and a set of ultrasonic measurements were performed to give an experimental verification to the simulation model. The simulations were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics and the ultrasonic experiments in this thesis were conducted on the Statoil-funded Behind Casing Logging Set-Up (BeCaLoS) developed by SINTEF Petroleum Research, designed to replicate the steel casing setup in an oil well. It was found from the simulations that a train of leaky Lamb wave packets is excited on both casings in the double-casing environment. Through the ultrasonic experiments the excitation of the Lamb wave packet trains on the plate was experimentally verified. Three sets of pitch-catch measurements were conducted by moving the receiver in a grid parallel to the plate to measure the Lamb wave spreading in the plate, each with a different setup for the lower plate. The tilting of the lower plate in the experimental setup, replicating the situation of casing <b>eccentering,</b> could be detected through these sets of pitch-catch measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Rousse field, {{located in}} the Lacq basin in the {{southwest}} of France, is a site for a pilot carbon dioxide (CO 2) storage project operated by Total. Since 2010, CO 2 has been injected into a depleted gas field {{at a depth of}} 4. 5 km through RSE- 1, a 45 -year old production well converted to an injection well. Older wells are commonly recognized as the most likely pathway for CO 2 to migrate from the injection zone to other zones or to the surface. A number of factors could increase the potential risk for these wells: completions and production history may have created defects in the sealing elements (cement, steel and elastomers); the history itself may not be known in sufficient detail to estimate a reliable risk figure and finally the injected or produced fluids may have corroded the structure. Old wells, whether they are converted to injectors or are {{in the path of the}} injection pressure field, could require renewed evaluation and preventive repairs as part of the field-level containment management plan, if their integrity assessment request so. As part of the due diligence process, advanced cement and steel evaluation logging tools were run in the RSE- 1 well to investigate the bottom kilometer of the two kilometer-thick caprock. The 3 D integrity map produced by the acoustic logging tools was analyzed for the presence of connected defects (pathways) that could lead to unwanted CO 2 migration. The logs were also compared to the original 40 year old low-resolution sonic log to assess the extent of degradation, if any. A particular issue for wells drilled before the 1990 's, when technological advances almost eliminated the problem, is that of mud channels left behind during the cement placement process. These defects present the highest risk because of their relatively large flow area. Since the well was completed in 1967, special attention was paid to the occurrence, connectivity and extent of channels. Even though imaging of the cemented annulus revealed an <b>eccentered</b> casing, almost lying on the rock face, and an oval borehole, the few mud pockets trapped between casing and rock were confirmed to be intermittent, with good cement providing hydraulic isolation between them. The comparison of the through-casing caliper to the formation sonic log enabled identification of borehole breakouts, caused by stres...|$|R
