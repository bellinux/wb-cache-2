The changes in this note are the specification of allodynia and the inclusion of hyperalgesia explicitly.

40|$|Chronic neuropathic pain affects {{millions}} of individuals worldwide, is typically long-lasting, and remains poorly treated with existing therapies. Neuropathic pain arising from peripheral nerve lesions {{is known to}} be dependent on the emergence of spontaneous and evoked hyperexcitability in damaged nerves. Here, we report that the potassium channel subunit Kv 9. 1 is expressed in myelinated sensory neurons, but is absent from small unmyelinated neurons. Kv 9. 1 expression was strongly and rapidly downregulated following axotomy, with a time course that matches the development of spontaneous activity and pain hypersensitivity in animal models. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Kv 9. 1 in naive rats led to neuropathic pain behaviors. Diminished Kv 9. 1 function also augmented myelinated sensory neuron excitability, manifested as spontaneous firing, hyper-responsiveness to stimulation, and persistent after-discharge. Intracellular recordings from ex vivo dorsal root ganglion preparations revealed that Kv 9. 1 knock-down was linked to lowered firing thresholds and increased firing rates under physiologically relevant conditions of extracellular potassium accumulation during prolonged activity. Similar neurophysiological changes were detected in animals subjected to traumatic nerve injury and provide an explanation for neuropathic pain symptoms, including poorly understood conditions such as <b>hyperpathia</b> and paresthesias.

We previously reported that mice bearing a transgene-expressing mutant SPTLC 1 (tgSPTLC 1 (C 133 W)) show {{a reduction in}} SPT activity and <b>hyperpathia</b> at 10 months of age. Now analyzed at a later age, we find these mice develop sensory loss with a distal small fiber neuropathy and peripheral myelinopathy. This phenotype is largely reversed when these mice are crossed with transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type SPTLC 1 showing that the mutant SPTLC 1 protein is not inherently toxic. Simple loss of SPT activity also cannot account for the HSAN 1 phenotype, since heterozygous SPTLC 1 knock-out mice have reduced SPT activity but are otherwise normal.

40|$|Hereditary sensory and {{autonomic}} neuropathy type 1 (HSAN 1) causes sensory {{loss that}} predominantly affects the lower limbs, often preceded by <b>hyperpathia</b> and spontaneous shooting or lancinating pain. It {{is caused by}} several missense mutations in the genes encoding 2 of the 3 subunits of the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The mutant forms of the enzyme show a shift from their canonical substrate l-serine to the alternative substrate l-alanine. This shift leads to increased formation of neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids (dSLs). Our initial analysis showed that in HEK cells transfected with SPTLC 1 mutants, dSL generation was modulated in vitro {{in the presence of}} various amino acids. We therefore examined whether in vivo specific amino acid substrate supplementation influenced dSL levels and disease severity in HSAN 1. In mice bearing a transgene expressing the C 133 W SPTLC 1 mutant linked to HSAN 1, a 10 % l-serine–enriched diet reduced dSL levels. l-serine supplementation also improved measures of motor and sensory performance as well as measures of male fertility. In contrast, a 10 % l-alanine–enriched diet increased dSL levels and led to severe peripheral neuropathy. In a pilot study with 14 HSAN 1 patients, l-serine supplementation similarly reduced dSL levels. These observations support the hypothesis that an altered substrate selectivity of the mutant SPT is key to the pathophysiology of HSAN 1 and raise the prospect of l-serine supplementation as a first treatment option for this disorder...|$|E

The study has highlighted the value of regular muscle charting and has cast doubt on previous neuroanatomical assumptions about the syndrome. Central cord syndrome is the commonest of the incomplete traumatic cervical cord syndromes, the others being the Brown-S#{ 233 }quard syndrome and the anterior cord syndrome. As originally defined by Schneider, Cherry and Pantek (1954), the central cord syndrome is characterised by motor impairment which is disproportionately greater in the upper limbs than in the lower, by bladder dysfunction (most often urinary retention) and by a variable degree of sensory loss below the level of the cord lesion. These authors and others (Taylor and Blackwood 1948) found the syndrome to be most common in older subjects with cervical spondylosis and hyperextension injuries.

Such patients accounted for 15 % of the failures (6 out of 40 failures) in our series. In an attempt to improve patient selection, we reviewed our patients considering a number of parameters in order to determine risk factors for unpleasant paresthesiae elicited by paresthesiae-producing DBS. The results showed that this response happenned only in patients with brain central pain complaining of evoked pain, secondary to a supratentorial lesion. Age, sex, duration of pain, quality of the steady pain, size of the causative lesion and site (VC,ML,IC) and type (micro or macroelectrode) of surgical exploration were not important factors. Unpleasant paresthesiae in response to dorsal column stimulation, restricted thalamic lesion on computed tomography and the occurrence of associated intermittent pain were considered major risk factors in this subset of patients and the presence of cold allodynia or <b>hyperpathia</b> in isolation and the absence of sensory loss were considered minor risk factors.

40|$|Introduction Neuropathic pain {{in cancer}} {{patients}} requires a focused clinical evaluation based on knowledge of common neuropathic pain syndromes. Definition Neuropathic pain is a non-nociceptive pain or "differentiation" pain, which suggests abnormal production of impulses by neural tissue that {{is separated from}} afferent input. Impulses arise from the peripheral nervous system or central nervous system. Causes of neuropathic pain due to malignancy Neuropathic pain is caused directly by cancer-related pathology (compression/infiltration of nerve tissue, combination of compression/infiltration) or by diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (surgical procedures, chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Mechanisms Pathophysiological mechanisms are very complex and still not clear enough. Neuropathic pain is generated by electrical hyperactivity of neurons along the pain pathways. Peripheral mechanisms (primary sensitization of nerve endings, ectopically generated action potentials within damaged nerves, abnormal electrogenesis within sensory ganglia) and central mechanisms (loss of input from peripheral nociceptors into dorsal horn, aberrant sprouting within dorsal horn, central sensitization, loss of inhibitory interneurons, mechanisms at higher centers) are involved. Diagnosis The quality of pain presents as spontaneous pain (continuous and paroxysmal), abnormal pain (allodynia, hyperalgesia, <b>hyperpathia),</b> paroxysmal pain. Clinical manifestations Clinically, neuropathic pain is described as the pain in the peripheral nerve (cranial nerves, other mononeuropathies, radiculopathy, plexopathy, paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy) and relatively infrequent, central pain syndrome. Therapy Treatment of neuropathic pain remains a challenge for clinicians, {{because there is no}} accepted algorithm for analgesic treatment of neuropathic pain. Pharmacotherapy is considered to be the first line therapy. Opioids combined with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs are warrented. If patient is relatively unresponsive to an opioid, a trial with adjuvant analgesics might be considered. Tricyclic antidepressants might be selected for patients with continuous dysesthesia, and anticonvulsants might be used if the pain is predominanty lancinating or paroxysmal. The complexity of neuropathic syndromes and underlying etiologic mechanisms warrant clinical trials to determine appropriate treatment...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the posterior limb of the internal capsule was performed in seven patients with central pain due to vascular lesions of the thalamus or due to multiple sclerosis. Three patients suffered from thalamic hemorrhage and three others from thalamic infarction, and one from multiple sclerosis. These patients developed dysesthesia, <b>hyperpathia</b> and spontaneous burning pain several months after {{the onset of the}} disorders. The severe pain was not relieved by any anticonvulsant, psychopharmacological drug or analgesic drug, nor even by the intrathecal infusion of morphine. Stimulating electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the posterior limb of the internal capsule 25 mm lateral to the posterior commissure for one-week stimulation trials. The patients reported pain relief and sensations such as warmth or comfortableness in the appropriate portion of the body during the electrical stimulation with a square pulse of 2 - 3 v, 0. 2 msec, 50 Hz. In the patients whose pain was relieved successfully, a receiving unit manufactured by Medtronic Co. was internalized for transduced transcutaneous stimulation. The patient with multiple sclerosis felt no pain relief during {{stimulation of}} either the posterior limb of the internal capsule or the posterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus, so the electrode was removed. Satisfactory relief of pain was obtained by 30 minute stimulation twice or three times a day for 10 to 14 days after surgery. Long-term observations from three months to two years showed that three patients had good results (incomplete pain relief with the stimulator with no medication required), two had fair results (incomplete pain relief with the stimulator with small doses of medication) and another had poor results in which the pain recurred within one month. No remarkable side effects were seen. These results indicate that internal capsule stimulation is more effective and lasts longer than the various ablative methods to relieve central pain. The mechanism of pain relief by internal capsule stimulation was discussed briefly...|$|E
