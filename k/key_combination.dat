Cook had hidden a secret congratulations screen in the game for players who entered a specific keyboard <b>key</b> <b>combination</b> at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, Gumball protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E

Many standard Unix <b>key</b> <b>combinations</b> were designed with the QWERTY layout and the ADM-3A's original Ctrl key placement in mind. Many of those <b>key</b> <b>combinations</b> are still in use today, even on non-Unix operating systems. Seasoned computer users familiar with the original layout often claim that the different position of the Ctrl key on modern PC keyboard layouts makes the use of Ctrl <b>key</b> <b>combinations</b> more cumbersome. Solutions exist for many operating systems to switch around the Caps Lock and Ctrl keys in software, thus making the PC keyboard layout more closely resemble the ADM-3A's keyboard layout.|$|R
