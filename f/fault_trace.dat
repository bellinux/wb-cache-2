5|$|The San Andreas Fault has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial Fault and the San Jacinto Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the San Jacinto Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of the San Andreas Fault during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon lies {{astride the}} Dead Sea Transform, which forms {{part of the}} {{boundary}} between the Arabian Plate and the African Plate. In Lebanon the fault zone forms a restraining bend associated with a right stepping offset of the <b>fault</b> <b>trace.</b> Transpressional deformation associated with this bend has formed a number of thrust faults, such as the recently identified Mount Lebanon thrust, which underlies the city and is interpreted to crop out at the seabed offshore.|$|E
500|$|Rocks are {{classified}} as precarious if their toppling accelerations are [...]3g or less and semi-precarious at [...]3–.5g. The area around the White Wolf fault was surveyed {{by a group of}} earth scientists with extensive experience estimating thousands of rock formations. The toppling accelerations of many rocks were assessed by the three geologists, with individual estimates usually agreeing within [...]1g. On the foot wall side, many precarious and semi-precarious rock formations were observed and allowed for peak ground acceleration to be estimated at [...]5g (within a kilometer of the <b>fault</b> <b>trace)</b> while rock shattering and a lack of precarious rocks on the hanging wall side suggested a value near 1g had been experienced {{at the time of the}} shock.|$|E

40|$|Several new active <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> were {{identified}} along Katrol Hill Fault (KHF). A new fault (named as Bhuj Fault, BF) that extends into the Bhuj Plain was also identified. These <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> {{were identified}} based on satellite photo interpretation and field survey. Trenches were excavated {{to identify the}} paleoseismic events, pattern of faulting {{and the nature of}} deformation. New active <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> were recognized about 1 km north of the topographic boundary between the Katrol Hill and the plain area. The fault exposure along the left bank of Khari River with 10 m wide shear zone in the Mesozoic rocks and showing displacement of the overlying Quaternary deposits is indicative of continued tectonic activity along the ancient fault. The E-W trending active <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> along the KHF in the western part changes to NE-SW or ENE-WSW near Wandhay village. Trenching survey across a low scarp near Wandhay village reveals three major fault strands F 1, F 2, and F 3. These fault strands displaced the older terrace deposits comprising Sand, Silt and Gravel units along with overlying younger deposits from units 1 to 5 made of gravel, sand and silt. Stratigraphic relationship indicates at least three large magnitude earthquakes along KHF during Late Holocene or recent historic past. 1...|$|R
500|$|Many erratic surface {{fractures}} {{were generated}} in the San Joaquin Valley along the White Wolf Fault. The cracks were not well-defined, and {{were the result of}} the disturbance of the alluvium that makes up the valley floor, rather than cracking along the <b>fault</b> <b>trace.</b> Northeast trending cracks ranging from hairline-width to near five inches wide were seen between Arvin and California State Route 166, and some showed clear lateral offset, but those were determined to be localized effects. Some of the fractures in the ground were aligned with the fault, and some were perpendicular to the general trend, but the more significant breaks were believed to be a direct result of faulting at depth. This was true in the mountainous areas as well, but some of the breaks at the higher elevations were probably related to slumping. The northeast trending breaks were described in a report from the State of California (that was prepared by well-known geologists and seismologists) as [...] "thrusting of the southeast block up and over the northwest block, and/or a lateral movement of the southeast block to the northeast".|$|E

2500|$|Where plate {{boundaries}} {{occur within}} the continental lithosphere, deformation is {{spread out over}} a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In {{the case of the}} San Andreas fault continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> (e.g., the [...] "Big bend" [...] region). The Northridge earthquake was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates where it runs through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself. This is demonstrated by earthquake focal mechanisms.|$|E
30|$|Iterative {{revision}} of mapped <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> and cross sections is required. Downhole lithologic {{data and the}} interpreted locations of surface <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> guide seismic reflection interpretation, potential field modeling, and construction of cross sections (Fig.  4). Conversely, seismic reflection data and potential field modeling are used to clarify uncertainties in the structural interpretation made from lithologic logs. Mapped surface <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> and <b>faults</b> interpreted from the subsurface data are correlated, and faults evident in subsurface data but unexposed or obscured at the surface {{are added to the}} 2 D map. Along-strike correlation between multiple across-strike cross sections is critical. Potential field anomalies and horizontal potential field gradients are interpreted to aid in along-strike fault correlations. Faults spanning multiple across-strike cross sections are noted, so that the along-strike variation in fault offset and fault dip are internally consistent. We have found that importing cross sections into 3 D space is an efficient method to correlate fault geometry and offset along strike. Subsequently, the 2 D cross sections are modified and re-projected in 3 D space for additional quality control.|$|R
30|$|The above {{previous}} GNSS studies {{mainly focused}} on the current tectonics {{for the whole of}} or southwest Japan. However, in order to investigate strain accumulation for each fault, a more detailed model reflecting surface <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> is preferable.|$|R
30|$|Before the earthquake, no active <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> {{had been}} {{recognized}} in the source region. However, immediately after the earthquake, several fault surface breaks were observed (e.g., Ishiyama et al. 2008; Maruyama et al. 2009), suggesting a west-northwest dipping reverse fault with north-northeast strike.|$|R
2500|$|The Pacific Plate {{is a major}} {{section of}} the Earth's crust, {{gradually}} expanding by the eruption of magma along the East Pacific Rise to the southeast. It is also being subducted far to the northwest into the Aleutian Trench. [...] In California, the plate is sliding northwestward along a transform boundary, the San Andreas Fault, toward the subduction zone. At the same time, the North American Plate is moving southwestward, but relatively southeast along the fault. The westward component of the North American Plate's motion results in some compressive force along the San Andreas and its associated faults, thus helping lift the Pacific Coast Ranges and other parallel inland ranges {{to the west of}} the Central Valley, in this region most notably the Diablo Range. The Hayward Fault shares the same relative motions of the San Andreas. As with portions of other faults, a large extent of the Hayward <b>Fault</b> <b>trace</b> is formed from a narrow complex zone of deformation which can span hundreds of feet in width.|$|E

30|$|The surface {{ruptures}} generally appeared along previously recognized <b>fault</b> <b>traces,</b> but did {{not always}} follow them precisely (Figs.  1 c, 3 a, 4 a, 5 a). Large dextral strike-slip displacements of about 200  cm occurred along the 12 -km-long central section of the Futagawa segment, accompanied by significant normal slip in the middle part of the section. Surface ruptures of the southwestern and northeastern sections of the Futagawa segment were characterized by arrays of releasing stepovers 7 – 8  km long and 2.5  km wide that diverged toward {{the ends of the}} segment, unlike the continuous curvilinear traces that were previously mapped there (e.g., Ikeda et al. 2001) (Fig.  4 a). Especially in the southwestern section, stepovers of the ruptures appeared where <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> were indistinct in the previous fault maps. This reflects the difficulty of mapping active faults where their distribution is complex.|$|R

30|$|By {{referring}} to the observed surface ruptures {{as well as the}} InSAR images, we set the surface traces of the two faults as shown in Figs.  1 and 2. The strikes of the Futagawa and Hinagu faults are taken to be 232 ° and 203 °, respectively. The length of the Futagawa and Hinagu faults is 40 and 20  km, respectively, and the depth of the faults is 16  km. Because of intensive surface deformation, we do not use the InSAR data within about 2  km from the model <b>fault</b> <b>traces.</b> We focus on the broad feature of fault slip distribution by neglecting very complicated deformation near the <b>fault</b> <b>traces.</b> As for basis functions, we use bicubic B-splines with an interval of 2  km in both (horizontal and depth) directions. In the computation of Green’s function, we assume a homogenous elastic half-space of a Poisson solid with a rigidity of 3.43  ×  1010  Pa.|$|R
