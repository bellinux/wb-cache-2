5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E

50|$|Gunner entered {{office in}} a {{formidable}} position. He won the third-largest majority government in Territory history (just percentage points behind Labor's 2005 landslide), and faced only two CLP members as opposition − <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> the <b>five</b> independents in the chamber. Although Labor was technically the only official party in the legislature, Gunner pledged that the CLP would be properly resourced as an opposition.|$|R
50|$|The same {{treatise}} {{outlines the}} option of undertaking <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> all <b>five</b> precepts, though nearly all modern ceremonies involve undertaking all five precepts. Certainly, committing more skillful and fewer unskillful actions is beneficial. But before entering nirvana, the Buddha said his disciples should take the precepts as their teacher, so few ceremonies are held for partial precept undertaking. There are exceptions, however.|$|R

50|$|The {{main power}} grid {{connecting}} the area transects the property along Highway 16. In addition, a power sub station occurs within two kilometres of the property, opening {{the potential for}} simple, low-cost power for the project. Surface rights {{in the area are}} controlled by a <b>few</b> (less <b>than</b> <b>five)</b> local residents that have thus far been cooperative with the exploration efforts. Also transacting the property is a natural gas pipeline. Natural gas is an important component used to drive energy for a Mo roaster facility, should the project ever warrant the development of one.|$|R
50|$|Subitizing {{refers to}} the rapid and {{accurate}} enumeration of small numbers of items. Numerous studies (dating back to 1871) have demonstrated that subjects can very quickly and accurately report the quantity of objects randomly presented on a display, when they number <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> around <b>five.</b> While larger quantities require subjects to count or estimate — at great expense of time and accuracy — it seems that a different enumeration method is employed in these low-quantity cases. In 1949, Kaufman, Lord, Reese and Volkmann coined the term 'subitizing' to describe the phenomenon.|$|R
25|$|Although up {{to fifty}} percent of {{deafness}} has genetic causes, <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> percent of deaf people have a deaf parent, so Deaf communities are unusual among cultural groups in that most members do not acquire their cultural identities from parents.|$|E

25|$|This is {{at least}} in part a matter of {{deliberate}} policy – concerns that high rise development might compromise the essential character of the city centre have led to strictly enforced building regulations that restrict the height of new structures in the city, so that most buildings in the CBD have <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> storeys.|$|E
5000|$|Strengths-only is not viable: They cite {{research}} that <b>few</b> have more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> strengths (defined as competencies where one {{is stronger than}} other managers) and that those five typically aren't {{in areas that are}} aligned with business needs.

5000|$|Following a July 1940 {{conference in}} Kiel, the Abwehr (German intelligence) began an espionage {{campaign}} against Britain involving intelligence gathering and sabotage. Spies were sent over from Europe in various ways; some parachuted or came off a submarine. Others entered {{the country on}} false passports or posing as refugees. Public perception in Britain was {{that the country was}} full of well trained German spies, who were deeply integrated into society. There was widespread [...] "spy-mania", as Churchill put it. The truth was that between September and November 1940 <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> twenty <b>five</b> agents arrived in the country; mostly of Eastern European extraction, badly trained and poorly motivated.|$|R

[...] More than 90% of employees in self-governing firms, and two-thirds in the informed-acquiescence category, agreed that [...] "good ideas are readily adopted by my company."

Of these, only Coppell and Bruce left of their own accord, with Coppell's departure brought about by a personality clash and Bruce's resignation leading to a high court case.|$|R
