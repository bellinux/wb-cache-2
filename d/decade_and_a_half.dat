5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

5|$|It {{had taken}} a <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979.

The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to the Bronx River, and nearly a <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> after the parkway was deeded land.

5|$|The nearly <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development {{for most of}} the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less {{than it had been in}} the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} results of research {{into some of the}} subtle and not-so-subtle factors that govern slow magnetic relaxation in lanthanide and actinide complexes. Single-molecule magnetism is only now entering its third decade, while the lanthanides and actinides in particular have only {{been a part of the}} field for about the last <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> respectively. Within this time, the study of slow magnetic relaxation in f-element systems has proven to be <b>a</b> rich <b>and</b> complex area of research. Chapter 1 sets out to provide some historical context for the state of the f-elements in the field today as well as to highlight some of the most impressive systems in the literature. Some of the themes introduced in Chapter 1 will be relevant to the research discussed in subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 describes the detailed magnetic characterization of U(H 2 BPz 2) 3, only the second actinide molecule found to exhibit slow magnetic relaxation, in magnetically dilute form. The results of variable-temperature and variable-field ac susceptibility measurements reveal that dipolar interactions are implicit in speeding up molecular slow relaxation and also facilitate very slow intermolecular relaxation that leads to magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures. When placed in the context of some relevant literature, {{the results of}} this study suggest that the intermolecular relaxation and observed hysteresis may be unrecognized, though common, phenomena among low-nuclearity U(III) molecules exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation. Chapter 3 describes a detailed study of the role of donor atom influence and dipolar interactions on slow magnetic relaxation in two series of uranium and lanthanide compounds with nitrogen and carbon donor atoms, respectively. Through a combination of magnetic susceptibility characterization and lanthanide M 5, 4 -edge XANES, EPR, and 1 H NMR spectroscopies, it is found that the carbon donor facilitates slower magnetic relaxation for all metal ions in the investigated temperature and frequency range. Thus, in addition to symmetry, the identity of the donor atom is revealed to be another tunable parameter in the design of f-element complexes exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation. Chapter 4 describes full magnetic characterization of concentrated and magnetically dilute samples of the bis(cyclooctatetraenide) complex [Er(COT) 2]−. The high symmetry ligand field afforded by the two (COT) 2 − groups leads to exceptionally slow magnetic relaxation for Er(III), with magnetic blocking at 9. 25 K and magnetic hysteresis as high as 10 K. Magnetic dilution also leads to an unprecedented opening of the hysteresis loop for this molecule at low temperatures, demonstrating that dipolar or intermolecular interactions can affect slow magnetic relaxation in some anomalous ways, by analogy with Chapter 2. Finally, Chapter 5 changes gears slightly and investigates slow magnetic relaxation in the series of (N 2) 3 − radical-bridged complexes {[(Me 3 Si) 2 N) 2 Ln(THF) ] 2 (μ-N 2) K} (for Ln = Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III)). Inner-sphere coordination of the K+ counter-ion in these complexes leads to bending of the Ln-radical-Ln unit, which is planar in the previously reported parent complexes {[(Me 3 Si) 2 N) 2 Ln(THF) ] 2 (μ-N 2) }− exhibiting an outer-sphere potassium ion. While the parent complexes hold records for both blocking temperature and magnetic coupling strength, bending of the core in {[(Me 3 Si) 2 N) 2 Ln(THF) ] 2 (μ-N 2) K} introduces non-negligible intramolecular lanthanide-lanthanide coupling that competes with the lanthanide-radical interaction. This competition results in depressed magnetic moments and faster magnetic relaxation for the anisotropic lanthanides, revealing that even a seemingly simple counter-ion can be used to tune slow magnetic relaxation...|$|R
