40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{prepared}} {{a series of}} graphene oxide (GO) <b>filled</b> <b>shape</b> memory polyurethane (SMPU) nanofibers and systematically investigated the morphological, thermal and mechanical properties, surface wettability, and the shape memory effect (SME) followed by the proposed programming model. The results show that GO can be well dispersed within the SMPU matrix, {{and the introduction of}} GO significantly improves the mechanical strength, surface wettability, and thermal stability of the SMPU. Compared with pristine SMPU nanofibrous mats, the prepared SMPU/GO nanofibrous mats have better SME and lower thermal shrinkage. When the loading amount of GO increased to 4. 0 wt%, the thermal shrinkage ratio (R ts) of composite nanofibrous mats could be as low as 4. 7 ± 0. 3 %, while the average fixation ratio (R f) and recovery ratio (Rr) could be as high as 92. 1 % and 96. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Research on complex shape {{recognition}} {{showed that}} the shape context algorithm is sensitive to relative position variation of articulation. Aimed at this problem, a shape recognition method is proposed based on local <b>shape</b> <b>filling</b> rate of various object silhouettes. We take each landmark point as a circle center and use r as its radius. Then, under a particular radius, the ratio between the covered silhouette pixels and the total pixels is defined as local <b>shape</b> <b>filling</b> rate. Thus, different radius may form different local <b>shape</b> <b>filling</b> rates. All landmark points with different radius will constitute a characteristic matrix which can effectively reflects the entire statistical property of the object shape. Experiments {{on a variety of}} shape databases show that the novel method is insensitive to articulation and less influenced by the number of landmark points, so our algorithm has strong power in describing object details. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Using {{collective}} differential operant conditioning, {{it could}} be shown that workers of the species Myrmica rubra distinguish different <b>filled</b> <b>shapes</b> of similar size (e. g. a black square from a black circle, a black triangle from a black circle, and a black triangle from a black square). They are unable to discriminate hollow shapes (e. g. a rectangle from an ellipse, or a lozenge from an ellipse) of similar size. When presented with hollow shapes, M. rubra workers rely more {{on the length of}} the perimeter than on the actual shape. A hollow lozenge and rectangle of identical height and width but with a different perimeter can be partly distinguished; hollow shapes of different height and width but identical perimeter are not at all discriminated. The visual perception ability in M. rubra is weaker than in M. ruginodis but superior to that in M. sabuleti; this assessment is consistent with the eye morphology and the navigation system of the three species.

40|$|Manual offline analysis, of a {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) image, is a time consuming process and requires continuous human intervention and efforts. This paper presents an image processing based method for automated offline analyses of SEM images. To this end, our strategy relies on a two-stage process, viz. texture analysis and quantification. The method involves a preprocessing step, aimed at the noise removal, {{in order to avoid}} false edges. For texture analysis, the proposed method employs a state of the art Curvelet transform followed by segmentation through a combination of entropy filtering, thresholding and mathematical morphology (MM). The quantification is carried out by the application of a box-counting algorithm, for fractal dimension (FD) calculations, with the ultimate goal of measuring the parameters, like surface area and perimeter. The perimeter is estimated indirectly by counting the boundary boxes of the <b>filled</b> <b>shapes.</b> The proposed method, when applied to a representative set of SEM images, not only showed better results in image segmentation but also exhibited a good accuracy in the calculation of surface area and perimeter.

40|$|Abstract: Nitromethane (NM or CH 3 NO 2) has a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} as a detonating homogeneous liquid explosive. Although, its use as a liquid propellant is more pronounced, the determination and characterization of NM and its mixtures for their various detonation properties has gained in importance. Various researchers have performed initiation studies of NM by shock and jet, and the presence of a superdetonation zone has also been debated. The opacity or otherwise of the reaction and detonation zones has been investigated experimentally. Sensitization or dilution of NM by various additives and the effect on the detonation behavior has also been investigated. In recent times, the use of NM as a field-filled homogeneous <b>filling</b> in <b>shaped</b> charges for the disposal of unexploded ordnance has gained in importance. The experimental observations and related theoretical aspects for the use of NM as a <b>filling</b> for <b>shaped</b> charges are illustrated in this article.
