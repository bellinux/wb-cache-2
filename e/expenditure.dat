40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} is to analyze {{structure}} {{and development of the}} mandatory <b>expenditures</b> in the Czech Republic in the period 1993 - 2013. The theoretical part deals with theories of public <b>expenditures</b> and public revenues in order to explain the importance of the mandatory <b>expenditures</b> in the scheme of Czech public finance. The second section of the theoretical part describes the features and legal framework with regard to the methodology of the Ministry of finance of the Czech Republic. The practical part of the thesis adopts the framework built in the theoretical part of the thesis. The most important <b>expenditures</b> are <b>expenditures</b> arising from law, which represent over 90 % of mandatory <b>expenditures.</b> The social transfers came into scrutiny because of special importance within this group of <b>expenditures.</b> The fastest growing <b>expenditures</b> within non-social transfers were debt-service <b>expenditures</b> caused by irresponsible fiscal policy of the government within the period. The other mandatory <b>expenditures</b> are divided into <b>expenditures</b> arising from other legal regulations, which are negligible, and into <b>expenditures</b> arising from treaties, which are very hard to cut down. The quasi-mandatory <b>expenditures,</b> involing defence spending and wages of employees of the public sector, were analysed in order to build up definition of mandatory <b>expenditures</b> in the broad sense, meaning sum of mandatory and quasi-mandatory <b>expenditures.</b> The last section of practical part of the thesis is devoted to comparing the development of the mandatory <b>expenditures</b> and mandatory <b>expenditures</b> in the broad sense with the development of important macroeconomic indicators, as GDP and inflation and total <b>expenditures</b> and revenues of the government budget.
