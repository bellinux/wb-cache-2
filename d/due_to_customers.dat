Bisexual DVDs sell much better online than in adult video stores, possibly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> in stores feeling embarrassed to buy them. Most bisexual porn is made by small production companies rather than the major studios.

50|$|EC's {{science fiction}} comics were {{never able to}} match the {{popularity}} of their horror comics like Tales from the Crypt, but Gaines and Feldstein kept them alive using the profits from their more popular titles. In the EC Library reprints, comics historian Mark Evanier theorizes that the short story format, where no story was longer than eight pages helped contribute to poor sales because the horror comics were much better suited for very short stories with shock endings than the science fiction comics. Evanier also ponders whether the very similar logo style of Weird Science and its companion comic Weird Fantasy as well as similar cover subjects contributed to lower sales <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> thinking they already owned the issues on sale. Historian Digby Diehl wondered whether having host characters like EC's horror comics would have helped the comics be more commercially successful.|$|E

50|$|AOL's {{entry into}} the PC market in 1991 marked the {{beginning}} of the end for CIS. AOL charged $2.95 an hour versus $5.00 an hour for Compuserve, until 1996, when AOL switched to a monthly subscription instead of hourly rates, so for active users it was much less expensive. AOL also used a GUI-based client, and while such systems existed for CIS, they only supported a subset of the system's functionality and were purchased separately. In response, CIS lowered their hourly rates on several occasions. The number of users grew, peaking at 3 million in April 1995. By this point AOL had over 20 million users in the United States alone, but this was off their peak of 27 million, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> leaving for lower-cost offerings. CIS finally introduced monthly pricing in late 1997, but by that time the number of users leaving all online services for dialup Internet service providers was reaching a crescendo.|$|E
40|$|Does {{expanding}} consumer {{awareness of}} new products explain firm growth, the industry life cycle, and aggregate profits? To explain industry and aggregate patterns, I introduce a mechanism by which consumers with heterogeneous pref-erences slowly become aware of differentiated products. Growing awareness gen-erates two countervailing forces on firm profits: 1) market power decreases due to more intense price competition; and 2) demand increases <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> sorting into their preferred firms. When aggregated, this information friction creates a wedge in an otherwise standard neoclassical growth model, which can help explain cyclical and secular changes in Tobin’s-Q and factor shares...|$|E

Most of the traditional models that are applied assume that customers buying a high-fare class ticket will not purchase a low-fare class ticket even if it is available. This is not a very realistic assumption and has led to revenue leakage <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> exhibiting buy-down behaviour. This paper aims at devising a suitable incentive mechanism that would incite the customer to reveal his nature. This helps in reducing revenue leakage. We show that the proposed incentive mechanism is profitable to both the buyer and seller and hence ensures the buyers participation in the mechanism.

40|$|Abstract—The P 2 P-based {{system for}} the {{distributed}} storing of session data of Internet service providers ’ access nodes called P 2 P-based storage platform is presented. Session data is continuously changing <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> connected to access nodes, i. e., it is highly volatile. However, {{it has to be}} stored persistently as it is required for data forwarding, traffic filtering, and deriving statistics. Failing access nodes must be able to restore their data after reentering the network. Today, the session data is stored in the access nodes ’ flash memory, which is limited in life time and size and intended for other purposes. Contrary, the P 2 P-based storage platform allows to store session data in the access nodes ’ available RAMs connected by the distributed hash table-based P 2 P network Kad. A Kad network consisting of 8, 000 access nodes for distributed storage of session data is setup for simulation. The simulation results show the traffic overhead to be minimal, linear scalability, and prove the high availability of the stored session data...|$|E

However, the creative variables {{that are related}} to successful branding through internet advertisement (IA) have yet to be validated quantitatively. This study adds to the growing body of literature on brand building by examining how some facilities of Internet Advertisement which have impact on brand building. The proposed characteristics of Internet Advertise which have been selected to identify the impact on brand building namely, customization facility, purchasing facility, style of Internet Advertisement, quick feedback and image of Internet Advertisement. The data was collected from different areas in Malaysia, among different type of respondents who used internet before. A total number of 591 responses have been finalized for the analysis. Multiples regression was employed as major analysis to test hypotheses. The present investigation was demonstrated that different styles of Internet Advertisement enhance the potentiality of IA. In addition, quick feedback also has significant effect on brand building. Surprisingly, image and purchasing capabilities have negative effect on brand building. It could be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> reluctant to purchase instantly after watching internet advertising...|$|E

Open source products and some vendor products outside the traditional ILS market allow libraries to pool data created by users– tags, reviews, comments–thus allowing the smallest libraries to harvest richer data than that of their own communities.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{computing}} market share in competitive service supply chains characterized by service congestion phenomena. Heterogenous customers choose services based on the utility maximization principle taking congestion into account. We use customer choice theory and infinite dimensional variational inequality to model the customer behavior and estimate service product’s market share. An extended Frank and Wolfe algorithm for solving this market share problem and a numerical example is given. The results shows that that service providers with poor service quality can also win some market share <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> ’ aversion to congestion. Service differs with manufacturing in many aspects: heterogeneity, perishability, invisibility, intangibility, and simultaneity [1, 2]. These inherent differences in services with manufacturing create an urgent need for service science theory and techniques specified for service industry. Lisa M. Ellram proposed service supply chain as a new framework to model the different scenario contrary to the conventional product supply chain [3]. Sampson [4] considers a bidirectional service supply chain as customers sometimes take part in service by self-service. Baltacioglu [5] proposed a new framework of service supply chain in which the supply chain is composed by raw material suppliers, service providers, and customers...|$|E
