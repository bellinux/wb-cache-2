Jones died in another attempt {{to go over the}} falls in an inflatable ball in 2017.|$|E

25|$|Surface {{dry suit}} users can face a similar {{inversion}} problem. The problem is more acute when {{not wearing a}} personal <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> (life vest) over the dry suit. For surface dry suit users, the inversion can be much more critical if no one is nearby to assist, since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe, and may also have water run down into their nose while inverted.|$|E

There were two more expansions in 1999 and 2002. 12 years later, the park announced that Splash Works {{would receive a}} new water slide, Typhoon, and an interactive aquatic playground.

500|$|When {{being used}} in a {{drafting}} operation from a pool, portable water tank, or other uncovered water source, the length of hard suction hose farthest from the pump is usually attached to a strainer, to keep foreign objects in the water from being pulled into and damaging the pump. [...] If used in a pond, stream, or other body of water, an appropriate <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> must be used to keep the strainer below the surface and above the bottom, so that neither mud nor air are sucked into the fire engine's pump. [...] When drafting from a solid-bottomed tank or pool, a strainer can safely rest on the bottom without suctioning mud into the fire engine's pump.|$|E
500|$|A report {{appeared}} {{following the}} battle of an interview with Mr. Yung, {{who claimed to have}} survived the Yangwu explosion having been stationed at the stern of the vessel. He explained that the ship had returned fire to the [...] before being hit by the spar torpedo, and orders were given to continue firing after the explosion. Fire from Hotchkiss guns on French vessels made this difficult. But, despite this Yangwu disabled the other torpedo boat. The Captain handed Yung a <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> and decided that the junior crew member should jump first, with the Captain following. As he swam away, Yung saw the Captain helping an engineer who had suffered severe burns but shortly afterwards the fore gunpowder magazine detonated, destroying the rest of the ship.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln {{returned}} to practicing law in Springfield, handling [...] "every {{kind of business}} that could come before a prairie lawyer". Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases {{in the midst of}} the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received a patent for a <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.|$|E

500|$|Hiram B. Shaw {{had just}} {{returned}} to the beach when this casualty occurred. After supplying his small rescue boat with more rope lines, he and Edward DeCourcy removed their outer clothing and prepared to embark. The men on the Cobb, who had just witnessed Waterhouse's drowning, prompted {{the captain of the}} schooner to give an impassioned address in which he said, [...] "They have sacrificed one man in their efforts to save us; now I'll risk my life in an attempt to get ashore." [...] The captain tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the water, just as the rescue boat had set out from shore. After battling against the current and waves, he was met by Shaw's rescue boat and clung to its stern until they reached land. Making use of the captain's line, the men on shore tied a life preserver to it. One at a time, the five stranded crewmen pulled the <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> out to the schooner, fastened it to their bodies and were pulled to safety by the people on the shore. [...] After receiving a cup of hot coffee, a drink of whiskey and a blanket, the Cobb's crew were taken to Coquina, Ormond Beach's area hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Although most pet {{life jackets}} are passive devices, {{there is at}} least one {{automatically}} inflated life jacket available for pets (made by Critter’s Inflatable, LLC). [...] An automatic <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> is generally more expensive than a foam life jacket, but, like automatic PFDs designed for humans, they are less bulky to wear when not inflated, and when inflated may provide more buoyancy than foam devices.

Manufacturers now offer wading boots with special rubber treads or metal studs. Breathable Gore-Tex waders provide ventilation when hiking along the water, but do not provide flotation {{in the event of}} slipping or falling into deep water. In deep water streams, an inflatable personal <b>flotation</b> <b>device</b> (PFD), or a Type III Kayak fishing vest, adds a degree of safety.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{describe}} the types and circumstances of traumatic work related fatalities in Australian commercial fishermen. METHODS [...] Work related traumatic fishing fatalities were studied {{as part of}} a larger study of all work related traumatic fatalities in Australia from 1982 to 1984. Data on 47 cases were obtained from inspection of coroners' files. RESULTS [...] The incidence of fatality of 143 / 100, 000 person-years was 18 times higher than the incidence of fatality for the entire workforce, and considerably higher than that of the mining and agricultural workforces. 68 % of decedents drowned and 13 % died from physical trauma. Rough weather, non-seaworthy vessels, inadequate use of personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices,</b> and inexperience were associated with many of the fatal incidents. DISCUSSION [...] Improved vessel and equipment maintenance, better training of workers, greater use of personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices,</b> and development of improved clothing and personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> are recommended...|$|R
