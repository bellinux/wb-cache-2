Both investors and managers respond to country returns and crises and adjust their investments substantially, for example, generating large reallocations during the global crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries during bad times and increasing it when conditions improve.

40|$|When an {{investor}} is allocating assets between <b>equities,</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> property, this allocation needs {{to provide a}} portfolio with an appropriate risk/return trade-off: for instance, a pension scheme may prefer a robust portfolio that holds its aggregate value {{in a number of}} different situations.

40|$|We analyze {{financial}} risk premiums and real economic dynamics in a DSGE model with {{three types of}} agents - shareholders, bondholders and workers - that differ in participation in the capital market {{and in terms of}} risk aversion. Aggregate productivity and distribution risk are shared among these agents via the bond market and via an efficient labor contract. The result is a combination of volatile returns to capital and a highly cyclical consumption process for the shareholders, which are two important ingredients for generating high and countercyclical risk premiums. These risk premiums are consistent with a strong propagation mechanism through an elastic supply of labor, rigid real wages and a countercyclical labor share. We discuss the implications for the real and nominal component of the risk premium on <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonds.</b> We show how these premiums react to changes in the volatility of the shocks, as experienced during the great moderation.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} investors were {{informed}} {{of the benefits of}} diversification and the reduction of systematic risk when property is included in an asset allocation portfolio. It also provided investors with information that will assist them in deciding on asset class allocations, specifically including real estate within a mixed-asset portfolio for both the short and long term. The method applied to answer the research questions started with a detailed literature review in order to gain a thorough understanding of the topic. The second part involved a quantitative approach. The South African Property Index (SAPI), All Share Index (ALSI) and All Bond Index (ALBI) total returns were analysed using descriptive statistics in order to gain knowledge about the return (mean) and risk (standard deviation) performances of the three asset data series. The final part analysed the allocation weights of assets in a mixed portfolio to determine the optimal portfolio weights to either reduce risk or enhance returns. It was found for the period under review that property quarterly returns outperformed <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonds.</b> The compound annual growth rate for the period was calculated and it was found that property had a growth rate of 26. 1 per cent, equity a growth rate of 17. 9 per cent and bonds a growth rate of 10. 9 per cent. The risk rate for property was also determined and it was higher than for <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonds.</b> The study also found a correlation between bonds and properties, meaning that adding bonds to a real estate portfolio would not give much diversification benefit. Equity to bonds had a negative correlation, showing diversification benefits of adding bonds to an equity portfolio. However, equity to property had a low correlation, meaning that adding property to an equity portfolio would reduce portfolio risk and increase returns. Should an investor not want to be exposed to more risk than simply holding one asset, namely bonds, a portfolio gives substantially higher returns without increasing the risk The study also observed the changes in the asset class returns during certain economic activities. Bonds were found to be the most resistant of the three asset classes and equity the most affected...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a {{fruitful}} way to account for prominent business cycle and asset pricing facts consists of introducing segmented markets into an otherwise standard business-cycle model with isoelastic preferences and elastic capital and labor supply. The key feature of our model is that households rebalance their financial portfolio allocations infrequently, as they face a fixed cost of transferring cash across accounts. The model generates reasonable business cycle properties and {{is consistent with the}} mean and volatility of the equity premium and risk-free rate, a nominal yield curve that is upward sloping on average, and the high volatility and predictability of excess returns on <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonds.</b> In this framework, long-term nominal debt is riskier than short-term debt, because the systematic response of monetary policy to current inflation induces long-run inflation risk, contributing to high and volatile term premia. ∗The views expressed in this paper are solely the responsibility of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or of any other person associated with the Federal Reserve System...|$|E
