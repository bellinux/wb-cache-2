40|$|Investigation of in vitro/in vivo {{behavior}} of <b>fast-dissolving</b> <b>tablets</b> containing solid dispersions of pioglitazone hydrochloride (PIO) {{is the focus}} of the present research work. The effect of various hydrophilic polymers on the aqueous solubility of PIO was studied. Poly vinyl pyrrolidine K 30 (PVPK 30) carrier was selected and solid dispersions were prepared by various methods. Evaluation of solid dispersion for percentage yield, drug content, solubility, and Fourier Transform Infrared-indicated kneading method was most appropriate. Furthermore, the dissolution studies exhibited an enhancement in drug dissolution. One-way ANOVA of in vitro data suggested that there was significant (P ≤ 0. 05) difference in dissolution profile of PIO solid dispersion when compared with pure drug and commercial product. Infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X-ray diffraction performed on solid dispersion indicated lack of physicochemical interaction between the drug and the carrier. The selected formulation is compressed into <b>fast-dissolving</b> <b>tablets</b> which were further evaluated for tablet properties and in vitro drug release. In vivo studies of pure drug, selected formulation, and marketed product were carried out in male Wistar rats and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Kinetica software 2000. The best formulation has shown T max of 1 hour which was highly significant (P < 0. 01) when compared with pure drug and marketed formulation. Therefore, the solid dispersions prepared by kneading method using PVPK 30 as hydrophilic carrier can be successfully used for improvement of dissolution of PIO and resulted in faster onset of action as indicated by in vivo studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design a ‘Traveller Friendly Drug Delivery System’ for PM-HCl. Conventional {{promethazine}} (PM-HCl) tablets are bitter, need to be taken 1  h before symptoms and water is also needed. Taste-masked granules were produced with Eudragit® E 100 by extrusion, and analyzed with FTIR, DSC, and XRD. Tablets formulated from granules by direct compression using Ac-Di-Sol, Polyplasdone®-XL, Primojel® and ion-exchanger Tulsion® 339 and evaluated for mass uniformity, friability, tensile strength, drug content uniformity, water absorption ratio, in-vitro and in-vivo disintegration time and in-vitro dissolution studies. The observed drug-polymer interactions and reduced crystallinity may be reasons for increased dissolution rates. The formulated tablets were disintegrated within 15  s. Tablets (25  mg PM-HCl) with Ac-Di-Sol (4 %) showed complete release within 1  min, while marketed conventional tablets (Phenergan®; Rhone-Poulec) release 25 % during the same period. A preliminary stability studies for the prepared tablets carried at 30 [*]±[*] 2 °C/ 60 [*]±[*] 5 % RH, and 40 [*]±[*] 2 °C/ 75 [*]±[*] 5 %RH for 3  months showed no significant changes in the tablets quality at 30 [*]±[*] 2 °C/ 60 [*]±[*] 5 % RH. However, at 40 [*]±[*] 2 °C/ 75 [*]±[*] 5 %RH marked increase in in-vitro disintegration time, tensile strength and decrease in friability and water absorption ratio was found. The present studies indicate the abilities of Eudragit® E 100 for taste masking and improving the dissolution profile of PM-HCl after complexation.

40|$|Orally {{disintegrating}} Tablets (ODTs), {{also known}} as fast-disintegrating, fast-melt or <b>fast-dissolving</b> <b>tablets,</b> are a relatively novel dosage technology that involves the rapid disintegration or dissolution of the dosage form into a solution or suspension in the mouth {{without the need for}} water. The solution containing the active ingredients is swallowed, and the active ingredients are then absorbed through the gastrointestinal epithelium to reach the target and produce the desired effect. Formulation of ODTs was originally developed to address swallowing difficulties of conventional solid oral dosage forms (tablets and capsules) experienced by wide range of patient population, especially children and elderly. The current work investigates the formulation and development of ODTs prepared by freeze drying. Initial studies focused on formulation parameters that influence the manufacturing process and performance of lyophilised tablets based on excipients used in commercial products (gelatin and saccharides). The second phase of the work was followed up by comprehensive studies to address the essential need to create saccharide free ODTs using naturally accruing amino acids individually or in combinations. Furthermore, a factorial design study was carried out to investigate the feasibility of delivering multiparticulate systems of challenging drugs using a novel formulation that exploited the electrostatic associative interaction between gelatin and carrageenan. Finally, studies aimed to replace gelatin with ethically and morally accepted components to the end users were performed and the selected binder was used in factorial design studies to investigate and optimise ODT formulations that incorporated drugs with varies physicochemical properties. Our results show that formulation of elegant lyophilised ODTs with instant disintegration and adequate mechanical strength requires carful optimisation of gelatin concentration and bloom strength in addition to saccharide type and concentration. Successful formulation of saccharides free lyophilised ODTs requires amino acids that crystallise in the frozen state or display relatively high Tg', interact and integrate completely with the binder and, also, display short wetting time with the disintegrating medium. The use of an optimised mixture of gelatin, carrageenan and alanine was able to create viscous solutions to suspend multiparticulate systems {{and at the same time}} provide tablets with short disintegration times and adequate mechanical properties. On the other hand, gum arabic showed an outstanding potential for use as a binder in the formulation of lyophilised ODTs. Compared to gelatin formulations, the use of gum arabic simplified the formulation stages, shortened the freeze drying cycles and produced tablets with superior performance in terms of the disintegration time and mechanical strength. Furthermore, formulation of lyophilised ODTs based on gum arabic showed capability to deliver diverse range of drugs with advantages over commercial products.

To assess the disintegration and dissolution of a new <b>fast-dissolving</b> acetaminophen <b>tablet</b> formulation (FD-APAP) and the impact on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Two randomized, single-center, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover studies in healthy subjects to compare FD-APAP (2 [*]×[*] 500 [*]mg tablets) with standard acetaminophen (2 [*]×[*] 500 [*]mg tablets). Gamma scintigraphy {{was used to assess}} tablet disintegration (Study 1, N[*]=[*] 24), and plasma profiles were evaluated in the fasted state (Study 2, N[*]=[*] 40). In Study 1, the mean time to complete disintegration (12. 9 vs. 69. 6 [*]min, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and onset of disintegration were both significantly faster with FD-APAP than with standard acetaminophen (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001).

AUC 0 –t and AUC 0 –inf were comparable between the two study treatments. Despite the absence of comparative clinical data, the FD-APAP formulation may be expected to overcome some of the issues associated with the slow and variable absorption of standard acetaminophen tablet formulations, improving therapeutic outcome and avoiding the need to switch to alternative therapeutic options.

O presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar, em pacientes submetidos à anestesia geral, o impacto da administração oral de ondansetrona na incidência de NVPO. MÉTODOS: Foram incluídos 178 pacientes em estudo prospectivo, randomizado, controlado e duplo-cego, divididos em dois grupos (ondansetrona= 89 e placebo= 89), utilizando-se comprimidos de dissolução oral rápida, especialmente preparados para este estudo.
