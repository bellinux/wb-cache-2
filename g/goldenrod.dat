5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, <b>goldenrod,</b> and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included <b>goldenrod</b> and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E
25|$|Misumena vatia is {{a species}} of crab spider with holarctic distribution. In North America, where {{it is the largest}} and best-known flower spider, it is called the <b>goldenrod</b> crab spider or flower (crab) spider, because it is {{commonly}} found hunting in <b>goldenrod</b> sprays in the autumn. Young males in the early summer may be quite small and easily overlooked, but females can grow up to 10mm (excluding legs); males reach 5mm at most.|$|E

25|$|In the US, {{people often}} mistakenly blame the {{conspicuous}} <b>goldenrod</b> flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen {{does not become}} independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by ragweed, a widespread anemophilous plant.|$|E

25|$|The {{business}} grew organically {{starting in}} 1990 {{with the first}} cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes.

Zango and <b>Goldenrod,</b> two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco's release of Not a Pretty Girl. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>goldenrods,</b> {{this species}} is a {{perennial}} herb. One {{of the smaller}} <b>goldenrods,</b> It grows 20 centimeters to one meter (8-40 inches) tall from a branching underground caudex. There are 1 to 6 erect stems, sometimes more. The stems are reddish to gray-green and have lines of short, white hairs. The lower leaves are up to 10 centimeters (4 inches long and the blades are borne on winged petioles. Leaves on {{the upper half of}} the stem are narrower and shorter and lack petioles. The spreading inflorescence can carry up to 300 flower heads. The head contains 5 to 11 yellow ray florets each a few millimeters long surrounding up to 10 yellow disc florets. Flowering occurs in late summer and fall. The fruit is a rough-texured cypsela about 2 millimeters long tipped with a pappus of bristles slightly longer.|$|R
50|$|Bombus fernaldae, the Fernald's cuckoo {{bumblebee}}, is {{a species}} of cuckoo bumblebee having only males and queens, but no worker bees. The females place their eggs in the nest of the confusing bumblebee (Bombus perplexus) or the red-belted bumblebee (Bombus rufocinctus), which raise the larvae. Fernald's cuckoo bumblebees pollinate Potentilla, Rubus, clovers, and <b>goldenrods.</b>|$|R
25|$|Edison became {{concerned}} with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and {{was determined to}} find a native supply of rubber. He joined Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida the following year. Edison did {{the majority of the}} research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder. After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the <b>Goldenrod</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|These spiders may be {{yellow or}} white, {{depending}} on the flower {{in which they are}} hunting. Especially younger females, which may hunt on a variety of flowers such as daisies and sunflowers, may change color at will. Older females require large amounts of relatively large prey to produce the best possible clutch of eggs. They are therefore, in North America, most commonly found in <b>goldenrod</b> (Solidago sp.), a bright yellow flower which attracts large numbers of insects, especially in autumn. It is often very hard even for a searching human to recognize one of these spiders on a yellow flower. These spiders are sometimes called banana spiders because of their striking yellow color.|$|E
25|$|Edison's work on rubber {{took place}} largely at his botanic {{research}} laboratory in Fort Myers, {{which has been}} designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark. The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's <b>Goldenrod.</b> The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{primarily}} found {{in areas of}} woodland openings, such as outcrops or clearings. Solidago arguta can be distinguished from similar <b>goldenrods</b> by its combination of dark maroon stems, lightly pubescent to hairless leaves, and broad lower leaves that taper to their base. It produces yellow heads of flowers in late summer and fall.|$|R
50|$|Females feed {{from several}} food plants, {{including}} asters, rabbitbrush, thistles, and <b>goldenrods.</b> They then invade the colony of another bee and live there to reproduce. This is {{a species of}} cuckoo bumblebee, one that parasitizes the nest of another bee rather than building and tending its own. Host species for this cuckoo bee include the western bumblebee (B. occidentalis).|$|R
50|$|The {{species were}} {{formerly}} classed in genus Solidago, the <b>goldenrods.</b> They were separated {{on the basis}} of morphological differences, such as the arrangement of the flower heads in the inflorescence and the glands on the leaves, and of DNA data. Authors have recognized 5 to 10 species. They are native to North America, but certain species are introduced in Europe and Asia.|$|R
