5|$|Some {{customers}} {{also reported}} problems with <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> and standing orders being returned unpaid {{due to their}} account balances not updating correctly, however RBS said in an announcement that they would work directly with the receiving banks and companies {{to ensure that all}} payments were processed. As a result of the system outage, RBS also announced that they would work with credit rating agencies directly to ensure no customer's credit file was permanently impacted. They also announced that no customer will be permanently out of pocket because of the system outage, and launched a dedicated new freephone helpline for the incident, as well as an online help point to guide and advise customers with any queries they had during the outage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>debits</b> are {{available}} {{in a number of}} countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Sweden, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. <b>Direct</b> <b>debits</b> are made under each country's rules, and are usually restricted to domestic transactions in those countries. An exception in this respect is the Single Euro Payments Area which allows for Euro-denominated cross-border (and domestic) <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> since November 2010. In the United States, <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> are processed through the Automated Clearing House network.|$|E

50|$|In Sweden, {{the problem}} of <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> fraud is much smaller than in the UK, since there are more strict {{requirements}} on which companies that can use <b>direct</b> <b>debit.</b> Still there are claims that well-known companies have taken too much money through <b>direct</b> <b>debit.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Malaysia, the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> {{system is}} {{available}} via the product known as FPX - Financial Process Exchange.

50|$|SEPA <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> {{currently}} works alongside national <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> schemes. As such, it {{is possible}} to collect payment through both SDD and/or a national <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> scheme. However, from 1 August 2014, it will no longer be possible to collect Euro-denominated payments through national <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> schemes in Euro-zone SEPA countries. In October 2016 SDD and IBAN become the mandatory methods for transfers in Euro in all of the EU and EEA, but not mandatory for transfers in other currencies.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> is {{performed}} through the direct entry system {{also known as}} BECS (Bulk Electronic Clearing System) or CS2, managed by the Australian Payments Clearing Association.

50|$|A record-breaking 2014 saw Bacs process 5.8 billion transactions, totalling £4.4 {{trillion}} {{and included}} 3.6 billion <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits.</b> These highs were surpassed again in 2015, {{when the number}} of payments passing through the Bacs system topped six billion for the first time, at a value of £4.6 trillion. 239 million more <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> were processed in 2015 than the previous 12 months, representing the highest ever year-on-year increase in payments made this way.|$|E

50|$|Before {{a company}} or {{organisation}} can collect payment by <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> {{they need to}} be approved by a bank, or use a commercial bureau to collect <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> payments on their behalf. This approval process ensures the company will be able to operate within the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> scheme rules and maintain the integrity of the scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Any <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> {{instruction}} {{that has not}} been used to collect funds for over 13 months is automatically cancelled by the customer's bank [...] (this is known as a [...] "dormancy period"). This can cause problems when the mandate is used infrequently, for instance, taking a payment to settle the bill for a seldom-used credit card. If the credit card company has not collected a payment using the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> mandate for over 13 months the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> mandate may have been cancelled as dormant without the customer's knowledge, and the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> claim will fail.|$|R
50|$|To set up {{payments}} by <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit,</b> the payer must {{complete a}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> Instruction to the merchant. This instruction contains bank-approved wording {{that makes it}} clear the payer is setting up an ongoing authority for the merchant to debit their account. The interface for completing the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> Instruction {{is controlled by the}} merchant, who then sends the data from the form to the customer's bank, via Bacs.|$|R

50|$|UK Legislation {{covering}} street F2FCharity cash collections on {{the street}} - the type usually done by volunteer ‘tin rattlers’ - need a licence from the council (or the police in London) under a rather arcane act of Parliament {{that dates back to}} 1916, the Police, Factories etc (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1916. However, an issue arises when determining whether soliciting <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> during F2F street fundraising is covered by this act. The act states specifically that licences are required for collections of money, whereas <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> are not considered to be money in law: they are ‘promises of money’ at a later date.|$|E
40|$|The {{letter of}} credit {{contract}} and the collection contract The diploma thesis deals with {{the topic of the}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> Contract and the Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit is a special payment instrument issued as a rule by a bank that the principal has undertaken to pay to the person in whose interest the Letter of Credit is open and designated as the authorized amount up to the amount agreed. The <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> is the commitment of the collector of receivables to obtain from the third party a receipt of a sum of money or other <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit.</b> Current legislation, contained in the Civil Code, took over the legal regulation of the Letter of Credit and the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> from the Commercial Code without any major changes. Both institutes show a number of identical and different elements.

50|$|One method {{involves}} {{only the}} payer and the payee, with the payer authorizing the payee to collect amounts due {{on his or}} her account. However, the payer can instruct his or her bank to return any Direct Debit note without giving a reason. In that event, the payee has to pay all fees for the transaction and may eventually lose his or her ability to initiate <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> if this occurs too often. However, it still requires all the account holders (not merely the payer) to watch statements and request returns if necessary, unless they have instructed their bank to block all <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> scheme rules, merchants {{have very}} few grounds to {{challenge}} a charge in generated under the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> Guarantee.

5000|$|A <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> {{requires}} the payer authorize the payee take a <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> for any amount at any time, or to instruct {{the bank to}} honour <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> requests from a specified payee. The payee has full control over the payments. They can vary the amount and frequency of payments without further authorisation from the customer (subject to providing the customer with the required advance notice). [...] The payer has no direct control over these payments, but can cancel the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> at any time, with no reason required, and require the return of disputed payments. It {{is not possible to}} authorise an individual to take direct debits; only organisations that have a contract with the payer's bank, or have been vetted by it, can do this.|$|R
