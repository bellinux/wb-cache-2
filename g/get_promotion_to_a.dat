[...] "You {{have shown}} that you have <b>a</b> head <b>to</b> think, and, as you before proved, you have <b>an</b> arm <b>to</b> strike. Why, every young knight in the Order must feel proud {{that one of their}} own age has gained such honour. It raises them all in their own esteem, and you will see that you will get the pick among all the professed knights, and of a good many who have {{finished}} their profession, and are serving here in the hope of some day <b>getting</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> commandery. Not such an one as you have got; that, in the ordinary course of things, does not fall <b>to</b> <b>a</b> knight until he is well on in years, and has served in many commanderies of smaller value. I can tell you, directly Sir John Kendall came back and told us that you had been appointed commander of the new galley, and that it was to be manned wholly by young knights, there was not one of those serving their profession in the auberge who did not beg Sir John to put down his name for it; and ten or twelve others, myself among them, who have obtained full knighthood also." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{whether there}} exists <b>a</b> glass ceiling <b>to</b> women’s ascension {{in the largest}} firms of the Brazilian manufacturing industry. In particular, we check whether gender matters {{in the time it}} takes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> managerial position. Although we employ parametric accelerated failure time models in our preliminary analysis, our main results rely on partial rank estimates of a semiparametric duration model that allows for covariate-dependent censoring. We find that, although there are significative gender differences in promotions within domestic firms, the same does not apply for foreign-owned firms. We also pay some attention to two other dimensions of career progress, namely, wage growth and promotion likelihood. It turns out that wage gains after promotion do not contribute to generating wage differential between males and females either in domestic or in multinational firms, whereas women are less likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>promotion</b> in domestic and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lesser extent, in foreign firms...|$|R
500|$|On {{her first}} day working at Ralph Lauren, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) tries {{to get along with}} her new {{colleague}} and boss, Nancy and Kim. The latter two are smokers, and go on a cigarette break, which Rachel can't join as she doesn't smoke and she is angered to find that Nancy and Kim are busy making company decisions without her during the smoking break. Rachel fears for her position, as Kim and Nancy spend more time together during smoking breaks and have <b>a</b> better chance <b>to</b> bond, and thus Nancy is most probably going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>promotions.</b> <b>To</b> make <b>an</b> effort and bond with her co-workers, Rachel goes with them and smokes a cigarette. She is not enthusiastic to fall into the bad habit and tries to talk Kim and Nancy into quitting which comes to no avail, later catching them smoking behind her back. Kim warns Rachel that she would fire her if she catches her with a cigarette as she doesn't want to [...] "drag her down with them". She forces Rachel to leave, just as she invites Nancy <b>to</b> go on <b>a</b> business trip <b>to</b> Paris with her.|$|R

40|$|Bureaucracy is {{featured}} by vertical hierarchical structure {{in which the}} decision maker usually lacks {{direct access to the}} informed agent, and the span of discretionary authority decreases top down. In this paper we investigate the delegation scheme in three-level hierarchies. The minister delegates authority <b>to</b> <b>a</b> biased senior bureaucrat, then the senior can make further delegation decision to the junior. We provide a full characterization of the implemented interval delegation set. It’s shown that the e ¢ ciency is attained if and only if the senior is intermediately biased. We reverse the conclusion in Dessein (2002) that delegation dominates informative cheap talk and shows that, for some range of senior’s preferences, the minister prefers keeping control and using the senior as information gate-keeper. The implication for hiring policy, job contents and promotion decision in bureaucracy is examined. Given the bias of the senior, the optimal junior should be intermediately between the senior and the minister. Under certain conditions the loyal bureaucrat would be assigned to action-level and doesn’t <b>get</b> <b>promotion.</b> Complete delegation <b>to</b> <b>an</b> acquainted knowledgeable senior may arise endogenously by the minister’s ignorance about the con‡ict of interest of the junior...|$|R
