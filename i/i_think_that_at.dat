500|$|Hensleigh {{found the}} {{rewriting}} process {{to be too}} difficult and dropped out, and felt he [...] "wasted nine months in pre-production". It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed [...] "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure {{if this was a}} science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie." [...] France was writing the script on fast track from July—September 1999. Filming for Hulk was to start in April 2000.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{first she}} did not see him. She swept round upon me and raised her veil.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all, boys. What {{with wild}} fowl and armadillos, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> a pinch, we could live {{for some time}} upon the produce of the estate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all--nor a {{glass of}} brandy in it, if you like it. Indeed, Mr Lynch, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> just <b>at</b> present, {{it will be the}} better thing for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hulme {{wrote to}} Lechmere, [...] "The man I {{relieved}} {{was killed by}} a shell, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>at</b> all likely to happen to me." [...] In 1917 he {{was killed by a}} shell. Lechmere never married.|$|R
50|$|In most of {{the cases}} it is said that there was an implied {{condition}} in the contract which operated to release the parties from performing it, and in all of them <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was <b>at</b> bottom the principle upon which the court proceeded.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't think--strangely enough--that {{he regards}} me as nasty. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> bottom--for that IS," [...] said the Princess, [...] "the strangeness--he's sorry for me. Yes, I think that, deep within, he pities me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, therefore, {{that is out}} of the question. You {{will have}} a {{fortnight}} or three weeks in London, in all the bustle of their departure, and I declare <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the last moment you will go with them." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{certainly}} could not complain of any {{lack of interest}} {{on the part of}} my auditors. They listened to every word of my story with rapt attention. When I had finished they were both silent for several moments. Mabane eyed me curiously. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> first he scarcely knew whether to believe me altogether serious.|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby made {{a little}} gesture. [...] "It will be hard--but it can't be helped," [...] he replied. [...] "As you said, I must go away too one day. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> <b>at</b> least, will feel by and by {{that it was all}} worth while." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 18 March 2015 {{interview}} with Globovisión, Bernal was asked [...] "Can a homosexual be a police officer?" [...] {{to where he}} replied, [...] "Yes ... {{so long as they}} don’t manifest their sexual preference publicly. Because imagine if a police officer that might want to wear a pink shirt, or wear lipstick. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> least in Venezuela, I don’t know in other places, doesn’t go with our culture. He then attempted to clarify, stating [...] "I have nothing against sexual diversity ... But they couldn’t manifest it publicly, because it goes against the structure of what a police officer should be." [...] Bernal's remarks raised concerns of homophobia in Venezuela among the Venezuelan and the international LGBT communities.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} all," [...] Nat said gravely. [...] "I shall not fight unless <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is <b>at</b> any rate {{a fair chance}} of victory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lieutenant Gordon, I am {{shocked to}} hear that an officer of my {{regiment}} should gamble {{to such an extent}} as you have done. You will, of course, be called tomorrow. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> the best, you will be advised to change into another regiment. I need not say that, after this exposure, the chits that you have given to Captain Sanders become null and void.|$|E
60|$|When she {{was within}} {{a hundred feet}} of the thicket through which her path would lead, I {{advanced}} to meet her. I tried to appear cool and composed, but I am afraid my success was slight. As for Sylvia, she stopped abruptly, and dropped her leathern case. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> first she did not recognize me, {{and was on the}} point of screaming. Suddenly to come upon a man in the midst of these solitudes was indeed startling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{any rate}} I will write to Mr. Thorn,' said Miss Aldclyffe, {{with a little}} smile. 'It is true, the whole {{proceeding}} is very irregular; but my present maid leaves next Monday, and neither of the five I have already seen seem to do for me.... Well, I will write to Mr. Thorn, and if his reply is satisfactory, you shall hear from me. It will be as well to set yourself in readiness to come on Monday.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall see," [...] he said. [...] "If Mannering {{is not for}} us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can <b>at</b> least promise <b>that</b> he does no harm on {{the other}} side." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It’s {{frustrating}} {{to me that}} it boiled down in the popular discussion to a conflict between right-to-life and right-to-die. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> it <b>at</b> all. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we ought to analyze the case in terms of disability discrimination." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} my mistress. If she had {{directed}} me to knock Mr. James Smith down, big as he was, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> could have done it.|$|R
6000|$|Jean {{has been}} in here {{examining}} the poll for the Immortals ("Literature," [...] March 24,) in the hope, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> last she should find me {{at the top and}} you in second place; and if that is her ambition she has suffered disappointment for the third time--and will never fare any better, I hope, for you are where you belong, by every right. She wanted to know who it is that does the voting, but I was not able to tell her. Nor when the election will be completed and decided.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are more}} nervous {{for me than}} I am for myself, Giuseppi; but I have been careful too, for {{although}} Ruggiero himself was away his friends are here, and active, too, as you see by this successful attempt. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present {{they are likely to}} let matters sleep. Public opinion is greatly excited over the affair, and as, if I were found with a stab in my back, it would, after what has passed, be put down to them, I think they will leave me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{certainly}} {{no wish to}} be an ascetic, Ralph. I should {{have no objection to}} hold estates, if I had them to hold. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present, with the great danger hanging over us, it would be better if, in the first place, we were all to spend less time in idleness or amusement, and to devote all our energies to the cause. I mean not only by fighting when the time comes for fighting, but by endeavouring in every way to ward off danger." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time Melville {{completely}} {{grasped the}} fact that he had a companion. But presently his meditations were disturbed by her voice. He started.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{recognize}} you now, sir," [...] she said coldly; [...] "and little did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should next {{see you as}} {{an officer of the}} Council of Blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} whence he came last, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he was <b>at</b> Edinburgh, {{and had taken}} service there, when the English king sat down before it; but, as you know, nought came of the siege." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{shadow of}} a dead man, I think," [...] {{answered}} Asti grimly. [...] "Some jealous god has looked upon this poor King whose crime is that he desires you, and therefore he must die. Of a truth it goes ill with your lovers, O Star of Amen, and sometimes I wonder if one who is dear to me will meet with better fortune at those royal eyes of yours. If ill befalls him <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the last I may learn to hate you, whom from the first I cherished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{why should}} you go? Oro has {{commanded}} it, it is true, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the last he will forget. It must be decided swiftly. There is yet time. I can place you in safety in the sepulchre of Sleep where you found us. Thence cross to the main island and sail away quickly in your boat out into the great sea, where I believe you will find succour. Know that after disobeying him, you must meet Oro no more lest {{it should be the}} worse for you. If that be your will, let us start. What say you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Seth {{considered}} {{for some time}} in silence, turned his plug of tobacco in his mouth, expectorated two or three times, as was his custom when thinking, and then said, [...] "That's not altogether an easy question to answer. I've been so near wiped out such scores of times, that it ain't no easy job to say which was the downright nearest. In thinking it over, I conclude sometimes that one go was the nearest, sometimes that another; it ain't no ways easy to say now. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> the time, I never so much felt that Seth Harper's time for going down had come, as I did in an affair near San Louis." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>at</b> {{the worst}} moments Bunter really desired to drown Captain Johns. I fancy that all his disordered {{imagination}} longed for was merely {{to stop the}} ghostly inanity of the skipper's talk.|$|R
2500|$|... "I’ve {{always said}} it: Mike {{is a lot}} funnier, and a lot wittier, than people thought. And Chris {{was a lot more}} {{knowledgeable}} and sharp, sports-wise, than people thought. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> combination, <b>at</b> times, got a little overrated—that Mike was the encyclopedic one, and Dog was the goofy one. Which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was the perception for a long time. After a while, they realized, hey, Mike’s funny! And Dog knows what he’s talking about! Once <b>that</b> was established, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the show was sharp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is pretty}} nearly so," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "but at present the empress has bought off the Prussians, whose king {{joined in the}} affair solely for his own advantage, by giving him the {{province}} of Silesia, so <b>that</b> in fact <b>at</b> present it is England and Hanover, which is all the same thing, with the Dutch and Hessians, against France and Bavaria, for <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present Spain has sent any troops." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{walked with}} me to the hall door, but she {{declined}} to shake hands with me. Her appearance was little short of tragic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> another time I might have been amused, for never in my life had I spoken more than a few courteous words to the girl. But my nerves were all on edge, and I took her seriously. I walked down the street, leaving her standing in the threshold with the door open as though anxious to {{give me a chance to}} return if I would. I looked back at the corner, and waved my hand. There was something almost threatening in the grim irresponsive figure, standing watching me, and making no pretence at returning my farewell--watching me with steady eyes and close-drawn brows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Methinks, Francois, that armour will ere long be abandoned, {{now that}} arquebuses and cannon are coming {{more and more}} into use. Against them they give no protection; and it were better, methinks, to have {{lightness}} and freedom of action, than to have the trouble of wearing all this iron stuff merely as a protection against lances. You {{have been trained to}} wear armour, and therefore feel less inconvenience; but I have never had as much as a breast plate on before, and I feel at present as if I had almost lost the use of my arms. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> any rate, I shall speedily get rid of these arm pieces. The body armour I don't so much mind, now that I am fairly in the saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{very much}} more, Lady Margaret. I {{should say that}} she was very true and loyal. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present she enters into what she has to do in {{something}} of the same spirit as her father, and that she thoroughly likes it. I think that she is naturally full of fun and has high spirits, and that she enjoys performing these missions with which she is entrusted as a child enjoys a game, and that {{the fact that there is}} a certain amount of danger connected with them is in itself attractive to her. I am glad that you have told me what he said to you about himself, for I could not understand him before. I think I can now, and understanding him one can understand his daughter." ...|$|E
5000|$|That was John {{after a night}} out, with dawn coming up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point, he was a bit...wondering {{where he}} was going, and to be truthful so was I. I was {{starting}} to worry about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{undersized}} little wretches," [...] Boduoc said, as {{they started}} for the village; [...] "no wonder that our forefathers swept {{them out of the}} land without any difficulty. But they are active and sturdy, and, knowing their swamps as they do, could harass an invader terribly. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> present they like our going into their country, but they will be glad enough of our aid if the Romans come." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked down}} for a little while, then lifted her head and laid her hand upon my shoulder, adding slowly: [...] "Do you know, Allan, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it will <b>at</b> the--" [...] and {{suddenly}} she turned and left me with her sentence unfinished.|$|R
