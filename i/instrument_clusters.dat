500|$|The {{development}} of the new car led Holden to redesign the Elizabeth plant in South Australia so that entire sections of the car can be assembled off the foremost production line. This new production method allows for complete sub-sections like the engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production. This process {{is applied to the}} front-end module of the VE Commodore, consisting of the headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. It can be easily removed as one-piece leading to lower repair costs and easier access to the engine bay. This design represents the first time such a method has been used within GM, and garnered the SAE Australasia's 2006 Automotive Engineering Excellence Award. A modular design structure known within Holden as [...] "Flex Vision" [...] has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> can be swapped out for the different Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs. The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed: Functional, Performance and Luxury. The closely related long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice derivatives feature a fourth interior type referred to as Prestige.|$|E

2500|$|Being {{transparent}} and durable, PMMA is a versatile material {{and has been}} used {{in a wide range of}} fields and applications such as rear-lights and <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> for vehicles, appliances, and lenses for glasses. PMMA in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows, skylights, bulletproof security barriers, signs & displays, sanitary ware (bathtubs), LCD screens, furniture and many other applications. [...] It is also used for coating polymers based on MMA provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of VOC. [...] Methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance.|$|E

50|$|Electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are being}} {{increasingly}} common features on railway vehicles, in which individual instruments {{are replaced by}} various forms of digital readouts. Early uses of <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> often employed LEDs to display analog-type or numeric readings for pressure gauges, electrical gauges, and other displays. They have been increasingly integrated with various cab signalling systems and together with the installation of multi-function displays, have simplified the cab layout and improved user interaction with the engineer.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers such as BMW, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz have {{included}} fuel-economy gauges in some <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters,</b> showing fuel mileage in real time. The ammeter was the gauge {{of choice for}} monitoring {{the state of the}} charging system until the 1970s. Later it was replaced by the voltmeter. Today most family vehicles have warning lights instead of voltmeters or oil pressure gauges in their dashboard <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters,</b> though sports cars often have proper gauges for performance purposes and driver appeasement.|$|E
