40|$|The risk of {{impingement}} of the aorta {{associated with}} thoracic vertebral screw or pedicle screw instrumentation {{in the treatment}} of thoracic scoliosis has been an important concern.

Purpose: We aimed to evaluate apical displacement and time needed for instrumentation of root canals of primary molars by manual and rotary techniques. Materials and Methods: Root canals of 144 extracted first and second primary maxillary molars were randomly divided into 2 groups: I- manual instrumentation (K-files); II- rotary instrumentation (K 3 Rotary System®). The canals were radiographed with pathfinding files in place, prepared by both techniques, and instrumentation time was recorded. After preparation, root canals were radiographed again with pathfinding files in place. To analyze the degree of apical displacement, digital images were superimposed using the Adobe Photoshop® software. Results: Mean apical displacement (0. 70 mm) in the manual <b>instrumentation</b> <b>group</b> was not statistically different from that in the rotary <b>instrumentation</b> <b>group</b> (0. 79 mm). However, mean time for root canal preparation was significantly shorter using the rotary system (128. 0 s) than using the manual system (174. 0 s) (...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Telemetry Group of the Range Commanders Council has {{provided}} suggested standards for transmission of telemetry data. These standards {{were necessary to}} promote compatibility of operational equipment at the respective Test and Evaluation ranges. For digital transmission, the applicable standards define the frame and word formats necessary for range compatibility. These standards were developed for acquisition of multiple analog and bi-level signals and provided a relatively straight forward means of developing an aggregate, time-division multiplexed (TDM), serial, data stream which includes the information necessary to reconstruct the signals at the ground station prior to analysis. The <b>Inter-Range</b> <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>Group</b> (IRIG) formats are, by design, periodic and form a matrix of "words" which are preassigned {{to each and every}} signal being encoded and transmitted. As all the original information is continuous in nature, the encoder must sample each of the channels in their proper sequence and place the sampled data in its respective time slot.

In the telemetry field to date, {{there has been a}} serious problem with the inability to properly time-tag multiple incoming data elements simultaneously.

The hierarchical modified dataflow architecture contains a supervisor module which manages an <b>Inter-Range</b> <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>Group</b> (IRIG) Time Acquisition Module and several acquisition and processing n-dules within a system. The high speed serial bussing techniques u t i l i z e d allow the time module to source time information to any one or all of the other modules simultaneously.
