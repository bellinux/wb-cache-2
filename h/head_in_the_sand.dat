Anyone who buries their <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> is a bit naïve. And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{allegations}} that the NDS tortured detainees handed over to them by British soldiers in Afghanistan. Allegations were also made that British Armed Forces have received evidence of this torture, and NATO [...] "has buried its <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> while torture has continued, and it's known about it." [...] The British High Court of Justice ruled on 25 June 2010 that there was [...] "a possibility of torture and serious mistreatment” of prisoners. It is now illegal for British troops to hand over detainees to the NDS in Kabul, however The High Court still approved of transfers in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. This was {{on the condition that}} government and military officials improved its systems for monitoring detainees, in order to avoid [...] "a real risk of torture or serious mistreatment.” ...|$|E
500|$|Law {{professor}} and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 {{that regardless of}} the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> Economics Nobel laureate and New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a [...] "stupid canard" [...] and a [...] "myth". But following Krugman's column, he declared [...] "peace on the boiled frog front" [...] and said that using the story is fine as long as you point out it's not literally true.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the album as a [...] "fine balancing act" [...] of [...] "emo-edged" [...] tracks and [...] "wallop-packed rockers." [...] Steve Hochman of The Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Those graduating from teen tastes could well turn to this album {{as a first}} step to adulthood." [...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So do the best you can, listen to your favorite band, bury your <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> before it all begins again. Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat World song!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{condemned}} Prime Minister Qarase {{for speaking}} [...] against the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. [...] Qarase had told {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Nadi the day before that western-style democracy was an alien concept in Fiji, and that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was not compatible with Fiji's hierarchical order. [...] Chaudhry countered by saying that Qarase was like a proverbial ostrich with its <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> [...] "The rule of law must apply equally to everyone, irrespective of status in society or class divisions it is this equal application that is the bulwark of modern democracies," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|The first castaways {{to use of}} one {{of these}} depots were members of the crew of the Derry Castle, an iron barque, which was wrecked on Enderby Island on 20 March 1887. Eight of the 23 crew made it ashore. A depot was in place (at Sandy Bay), but looters had removed all {{supplies}} but a bottle of salt, so the castaways subsisted on shellfish and a small quantity of wheat recovered from the wreck. [...] After 92 days they discovered an axe <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and were able to use it to build a boat from the wreckage. Two of the men navigated the boat to nearby Erebus Cove, Port Ross, on Auckland Island, where they obtained supplies from the government depot that had been established there. They then returned to collecting the remaining men, and the group lived at Port Ross until they were rescued by the sealer Awarua on 19 July, which took them to Melbourne.|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales Police Commissioner Ken Moroney {{called the}} riots [...] "absolutely totally un-Australian", saying that [...] "I saw, in my 40 years of police service, {{some of the}} most disgraceful {{behaviour}} and conduct by adults that I'd ever seen." [...] New South Wales Opposition leader Peter Debnam called it [...] "a real disgrace" [...] and called for a tougher police response. Australian Prime Minister John Howard condemned the violence describing it as [...] "sickening and deplorable" [...] but denied any racial undertones, saying the events were primarily an issue of law and order — a view echoed by the Treasurer Peter Costello, who described the Sydney riots as [...] "an example of hoodlums who got out of control". However this was viewed by many people who live in Sydney as the government burying its <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> over racial tension so foreign ownership in Australia would not be affected. Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley described the attacks as [...] "simply criminal behaviour, that's all there is to it".|$|E

5000|$|Ostriches {{are often}} portrayed as being nervous and are widely thought to bury their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> at <b>the</b> {{first sign of}} danger.

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{ostriches}} do not bury their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> sand to avoid danger. This myth likely began with Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79), {{who wrote that}} ostriches [...] "imagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the whole of their body is concealed." [...] This {{may have been a}} misunderstanding of their sticking their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> to swallow sand and pebbles to help digest their fibrous food, or, as National Geographic suggests, of the defensive behavior of lying low, so that they may appear from a distance to have their head buried. Another possible origin for the myth lies with the fact that ostriches keep their eggs <b>in</b> holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> instead of nests, and must rotate them using their beaks during incubation; digging the hole, placing the eggs, and rotating them might each be mistaken for an attempt to bury their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|R

6000|$|I am {{weary of}} repeating {{that this is}} false. It is only denied that mere acts, not {{proceeding}} from faith, are or can be holiness.

60|$|He {{was as good}} as his word. When Don Pedro Amador, his uncle, {{installed}} Miss Mannersley, with Spanish courtesy, on {{a raised}} platform in the long valley where the rodeo took place, the gallant Enriquez selected a bull from the frightened and galloping herd, and, cleverly isolating him from the band, lassoed his hind legs, and threw him exactly before the platform where Miss Mannersley was seated. It was Enriquez who caught the unbroken mustang, sprang from his own saddle to the bare back of his captive, and with the lasso for a bridle, halted him on rigid haunches at Miss Mannersley's feet. It was Enriquez who, in the sports that followed, leaned from his saddle at full speed, caught up the chicken buried to its <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> without wringing its neck, and tossed it unharmed and fluttering toward his mistress. As for her, she wore the same look of animation that I had seen in her face at our previous meeting. Although she did not bring her sketchbook with her, as at the bullfight, she did not shrink from the branding of the cattle, which took place under her very eyes.|$|E
