25|$|On 10 October 1889, Isaac R Johnson, an African-American inventor, lodged his {{patent for}} a <b>folding</b> <b>bicycle</b> - the {{first with a}} recognisably modern diamond frame, the pattern still used in 21st-century bicycles.|$|E

2500|$|One {{standard}} {{option for the}} Brompton <b>folding</b> <b>bicycle</b> {{is to use a}} 3-speed hub gear (roughly a 30% difference between gear ratios) in combination with a 2-speed deraileur gear (roughly a 15% difference) to give 6 distinct gear ratios; {{this is an example of}} half-step gearing. [...] Some Brompton suppliers offer a 2-speed chainring 'Mountain Drive' as well, which results in 12 distinct gear ratios with a range exceeding 5:1; in this case, the change from 6th to 7th gear involves changing all three sets of gears simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|According to Charles Spencer, BSA was {{manufacturing}} the [...] "Delta" [...] bicycle circa 1869. In 1880 {{the company}} was approached to manufacture the [...] "Otto Dicycle". An initial contract was signed to produce 210 and a further contract followed for a further 200. [...] In all {{it is believed that}} a total of 953 Otto machines were made. BSA then went into bicycle production on their own account, the first machines to their own specification being exhibited at the 1881 Stanley Show. BSA went on to design and manufacture a [...] "safety" [...] bicycle (patent:15,342 of 1884). BSA was also producing tricycles and a licence was obtained in 1885 to manufacture ball bearings. BSA ceased bicycle manufacture in 1887 because of the demand for arms. Bicycle component manufacture commenced in 1894 and BSA continued to supply the bicycle trade up to 1936. The company recommenced bicycle manufacture on their own account again in 1908 and these were exhibited at the Stanley Show in 1909. [...] Bicycle manufacture was what led BSA into motorcycles. BSA produced bicycles for both the police and military and notably a <b>folding</b> <b>bicycle</b> for the British Army during World War I and the more well known folding Paratroopers bicycle during World War II. [...] BSA supplied the Irish Army with bicycles after 1922.|$|E
