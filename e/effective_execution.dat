6000|$|As {{they picked}} {{their way in}} the gray, {{deceptive}} dawn, between the manure-heaps of the village street, Newman's new acquaintance narrated the particulars of the duel. The conditions of the meeting had been that if the first exchange of shots should fail to satisfy {{one of the two}} gentlemen, a second should take place. Valentin's first bullet had done exactly what Newman's companion was convinced he had intended it to do; it had grazed the arm of M. Stanislas Kapp, just scratching the flesh. M. Kapp's own projectile, meanwhile, had passed at ten good inches from the person of Valentin. The representatives of M. Stanislas had demanded another shot, which was granted. Valentin had then fired aside and the young Alsatian had done <b>effective</b> <b>execution.</b> [...] "I saw, when we met him on the ground," [...] said Newman's informant, [...] "that {{he was not going to}} be commode. It is a kind of bovine temperament." [...] Valentin had immediately been installed at the inn, and M. Stanislas and his friends had withdrawn to regions unknown. The police authorities of the canton had waited upon the party at the inn, had been extremely majestic, and had drawn up a long proces-verbal; but it was probable that they would wink at so very gentlemanly a bit of bloodshed. Newman asked whether a message had not been sent to Valentin's family, and learned that up to a late hour on the preceding evening Valentin had opposed it. He had refused to believe his wound was dangerous. But after his interview with the cure he had consented, and a telegram had been dispatched to his mother. [...] "But the marquise had better hurry!" [...] said Newman's conductor.|$|E

Past {{studies have shown}} that RDB 2 RDF systems do not perform well, in other words, the execution time of a SPARQL query on a RDB 2 RDF system compared to its semantically equivalent SQL query is much slower.

We experimented on Microsoft SQL Server, using the Barton and Berlin SPARQL Benchmark, and Ultrawrap, an automatic RDB 2 RDF wrapping system that has been architectured to leverage the SQL optimizer.

40|$|The last decade, civil {{engineering}} has exercised {{a rapidly growing}} interest {{in the application of}} neurally inspired computing techniques. The motive for this interest was the promises of certain information processing characteristics, which are similar to some extend, to those of human brain. The immediate examples of these include an ability to learn and generalize. In parallel to this and further developments in the information systems technology, established the essential motivation that the construction industry should benefit from these developments for enhanced and <b>effective</b> <b>executions.</b> Today such information processing methods are collectively referred to as soft computing (SC). Explicitly, soft computing is an emerging approach to computing which parallels the remarkable ability of the human mind to reason and learn in an environment of certainty and imprecision. SC consists of several computing paradigms, including neural networks, fuzzy set theory, approximate reasoning and combinatorial optimization methods such as genetic algorithms. SC finds important applications in diverse disciplines. As a branch of artificial intelligence, soft computing is closely related to computational intelligence where in essence SC methods are implemented by machine learning techniques. Paper deals with SC in the context of construction information technology (CIT) pointing out the important role it can play. It exemplifies the SC applications in CIT supported by pilot implementations, which are carried out as a part of ongoing departmental research program. Architecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

50|$|Others however {{dispute the}} link between RAN testing and phonological processing. They argue that phonological {{awareness}} is more strongly related to pure decoding ability, whereas naming speed {{appears to be more}} strongly related to reading fluency. Similarly, other researchers view RAN as a sub-process of phonological awareness. In this view RAN is seen as a task that draws on accessing phonological codes for <b>effective</b> <b>execution.</b> Although the relationship between RAN and phonological awareness is monotonic, these measures do not produce uniform changes. Instead, as reading skills increase or decrease, RAN and phonological awareness skills do not change uniformly.|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} I/O bound {{processes}} are slower than non-I/O bound processes, not faster. This {{is due to}} increases {{in the rate of}} data processing in the core, while the rate at which data is transferred from storage to the processor does not increase with it. As CPU clock speed increases, allowing more instructions to be executed in a given time window, the limiting factor of <b>effective</b> <b>execution</b> is the rate at which instructions can be delivered to the processor from storage, and sent from the processor to their destination. In short, programs naturally shift to being more and more I/O bound.|$|E
