5|$|Continuing a {{theme of}} his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion of}} the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Recovery</b> System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, constructors {{were allowed}} to use <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> systems (KERS), also called {{regenerative}} brakes. Energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor), with a maximum power of 81hp (60kW; 82 PS). Four teams used it {{at some point in}} the season: Ferrari, Renault, BMW, and McLaren.|$|E
25|$|Ten teams {{participated in}} the Championship after several rule changes were {{implemented}} by the FIA to cut costs to try to minimise {{the impact of the}} global financial crisis. There were further changes to try to improve the on-track spectacle with the return of slick tyres, changes to aerodynamics and the introduction of <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Recovery</b> Systems (KERS) presenting some of the biggest changes in Formula One regulations for several decades.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kinetic</b> braking <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> rate {{is higher}} and {{therefore}} the system is more efficient than 2013-era battery charged hybrids, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in economy in EPA testing. In EPA tests a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned 32 mpg in urban driving and 22 mpg on the highway.|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{movements}} of the body segments due to lowest level gait disorders such as musculoskeletal disorders, peripheral neuropathies and radiculopathies or middle-level disorders such as hemiplegia, paraplegia and dystonia influence {{the motion of the}} centre of gravity (CG) during walking. The translation of the CG can be studied by the work done by muscles (WExt) with respect to the ground. The efficacy of gait's mechanism can be quantified by the energy transferred between gravitational potential and <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> (<b>recovery).</b> WExt and recovery were investigated in lowest and middle-level gait disorders during level walking. No statistical significant difference was observed between patients with lowest-level gait disorders and normal subjects. However, WExt was increased for the patients with middle-level gait disorders and recovery decreased up to 20 %. The measurement of changes in mechanical energy of the CG might be a summary indicator for the mechanics of pathological gait...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{production}} of energy for traction in classical vehicles is performed by petrol or oil combustion. The consequence is green gas production. Paper deals with different power trains of electric hybrid and electric vehicles. Electric hybrid vehicles diminish the fuel consumption by giving to {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE) better working conditions with respect to ICE revolutions and demanded power. The <b>kinetic</b> braking <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> is an important feature too. Electric vehicles are usually called “green vehicles”. It is true that they do not produce green gas on places where they are driving but {{it is also true that}} their traction energy has to be produced with another energy technology used in electric plants. The efficiency of the vehicle powertrain is important. The energy for transportation by vehicles in the world is great. Therefore it is very important what energy production technology for this traction purposes will be used...|$|R
25|$|FIA President Max Mosley {{announced}} dramatic rule {{changes for}} the 2009 season {{in a bid to}} improve the spectacle of the sport, with the cars undergoing major changes in an effort to increase overtaking. The design changes significantly altered the design of the cars, incorporating wider and lower front wings, taller and narrower rear wings, and a reduction on aerodynamic bodywork. Also introduced were slick tyres and <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Recovery</b> Systems, as well as implementing cost-cutting measures in a response to the rising costs of competing.|$|E
25|$|WHP {{was first}} {{established}} in 2008 and immediately set about {{developing a new}} flywheel energy-recovery system for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Recovery</b> Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery systems, Williams F1 opted {{to go down the}} flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology's wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel. WHP has also seen its flywheel technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK's biggest transport operators. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to GKN.|$|E
25|$|But {{the most}} {{significant}} system introduced in F1 was the <b>Kinetic</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Recovery</b> System (KERS), a system that stores energy created by braking that is stored through a flywheel and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year {{but it was too}} experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine and gearbox mileage. Many teams voiced concerns over the cost of KERS and have suggested a standardised unit, but so far no such opportunity exists. The new rules and regulations saw a new order in 2009, with new teams Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing and their drivers leading the way, with Ferrari and McLaren having a poor season. However Ferrari started by the British Grand Prix {{to make the most of}} their car with a string of podium finishes and a race victory in Belgium, while a redesign of the McLaren challenger helped Lewis Hamilton to win two races and gain more points than any other driver after it was upgraded at the German Grand Prix. After dominating the beginning of the season with six out of seven race wins, Jenson Button eventually clinched the Drivers' title in Brazil, with Brawn GP winning the Constructors' Championship in its only season, before being taken over by Mercedes. Rubens Barrichello, Jenson Button's teammate, was second in the Drivers' Championship for the whole season until he had a problem at the Brazilian Grand Prix and was overtaken (in points) by Sebastian Vettel, a Red Bull driver, who won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to finish eleven points behind Button. Also, the major manufacturer teams were starting to disappear rapidly due to the worldwide economy crisis. In addition to Ford/Jaguar which had left in 2004, Honda had departed in 2008 also due to uncompetitiveness, Toyota and BMW both departed entirely in 2009 (BMW sold Sauber, a team it had bought in 2005 after its split with Williams even though in 2010 the team was still called BMW Sauber), Renault changed their involvement as a full works effort to engine supplier in 2011 and Cosworth departed entirely as an engine supplier in 2013.|$|E

40|$|Limitations in <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> {{technology}} require extended {{research for}} development of existing and alternative solutions. This thesis project has treated valuing pneumatic drivetrain independent <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> system as a potential solution. The prototype built during this project uses a piston compressor to transform <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> into compressed air. The compressed air was then stored in two air tanks and transformed into <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> with an air motor on demand. The prototype was built on a rig using a high power electrical engine to simulate energy input from the wheels during braking. The air motor was then used to rotate a Volvo S 40 engine simulating energy output to the wheels. To further illustrate how the technology can be implemented in vehicles and to emphasize the variety of pneumatic <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> solutions a 3 D CAD model was designed and other components was reflected. Such as using a screw compressor instead of piston and also using the compressor as a motor {{reducing the number of}} components optimizing the system. The system storing the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> {{does not mean that the}} vehicle can manage without an ordinary brake system. The regenerative braking effect rapidly reduces at lower speeds; therefore friction brake is still required in order to bring the vehicle to a complete halt. Analyses of strength of strained components acknowledge that limited <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> is possible without redimensioning the driveshaft´s. The limitation is regulated by the original dimension for engine load, with subject to the CV joint. Optimum positioning of the compressor due to the limited space in a modern vehicle is behind the gearbox in conjunction with the gearbox outgoing pinion for short energy transportation. Electrical <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> system is the solution with the highest potential on the market today but electrical vehicles covers just a fraction of the vehicle industry doe to technical and infrastructural limitations. Drivetrain independent pneumatic, hydraulic or mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> systems lay the foundation of a common ground for all vehicles and other waste energy machinery to use one <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> technology.

500|$|First, the {{turbocharger}} {{was split}} and positioned alongside the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H)—the generator harvesting heat {{energy from the}} exhaust manifold used to power the turbine—and positioned within the cylinder banks forming the 'V' configuration of the engine. In order to make this fit, Honda eschewed {{the use of a}} centrifugal fan in its single-stage compressor in favour of using several smaller fans positioned at intervals along a shaft. Although this would limit the ability of the turbocharger to build up the maximum amount of boost pressure, the 100kg/h fuel flow limit introduced in 2014 minimised the impact of this. The Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K)—the generator harvesting energy from the engine spinning while under braking—was positioned in front of the engine to deliver energy directly to the crankshaft, following the convention established with the introduction of the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> system in [...] The batteries housing the energy harvested by the MGU-H and MGU-K were merged with the Electronic Control Unit and positioned in front of the engine.

The regulations limit the additional power to around [...] of 400kJ for six seconds a lap. The systems were not made compulsory, and because of concerns about both limited performance gains and safety implications only four teams opted to use the system during the season.|$|E
2500|$|The Toyota TS030 Hybrid was a Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) {{sports car}} built by Toyota Motorsport GmbH {{and used by}} the {{manufacturer}} in the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2012 and 2013.

During ground walking, the whole body centre of mass (COM) acts like an inverted pendulum recovering energy, thereby reducing the effort of locomotion. The <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> has a relationship with speed whereby maximum recovery occurs at intermediate speeds. In order to determine the relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> and speed during treadmill walking, we investigated estimated COM displacement in nine healthy individuals each walking on a treadmill at seven different speeds.

Our participants formed two distinct groups, those with normal COM <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> (N%R) that was similar to ground walking, and those with low COM <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> (L%R) that was different from typical ground walking. The low <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> in the L%R group was attributed to in-phase potential and <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> fluctuations.

50|$|A {{regenerative}} brake is an <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> mechanism which slows a vehicle or object by converting its <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> {{into a form}} which can be either used immediately or stored until needed. This contrasts with conventional braking systems, where the excess <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> is converted to unwanted and wasted heat by friction in the brakes, or with dynamic brakes, where energy is recovered by using electric motors as generators but is immediately dissipated as heat in resistors. In addition to improving the overall efficiency of the vehicle, regeneration can greatly {{extend the life of}} the braking system as its parts do not wear as quickly.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>recovery</b> system—known from [...] to 2013 as KERS, and renamed from 2014 as ERS-K—was {{incorporated}} into {{the design of the}} engine and its usage increased; its function as a supplementary power source was taken by the introduction of the heat-based energy recovery system (ERS). The ERS unit captured waste heat as it was dispelled from the exhaust turbocharger, using an electrical device known as a heat motor generator unit. This waste heat was stored as an electrical charge until it was used by a complementary system called the kinetic motor generator unit. This device was connected directly to the drive train to deliver the additional power in the most direct and efficient way.

40|$|The growing {{issues of}} energy {{shortage}} {{and the environmental}} crisis has resulted in new challenges for the automotive industry. Conventional commercial vehicles, such as refuse trucks and delivery vehicles, consume significantly more energy than other on-road vehicles since they have the characteristic of frequent start/stop with high moment of inertia and drive at low speeds on designated city routes. It is important to make these vehicles more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. The hybrid commercial vehicle is a promising solution to reduce emissions and to meet the future vehicle emission standard since it is generally equipped with braking energy regeneration systems to recover the kinematic loss from frequent braking.
