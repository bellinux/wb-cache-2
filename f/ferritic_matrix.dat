50|$|A typical {{chemical}} composition {{to obtain a}} graphitic microstructure is 2.5 to 4.0% carbon and 1 to 3% silicon by weight. Graphite may occupy 6 to 10% {{of the volume of}} grey iron. Silicon is important for making grey iron as opposed to white cast iron, because silicon is a graphite stabilizing element in cast iron, which means it helps the alloy produce graphite instead of iron carbides; at 3% silicon almost no carbon is held in chemical form as iron carbide. Another factor affecting graphitization is the solidification rate; the slower the rate, the greater the time for the carbon to diffuse and accumulate into graphite. A moderate cooling rate forms a more pearlitic matrix, while a fast cooling rate forms a more <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix.</b> To achieve a fully <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> the alloy must be annealed. Rapid cooling partly or completely suppresses graphitization and leads to the formation of cementite, which is called white iron.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the spatial distribution of the austenitic phase on the effective mechanical properties of a multiphase steel assisted by transformation-induced plasticity is analyzed using a numerical homogenization scheme. Representative three-dimensional volume elements with distinct microstructures are created applying a newly-developed algorithm based on the generation of a multilevel Voronoi tessellation; this approach allows for straightforwardly incorporating grains with complex, non-convex shapes in the microstructure. The effective macroscopic response of the samples is computed under the formulation {{of a set of}} non-redundant, periodic boundary conditions, which warrants a consistent transition between the microscopic and macroscopic scales.

40|$|For {{a proper}} {{estimation}} of the fatigue life of a heavy-walled cast component made of nodular cast iron, sufficient knowledge regarding the cyclic properties of the material is necessary. Based on the material parameters at hand for component design, different fatigue analysis procedures can be used. Elastic and elastic-plastic approaches can be adopted, with the latter being reserved only for local approaches. The present publication summarizes the cyclic material parameters gained during a research project by extensive material tests under stress and strain controlled cyclic loading at different load ratios for three nodular cast iron grades. In addition to an improved knowledge of the cyclic material behavior, the notch, the size effects and the mean stress sensitivity were of special concern during the investigations {{in order to provide}} an entire overview of the tested materials and thus input information for both stress and strain based design approaches. Tests were performed for specimens taken from large cast blocks of the nodular cast iron grades EN-GJS- 400 - 18 U-LT and EN-GJS- 450 - 18, both with <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrices,</b> and EN-GJS- 700 - 2 with a pearlitic matrix. For some of these materials, mean stress sensitivities above 0. 5 were obtained during the investigations. These values are not covered by the common standards, which calculate lower values for the mean stress sensitivity. Cyclic material parameters for stress and strain controlled tests are given in this paper as well as values for the size effect, based on the concept of the highly stressed volume.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{feasibility}} of obtaining Austempered Ductile Iron with Dual Phase structures (DPADI) through heat treatment, starting from different as-cast microstructures. The mechanical properties on these microstructures were evaluated. DPADI microstructures were obtained by adding different tenors of silicon (2. 4 % to 4. 2 %) to the melts and keeping the other alloying elements constant. The study focused on {{the determination of the}} time required to achieve the percentages of equilibrium phases (ferrite and austenite) at different temperatures in the intercritical temperature interval {{as a function of the}} starting as cast microstructure. The results showed that, as the silicon content increases, higher amount of ferrite is present in the as cast structure, and the time required to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium phases in the intercritical temperature interval is markedly reduced. Similarly, for a constant chemical composition, as the intercritical austenitizing temperature increases, the time required to reach the quantities of the equilibrium phases decreases. Regarding mechanical properties, the tests revealed that, as expected, as intercritical austenitising temperature increases so do tensile strength and hardness due to the higher ausferrite content in the DPADI matrix. These results indicate that high silicon Ductile Iron (with Si content higher than 3 %) with a mostly ferritic microstructure in as cast conditions yields DPADI microstructures able to dispense with prior annealing heat treatments since the time required to reach the phase equilibrium percentages is compatible with the industrial practice and the mechanical properties are similar as compared to DPADI structures deriving from fully <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrices.</b> Fil: Basso, Alejandro Daniel.

Design/methodology/approach: Machining of hardened alloys has some metallurgical and mechanical difficulties even if many successful processes have been increasingly developed. A lot of study has been carried out on this subject, however only with modest progress showing specific results concerning the real efficiency of chip formation. Hence, some crucial questions remain unanswered: the evolution of white layers produced during progressive tool flank wear in dry hard turning and to correlate this with the surface integrity of the machined surface. For the experimental study here, various cutting speeds and feed rates have been applied on the work material.

To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the test pieces, JIS 8 C type tensile strength test pieces, were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot. Irons, about 3 kg, were melted in a high frequency induction furnace at about 1450 ℃ with alumina crucible and were poured into the mold at 1300 ℃, after　being　inoculated　at　 1450 ℃ with 0. 3 % Ca-Si.

40|$|Due to the {{stringent}} {{demands for}} lower emission from trucks require better mechanical {{properties of the}} material {{to be used in}} the engines. Better efficiency necessitates higher peak pressure in the engines and for traditionally used material, Flake Graphite Iron (FGI), the mechanical properties starts to reach the limit of what the material can withstand. Instead of using FGI, Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) is an excellent replacement. Compared to FGI, the vermicular graphite in CGI improves the tensile strength of the material. Although the thermal conductivity and damping ability are lower in CGI, it fulfills the engineering aspects of an engine. Concerning machinability, CGI has lower machinability than FGI, especially in continuous cutting operations. Also, as the material is recently introduced into manufacturing the knowledge of its machining is inadequate and requires improvement. It is therefore necessary to obtain increased knowledge of casting and machining of CGI to implement it successfully as an engine material. To achieve this objective a large number of CGI materials have been casted and the machinability parameters have been tested and presented in this thesis. The main focus in this thesis has been on studying the correlation between materials microstructure, their mechanical properties and machinability. The thesis covers the influence of material matrix and nodularity on the machinability of CGI material. A range of materials were tested from <b>ferritic</b> to pearlitic <b>matrix.</b> Empirical relations have been used which were driven from experimental results. Relationships between chemical compositions, material microstructure and material’s physical properties have been presented. By understanding such relationships CGI materials could be optimized for design and manufacturing requirements. For machinability analysis mainly tool life and cutting forces were taken into consideration for the evaluation of machinability analysis. Due to the complexity of machining process, the focus of the research was to develop the empirical models for tool life and cutting forces for continuous cutting operation. The influence of micro-edge geometry on the machinability of CGI has also been presented in the thesis. Empirical models for tool life and cutting forces as a function of cutting edge geometry and cutting parameters have been presented for continuous cutting operations. Machinability of CGI has also been compared with other graphitic grades of cast iron and the importance of cutting fluid use in continuous cutting operation has been highlighted. The thesis also covers the performance testing of different cutting fluids. Some methods have been presented in the thesis to evaluate the performance of cutting fluids. For cutting fluids testing, drilling and tapping tests were performed into aluminium alloy (AlSi 9 Cu 3) and alloy steel (SAE 52100), which are the materials extensively used in automotive industry. The results reveal that type and concentration of cutting fluids have effect on the torque, thrust force, tool life and surface quality.

This phenomenon can stem from different factors associated to {{the balance of the}} phases, the nature of the interface, the distribution, size and shape of the second phase, and possibly also from difference in rheology between ferrite and austenite. In order to determine the specific influence of phase morphology on the hot-workability of DSS, two austenite morphologies (E: Equiaxed and W: Widmanstätten) with very similar phase ratio have been generated using appropriate heat treatments. It was checked that the latter treatments generate stable microstructures so that subsequent hot mechanical tests are performed on the microstructures of interest. One microstructure consists of a <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> with austenitic equiaxed islands while the other microstructure is composed of a <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> with Widmanstätten austenite. The latter morphology corresponds to the morphology observed in as-cast slabs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of intercritically rolled TRIP-assisted multiphase steels. It is shown that the occurrence of the TRIP effect in a recovered <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> brings about an improved strength-ductility balance {{with respect to a}} fully recrystallised ferrite matrix. On the other hand, the intercritical deformation does not influence the austenite transformation rate during straining at room temperature. The improvement of the mechanical properties results from the interactions between the transformation strain and the recovered ferrite. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Atom probe {{tomography}} (APT) is used {{to investigate}} the composition of oxygen rich nanoparticles within a <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> in Fe- 14 Cr- 2 W- 0. 1 Ti oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steel. This study investigates whether artifacts associated with APT analysis are {{the cause of a}} sub-stoichiometric oxide composition measurement. Bulk Y₂O₃ is analyzed by APT, thus demonstrating the ability of the technique to measure near-stoichiometric composition measurements in insulating oxides. Through analysis of the sequence of ion hits on the detector during APT data acquisition, it is shown that a proportion of yttrium hits are spatially correlated but oxygen hits are not. Y-O based nanoparticles in a <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> are analyzed by APT using voltage pulsing and a laser pulsing with a range of laser energies from 0. 3 - 0. 8 nJ. When the material is analyzed using a high effective evaporation field, this influences the effect of trajectory aberrations, and the apparent size of the nanoparticles is reduced. Some reduction in Y:O ratio is observed, caused by high instances of multiple-ion evaporation events. From a detailed comparison between the results of APT analysis of the bulk Y₂O₃ the nanoparticles in the ODS material are concluded to have an approximate Y:O ratio of 1 : 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of super duplex stainless steels AISI F 55 -UNS S 32760 in hot-dip aluminizing {{process has been}} studied, investigating the influence of cold working and of different initial microstructures obtained through a preliminary thermal treatment. The microstructural features examined are the secondary austenite precipitation, the static recovery of ferrite and the thermal dissolution of austenite within <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix.</b> The hot-dip aluminizing temperature has been optimized through sessile drop tests. The treatment has been performed at 1100 °C for 300 s, 900 s and 2700 s. A strong chemical interaction occurs, generating intermetallic compounds at the interface. Molten aluminum interacts exclusively with the ferritic phase due to its much higher diffusivity in this phase coupled with its marked ferrite-stabilizer behavior. Thus, the influence of cold working is not remarkable, since the strains are mainly allocated by austenitic phase. The diffusivity of aluminum increases due to lattice defects thermally generated and, mainly, to influence given by grain boundaries, multiplied by secondary austenite precipitation, which act as short-circuit diffusion paths. Ni and Cr contents in the <b>ferritic</b> <b>matrix</b> have an influence but not highly relevant. Then, the best starting condition of the super duplex stainless steel substrates, to obtain a thick interfacial layer, are the thermal annealing at 1080 °C for 360 s/mm after a solution thermal treatment at 1300 °C for 60 s/mm...|$|E

The present paper explores the effect of the heating rate and temperature on the accelerated carbide spheroidisation process and on the resulting hardness.
