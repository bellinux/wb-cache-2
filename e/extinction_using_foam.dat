40|$|ABSTRACT Current control {{strategies}} for avian influ-enza and other highly contagious poultry diseases often include quarantine, depopulation, {{and disposal of}} in-fected birds. For biosecurity reasons, on-farm depopula-tion and disposal methods are preferred. The options for mass depopulation are limited, {{as reported by the}} “ 2000 Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia. ” Current de-population techniques may have excessive labor require-ments, are not appropriate for all house types, and may not be suitable for large-scale emergency implementation. A procedure has been developed that <b>uses</b> <b>foam</b> to rapidly form a blanket over the birds. The procedure requires relatively few people, can be performed in a variety of house types, and is compatible with in-house composting.

40|$|Abstract Background Negative {{pressure}} wound therapy (NPWT) has remarkable {{effects on}} the healing of poststernotomy mediastinitis. Foam is presently the material of choice for NPWT in this indication. There is now increasing interest in using gauze, as this has proven successful {{in the treatment of}} peripheral wounds. It is important {{to determine the effects of}} NPWT using gauze on heart pumping function before it can be used for deep sternotomy wounds. The aim was to examine the effects of NPWT when <b>using</b> gauze and <b>foam</b> on the heart pumping function during the treatment of a sternotomy wound. Methods Eight pigs underwent median sternotomy followed by NPWT at - 40, - 70, - 120 and - 160 mmHg, <b>using</b> <b>foam</b> or gauze. The heart frequency, cardiac output, mean systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure and left atrial pressure were recorded. Results Cardiac output was not affected by NPWT <b>using</b> gauze or <b>foam.</b> Heart frequency decreased during NPWT when <b>using</b> <b>foam,</b> but not gauze. Treatment with foam also lowered the central venous pressure and the left atrial pressure, while gauze had no such effects. Mean systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure and systemic vascular resistance were not affected by NPWT. Similar haemodynamic effects were observed at all levels of negative pressure studied. Conclusions NPWT <b>using</b> <b>foam</b> results in decreased heart frequency and lower right and left atrial filling pressures. The use of gauze in NPWT did not affect the haemodynamic parameters studied. Gauze may thus provide an alternative to foam for NPWT of sternotomy wounds. </p...|$|R
