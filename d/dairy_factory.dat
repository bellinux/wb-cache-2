25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis <b>Dairy</b> <b>Factory</b> in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside {{the trunk of the}} Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans onto the back of delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E
500|$|The studio {{recording}} on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the {{one that}} most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage. It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966, recorded live-in-studio at Thompson Private Recording Company. This version was used as the audio sound to the film San Francisco, which was made by a friend of Barrett's, Anthony Stern. While filmmaker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion, the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern, to which Whitehead told him, [...] "yeah, terrible music". Stern said that [...] "they're successful now", and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd, at their gig at the Royal College of Art. Whitehead recalled that they [...] "went to UFO and I liked them. Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality, ideal for what I wanted." [...] Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for a film he was working on. Before turning up at the recording studio, the band held a rehearsal, and the next day, 11 January 1967, went to Sound Techniques studios. The studio, which was originally a <b>dairy</b> <b>factory,</b> was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood.|$|E

Responding to a recent investigation at New York’s largest <b>dairy</b> <b>factory</b> that revealed shocking images of animal abuse, NY’s agribusiness industry is now attempting to shield its inhumane practices from any further public scrutiny and debate.

[...] Nonetheless, the mixed trains lasted another two decades (longer than the railcars, which ceased operating in 1967); the last one ran between Whangarei and Opua on 18 June 1976. [...] From this time, this part was used to carry solely freight, almost all of which was output from the Moerewa <b>Dairy</b> <b>Factory</b> and Affco Meat Works to the port of Opua. [...] By the 1980s, regular freight services beyond Kawakawa were becoming irregular due to the decline of shipping to Opua as a result of containerisation.

In 1881, the newly arrived colonist William Bowron gave {{a series of}} lectures propounding {{the notion that the}} institution of <b>dairy</b> <b>factories,</b> for the mass production of cheese, would be greatly advantageous to the economy of New Zealand. He was largely instrumental in the establishment of the Ashburton Cheese and Butter Factory at Flemington, managed by William Harding, son of the Cheddar Cheese founder Joseph Harding.

In addition, HRW said that by providing logistical and intelligence assistance to coalition forces, [...] "the United States may have become a party to the conflict, creating obligations under the laws of war".

2500|$|As {{summarized}} {{by the official}} press of his time, he [...] "put all his efforts into directing peasants toward the cottage industry", created [...] "home economics classes and adult education courses", and [...] "was the first to speak" [...] at educational conferences. He established a <b>dairy</b> <b>factory,</b> as well as shops for weavers, ropemakers, wainwrights and woodturners, and showcased their products at the 1900 World's Fair. Following Julius Kühn, Kalinderu insisted that the precondition of a [...] "rational economy" [...] was good livestock, so he inaugurated a freely accessible breeding program, also providing tenants with cultivars, or with beekeeping and sericulture implements. He also reintroduced reforestation and forest farming where bad practices had affected the environment. Kalinderu held {{the notion that the}} Romanian peasant was miserable for being illiterate, and that [...] "all it takes is a set of favorable circumstances for him to display [...] talents". The efforts to educate his tenants were conjugated with those of Steauas Haret, by then National Liberal Minister of Education, providing young students with work experience and physical culture, as well as inculcating in them a patriotic awareness. A significant portion of his time was spent on teaching peasants to diversify their diet, including providing hired hands with daily rations of vegetables, meat and milk.
