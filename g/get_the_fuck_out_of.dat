500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E

5000|$|Everything {{came to a}} {{grinding}} halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run {{for almost two decades}} but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that “... {{no one wants to be}} the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn’t want to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.” [...] - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again.|$|E

He reached out to Planes Mistaken for Stars' original bassist Aaron Wise (who only appeared on their debut self-titled EP). Wise ultimately told O'Donnell to return to his family. O'Donnell said: [...] "He came out and we had a couple adventures, and then he was like, 'It sounds like you just need to go home and focus on clearing your head and being with your family.' In doing so, I figured out what the theme was for the record: waking up. Waking up and learning to tackle things head on." ...|$|E

The segment shows several of Taylor's attempts to [...] "pop the question", including hanging a sign over a freeway and [...] "proposing" [...] on a big screen at an outdoor festival. For the finale, Taylor introduces the interview of him on the morning television program Sunrise. In the interview, Taylor asks the hosts if he can send a quick message to his partner, he then proceeds and says [...] "Jo, <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my life. And if you don't get this fucking message right now, you never will." [...] This finale from the segment was leaked onto the internet without the break-up plan and has been widely distributed online as a viral video. Many viewers believed the segment was actually real but Taylor admitted on national radio station Triple J that it was set up. It was actually filmed after Sunrise went to air, with Channel Seven editing on screen graphics with current news at the time for realism. The hosts of Sunrise admitted it was a set up and apologised. However, they did not know what Taylor was going to say because he only asked if he could do a bit for the show and as a result, their interaction with Taylor was unscripted, as well as their reaction to his profane message.|$|E
