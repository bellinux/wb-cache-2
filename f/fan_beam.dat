The envisaged application is for snow and ice mapping and ocean wind vector measurement. The vastly increased complexity of the high-frequency waveband may not be justified by the scientific benefit and operation at an additional lower frequency such as 18 GHz may give improved classification, though with reduced spatial resolution.

40|$|Tetrahedron beam {{computed}} tomography (TBCT) performs volumetric imaging using {{a stack of}} <b>fan</b> <b>beams</b> generated by a multiple pixel X-ray source. While the TBCT system was designed to overcome the scatter and detector issues faced by cone beam {{computed tomography}} (CBCT), it still suffers the same large cone angle artifacts as CBCT due {{to the use of}} approximate reconstruction algorithms.

In this paper, the SART algorithm is modified for the use with the different TBCT geometries and is tested using both simulated projection data and data acquired using the TBCT benchtop system. The modified SART reconstruction algorithms were able to mitigate the effects of using data generated at large cone angles and were also able to reconstruct CT images without the introduction of artifacts due to either the longitudinal or transverse truncation in the data sets.

The source {{was shown to}} have a complicated pulse-averaged X-ray spectral continuum with possible evidence of cyclotron absorption features. In this paper we present the first pulse-phase resolved analysis of the broad band X-ray spectra of EXO 2030 + 375 obtained with the INTEGRAL observatory close to the maximum and during the decay phase of the giant outburst. We report a strong variability of the spectrum with pulse phase. Alternative spectral continuum models are discussed.

40|$|High-quality {{averaged}} radio {{profiles of}} some pulsars exhibit double, highly symmetric features both in emission and absorption. It is shown that {{both types of}} features are produced by a split-fan beam of extraordinary-mode curvature radiation (CR) that is emitted/absorbed by radially-extended streams of magnetospheric plasma. With no emissivity in {{the plane of the}} stream, such a beam produces bifurcated emission components (BFCs) when our line of sight passes through the plane. A distinct example of double component created in that way is present in averaged profile of the 5 ms pulsar J 1012 + 5307. We show that the component can indeed be very well fitted by the textbook formula for the non-coherent beam of curvature radiation in the polarisation state that is orthogonal to the plane of electron trajectory. The observed width of the BFC decreases with increasing frequency at the rate that confirms the curvature origin. Likewise, the double absorption features (double notches) are produced by the same beam of the extraordinary-mode CR, when it is eclipsed by thin plasma streams. The intrinsic property of CR to create bifurcated <b>fan</b> <b>beams</b> explains the double features in terms of very natural geometry and implies the curvature origin of pulsar radio emission.
