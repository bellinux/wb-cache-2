25|$|Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the <b>drill</b> <b>string</b> forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|E
500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire <b>drill</b> <b>string</b> must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the <b>drill</b> <b>string</b> is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the <b>drill</b> <b>string</b> is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E

30|$|In {{the type}} of deep {{drilling}} operations that are commonly used for hydrocarbon exploration and recovery, {{there are a few}} common designs. These drilling operations typically make use of <b>drill</b> <b>strings,</b> which are pipes that transmit both drilling fluid and torque necessary to rotate a drill bit. The top end of a <b>drilling</b> <b>string</b> typically has the machinery necessary to pump the drilling fluid, and either a top or kelly drive to provide torque for the drill bit. Pipe typically encases the string below, to contain the drilling fluid. The lower end of the string, consisting of the drill bit, collars and other components that are collectively known as the bottom hole assembly (BHA), is the region of many failures (Macdonald and Bjune 2007). Typical problems that are encountered include severe stick–slip, lateral vibration, hole enlargement, which induce poor directional control. Inevitably this problem causes costly drilling equipment failures.|$|R
