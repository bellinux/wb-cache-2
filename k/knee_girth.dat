40|$|Objectives: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of a patellar strap on the proprioception of the symptomatic leg in PT. Secondary aims were to investigate a possible difference in effectiveness between athletes with high and low proprioceptive acuity, and whether predictors of effectiveness could be found. Design: Randomised cross-over pilot study. Methods: 24 athletes with PT (age 27. 3 +/- 9. 0, VISA-P 50. 6 +/- 11. 2) performed a joint position sense test with and without a patellar strap. The difference between both conditions was analysed using linear mixed-model analysis. Results: No improvement in the joint position sense using the strap for the whole group was found, while those classified as having low proprioceptive acuity did improve using the strap (p = 0. 015, 17. 2 %). A larger <b>knee</b> <b>girth,</b> longer duration of symptoms and more tendon abnormalities were negatively associated with the strap's effectiveness. Conclusions: The use of a patellar strap improves the knee joint proprioception - measured with joint position sense - of the symptomatic leg in athletes with poor proprioceptive acuity. Especially athletes with relatively small <b>knee</b> <b>girth,</b> short duration of symptoms and small tendon abnormalities might benefit from the strap. As proprioception plays an important role in motor control, and deficits in proprioception may put an athlete at risk for (re-) injury, these findings may be relevant for prevention as well as rehabilitation purposes in those PT athletes with low proprioceptive acuity...|$|E

A {{patient with}} {{mobility}} deficits secondary to posterolateral corner/posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery was seen for 8 physical therapy treatment sessions from July 3 rd, 2014 to August 20 th, 2014 at an outpatient clinic {{under the supervision}} of a licensed physical therapist. 	The patient was evaluated at the initial encounter with goniometry, muscle strength testing, mid-patella <b>knee</b> <b>girth</b> measurement, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, the 6 Minute Walk Test and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, and a plan of care was established. Main goals for the patient were to demonstrate: active right knee flexion to 90 ??; a right straight leg raise without quadriceps lag; the ability to safely ambulate using axillary crutches maintaining non-weight-bearing status on the right lower extremity; and 100...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in order to study changes in body measurements in the Chiapas sheep breed. For this purpose 66 males and 79 females of various ages were measured: body weight, chest <b>girth,</b> <b>knee</b> perimeter, cannon perimeter, coronne perimeter, hock perimeter and ear length. The study reflects a regional change according to age, which are not isometrical. Body weight and chest girth are the most discriminative variables, which presented identical age regression trajectories for both sexes (F= 1. 006, p= 0. 317). Although body weight in adult male (> 12 months, n= 56) was greater than those of females (n= 64) (U= 1320, p= 0. 014), and no differences appeared for chest girth (U= 1720, p= 0. 704), regression trajectories for both traits appeared similar...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study}} was to detect if {{increases}} in functional levels for patients with osteoarthritis show differences between an aquatic exercise program and a land-based exercise program. Forty-six subjects between the ages of 45 and 70 years participated in 1 of 2 exercise groups. Pre- and posttest measurements included knee range of motion (ROM), thigh girth, subjective pain scale, and time for a 1 -mile walk. Both exercise groups showed a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in all measurements between pre- and posttests. There were no significant differences between the aquatic exercise group and the land-based exercise group pertaining to <b>knee</b> ROM, thigh <b>girth,</b> and time for a 1 -mile walk. Subjective pain levels were significantly less in the aquatic group when compared with the land-based group. This study concludes that both aquatic and land-based exercise programs are beneficial to patients with osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{effects of}} TENS before {{exercise}} (TBE) and TENS after exercise (TAE) {{in the management}} of knee osteoarthritis (OA) were compared. Methods Fifteen participants with knee OA were alternatively assigned to either TBE or TAE groups. Participants' pain, active <b>knee</b> flexibility, thigh <b>girth,</b> disability, and activity levels were assessed at baseline {{and at the end of}} eight-week study. Mixed design two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at P < 0. 05 was used to compare the two groups. Results The mean age of the participants was 58. 1 ± 10. 9 years. Post-intervention comparison showed that TAE had significantly lower scores (1. 9 ± 0. 9) than TBE (4. 3 ± 1. 5) on Disability Index Questionnaire (DIQ) (F -ratio = 10. 5; P = 0. 006), and significantly lower scores (0. 8 ± 0. 3) than TBE (1. 4 ± 0. 6) on Patient Assessment Scale (PAS) (F -ratio = 8. 3; P = 0. 013). However, both groups did not significantly differ on the selected impairment measures. Conclusion TAE was found to be more effective on the primary outcome measures in patients with knee OA...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{combined}} oral beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) supplementation on indices of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) after an acute bout of eccentric-biased exercise. Fourteen male subjects were allocated to 2 groups: a placebo group (3 g. d corn flour, N = 7) or an HMB + KIC group (3 g. d HMB and 0. 3 g. d KIC, N = 7). Supplementation commenced 11 days before a 40 -minute bout of downhill running and continued for 3 days post-exercise. Delayed-onset muscle soreness, mid-thigh <b>girth,</b> <b>knee</b> extensor range of motion, serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, and isometric and concentric torque were assessed pre-exercise and at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise. Delayed-onset muscle soreness, CK activity, and isometric and concentric torque all changed over the 72 -hour period (p < 0. 05); however, HMB + KIC had no significant effect on any of the indices of muscle damage. Although 14 days HMB and KIC supplementation did not attenuate indices of EIMD after an acute bout of unaccustomed eccentric-biased exercise, there was a trend for a more rapid rate of recovery in isometric and isokinetic muscle function. beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate and KIC may therefore provide limited benefit in the recovery of muscle function after EIMD in untrained subjects or after unaccustomed exercise...|$|R
