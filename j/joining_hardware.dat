40|$|What is Data Cabling? A {{structured}} cabling {{system is a}} type of network construction that is open and is used by different systems like data, access management, telephony, building automation, along with many other similar capabilities. It is an extremely flexible and economical set up. Usually, a cabling system such as this can be broken into six components: work space, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, gear space, telecommunication closet (room) and entrance ways. Common Network Set up Work space components are extended over into horizontal cabling networks via the telecommunications connector, reaching into the equipment in the targeted workspace. The components utilized in the work place usually include channel equipment (computers, information terminals, telephones, etc.), patch cables (modular cords, PC adapter wires, fiber patch cables, etc.) and communication sockets or outlets. Horizontal cabling setups are designed to extend to the telecommunications data outlet directly to the desired work area. The elements of horizontal cabling contain cable terminations, telecommunication outlets, cross-connections, cable from the patch panel into the work place, and cross-connects into different telecommunication rooms. Generally speaking, backbone cabling networks contain components such as spine wires (typically optical fiber cables), mechanical terminations, intermediate and main cross-connects, and patch cables that can be utilized for backbone-to-backbone cross-connections. Typically, equipment rooms within a building houses (stores) equipment in a type of network room. This usually includes main corr-connect, horizontal connects, or intermediate cross connects. A telecommunication room house any terminations of backbone and horizontal cables to <b>joining</b> <b>hardware</b> such as patch cords or jumpers. Entrance facilities typically have a telecommunications service entrance to the backbone and construction pathways different buildings. These areas contain the wires, network demarcation points, connecting safety devices, hardware and other equipment that connect to personal network cabling and your access provider. Why a Business Needs a Cabling Structure Without the right network installation and data infrastructure, a company {{would not be able to}} operate or compete in the marketplace. Today, most businesses operate using a data network system to help process transactions, store and handle sensitive information, conduct daily business operations, manage accounting and money, employee tracking and payroll, along with business email and hosting services...|$|E

40|$|In its {{simplest}} form {{diffusion bonding}} {{is accomplished by}} placing clean metal surfaces together under a sufficient load and heating. The natural interatomic attractive force between atoms transforms the interface into a natural grain boundary. Therefore, in principle, {{the properties of the}} bond area are identical to those of the parent metal. Other advantages of diffusion bonding over conventional methods of bonding include freedom from residual stresses, excessive deformation, foreign metals, or changed crystal structures. Stainless steels, nickel-base superalloys, and aluminum alloys have all been successfully <b>joined.</b> Complex <b>hardware,</b> including integrated flueric devices, jet engine servovalves, and porous woven structures have been fabricated.

We model interrupts as logical rather than physical events and accordingly provides guidelines to compose software components including interrupt-service-routines. As a benefit, classical indeterministic behaviors (due to the parallelism) {{in the software}} domain, such as preemption and nesting, can be constructed as early as raw hardware components are being integrated. In effect, while the interrupt mechanism itself is under rigorous stress, it is simultaneously driving the exercise of the entire SoC. This effect can be observed through software profiling at the hardware integration stage. Xiaoxi Xu and Cheng-Chew Li...|$|R

One of the main applications of DSRC is RTTT (Road Transport and Traffic Telematics), especially EFC (Electronic Fee Collection) on tolled roads, bridges or tunnels. Other vehicle-related applications had been envisaged, such as car parking or fuel refilling automatic payment. These applications were successfully developed, deployed and are in current use in Portugal. Especially for EFC, medium access control is of utmost importance. In this paper it is presented an implementation scheme for the MAC-layer of the RSE (road side equipment), suitable for low-cost microcontrollers, to operate between the two equipments (as in Figure 1), and also the MAC layer of the SPI connection, of the two Microcontrollers present within the RSE. The result is interface software that controls the referred communication, embracing hardware and software into a <b>join</b> solution.

40|$|As {{the need}} for {{achieving}} super high temperatures (2000 K and above) in solar heat receivers has developed so has {{the need for}} secondary concentrators. These concentrators refocus the already highly concentrated solar energy provided by a primary solar collector, thereby significantly reducing the light entrance aperture of the heat receiver and the resulting infrared radiation heat loss from the receiver cavity. Although {{a significant amount of}} research and development has been done on nonimaging hollow reflective concentrators, there has been no other research or development to date on solid, single crystal, refractive concentrators that can operate at temperatures above 2000 K. The NASA Lewis Research Center recently initiated the development of single-crystal, optically clear, refractive secondary concentrators that, combined with a flux extractor, offer a number of significant advantages over the more conventional, hollow, reflective concentrators at elevated temperatures. Such concentrators could potentially provide higher throughput (efficiency), require no special cooling device, block heat receiver material boiloff from the receiver cavity, provide for flux tailoring in the cavity via the extractor, and potentially reduce infrared heat loss via an infrared block coating. The many technical challenges of designing and fabricating high-temperature refractive secondary concentrators and flux extractors include identifying optical materials that can survive the environment (high-temperature, vacuum and/or hydrogen atmosphere), developing coatings for enhanced optical and thermal performance, and developing crystal <b>joining</b> techniques and <b>hardware</b> that can survive launch loads...|$|R
