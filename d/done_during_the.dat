Extensive restoration reports became the norm, including plans, results of surveys, historical sources, and {{documentation of the}} work <b>done.</b> <b>During</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, about 70–75% of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased even during the war.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 {{and the ensuing}} outbreak of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral, as they had <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> First World War 25 years earlier. To ensure this neutrality, the Dutch army was mobilised from 24 August and entrenched. Large sums (almost 900 million guilders) were spent on defence. It proved very difficult to obtain new matériel in wartime, however, especially as the Dutch had ordered some of their new equipment from Germany, which deliberately delayed deliveries. Moreover, a considerable part of the funds were intended for the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), much of it related to a plan to build three battlecruisers.|$|E

5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually <b>done.</b> <b>During</b> <b>the</b> war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

5|$|The British {{took over}} the Maltese islands as a {{protectorate}} in 1800, and later as a colony in 1813. They initially used the Hospitaller fortifications without any alterations. Under the military theory of the time, the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion, {{and in fact the}} British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, wanted to demolish the majority of Valletta's fortifications in 1801, although this was never <b>done.</b> <b>During</b> <b>the</b> British period, the various forts of the Order were rearmed, refitted and altered a number of times {{to keep up with the}} latest military technology.|$|E

5|$|Further {{significant}} developments did {{not come}} until the Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the cerebellum briefly, and the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664. More anatomical work was <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, {{but it was not}} until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that damage to the cerebellum results in motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the cerebellum relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|In 1717, Baclayon was {{elevated}} as a parish. The present stone church constructed {{under the}} Jesuits was finished in 1727. When the Jesuits were expelled {{in the country}} in 1768, the Augustinian Recollects immediately succeeded them in the late part of the same year in administering the spiritual needs of the people of Baclayon. Renovations on the church was <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> administration of Father Pedro de la Encarnación, OAR (1839–1854), Father Antonio Úbeda, OAR (1856–1859, 1861–1868) and Father José María Cabañas, OAR (1870–1898). The church was saved from destruction that might be brought by American soldiers in exchange for food and water in 1901. During the Second World War, the church suffered damages but was later restored. From being part of Baclayon, Balilihan, Alburquerque, Corella and Sikatuna became independent parishes in 1829, 1869, 1884 and 1914 respectively. Although it survived damages and was eventually restored, the church of Baclayon was heavily damaged when an earthquake struck Bohol on October 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E

5|$|The Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–92 was {{the second}} civil {{conflict}} between Jogaila, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his cousin Vytautas. At issue was control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Jogaila had been crowned King of Poland in 1386; he installed his brother Skirgaila as ruler of Lithuania. Skirgaila proved unpopular and Vytautas attempted to depose him. When his first attempt to take {{the capital city of}} Vilnius failed, Vytautas forged an alliance with the Teutonic Knights, their common enemy – just as both cousins had <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384. Vytautas and the Knights unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius in 1390. Over the next two years it became clear that neither side could achieve a quick victory, and Jogaila proposed a compromise: Vytautas would become Grand Duke and Jogaila would remain Superior Duke. This proposal was formalized in the Ostrów Agreement of 1392, and Vytautas turned against the Knights. He went on to reign as Grand Duke of Lithuania for 38 years, and the cousins remained at peace.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was rice, the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. Rice cultivation began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> rainy seasons. Rice was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton was grown extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet was grown as a substitute for rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly rice, were exported.|$|E
5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in its quick collapse. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged {{in the wake}} of Diệm's deposal, due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diệm. The incidence of Việt Cộng attacks continued to increase as it had <b>done</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Aside from battlefield setbacks, something that was outside his remit, Thơ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the various anti-Minh coup plots at the time was to remove Thơ, and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target; at that time, the MRC was moving toward removing Thơ, and Minh was the only senior general to retain confidence in him.|$|E
