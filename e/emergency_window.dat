2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{system for}} the USAF's H-3E helicopters is described as standard to the HH-3E, and capable of being fitted as required to the CH-3E. [...] The basic system comprises three M60 machine guns, one each at the forward door, the opposite <b>emergency</b> <b>window,</b> and the rear loading ramp. The forward two positions comprise pintle mounts on skate rails, while the rear loading ramp station comprises a pedestal mount on an armored floor plate. The floor plate slides on two tracks, forward and back, to and from its firing position {{at the edge of}} the ramp. Either the standard infantry M60 can be used, with standard 200-round ammunition boxes attached, or the M60D variant, feeding via flexible ammunition chutes from 750-round boxes fixed to the floor (or to the armored floor plate for the rear loading ramp position).|$|E
2500|$|At 19:20, Cameron and Ouimet made an {{extremely}} difficult emergency landing at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, located in Boone County, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. During the evacuation, the overwing aircraft doors were opened, causing {{an influx of}} air that fuelled the fire. Ouimet escaped through the co-pilot's <b>emergency</b> <b>window</b> shortly after the plane landed, but Cameron, who had expended {{a great deal of}} physical energy while trying to keep the plane under control, was unable to move due to exhaustion. Firefighters doused Cameron in firefighting foam through Ouimet's window, shocking him back to consciousness; Cameron was then able to open the pilot's emergency escape window and drop to the ground, where he was dragged to safety by Ouimet. Cameron was the last person to make it out of the plane alive. Less than 90 seconds after touchdown, the interior of the plane flashed over and ignited, killing 23 of the 41 passengers. The passengers trapped inside the plane died from smoke inhalation and burns from the flash fire. Dianne Fadley, a survivor, said that [...] "it was almost like anybody who got out had nothing wrong"; of the eighteen surviving passengers, three received serious injuries, thirteen received minor injuries, and two were uninjured, while none of the five crew members sustained any injuries. [...] "You made it and you were completely fine," [...] Fadley concluded, [...] "or you didn't make it." ...|$|E

50|$|An <b>emergency</b> exit <b>window</b> is {{a window}} big enough and low enough so that {{occupants}} can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a fire. In many countries, exact specifications for <b>emergency</b> <b>windows</b> in bedrooms are given in many building codes. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as buses and aircraft, frequently have <b>emergency</b> exit <b>windows</b> as well.|$|R

50|$|This line uses Overhead Lines, {{therefore}} {{overhead line}} gearboxes are installed. During peak hours, SBS Transit staff may be deployed on the trains, hence passengers can only view the tracks through the <b>emergency</b> exit <b>window.</b> The difference between C751A and C751C {{is that there}} is no LCD Displays. Compared to the C751A trains, the interior roof is coloured white instead of beige-orange.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} obvious school bus yellow color scheme and warning lights, Phantom school buses were {{distinguished}} from the standard Phantom by several exterior design features. As it was the maximum approved width at {{the time for the}} type, all Phantom school buses were constructed with the 96-inch wide body. Additionally, they were equipped with dual vertical windshields, a rear (<b>emergency</b> exit) <b>window,</b> left-side <b>emergency</b> exit door, and single curbside door.|$|R
50|$|The {{rolling stock}} of the Ampang Line {{currently}} consists of a fleet of 50 new trains, better known as AMY, that are deployed to increase {{the capacity of the}} line and provide a better service. Each of the new trains is six cars long and provided by CSR Zhuzhou of China, similar to on the design for İzmir Metro and Buenos Aires Underground 200 Series. These trains are disabled-friendly and include safety features like closed-circuit TV, <b>emergency</b> breakable <b>window,</b> <b>emergency</b> ventilation fan, fire and smoke detection system and supervised automatic train operation system (SATO), and other elements such as interactive destination display inside the train, non-slipping seats, LCD infotainment, walk-through gangways, and a more spacious wheelchair space for the physically challenged. The first trains for Sri Petaling Line were put into service starting from January 2015, followed by Ampang Line in December 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the cars}} were of open saloon design, with fixed and reversible seats - except in the first class carriage, where all seats were reversible. Doors were provided {{at the ends of}} the carriages; an unusual feature, though previously used on the original Liverpool-Southport trains, was that the doors were fitted inside an alcove, so that they opened within the width of the train. The exits were fitted with particularly convenient handrails.Although the Manchester Victoria to Bury line is less than 11 miles long, the trains had through corridor connections from end to end. Passengers were not provided with any means of stopping the train in an emergency, but could at least move into an adjacent carriage! Large <b>emergency</b> <b>windows</b> were provided, hinged at the top and opening outwards, a feature which the trains seem to have shared with the [...] "fireproof" [...] train developed by the LYR in 1914. There was no emergency lighting. The trains carried an oil lamp front and rear: the lamp at the front was in the centre when the train was carrying passengers and on the nearside of the buffer beam when it was working empty.|$|R
50|$|In Norway, {{the use of}} wrap {{advertising}} on buses was prohibited by the road authorities. The reason behind the ban was that in an <b>emergency</b> the <b>windows</b> might need {{to serve as an}} emergency exit, and that the advertising would make the window harder to break with the emergency hammer. Gaia Trafikk argued against the ban, pointing out that their tests showed that the thin wrap had no impact on the breakability of the window, but did remove the advertising which covered the windows.|$|R
50|$|As of mid-November 2008, it was {{estimated}} that the new loans, purchases, and liabilities of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and FDIC, brought on by the financial crisis, totalled over $5 trillion: $1 trillion in loans by the Fed to broker-dealers through the <b>emergency</b> discount <b>window,</b> $1.8 trillion in loans by the Fed through the Term Auction Facility, $700 billion to be raised by the Treasury for the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $200 billion insurance for the GSEs by the Treasury, and $1.5 trillion insurance for unsecured bank debt by FDIC.|$|R
5000|$|One {{innovation}} that Carpenter introduced {{during this period}} was a change {{to the design of}} its [...] "Crown RE", mounted on a Spartan Motors chassis. The Crown RE was the first rear-engine school bus to feature an option of a conventional rear emergency door instead of an <b>emergency</b> exit <b>window</b> typical on rear-engine school buses. To make this possible, the floor was slanted up in the last few rows in order to gain height over the engine compartment. Crown by Carpenter also produced a delivery truck loosely derived from its [...] "Cadet" [...] Type B school bus line.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>emergency</b> loan {{transfer}} <b>window</b> shut in Scotland, McLean signed with Forfar Athletic {{for the rest}} of the season. [...] He was released by St Johnstone at the end of the 2009/10 season and joined Forfar on a permanent basis. McLean retired from professional football in March 2011 after being accepted to become a police officer.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{international}} break Derby {{added to the}} squad, with the loan signing of Mansfield Town defender Tom Naylor and trials for defender Daniel Lafferty and forward Edwin Gyasi. The first game after the break, at home to Hull City, also saw the return to the squad of Shaun Barker, Paul Green and John Brayford., {{though it was not}} enough to prevent The Rams crash to their third straight defeat as the visitors ran out 2-0 winners. The result meant Derby had won just one of the last 9 fixtures, slumping from 2nd to 9th in the table, though Clough dismissed the poor form as [...] "not a concern". The game also saw top-scorer Theo Robinson go off with a hamstring injury in the first 15 minutes, an injury which saw the club begin to scour the loan market for a replacement striker ahead of the <b>emergency</b> loan <b>window's</b> closure the following Thursday.On the day that the <b>emergency</b> loan <b>window</b> closed, Ipswich Town's Tamás Priskin joined The Rams on a five-week deal, with youth team winger Aaron Cole going out on loan to Conference National side Stockport County on a similar deal. Priskin scored on his debut to give Derby the lead at West Ham United but The Rams eventually fell to a 3-1 defeat to slip to 15th in the table {{on the back of a}} fourth consecutive defeat. This was followed by a 1-0 defeat at home to Brighton and Hove Albion, which was a fifth straight defeat and meant that November yielded no points and just three goals.|$|R

40|$|Bus mass {{transport}} vehicles {{are designed to}} ferry passengers along routes in cities and between cities. Advancement of technology in the 21 st century has resulted in various designs of buses. Innovation in bus design has been centered on lightweight materials, formability and aesthetic appeal of the bus interior and exterior. Meanwhile the bus structure has not developed in terms of emergency exit tools to aid quick passenger egress {{in the case of}} emergency. This paper focuses on the design on a bus emergency exit tool. This tool will be applicable at designated <b>emergency</b> exit <b>windows.</b> The tool will assist passengers to escape the bus as soon as an accident occurs while emergency services have not yet arrived. The design will be modelled using SolidWorks software...|$|R
50|$|Only six of {{the twenty}} six people on board escaped from the helicopter; Lawlor exited through the <b>emergency</b> exit <b>window</b> by his seat, while Charleton and a child got out through the forward freight bay. Another child managed to escape via the rear freight bay, and two adults exited through the {{starboard}} airstairs door. In addition to the two pilots, the survivors were Howard Goddard (aged 12), Ellen Hounslow (15), Lucille Langley-Williams and Megan Smith. Hounslow spotted that Goddard was struggling in the water, and she swam to help him. None of the six had managed to retrieve a life jacket, and so the two pilots gathered the survivors together, and helped keep them afloat, using suitcases as flotation aids.|$|R
50|$|When fire first {{broke out}} {{immediately}} after the collision, bus driver John Pearman tried {{to put it out}} with a small fire extinguisher while passengers began to evacuate through the center rear emergency door, squeezing through the narrow opening between the two rear seats and jumping approximately 3 feet to the ground. The front door was blocked by collision damage, and there were no <b>emergency</b> exit <b>windows</b> or roof hatches, as found on commercial buses and some school buses of the time. Only one adult, a woman who was of small stature, managed to escape through a nine-inch opening side window. When she looked back up from the ground, the window opening was filled with flames. The other three adults aboard, including Pearman, died.|$|R
50|$|Another {{drawback}} of the up-armored HMMWVs {{occurs during}} {{an accident or}} attack, when the heavily armored doors tend to jam shut, trapping the troops inside. As a result, HMMWVs were fitted with hooks on their doors, so that another vehicle can rip the door off, freeing the troops inside. In addition, Vehicle <b>Emergency</b> Escape (VEE) <b>windows,</b> developed by BAE Systems, were fielded for use on the M1114 uparmored HMMWV, with 1,000 kits ordered.|$|R
500|$|Peterborough's Director of {{football}} Barry Fry criticised Nottingham Forest's owners for {{pulling out of}} the deal to sign Boyd, and chairman MacAnthony said, [...] "I'm devastated for George.

50|$|Initial {{management}} in hospital is by pericardiocentesis. This involves {{the insertion of}} a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach. A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary artery, in the 5th intercostal space. Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an <b>emergency</b> pericardial <b>window</b> may be performed instead, during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the patient, surgery is provided to seal {{the source of the}} bleed and mend the pericardium.|$|R

5|$|On 27 November 2014, O'Keefe {{eventually}} {{secured a}} loan {{move away from}} Palace {{on the final day}} of the <b>emergency</b> loan <b>window,</b> joining struggling Championship club Blackpool on loan until 1 January 2015, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Kevin Foley. He made his debut on 29 November 2014, starting in a 1–1 draw with Rotherham United, being replaced by Nathan Delfouneso after 56 minutes, and went on to make four appearances for the team before returning to Palace. On his return to Selhurst Park, O'Keefe found himself under a new manager for the fourth time since August 2014, following the appointment of Alan Pardew. Despite being handed a starting spot in Pardew's first match in charge at the club, a 4–0 win over non-League team Dover Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup on 4 January 2015, he was later informed that he was not part of the manager's new plans at the club.|$|R
