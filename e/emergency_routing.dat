40|$|Geographical Information System (GIS) {{is known}} for its {{capacity}} to spatially enhance the management of natural resources. While being often used as an analytical tool, it also represents a collaborative scientific platform to develop new algorithms. Thus, it is critical that GIS software as well as the algorithms are open and accessible to anybody [18]. We present how GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many scientists to implement and perform geoprocessing tasks. We will show how integrating scientific algorithms into GRASS GIS helps to preserve reproducibility of scientific results over time [15]. Moreover, subsequent improvements are tracked in the source code version control system and are immediately available to the public. GRASS GIS therefore acts as a repository of scientific peer-reviewed code, algorithm library, and knowledge hub for future generation of scientists. In the field of hydrology, with the various types of actual evapotranspiration (ET) models being developed in the last 20 years, it becomes necessary to inter-compare methods. Most of already published ETa models comparisons address few number of models, and small to medium areas [3, 6, 7, 22, 23]. With the large amount of remote sensing data covering the Earth, and the daily information available {{for the past ten years}} (i. e. Aqua/Terra-MODIS) for each pixel location, it becomes paramount to have a more complete comparison, in space and time. To address this new experimental requirement, a distributed computing framework was designed, and created [3, 4]. The design architecture was built from original satellite datasets to various levels of processing until reaching the requirement of various ETa models input dataset. Each input product is computed once and reused in all ETa models requiring such input. This permits standardization of inputs as much as possible to zero-in variations of models to the models internals/specificities. All of the ET models are available in the new GRASS GIS version 7 as imagery modules and replicability is complete for future research. A set of modules for multiscale analysis of landscape structure was added in 1992 by [1], who developed the r. le model similar to FRAGSTATS ([10]). The modules were gradually improved to become r. li in 2006. Further development continued, with a significant speed up [9] and new interactive user interface. The development of spatial interpolation module v. surf. rst started in 1988 [11] and continued by introduction of new interpolation methods and finally full integration into GRASS GIS version 4 [13]. Since then it was improved several times [8]. The module is an important part of GRASS GIS and is taught at geospatial modeling courses, for example at North Carolina State University [14]. GRASS GIS entails several modules that constitute the result of active research on natural hazard. The r. sim. water simulation model [12] for overland flow under rainfall excess conditions was integrated into the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Routing</b> Decision Planning system as a WPS [17]. It was also utilized by [16] and is now part of Tangible Landscape, a tangible GIS system, which also incorporated the r. damflood, a dam break inundation simulation [2].

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis {{research}} was on developing an assessment protocol which assists the structural engineer in visualizing the structural possibilities for multi-story industrial heritage constructed between 1910 and 1950. The protocol distinguishes seven assessment steps {{which can be used}} to (1) indicate the material and structural quality (2) visualize the structural design possibilities and (3) assess the structural safety. The systematic approach introduced by the protocol stimulates a faster and more efficient determination of the comprehensive capabilities of the concrete load bearing frame. The protocol is developed from the context of integrated designing, giving the structural engineer an independent role in the redevelopment process. The individual assessment steps [the historic assessment, the visual assessment, the technical assessment, evaluation, the preliminary assessment, the [refined] structural safety assessment and the strenghtening assessment] are provided with current knowledge and trends available for the assessment of existing reinforced concrete structures. These steps are subjected to constant change and development. The structural engineer is therefore encouraged to supplement the protocol with experience gained during projects, and with future developments. The engineer is recommended to follow the assessment steps as proposed by the protocol. In cases where this is not possible the engineer should use the protocol to formulate a targeted assessment strategy, which minimizes the influences of the obstructed process. The protocol will provide the information, but requires the motivation and capabilities of the engineer to come to the desired results. QUALITY The first four assessment steps are designed to assist the visualization of the structural and material quality. The steps are focussed in gathering a sufficient amount of information to prevent unexpected situations in the construction or execution phase. The engineer should be aware that in the design of new buildings the information produced on paper will be realized, whereas in the situation of redesigning existing buildings what is realized should be put on paper. The information that is needed to estimate the remaining life span and to perform the structural safety assessment can only be found insitu. In some situations also design information {{can be found in the}} original document, but the engineer should be aware that his information always brings a certain level of inaccuracy and uncertainty. The first assessment step is the historic assessment which helps the engineer to collect a sufficient amount of original documentation [architectural design, structural design, reinforcement design, foundation etc. ] to visualize the quality and characteristics of the load bearing system. The assessment step is substantiated by a historic database which informs the modern structural engineer about the material and structural characteristics of historic concrete. This concept is introduced to bridge the knowledge gap between past and present and eliminate possible risks occurring from this gap by visualizing the differences in material durability, and provide structural information to clarify the original documentation or when no original information is available to substantiate the making of assessment assumptions. The quality assessment of materials and structures is time consuming, expensive and difficult when performed into detail. The structural engineer is therefore challenged to formulate a targeted and efficient approach without compromising the desired information. To stimulate this process the protocol introduces at the end of the historic assessment a general strategy which helps to formulate the desired and required input and output regarding the visual and technical assessment. The visual assessment stimulates the engineer to visualize the structural and material quality in-situ, by proposing a visual inspection towards deterioration and the optical verification of the original drawings. The assessment V step also provides a description of the non-destructive measuring techniques which can either be used to verify certain forms of deterioration or to verify the test results found with the technical assessment. At the end of the visual assessment the engineer is granted the possibility to take concrete and steel samples for additional research to be performed in the laboratory to indicate, the mechanical properties, the cause of deterioration or to estimate future deterioration. The protocol provides an estimate of the required research pool, and the considerations which have to be taken into account when estimating the sample location. The technical assessment step provides the structural engineer with a general introduction on the different laboratory tests, and their specifications. The quality assessment is completed by introducing the evaluation step, which provides the structural engineer with the general methodology for reinforced concrete repair and protection. This methodology points out the importance for conservation, and a durable and compatible approach. The assessment step also provides a list with the general methods that can be used for repair and protection. DESIGN POSSIBILITIES The identification of the quality and the visualization of the structural design is the basic input of the preliminary assessment stage. This stage is focussed on generating structural redevelopment concepts based on a pragmatic approach, and from the context of integrated designing. This process stimulates the designer’s creativity in visualizing the structural possibilities with respect to functional change. The success of redevelopment seen from a structural perspective depends on the aspects of structural flexibility, the structural adaptability, the relation between building and user, and the standard redevelopment criteria [climate, day light entrance, <b>emergency</b> <b>routing</b> etc. ]. To stimulate the successful integration of these design aspects into the redevelopment, the engineer is advised to use a morphological overview. Such an overview gathers the different structural aspects and combines them with possible structural redevelopment alternatives. The overview facilitates the making of combinations, generating redevelopment concepts and to rerun the design steps in a later stadium of the process. As a last note, the preliminary assessment recommends the engineer to generate the structural concepts from the concept of durable and sustainable design. The sustainable perspective requires the engineer to design with an eye on the future, whereas a durable design minimizes the need for functional change in the future. STRUCTURAL SAFETY The safety assessment of existing structures is different than the safety assessment for new structures. The differences can be found in the required aspects of the limit state design, and the considerations towards the structural reliability, the fire safety and the capacity estimation. The [refined] structural safety assessment visualizes the options regarding these different subjects, and clarifies their influences. The assessment stage also gives a general introduction on the methodology influencing the in depth detailing of the calculations and their reflection onto the desired results. In some situations the functional requirements exceed the bearing capacity of the load bearing structure. In such a case strengthening could be an option to improve the chances on redevelopment. Therefore, as last assessments stage the strengthening assessment is introduced. This assessment step visualizes the methodology towards estimating the required strengthening in respect to the ultimate and serviceability limit state design, and gives a general introduction on the strengthening methods available on today’s market.

40|$|Abstract—Vehicle {{detection}} in {{wide area}} motion imagery (WAMI) {{is an important}} problem in computer science, which if solved, supports urban traffic management, <b>emergency</b> responder <b>routing,</b> and accident discovery. Due to large amount of camera motion, {{the small number of}} pixels on target objects, and the low frame rate of the WAMI data, vehicle detection is much more challenging than the task in traditional video imagery. Since the object in wide area imagery covers a few pixels, feature information of shape, texture, and appearance information are limited for vehicle detection and classification performance. Histogram of Gradients (HOG) and Haar descriptors have been used in human and face detection successfully, only using the intensity of an image, and HOG and Haar descriptors have different advantages. In this paper, we propose a classification scheme which combines HOG and Haar descriptors by using Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning (GMKL) that can learn the trade-off between HOG and Haar descriptors by constructing an optimal kernel with many base kernels. Due to the large number of Haar features, we first use a cascade of boosting classifier which is a variant of Gentle AdaBoost and has the ability to do feature selection to select a small number of features from a huge feature set. Then, we combine the HOG descriptors and the selected Haar features and use GMKL to train the final classifier. In our experiments, we evaluate the performance of HOG+Haar with GMKL, HOG with GMKL, Haar with GMKL, and also the cascaded boosting classifier on Columbus Large Image Format (CLIF) dataset. Experimental results show that the fusion of the HOG+Haar with GMKL outperforms the other three classification schemes. I...|$|R
