5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean's {{birth in}} 1975, Lennon took a hiatus {{from the music}} {{industry}} and became a househusband to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Blyth A won a {{place in}} the Guinness Book of Records by setting the world record for total running <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plant of its size, when all four {{generating}} units achieved 200,000running hours. With the privatisation of the UK's electricity supply industry in 1990, the station passed into the ownership of National Power. In 1991, the two 275MW units at Blyth B (units 5 & 6) were decommissioned on the grounds of economy, despite the station having been modernised in the early 1980s. This decommissioning resulted in 260 job losses.|$|E

5|$|Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared {{from the}} body by tubular {{secretion}} and excreted unchanged in the urine; metformin is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single-dose study of nondiabetics).|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate {{for a period of time}} before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> day, in stereophonic sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1985, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. He relinquished presidential {{power to the}} Vice President for eight <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment, which he specifically avoided invoking. The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful. Reagan resumed {{the powers of the}} presidency later that day. In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose. In October, more skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.|$|E

5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at {{the upper end of the}} range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.|$|E

One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E

5|$|With Canadian {{industry}} reorganized {{to supply}} the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S. Western Prince in December 1940. This was an intensely dangerous trip; Germany was attempting to blockade Britain {{and there were many}} German submarines in the North Atlantic. One of those submarines sank the Western Prince on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship. Howe professed coolness in the incident, but later told the Manchester Guardian that he considered every hour that he lived from that day onwards to be borrowed time.|$|E
5|$|Doris {{travelled}} to Egypt {{to visit}} her husband in March 1917. By June, Rupert was becoming increasingly immersed in preparations for the Third Battle of Gaza and Doris, who had become pregnant during her visit, decided to return home. On her return journey to Australia in June 1917, her ship, the P liner Mongolia struck a mine and was sunk in the Indian Ocean {{with the loss of}} 23 lives. Doris spent 11 <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crowded lifeboat, before being rescued by a passing steamer, which took her to Bombay. From there she eventually made her way back to Australia via Singapore and Batavia. In 1918 Doris was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her volunteer work among soldiers' families as secretary of the Friendly Union of Soldiers' Wives and Mothers.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E

5|$|After the 2000 World Cup, Taylor {{wanted to}} focus on her desire {{to become one of}} the best batsmen in the world. In order to achieve this, she decided to become a {{full-time}} cricketer. After university, she had joined Procter & Gamble, and by 2001 she was earning £38,000 as an IT assistant manager at the company. In contrast, her income from cricket totalled £7,000, and in order to afford to quit her IT job, she had to move back in with her parents. England's next series was against the World Cup runners-up, Australia, who toured in June and July 2001. England's batting remained unreliable, and Australia won all five matches between the sides: two Test matches and three ODIs. Taylor was praised as the only highlight of the English batting; her innings of 50 not out was the highest score by her side in any of the ODIs. In the second Test, she significantly improved on her previous best Test score of 18 runs, batting for over four <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gritty performance to reach 137 runs. Taylor missed the tour of India in January 2002 after injuring her knee in a training session, but returned the following summer with a string of good performances in the Super Fours—a competition in which the England selectors place the 48 leading players into four teams—trailing only her England team mate Charlotte Edwards as the leading run-scorer. In the four ODIs that season, against New Zealand and India, Taylor failed to make an impact, scoring just 43 runs in total.|$|E
