I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved."

5000|$|Jamie Anne Allman (Terry Marek) {{spoke about}} the {{seasonal}} transition and her view on doing guest appearances and being a regular character: [...] "This season, they've written me some very interesting, unique things that I didn't get to dabble with last year. So, every scene is different and I just take each scene individually. Then when I watch it as a whole I'm like, 'Oh, it was one piece.' I take each scene, look at it, break it down and it's a new experience every time, with every scene. But being with the characters the whole time, {{for a long period}} of time really allows you to sink your teeth into something more than if you're just doing a guest star. If you're doing a guest star spot, you come in at the heightened part of your character who's having a breakdown or is having a real moment, and in a show where you're the same character the whole time it's a progression. You have to let it build." [...] She was shocked to learn that her character was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When she gave me the news, I was upset, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>crying.</b> I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>crying</b> and started feeling bad for Terry.

We were so happy, Ness (Vanessa White) and <b>I</b> even <b>started</b> <b>crying!</b> We all ran out of the office after and had a group hug (yes, my idea, you know I like to cheese things up, haha).

5000|$|On winning Gold at the World Championships, Mitchell stated, [...] "I {{had to look}} at {{the score}} again...I think <b>I</b> nearly <b>started</b> <b>crying.</b> It didn't feel like my routine was so good but {{obviously}} it was...

She added: [...] "I wanted to prove on the floor that I belonged in the top three...I wanted to prove to the judges that Australia is up there with the world...I know I had a few landing errors...But my leaps and jumps were pretty good. I'd never done a triple pivot in a floor routine before, so that was a first...I thought I'd come fourth again...I had to look twice at the scoreboard. I thought it was a 14.6. Then when I realised it was a 14.8, and I knew that the Russian had got a 14.7, I had to think. Is an eight more than a seven? I was in shock". Western Australian Institute of Sport gymnastics program manager, Liz Chetkovich, believed failing to win Gold in the floor exercise at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and to take Lori Strong's Commonwealth record in terms of medals won was the motivational force behind Mitchell's World Championships success, stating: [...] "For her, not having the icing on the cake was a very good thing...It was a real motivator for her, and fortunately it helped her put her technique together when it really counted. In the end, it was a stunning victory".|$|R

These {{characters}} are very real to me, and their deaths are upsetting even to me. I plotted this issue out during a plane ride a few months ago.

As I was writing some of the moments from this issue, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>crying.</b> I found myself glancing around, wiping my eyes, hoping no one would notice. I’ve been living with this death for months now…and I don’t like it. I {{had plenty of time to}} change my mind. I had plenty of time to just not do it. I am in control of this story after all. But honestly, sometimes it feels like I’m not. This was one of those times. I don’t like this. I don’t want this. I want Andrea to live. I want to write more stories with her. I want to see her and Rick grow old together, watching Carl grow up and have kids of his own. I want that kind of happiness for these characters. And yet, here we are. Andrea is dead and the story moves on. I don’t know why this had to happen…but I know it did. I know this is another important turning point in the life of this series. I know Andrea’s death will mean something, that will resonate in the stories moving forward for years to come. But I still don’t like it. It still upsets me.
