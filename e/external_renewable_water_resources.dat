40|$|Changes {{in water}} {{resources}} availability {{can be expected}} as consequences of climate change, population growth, economic development and environmental considerations. A two-stage modeling approach is used to explore {{the impact of these}} changes in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. An advanced physical based distributed hydrological model is applied to determine the internal and <b>external</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> for the current situation and under future changes. Subsequently, a water allocation model is used to combine the renewable water resources with sectorial water demands. Results show that total demand in the region will increase to 132 km 3 yr&minus; 1 in 2050, while total water shortage will grow to 199 km 3 yr&minus; 1 in 2050 for the average climate change projection; an increase of 157 km 3 . This increase in shortage is the combined impact of an increase in water demand by 50 % with a decrease in water supply by 12 %. Uncertainty based on the output of the nine GCMs applied, reveals that expected water shortage ranges from 85 km 3 to 283 km 3 in 2050. The analysis shows that 22 % of the water shortage can be attributed to climate change and 78 % to changes in socio-economic factors...|$|E

We then conduct a <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> system simulation based on estimates of future water needs, regional reservoir effective capacity and <b>renewable</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> volume. This paper uses three <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> assessment indicators: the annual water utilization ratio indicator, the water shortage indicator and the extreme event occurrence indicator. Through fuzzy comprehensive assessment, we divide the evaluation set into five levels: very good (L 1), good (L 2), fair (L 3), poor (L 4) and very poor (L 5).

40|$|Increasing {{population}} and socio-economic development have put great pressure on <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> of the Yellow River (YR) basin. The anticipated climate and socio-economic changes may further increase water stress. Many studies {{have investigated the}} changes in <b>renewable</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> under various climate change scenarios, but few have considered the joint pressure from both climate change and socio-economic development. In this study, we assess water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways with emphasis {{on the impact of}} water scarcity on food production. The water demands in the 21 st century are estimated based on the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and <b>renewable</b> <b>water</b> supply is estimated using the climate projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)   8. 5 scenario. The assessment predicts that the <b>renewable</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> would decrease slightly then increase. The domestic and industrial water withdrawals are projected to increase in the next a few decades and then remain at the high level or decrease slightly during the 21 st century. The increase in water withdrawals will put the middle and lower reaches in a condition of severe water scarcity beginning in the next a few decades. If 40  % of the <b>renewable</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> were used to sustain ecosystems, a portion of irrigated land would have to be converted to rain-fed agriculture, which would lead to a 2 – 11  % reduction in food production.

This puts the region’s irrigated agriculture at risk and leads to saltwater intrusion in aquifers close to the seas (Chaudhuri and Srinivasulu 2014). Low water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture, therefore, exacerbates the water scarcity problem. According to FAO (2003), water use efficiency is about 40  %. Figures from the World Water Development Report (UNESCO-WWDR 2003) show that countries like Kuwait, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates are facing extreme situations of water scarcity (see Table  1).
