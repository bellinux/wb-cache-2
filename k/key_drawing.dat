50|$|Ten years later, Primus's plan to imprison Unicron's spark at {{the heart}} of the sun {{ultimately}} failed, leading the star to collapse, creating a black hole which threatened the existence of Cybertron, and the rest of the universe. Escaping his confinement within the sun, Megatron (now known as Master Megatron in Japan) enhanced his powers by merging his body with the remnants of Unicron's shattered form, increasing his power with the dark god's own. Guided through a spatial warp by the mysterious Soundwave to Gigantion, the Giant Planet, home of the final key, Megatron engaged the world's leader, Metroplex, in battle. Much to his surprise, however, he was utterly defeated in seconds, and Nemesis Breaker was destroyed. Consumed with rage, the power of Unicron within his armor reached out and detected the energies of the Giant Planet's Cyber Planet <b>Key,</b> <b>drawing</b> upon them and infusing Megatron's body with them. Attacking the Autobots in a dark, shadowed form, he decimated most of their forces before being confronted by Optimus Prime and completing his transformation - once again, Megatron had become Galvatron (Master Galvatron in Japan).|$|E
40|$|Background: Since {{psychological}} tests such as questionnaire or drawing {{tests are}} almost qualitative, their results carry {{a degree of}} uncertainty and sometimes subjectivity. The deficiency of all drawing tests is that the assessment is carried out after drawing the objects and lots of information such as pen angle, speed, curvature and pressure are missed through the test. In other words, the psychologists cannot assess their patients while running the tests. One of the famous drawing tests to measure the degree of Obsession Compulsion Disorder (OCD) is the Bender Gestalt, though its reliability is not promising. Objective: The main objective {{of this study is}} to make the Bender Gestalt test quantitative; therefore, an optical pen along with a digital tablet is utilized to preserve the <b>key</b> <b>drawing</b> features of OCD patients during the test. Materials and Methods: Among a large population of patients who referred to a special clinic of OCD, 50 under therapy subjects voluntarily took part in this study. In contrast, 50 subjects with no sign of OCD performed the test as a control group. This test contains 9 shapes and the participants were not constraint to draw the shapes in a certain interval of time; consequently, to classify the stream of feature vectors (samples through drawing) Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is employed and its flexibility increased by incorporating the fuzzy technique into its learning scheme. Results: Applying fuzzy HMM classifier to the data stream of subjects could classify two groups up to 95. 2...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} linearizable, {{non-blocking}} k-ary search tree (k-ST) that supports fast searches and range queries. Our algorithm uses single-word compare-and-swap (CAS) operations, and tolerates {{any number of}} crash failures. Performance experiments show that, for workloads containing small range queries, our k-ST significantly outperforms other algorithms which support these operations, and rivals {{the performance of a}} leading concurrent skip-list, which provides range queries that cannot always be linearized. 1 Introduction and Related Work The ordered set abstract data type (ADT) represents a set of <b>keys</b> <b>drawn</b> from an ordered universe, and supports three operations: Insert(key), Delete(key), and Find(key).

40|$|A {{number of}} concurrent, relaxed {{priority}} queues {{have recently been}} proposed and implemented. Results are commonly reported for a throughput benchmark that uses a uniform distribution of <b>keys</b> <b>drawn</b> from a large integer range, and mostly for single systems. We have conducted more extensive benchmarking of three recent, relaxed priority queues on four different types of systems with different key ranges and distributions. While we can show superior throughput and scalability for our own k-LSM priority queue for the uniform key distribution, the picture changes drastically for other distributions, both with respect to achieved throughput and relative merit of the priority queues. The throughput benchmark alone is thus not sufficient to characterize the performance of concurrent priority queues. Our benchmark code and k-LSM priority queue are publicly available to foster future comparison...|$|R
30|$|A uniform {{framework}} for random key {{management in the}} distributed peer-to-peer WSNs with heterogeneous sensor nodes is proposed in [12]. Indeed, similar to [31], the deployment of some heterogeneous sensor nodes (called high-class nodes) amongst the low-class sensor nodes has been studied. In this heterogeneous WSN, the connectivity between a low-class node and a high-class node {{is more important than}} the connectivity between two low-class sensor nodes. In [31], a hybrid security mechanism is proposed that can work with or without the presence of KDC. Here, all the sensor nodes are preloaded with a random set of <b>keys</b> <b>drawn</b> from a pool before deployment. Whenever KDC is available, each gateway shares a public and private key combination with KDC. The authors evaluate connectivity, reliability, and resiliency of their scheme, but the memory requirement may not be scalable in certain situations.|$|R

We show that there is a randomized scheme with error ffl that stores O(n ffl 2 log m) bits and answers queries using a single bitprobe. It is based on a family of sets with small intersections. If the error is required to be restricted to queries not in S, then we have a scheme that stores O((n ffl) 2 log m) bits, answers queries with one bitprobe and works with probability of error less than ffl. We also show that better schemes with one-sided error can be obtained if more probes are allowed.
