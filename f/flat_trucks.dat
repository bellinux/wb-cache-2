25|$|At this time, the trams {{are still}} divided into classes based on race. The first class {{carriage}} {{is for the}} Europeans. The much humbler second and third class carriage are for the Chinese and the Natives. The pikulan carriage is used for goods transportation, e.g. fish and vegetables, typical of Batavia. Of the passenger traffic, about 15 percent came from the first class carriage and 85 percent from {{the second and third}} class carriage. In 1937, the BVM owned 42 large motor cars, 39 small motor cars, 23 <b>flat</b> <b>trucks,</b> and 52 trailers.|$|E
50|$|Two {{passenger}} coaches are in service, and assorted maintenance vehicles including a tank wagon, four <b>flat</b> <b>trucks,</b> and four tipper wagons.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{started at}} a site in Millbay where Smeaton built a jetty and workyard in the south west corner of the harbour for {{unloading}} and working the stone. Timber rails of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge were laid for the four-wheeled <b>flat</b> <b>trucks</b> on which the masonry was moved around the site. A ten-ton ship, named the Eddystone Boat, was based here and took the worked stones out to the reef. The lighthouse was 72 ft high and had a diameter {{at the base of}} 26 ft and at the top of 17 ft.|$|E

5000|$|Parallel to {{and south}} of the current Platform 1, the 'Windsor Bay', were two {{additional}} sidings and a platform-level loading bank. These were latterly used for loading tanks, from the Royal Alexandra Barracks in Windsor, on to <b>flat</b> <b>trucks</b> (e.g., 'Rectank' and 'Warwell' wagons) for onward transport by rail. The sidings were removed in the 1980s and replaced by an access road, at track level, under the Stoke Road Bridge to the West Car Park - built on part of the engine shed site. One siding was the same length as the Windsor Bay line, and (...) its buffers are still in situ, even though the line itself has long since gone.|$|E
50|$|Another {{successful}} {{product line}} were the battery-electric factory <b>flat</b> <b>trucks,</b> small vehicles designed for transporting goods inside factories, where the exhaust fumes {{of an internal}} combustion engine could not be tolerated. The truck consisted of a flat load bed, with a battery box and wheels underneath. One set of wheels was driven, and the other steered, with the motor positioned between them. The prop-shaft went {{down the middle of}} the two battery boxes to the driven wheels. At the steered end was a driver's platform, with a steering tiller (like a narrowboat) and controller, with foot pedal operating brake and on/off switch. A 3/4 ton example can be found on the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Railway.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Society {{recommended}} Smeaton for the task, and he modelled {{the lighthouse}} on an oak tree. He rediscovered {{the use of}} hydraulic lime, a form of concrete used in Roman times. The technique allowed concrete to set under water, as Smeaton put granite blocks together using dovetail joints and marble dowels.Construction started in 1756 at a site in Millbay, where Smeaton built a jetty and a workyard in the south-western corner of the harbour to unload and work on stones. Timber rails of 3 ft 6 in (107 cm) gauge were laid for four-wheeled <b>flat</b> <b>trucks,</b> which were used to move masonry around the site. A 10-ton ship named the Eddystone Boat was based here, and transported worked stones out to the reef. The ship carried the 2¼-ton foundation stone {{out in the morning}} of 12 June 1756.|$|E

50|$|Railways also employ <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> in {{engineering}} trains and freight trains. In Britain and the Commonwealth the term bogie flat is often {{applied to a}} bogie <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck.</b> Although less common, <b>flatbed</b> railway <b>trucks</b> on rigid frames and axles are sometimes used, with both 4-wheel and 6-wheel versions being extant. In British English, the term 'truck' most commonly relates to railway vehicles, with the word 'lorry' more commonly applied to road vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|The Engineers Department {{had many}} {{different}} wagons for their specialised needs {{such as the}} ballast wagons which were all given diagram numbers in the P series. Most of these were small iron open wagons varying from 8 to 20 tons capacity, but some had specialised discharge systems - P6, P7 and P22 were hoppers, {{and a number of}} side-tipping wagons were also bought in 1930 but never allocated a diagram number. [...] Rail wagons ('') were mixed in with revenue earning bogie bolsters in the J diagrams, but open wagons for new sleepers had their own T diagram series, which also included special well wagons to carry sleepers with their rail chairs fixed to them (T1, T12 and T13).The operating department had a requirement for wagons to carry gas for carriage lighting. These were given the telegraphic code 'Cordon' and came in two distinct styles, with two long tanks {{along the length of the}} wagon (diagram DD5) or nine short tanks stacked across the wagon (DD4). [...] There were also match or 'shunting' trucks to connect broad and standard gauge wagons until the broad gauge was abandoned in 1892, or to run with overhanging or dangerous loads. [...] These were originally just ordinary <b>flat</b> <b>trucks</b> run without a load, but in later years a number of old wagons were kept for this purpose and given diagrams L21 to L23. Cranes also had match trucks of various styles in diagrams L1 to L20. [...] Shunters trucks were another kind of flat wagon and could be found in diagrams M1 to M5. These had full length footboards and handrails for shunters who rode on them during movements around stations and depots; they carried a distinctive asymmetrical toolbox and usually had their depot name painted on this.|$|E
