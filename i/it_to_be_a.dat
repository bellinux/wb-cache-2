5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Devonian fish {{rather than a}} Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of}} the Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

5|$|After {{screening}} at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 {{was released}} direct-to-video in the United States on January 8, 2008; {{it was later}} released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada {{was too old to}} be retained, so they {{assigned}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E

Half of the engineers' boats were too far west to be used (43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation process. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E

5|$|Chinese paleontologists {{discovered}} a partial skull and {{skeleton of a}} small theropod (IVPP V4878) in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China in the mid-1960s. In 1977, Dong Zhiming described this specimen, which was recovered from the Subashi Formation in Shanshan County, as a new genus and species, Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis. Gregory Paul recognized Shanshanosaurus as a tyrannosaurid in 1988, referring it to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Dong and Currie later re-examined the specimen and deemed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> juvenile of a larger species of tyrannosaurid. These authors refrained from assigning it to any particular genus but suggested Tarbosaurus as a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed {{the presence of}} a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta. Based on two parts of a skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History, G. latidens is also known from bonebed material. Horner, who described the specimens, considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> less derived species.|$|E

Homer is dismayed {{to find out}} that it is {{actually}} a musical, and expresses his distaste for such films. Marge is baffled by this, saying that he ironically loves singing. The family starts delivering their dialogue in song form, and Marge decides to prove that Homer loves to sing by showing family videos. Several clips are shown of various songs from past episodes, but Homer is not convinced. At this moment, Snake breaks into their house and holds them hostage. However once he hears them singing, Snake decides that they would not make good hostages and leaves.|$|E

5|$|Hotel Chevalier is an American-French {{short film}} written and {{directed}} by Wes Anderson and released in 2007. Starring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a prologue to Anderson's 2007 feature The Darjeeling Limited. It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the Venice Film Festival première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at Apple Stores in four U.S. cities.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, The Orcadian {{newspaper}} {{reported that a}} strange creature had been seen {{off the coast of}} Shapinsay. It was reportedly the size of a horse, with a spotted body covered in scales.

5|$|In 1972, Vincent Demoulin {{described}} the species Lycoperdon americanum {{on the basis}} of a specimen found in North Carolina. Although he believed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> unique species, several authors consider it synonymous with L.echinatum. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes coding for the internal transcribed spacer units suggests that Lycoperdon echinatum forms a clade with the puffball genus Handkea, separate from the type species of Lycoperdon, Lycoperdon perlatum. In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, L.echinatum formed a clade with L.mammiforme, L.foetidum, and Bovistella radicata (now known as Lycoperdon radicatum), but separate from L.pyriforme.|$|E

5|$|In 1994 the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the original 45-minute play into a full-length production. Blackrock retained the original four characters but also added nine others. It also extended {{the length of the}} play, and was considered to be a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder, though many viewers still considered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factual account of the crime. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience outside of a specifically educational environment, also shifting the plays focus. While A Property of the Clan focused on the possible motives for rape, Blackrock was said to focus on the boys involved in the crime, portraying them as victims of the society they live in.|$|E

The film with an ensemble cast, was a two-part crime saga centred on the coal mafia of Dhanbad with the story spanning from the early 1940s to 2009. The first part was released on 22 June, and the second on 8 August 2012, both receiving appreciation from Indian and international critics alike.

5|$|In August 1990, an insurrection {{took place}} in Croatia centred in {{predominantly}} Serb-populated areas, including parts of Lika, {{near the city of}} Gospić, which also had a significant ethnic Serb population.
