2500|$|Computerized {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CCBT) {{has been}} described by NICE as a [...] "generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> response system", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. In this context, {{it is important not to}} confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as e-Learning.|$|E

It allows employers in small markets to connect with voice actors in other regions, as well as connecting larger companies with voice actors. In 2011 Voices.com had revenues of $2,266,887, 97% of which came from exports. That year the company moved its headquarters from Western University's research park to a larger space in downtown London, Ontario. In 2014, the company launched its first non-English site, for Spanish speakers in Latin America. As part of the 2015 Canada Technology Accelerator, the company set up a temporary office in New York City for four months.|$|R

Literature, studies, and flight tests indicate that utilizing a <b>voice</b> <b>interactive</b> system for certain cockpit tasks can reduce this workload by decreasing {{the time required to}} perform the task. This being the case, the problem which remains is one of deciding which tasks to convert.

This second generation, intended both for high schools and conservatories has been commissioned by French Ministry of Education and French Ministry of Culture. Musique Lab 2 can be approached through three pedagogical strategies according to the teacher: an approach {{by way of the}} repertoire using simple annotation and synchronisation tools (ML-Annotation), an approach through interactive sound creation and production (ML-Audio) and an approach based on musical composition (ML-Maquette). 1.
