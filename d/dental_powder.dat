50|$|Sreekantan {{hails from}} a family of temple priests; he was born to Laxmi Devi and Badanaval Venkata Pandit on 30 June 1925, in the small hamlet of Nanjangud, located in the {{erstwhile}} Mysore state (present day Karnataka). He was the fifth of eight sons and three daughters born to the Pandit couple, whose Telugu speaking ancestors had migrated from Andhra Pradesh to Karnataka. B. V. Pandit, an Ayurvedic physician by profession and the formulator of Nanjagud Ayurvedic <b>Dental</b> <b>Powder,</b> was scholastically inclined and maintained a home library that helped Sreekantan develop a reading habit from an early age. Sreekantan attended the local high school in Nanjangud and completed his intermediate degree course at Mysore. He secured his graduate degree in physics, with honours, in 1946 and completed his master's degree the following year, specializing in Wireless communication, from Mysore University. He continued his studies as a research scholar at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, but moved to Mumbai in 1948 to the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) when Homi J. Bhabha invited him for advanced research on cosmic ray physics.|$|E
30|$|The HAp is {{well known}} as {{eco-friendly}} biomaterials and widely applied for industrial products, e.g., <b>dental</b> <b>powder,</b> bone-repairing or bone-replacing material. Since the HAp is water-insoluble material, it has a potential {{to be used as}} a fixative in wood preservative formulations. In the previous studies of wood-HAp combining, the HAp was used as fixatives of the antibacterial metal ions within woods [9], and it was also synthesized and fixed on the surface of modified bamboo with the phosphorylation methods [10]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the HAp contains a phosphoric component like some kinds of fireproof agents; therefore, by combining with the HAp, the treated woods would improve their fire retardance. So in this study, the combustion behavior of the HAp-wood composites was examined using a thermogravimetric analyzer, an oxygen index flammability tester and a corn calorimeter to evaluate the effects of the wood ash-based HAp agent on the fire-retarding properties of the HAp-wood composites.|$|E

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{proposes to}} {{investigate}} the feasibility of laser-assisted dental restoration {{and to develop a}} fundamental understanding of the interaction between laser beam and dental materials. Traditional dental restorations are produced by the porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) process, in which a dental restoration is cast from a metallic alloy and then coated with dental porcelains by multiple furnace-firing processes. PFM method is labor-intensive and hence very expensive. In order to fabricate dental restoration units faster and more cost-effectively, the Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technique has been employed in this study. In particular, a Multi-Material Laser Densification (MMLD) process has been investigated for its potential to fabricate artificial teeth automatically from 3 -D computer dental tooth files. ^ Based on the principle of SFF, the MMLD process utilizes a micro-extruder system to deliver commercial dental alloy and porcelain slurry in a computer-controlled pattern line by line and layer by layer. Instead of firing the artificial tooth/teeth in a furnace, the extruded dental materials are laser scanned to convert the loose powder to a fully dense body. Different laser densification parameters including the densification temperature, laser output power, laser beam size, line dimension, ratio of the beam size to line width, beam scanning rate, processing atmosphere and pressure, <b>dental</b> <b>powder</b> state (powder bed or slurry), powder particle size, etc. have been used to evaluate their effects on the microstructures and properties of the laser densified dental body, and hence to optimize MMLD conditions. Furthermore, laser-scanning induced phase transformations in dental porcelains have been studied because the transformations have great impact on coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of dental porcelains, which should match that of dental alloy substrate. Since a single dental material line delivered by the MMLD system functions as a “construction block” in the building of a dental restoration unit, the geometry changes of single and multiple porcelain lines before and after laser densification are studied to minimize porosity and improve surface quality. It is concluded that dental restoration by MMLD is achievable through proper MMLD conditions. ...|$|E

The manufacturing process of the specimens was by casting them into cylindrical molds of diameter 3 cm and 6 cm long. The properties of conductivity (k) and thermal diffusivity (α) and the specific heat per unit volume (ρc), were found using the KD 2 Pro® system which operates on the physical principle of linear transient heat flow. Thermal effusivity (ε) was determined using data from k and α, and the expression ε = k/√ α. The results show that as the percentage of the ceramic powder is increased, the density of the samples increases, and thus the thermal conductivity (k), which is directly proportional to both heat diffusion rate (α) and the amount of heat that the material can store or release (ρc). These results suggest a new material for technological applications, as well as they help to mitigate the environmental impact due to the recycling process of dental ceramic waste...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} inter-particle {{interactions}} on the slurry properties {{and the final}} surface roughness of the dental ceramic restoratives was investigated. A commercial <b>dental</b> ceramic <b>powder,</b> IPS Empress 2 veneer, {{was used as the}} raw material. The magnitudes of the particle-particle interactions were computed by the DLVO theory for the ceramic slurries of different electrolyte solutions (0. 1 M, 0. 25 M, 0. 5 M, 0. 75 M, 1 M NaCl and CaCl 2). As expected, the energies of particle-particle interactions were influenced significantly by the presence of electrolytes. These computations demonstrated that addition of electrolytes leads to a progressive depression of the repulsive double layer forces. The absence of these forces should inevitably lead to agglomeration caused by the ever-present van der Waals forces. The rheological measurements carried out using the slurries with same solution properties supported the findings of the DLVO computations. It was found that dental ceramic slurries showed a Newtonian behavior in the absence of electrolytes, which is indicative of little or no agglomeration in the slurry. On the other hand, the same slurries displayed a non-Newtonian, shear thinning behavior in the presence of electrolytes which can be attributed to agglomeration or gelation. Roughness of the ceramic surfaces produced from these slurries was studied by SEM analysis and profilometer measurements. Contact angle studies were also carried out on the same surfaces. It was observed that the surface became rougher initially with electrolyte addition to a maximum, most probably due to formation of isolated agglomerates due to a reduction of the repulsive double layer forces. After reaching a maximum, surface roughness decreased to a much lower value with further increase in electrolyte concentration. This was most probably caused by the formation of a relatively homogeneous, gel-like structure within the extensively agglomerated slurry due to a complete collapse of the double layer.

The more numerous cytoplasmic deposits were of a particulate nature with dimensions of approximately 1 microgram. The nuclear deposits, which appeared later but which were relatively more common in longer-term animals, took the form of prominent inclusions, 1 to 3 micrograms in diameter. The ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic deposits was higher in animals receiving high copper as compared with conventional amalgam. At electron microscopical level, the cytoplasmic deposits were seen to consist of collections of fine particles within lysosomes. Similar deposits were also found in far smaller numbers in lysosomes in collecting duct cells. The nuclear inclusions in proximal tubular cells were made up of closely packed electron dense granules. X-ray microanalysis showed both lysosomal and nuclear deposits to contain mercury and selenium. The association of mercury with selenium, which was present in the animals' diet at low levels, probably aided the microscopical visualisation of the deposits...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{established}} {{method of}} fissure-sealing using polymeric coating materials exhibits {{limitations on the}} long-term. Here, we present a novel technique {{with the potential to}} protect susceptible teeth against caries and erosion. We hypothesized that a tailored glass-ceramic material could be sprayed onto enamel-like substrates to create superior adhesion properties after sintering by a CO 2 laser beam. Methods A <b>powdered</b> <b>dental</b> glass-ceramic material from the system SiO 2 -Na 2 O-K 2 O-CaO-Al 2 O 3 -MgO was adjusted with individual properties suitable for a spray coating process. The material was characterized using X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF), heating microscopy, dilatometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), grain size analysis, biaxial flexural strength measurements, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gas pycnometry. Three different groups of samples (each n = 10) where prepared: Group A, powder pressed glass-ceramic coating material; Group B, sintered hydroxyapatite specimens; and Group C, enamel specimens (prepared from bovine teeth). Group B and C where spray coated with glass-ceramic powder. All specimens were heat treated using a CO 2 laser beam process. Cross-sections of the laser-sintered specimens were analyzed using laser scanning microscopy (LSM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and SEM. Results The developed glass-ceramic material (grain size d 50 = 13. 1 mm, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) = 13. 3 10 − 6 /K) could be spray coated on all tested substrates (mean thickness = 160 μm). FTIR analysis confirmed an absorption of the laser energy up to 95 %. The powdered glass-ceramic material was successfully densely sintered in all sample groups. The coating interface investigation by SEM and EDX proved atomic diffusion and adhesion of the glass-ceramic material to hydroxyapatite and to dental enamel. Significance A glass-ceramic material with suitable absorption properties was successfully sprayed and laser-sintered in thin films on hydroxyapatite as well as on bovine enamel. The presented novel technique of tooth coating with a dental glass-ceramic using a CO 2 -laser holds a great potential as a possible method to protect susceptible teeth against caries and erosion...|$|R
