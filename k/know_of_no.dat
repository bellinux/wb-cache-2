He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

As the crash was entirely a front-end collision, it did not explain {{the damage to the}} rear of her vehicle. A microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint chips that could have come only from a rear impact by another vehicle. Silkwood's family claimed to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> accidents of any kind that Silkwood had had with the car, and that the 1974 Honda Civic she was driving was new when purchased and no insurance claims were filed on that vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

Following the Second World War, it was {{available only in}} select archives. In 1992, the memorandum was published for first time with an introduction by University of Pennsylvania historian Arthur Waldron. Although it had been suppressed and largely disregarded {{at the time it}} was written, MacMurray's analysis was considered prescient by later generations of scholars and diplomats. George F. Kennan wrote of the 1935 memorandum: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> document on record in our government with respect to foreign policy which is more penetrating and thoughtful and prescient than this one." ...|$|E
500|$|Though she {{eventually}} gave {{up trying to}} convert her non-Catholic subjects to Roman Catholicism, Maria Theresa regarded both the Jews and Protestants as dangerous to the state and actively tried to suppress them. The empress was probably the most anti-Semitic monarch of her time, having inherited the traditional prejudices of her ancestors and acquired new ones. This was a product of deep religious devotion and was not kept secret in her time. In 1777, she wrote of the Jews: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> greater plague than this race, which on account of its deceit, usury and avarice is driving my subjects into beggary. Therefore as far as possible, the Jews are to be kept away and avoided." ...|$|E

500|$|Governor Hutchinson became {{concerned}} that the committees of correspondence were growing into an independence movement, so he convened the General Court in January 1773. Addressing the legislature, Hutchinson argued that denying the supremacy of Parliament, as some committees had done, came dangerously close to rebellion. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> line that can be drawn", he said, [...] "between the supreme authority of Parliament and the total independence of the colonies." [...] Adams and the House responded that the Massachusetts Charter did not establish Parliament's supremacy over the province, and so Parliament could not claim that authority now. Hutchinson soon {{realized that he had}} made a major blunder by initiating a public debate about independence and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The Boston Committee of Correspondence published its statement of colonial rights, along with Hutchinson's exchange with the Massachusetts House, in the widely distributed [...] "Boston Pamphlet".|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Congress had {{authorized}} branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, Dahlonega, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, {{to strike}} into American coin the gold being mined in or {{entering the country}} through the South. [...] Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel {{would have to be}} sent from Philadelphia. [...] New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, proposing [...] "to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed... I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one competent to this task, except our Melter & Refiner, Mr. Peale." [...] Woodbury agreed, informing Patterson, [...] "you are authorized to send Mr. Peak." ...|$|E

Almost immediately after his primary win, Bevin was asked about his support for McConnell, telling reporters, [...] "I literally <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> other elected official in this state who went to more events between May and November in support of candidates and support of Mitch McConnell and other down ticket races than I did. I knocked on doors, I made phone calls, I wrote checks myself, and I physically attended fundraiser after fundraiser."

500|$|In {{spite of}} Washington's pleas, Mason {{remained}} in Virginia, plagued by illness and heavily occupied, {{both on the}} Committee of Safety and elsewhere in defending the Fairfax County area. [...] Most of the legislation Mason introduced in the House of Delegates was war related, often aimed at raising the men or money needed by Congress for Washington's Continental Army. The new federal and state governments, short on cash, issued paper money. By 1777, the value of Virginia's paper money had dropped precipitously, and Mason developed a plan to redeem the notes with a tax on real estate. Due to illness, Mason was three weeks late in arriving at Richmond, to the frustration of Washington, who had faith in Mason's knowledge of financial affairs. The general wrote to Custis, [...] "It is much to be wished that a remedy {{could be applied to}} the depreciation of our Currency... I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> person better qualified to do this than Colonel Mason".|$|E
500|$|The White family built Killakee House on {{the estate}} {{in the early nineteenth}} century. This was a two-storey, thirty-six roomed stucco-faced house. It had a Tuscan-columned {{entrance}} and large three-windowed bows on the back and sides. Luke White's second son, Colonel Samuel White, inherited the estate on his father's death in 1824 and invested considerable effort in developing its gardens. In 1838, he engaged the services of Sir Ninian Niven, former director of the Botanic Gardens in Dublin. Niven laid out two Victorian formal gardens of gravel walks, terraces and exotic trees decorated with statues of Greek and Roman gods. Adjacent to the house was a terraced rose garden with a statue of Neptune. A second walled garden in a vale in the woods below the house contained more fountains and a range of glasshouses designed by Richard Turner. William Robinson, writing in The Gardener's Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette on 10 December 1864, said of the gardens, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> better example of the ...|$|E
500|$|Mason and Washington {{were friends}} {{for many years}} until they finally broke over their {{differences}} regarding the federal constitution. Peter R. Henriques, in his journal article on their relationship, suggested that Mason cultivated the friendship more than Washington did, as Mason sent many more letters and gifts, and stayed more often at Washington's plantation, though the last can be explained in part as Mount Vernon lay on the road from Gunston Hall to Alexandria. Henriques suggested that as Mason was older, intellectually superior, {{and the owner of}} a flourishing plantation as Washington struggled to establish Mount Vernon, {{it would not have been}} in the future president's character to be close to Mason. Washington had a deep respect for Mason's intellectual abilities, several times asking for his advice, and writing in 1777 when learning that Mason had taken charge of an issue before the General Assembly, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> person better qualified... than Colonel Mason, and shall be very happy to hear he has taken it in hand".|$|E
