30|$|This study mainly aims {{to conduct}} an inter-industry {{analysis}} through the subdivision of <b>the</b> various industries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FOF accounts. Using the expanded FOF tables, we examine the central bank’s monetary policy evaluations. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} by obtaining the NII of each industry, which are caused by any kind of monetary or financial policy, it is possible to link the I–O table and NII from <b>the</b> FOF accounts. <b>In</b> this study, we will adopt the I–O analysis method, which is applied to the FOF accounts devised by Tsujimura and Mizoshita (2002 a, b). Applying the I–O analysis method to the ALM derived from the FOF accounts, Y and Y* matrices (ALM of institutional sector-by-institutional sector) are obtained. Using the Leontief inverse matrix, four kinds of indices (power of dispersion <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liability-oriented <b>system,</b> power of dispersion <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asset-oriented <b>system,</b> sensitivity of dispersion <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liability-oriented <b>system,</b> and sensitivity of dispersion <b>index</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asset-oriented <b>system)</b> are estimated. Furthermore, by employing ALM, it is possible {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a monetary policy by applying <b>the</b> Leontief inverse. <b>In</b> summary, if <b>the</b> expanded FOF accounts, which are separated into various inter-industries, are obtained, (1) a financial transaction table of each inter-industry by inter-industry, which are deeply related to the I–O table, is created; (2) the power index and sensitivity index of each industry are computed; and (3) an analysis method connected to the I–O table and the FOF accounts can be applicable. To subdivide the nonfinancial corporation sector of the FOF accounts into different types of industries, we adopt the Financial Statement Analysis (FSA) data compiled by the Bank of Korea (BOK). Since the FSA data announce annual balance sheets and income statements for each industry, it is possible to create expanded FOF accounts whose institutional sectors are divided into about 100 types of industry. This study aims to (1) analyze various inter-industries from the viewpoint of the FOF accounts, (2) examine policy evaluation methods and suggest monetary market operations, and (3) derive a new analysis tool to link the I–O table and FOF accounts for future works.|$|R

40|$|Mie {{scattering}} {{theory is}} used to calculate radiation forces on a dielectric microsphere illuminated by evanescent waves, produced by laser light transmitted obliquely through a flat horizontal dielectric surface. The incident field is identified with the evanescent field, and both p and s polarizations are considered. Our investigation consists of three parts. First, after highlighting the basic formalism, we report results for the radiation force published in an earlier paper [J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 12, 2429 (1995) ], correcting a few trivial calculational errors. Second - the main objective of our paper - is to show how the vertical (lifting) force on microspheres, typically via a proper adjustment of the laser frequency, can be used to separate spheres differing by a slight amount <b>in</b> their refractive <b>index.</b> This is caused by an oscillatory behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> force with respect to the nondimensional wave number α <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding medium.
