500|$|By late 1985, Rangel {{was in a}} six-person race {{to become}} the next House Majority Whip, the third-highest ranked {{position}} in the House {{and for the first time}} up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker. By October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel the underdog coming close to Representative Tony Coelho from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance. However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 167–78. Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, later saying, “I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> goddamn naive. I came to Washington as an experienced politician. How did I miss Coelho’s contribution to members?” ...|$|E
500|$|Earlier that year, while {{accompanying}} Roosevelt on a [...] {{visit to}} Kansas, Burton told Roosevelt about his project {{to create a}} reproduction of Jerusalem {{at the time of}} Christ's birth for the St. Louis World's Fair. Roosevelt gave Burton a letter praising the exhibit, which Burton in turn published by facsimile in a magazine advertisement for the sale of stock in the exhibit. The White House received a letter from the magazine inquiring into the authenticity of the letter {{on the same day that}} Mulvane returned for a second meeting to press Smith's appointment. Roosevelt was enraged, demanded the return of the letter, and declared that [...] "from now on Burton would be considered politically a Democratic Senator, as far as patronage is concerned." [...] "The President's indignation knew no bounds. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> grossly and humiliatingly deceived during his incumbency in office." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many batsmen {{were given}} a {{thorough}} battering by Kortright and W. G. Grace was no exception. [...] In 1898, the batsman was approaching 50 years old and refused to speak to Kortright following a Gloucestershire vs Essex match. [...] This was the famous occasion on which Kortright, having uprooted two of the stumps after Grace had shamelessly intimidated the umpire out of giving several dismissals, said: [...] "Surely you're not going, Doc? There's still one stump standing". This witticism rather than the battering he received, {{may have been the}} main cause of Grace's ire. He claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> insulted.|$|E

As a result, migrants are no longer just ‘migrants’ but have become ‘transnationals’ maintaining links between their country of origin, their current country, and, not unusually, other countries where they have spent time...|$|R

2500|$|Melba {{sang the}} role of Nedda in Pagliacci at Covent Garden in 1893, soon after its Italian premiere. The {{composer}} was present, {{and said that the}} role <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> well played before. In December of that year, Melba sang at the Metropolitan Opera in New York for the first time. As at her Covent Garden debut, she appeared as Lucia di Lammermoor, and as at Covent Garden, it was less than a triumph. The New York Times praised her performance– [...] "one of the loveliest voices that ever issued from a human throat ... simply delicious in its fullness, richness and purity"– but the work was out of fashion, and the performances were poorly attended. Her performance in Roméo et Juliette, later in the season, was a triumph and established her as the leading prima donna of the time in succession to Adelina Patti. She had at first been nonplussed by the impenetrable snobbery at the Metropolitan; the author Peter Conrad has written, [...] "In London she hobnobbed with royalty; in New York she was a singing menial." [...] Assured of critical success, she set herself to achieve social recognition, and succeeded.|$|E

Unfortunately, most current photo browsers provide very limited support for effectively navigating image collections. This demonstration proposal describes PhotoCube, a personal image browser based on a multi-dimensional data model similar to the model used in OLAP applications. With PhotoCube, users can tag pictures, structure tags into various hierarchies, and browse images according to any possible perspective. We also describe three demonstration scenarios that show the power, flexibility and scalability of PhotoCube...|$|R
5000|$|Lack of {{political}} will and citizen involvement {{at the international level}} has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the [...] "neoliberal" [...] agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Pierre Calame gives an account of this development, while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> great, but people's trust in them <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> low.|$|R

It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much used as it is today, and yet it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> widely criticised. To improve it, an EU Committee of Experts has recommended consideration of this author’s proposal to add a financial dimension to the existing measurement of grants by time. Empirical work that provides a first evaluation of such a possible change is reported, and some lines are sketched out for more refined research on {{how it might be}} introduced...|$|R
