The outcome depends critically upon {{the nature of the}} wind that is driven by neutrino absorption in the surface layers as the dwarf collapses. Unlike previous calculations which either ignored mass loss or employed inadequate zoning to resolve it, a characteristic mass-loss rate of about 0. 005 solar mass/s and an energy input of 5 x 10 exp 50 ergs/s is found. Such a large mass-loss rate almost completely obscures any prompt <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>display</b> and certainly rules out the production by this model of gamma-ray bursts situated at cosmological distances. The occurrence of such collapses with the Milky Way Galaxy might, however, be detected and limited by their nucleosynthesis and gamma-ray line emission.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{metamaterials}} has heralded {{a period of}} unprecedented control of light.

The current design philosophy for tailoring metamaterial functionality is to use geometry to control the nearfield coupling of the elements of the nanostructures. A drawback of this geometry-focused strategy is that the functionality of a metamaterial is pre-determined and cannot be manipulated easily post-fabrication. Here we present a new design paradigm for metamaterials, in which the coupling between chiral elements of a nanostructure is controlled by the chiral asymmetries of the nearfield, which can be externally manipulated. We call this mechanism dichroic coupling. This phenomenon is used to control the <b>electromagnetic</b> induced transparency <b>displayed</b> by a chiral metamaterial by tuning the chirality of the near fields.

40|$|The {{absorption}} and emission maxima, photostabilities and photoreactivities of small-molecule organic chromophores can {{be tailored}} by (a) {{the choice of}} an appropriate parent structure and (b) the deliberate introduction of substituents that predictably alter the optical properties and photochemistry of this parent structure. Suitably-designed chromophores {{can be used in}} a variety of applications, such as imaging (for example, as fluorescent labeling agents or as indicators for specific analytes), optical lithography and as active components in organic electronic devices. In Chapter 1, a fluorogenic chemosensor to detect saturated nitramine and nitrate ester explosives was devised based on a photochemical reduction reaction. 10 -Methyl- 9, 10 - dihydroacridine (AcrH 2) was found to transfer a hydride ion equivalent to the high explosives RDX and PETN upon irradiation at 313 nm in degassed acetonitrile solutions. Mechanistic photophysical studies indicated that the photoreduction of RDX proceeded via a two-step electron-hydrogen atom transfer reaction, whereas PETN photoreduction proceeded via a threestep electron-proton-electron transfer sequence. A zinc analog was synthesized and found to display an 80 - or 25 -fold increase in 480 nm emission intensity upon reaction with RDX or PETN, respectively; moreover, the Zn analog was found to be unresponsive to TNT and other common contaminants, in addition to being photostable under ambient conditions. In Chapter 2, the nitramine-containing explosive RDX and the nitroester-containing explosive PETN were shown to be susceptible to photodegradation upon exposure to sunlight. The products of this photodegradation were identified as reactive, electrophilic NOx species, such as nitrous and nitric acid, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide. NN-Dimethylaniline was capable of being nitrated by the reactive, electrophilic NOx photodegradation products of RDX and PETN. A series of 9, 9 -disubstituted 9, 10 -dihydroacridines (DHAs) were synthesized from either N-phenylanthranilic acid methyl ester or a diphenylamine derivative and were similarly shown to be rapidly nitrated by the photodegradation products of RDX and PETN. An increase in the emission signal at 550 nm was observed upon nitration of DHAs due to the generation of fluorescent donor-acceptor chromophores. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, the presence of ca. 1. 2 ng of RDX and 320 pg of PETN could be detected by DHA indicators in the solid state upon exposure to sunlight. In Chapter 3, optical lithography with organic photochromes is demonstrated. In the past, the formation of microscale patterns in the far field by light has been diffractively limited in resolution to roughly half the wavelength of the radiation used. We demonstrated lines with an - 4 - average width of 36 nm, about one-tenth the illuminating wavelength (11 = 325 nm), made by applying a film of thermally-stable photochromic molecules above the photoresist. Simultaneous irradiation of a second wavelength (k= 633 nm) rendered the film opaque to the writing beam except at nodal sites, which let through a spatially constrained segment of incident 1 light, allowing subdiffractional patterning. In Chapter 4, rylene dyes functionalized with varying numbers of phenyl trifluorovinylether (TFVE) moieties were subjected to a thermal emulsion polymerization to yield shape-persistent, water-soluble chromophore nanoparticles. Perylene and terrylene diimide derivatives containing either two or four phenyl TFVE functional groups were synthesized and subjected to thermal emulsion polymerization in tetraglyme. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicated that particles with sizes ranging from 70 - 100 nm were obtained in tetraglyme, depending on monomer concentration. The photophysical properties of individual monomers were preserved in the nanoemulsions and emission colors could be tuned between yellow, orange, red, and deep red. The nanoparticles retained their shape upon dissolution into water and the resulting water suspensions displayed moderate to high fluorescence quantum yield, thus making them attractive candidates for bioimaging applications. In Chapter 5, a series of substituted 6, 6 -dicyanofulvenes (DCFs) were synthesized starting from masked, dimeric or monomeric cyclopentadienones. DCFs lacking sufficient steric bulk around the fulvene core tended to reversibly undergo a [4 + 2] dimerization. In addition to being highly crystalline, DCFs were darkly-colored compounds due to the presence of weak electronic transitions in the visible region of the <b>electromagnetic</b> spectrum. DCFs <b>displayed</b> two distinct, reversible one-electron reductions by cyclic voltammetry. Based on their high crystallinity and suitable electron affinities, and buoyed by their relatively cheap and straightforward synthesis, DCFs are interesting candidates for organic electron-transport materials. by Trisha Lionel Andrew.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present the {{essential}} issues concerning the radio imaging method (RIM) and attenuation measurements. Although most of the issues discussed in this thesis are in no sense novel, the thesis {{provides an overview of}} the fundamental aspects of RIM and presents novel results from the combination of RIM with other borehole methods. About 2. 6 million years ago, early humans perhaps accidently discovered that sharp stone flakes made it easier to cut the flesh from around bones. From sharp flakes to the first handaxes took hundreds of thousands of years, and the development was thus extremely slow. Alessandro Volta s invention of the voltaic pile (battery) in 1800 started a huge journey, and only one hundred years later humans had all the necessary means to start examining the Earth s subsurface. Since then, the development has been rapid, resulting in numerous methods (e. g. magnetic, gravimetric, electromagnetic and seismic) and techniques to resolve the Earth s treasures. The theoretical basis for the radio imaging method was established long before the method was utilized for exploration purposes. RIM is a geotomographic electromagnetic method in which the transmitter and receivers are in different boreholes to delineate electric conductors between the boreholes. It is a frequency domain method and the continuous wave technique is usually utilized. One of the pioneers was L. G. Stolarczyk in the USA in the 1980 s. In the former Soviet Union, interest in RIM was high in the late 2000 s. Our present device is also Russian based. Furthermore, in South Africa and Australian, a considerable amount of effort has been invested in RIM. The RIM device is superficially examined. It is the essential part in our RIM system, referred to as electromagnetic radiofrequency echoing (EMRE). The idea behind the device is excellent. However, several poor solutions have been utilized in its construction. Many of them have possibly resulted from the lack of good electronic components. The overall electronic construction of the whole device is very complicated. At least two essential properties are lacking, namely circuits for measuring the input impedances of the antennas and the return loss to obtain the actual output power. Of course, the digitalization of data in the borehole receiver could give additional benefits in data handling. The measurements can be monitored in real time on a screen, thus allowing the operator to already gain initial insights into the subsurface geology at the site and also to modify the measurement plan if necessary. Even today, no practical forward modelling tool for examining the behaviour of electromagnetic waves in the Earth s subsurface is available for the RIM environment, and interpretation is thus traditionally based on linear reconstruction techniques. Assuming low contrast and straight ray conditions can generally provide good and rapid results, even during the measurement session. Electrical resistive logging is usually one of the first methods used in a new borehole. Comparing the logging data with measured amplitude data can simply reveal the situations where a nearby and relatively limited conductive formation can mostly be responsible for the high attenuations levels between boreholes and can hence be taken into account in the interpretation. The transient electromagnetic method (TEM) functions in the time domain. TEM is also a short-range method and can very reliably reveal nearby conductors. Comparisons of RIM and TEM data from the ore district coincide well. These issues are considered in detail in Publication I. The functioning of the antenna is highly dependent on the environment in which the antenna is placed. The primary task of the antenna is to radiate and receive electromagnetic energy, or the antenna is a transducer between the generator and the environment. A simple bare wire can serve as a diagnostic probe to detect conductors in the borehole vicinity. However, borehole antennas are generally highly insulated to prevent the leakage of current into the borehole, {{and at the same time}} the insulation reduces the sensitivity of the antenna current to the ambient medium, especially as the electric properties of the insulation and surrounding material differ significantly. However, monitoring of the input impedance of the antenna could help in estimating its effectiveness in the borehole. This property is lacking in the present device. The scattering parameter s 11 defines the relationship between the reflected and incident voltage or it provides information on the impedance matching chain. The behaviour of impedance of the insulated antennas in the different borehole conditions were estimated using simple analytical methods, such as the models of Wu, King and Giri (WKG) and Chen and Warne (CHEN), and highly sophisticated numerical software such as FEKO from EM Software & Systems (Altair). According to the results, our antennas maintain their effectiveness and feasibility in the whole frequency band (312. 5 − 2500 kHz) utilized by the device. However, the highest frequency (2500 kHz) may suffer from different ambient conditions. The resolution is closely related to the frequency, whereby higher frequencies result in better resolution but at the expense of the range. These issues are clarified in Publication II. Electromagnetic methods are based on the fact that earth materials may have large contrasts in their electrical properties. A geotomographic RIM survey can have several benefits over ground-level EM sounding methods. When the transmitter is in the borehole, boundary effects due to the ground surface and the strong attenuation emerging from soils are easily eliminated. A borehole survey also brings the survey closer to the targets, and higher frequencies can be used, which means better resolution. Viewing of the target from different angles and directions also means better reconstruction results. The fundamental principles of the electromagnetic fields are explained to distinguish diffusive movement (strongly attenuating propagation) from wave propagation and to give a good conception of the possible transillumination depths of RIM. The transillumination depths of up to 1000 m are possible in a highly resistive environment using the lowest measurement frequency (312. 5 kHz). In this context, one interesting and challenging case study is also presented from the area for a repository of spent nuclear fuel in Finland. The task was to examine the usefulness of RIM in the area and to determine how well the apparent resistivity could be associated with the structural integrity of the rock. The measurements were successful and the results convinced us of the potential of RIM. Publication III is related to these issues. In Finland, active use of RIM started in 2005 when Russian RIM experts jointly with GTK carried out RIM measurements at Olkiluoto. The results are presented in Publication IV. In this pioneering work, extensive background information (e. g. versatile geophysical borehole logging, optical imaging, 3 D vertical seismic profile (VSP) and single-hole radar reflection measurements) was available from the site. The comparability of the results was good, e. g. low resistive or highly attenuating areas near boreholes from the RIM measurements coincided well with resistive logging and radar results. Electric mise-á-la-masse and high frequency <b>electromagnetic</b> RIM <b>displayed</b> even better comparability. The comparability of the surface electromagnetic sounding data and the RIM data was good. However, the tomographic reconstruction is much more detailed. In overall conclusion, the attenuation measurements were well suited to the recording of subsurface resistivity properties and continuity information between boreholes at Olkiluoto. To date, we have utilized RIM in two quite different environments. Olkiluoto is a spent nuclear fuel area in Finland with solid crystalline bedrock and Pyhäsalmi is an ore district with massive sulphide deposit. Despite Pyhäsalmi being an ideal research target for RIM, the utilization of the method has proven successful in both cases. Tämän tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on esittää radiovarjostusmenetelmään (RIM) ja vaimennusmittauksiin liittyviä keskeisiä tekijöitä. Vaikka tutkimus ei ole kaikilta osin uutta tietoa, antaa se kuitenkin perusteellisen kuvan niistä tärkeimmistä tekijöistä, jotka liittyvät geotomograafiseen tutkimukseen. Lisäksi tutkimuksessa vertaillaan laajasti RIM-menetelmän ja muiden poranreikämittausten tuloksia. Ihmisen kiinnostus geologiaan alkoi muutama miljoona vuotta sitten, kun ihmiset ehkä vain sattumalta huomasivat, että terävät kiviliuskeet leikkasivat lihaa. Aikamatka liuskeista ensimmäisiin kivikirveisiin oli hidasta, ja se kesti useita satoja tuhansia vuosia. Vuonna 1800 Alessandro Volta esitteli paristonsa, joka mahdollisti sähkövirran ylläpitämisen. Alkeellisista olosuhteista ja välineistä huolimatta uusien laitteiden ja matemaattisten teorioiden kehitys oli kuitenkin nopeaa seuraavan sadan vuoden aikana. 1900 -luvun alkupuolella ihmisellä oli hallussa kaikki tarpeellinen tietotaito tutkia maaperää. Siitä lähtien kehitystyö on tuottanut uusia menetelmiä (magneettinen, gravimetrinen, sähkömagneettinen ja sähköinen sekä seisminen) ja tekniikoita tutkia maaperän rikkauksia. Radiovarjostuksen (RIM) perusteet luotiin paljon ennen menetelmän todellista hyväksikäyttöä maaperän tutkimisessa, kun eri tutkijat tekivät teoreettisia antennimalleja. RIM on geotomografinen sähkömagneettinen taajuusalueen menetelmä, jossa lähetin ja vastaanotin ovat eri poranrei issä. Lähetin on normaalisti myös jatkuvasti lähettävä. Menetelmällä voidaan esimerkiksi kartoittaa poranreikien välissä mahdollisesti olevia sähkönjohteita. L. G. Stolarczyk tutki hiilijuonteiden yhtenäisyyttä, ja hänen työnsä on yksi merkittävimmistä RIM:n kehitystyössä. Entisessä Neuvostoliitossa kiinnostus RIM-menetelmää kohtaan oli suuri 1900 -luvun|$|R
