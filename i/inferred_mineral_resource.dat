40|$|Abstract: Mineral Asset {{valuation}} of <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources</b> and <b>Mineral</b> Reserves {{as the single}} fundamental asset for a mining company, according to the SAMVAL Code, CIMVAL Code or the VALMIN code, {{can be carried out}} using three valuation approaches, namely; the Cash Flow (Income) Approach, Market Approach, and Cost Approach. Under the 2009 SAMVAL Code the Market and Cost approaches are viewed as the preferred approaches to the {{valuation of}} Exploration Properties with mainly only <b>Inferred</b> <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources,</b> with the Cash Flow Approach ’not generally used’. The updated 2016 SAMVAL Code has split Exploration Properties into two categories; early stage and advanced stage Exploration Properties. For both stages of Exploration Properties the Market and Cost Approach is ‘widely used’, while the Income Approach is ’not generally used’ for early stage Exploration Properties and ’less widely used’ for advanced stage Exploration Properties. In both versions of the SAMVAL Code the Income Approach is the least preferred method for valuations of exploration projects, with only <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources</b> and without any credible studies to assess the technical and economic viability. Under the 2016 SAMVAL Code, an advanced Exploration Property is defined as a project that has undertaken considerable exploration and a <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resource</b> estimate has been defined and a Scoping Study has been applied to determine whether there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. This paper looks at the valuation of early Exploration Properties, especially those with mainly <b>Inferred</b> <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources,</b> with particular attention {{on the use of the}} Income Approach.

40|$|The Odobola, Ogodo area {{is part of}} the {{basement}} complex of Nigeria and is underlain mainly by schists and intrusive granitic and pegmatitic rocks along with sediments weathered from these rocks. The granitic and pegmatitic intrusives are source of feldspar with a significant K 2 O component (k-feldspar). A study of the area reveals the occurrence of feldspar deposit hosted by granitic and pegmatitic intrusives. Geochemical data for the feldspar samples show average Si 2 O, Al 2 O, K 2 O, Na 2 O, CaO, Fe 2 O 3, MgO and TiO 2 contents of 65. 81 wt%, 16. 67 wt%, 10. 67 wt%, 5. 83 wt%, 0. 02 wt%, 0. 26 wt%, 0. 5 wt % and < 0. 001 wt % respectively while mineralogical results reveals average anorthite, orthoclase and albite contents of 0. 42 %, 85. 40 % and 14. 06 % respectively. The results of the analyses compared with those of the British international Standard (BIS) shows that the feldspar deposit can be used in industries such as glass, ceramic tiles, sanitary wares and insulators.

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of the CRISCO family of International reporting Codes {{is a response to}} a number of mining industry “bubbles” e. g. Poseidon Nickel Boom and Bust of 1969 / 70 and Bre-X Scandal of 1997. Although the USA and Australians had started developing their codes (1988 and 1989 respectively), the international initiative to standardise reporting definitions for <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>mineral</b> reserves began at the 15 th Council of Mining and Metallurgical Institutions (CMMI) Congress at Sun City, South Africa in 1994. The ad-hoc International Definitions Group (later to become CRIRSCO) was provided with the primary objective of developing a set of international standard definitions for the reporting of <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>mineral</b> reserves. Deliberations continued with agreement being reached for the definitions of the two major categories, <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources</b> and <b>Mineral</b> Reserves, and their respective sub-categories Measured, Indicated and <b>Inferred</b> <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources,</b> and Proved and Probable Mineral Reserves under the Denver Accord in 1997. Following these agreements, an updated version of the JORC Code was released in Australia in 1999 and the first SAMREC Code was issued in 2000. In 2002, the Combined Reserves International Reporting Standards Committee (CRIRSCO, now known as the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards) was formed, replacing the CMMI International Definitions Group, with the mission to continue coordination between member countries of the {{development of}} international standards for the definition and reporting of Exploration Results, <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resources</b> and <b>Mineral</b> Reserves. Subsequently various other codes have been developed based on the CRIRSCO template. These now include eight national representative organisations (NROs); namely Australasia (JORC), Canada (CIM), Chile (National Committee), Europe (National Committee PERC), Mongolia (MPIGM), Russia (NAEN), South Africa (SAMREC) and the USA (SME). The combined value of mining companies listed on the stock exchanges of these countries accounts for more than 80 % of the listed capital of the mining industry (CRIRSCO website) ...|$|R

40|$|The Manus back-arc basin host three {{distinct}} well known submarine hydrothermal deposits of Vienna Wood, Pacmanus and Onsen sites. The Vienna Wood {{site is a}} typical Cu-Zn type of mineralization consisting predominantly of pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, wurtzite and chalcopyrite. The Pacmanus site is a polymetallic type of mineral deposit consisting of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, bornite, wurtzite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite, tennantite, galena, Pb-As-Sulphosalt, gold, covellite, digenite and chalcocite.

40|$|The often complex, erratic, and {{localized}} {{nature of}} gold {{is a common}} feature of many vein-style gold deposits. This style of mineralization {{is often referred to}} as being nuggety or possessing a high-nugget effect. As a result of these complexities resource estimation is difficult and in general, only Exploration Results can be provided or an <b>Inferred</b> <b>Mineral</b> <b>Resource</b> estimated from surface drilling data alone. Underground development, further drilling, and probably bulk sampling will be required to delineate Indicated and Measured Resources. Tonnages can generally be estimated from diamond drill and development information with a reasonable degree of confidence. Grade is much more difficult to define with confidence because it is commonly highly erratic and discontinuous in nature. The dependency of higher confidence Resource categories on development information may create a Catch 22 situation, with funding for such development often depending on the prior definition of at least Indicated Resources. There are no easy solutions to these challenges posed by high-nugget effect deposits, and it is important when classifying and reporting not to downplay the uncertainties often associated with Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates for such deposits. However, in common with all deposit types, if the principles that underpin the estimation, classification, and reporting procedures are borne in mind and common sense applied, most issues can be satisfactorily resolved. This paper discusses the classification and reporting of Mineral Resources for high-nugget effect gold vein deposits within the framework of the JORC Code (JORC, 1999) ...|$|E

40|$|The Kabanga Ni sulfide deposit {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} Ni sulfide discoveries of the last two decades, with current indicated <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> of 23. 23 Mt at 2. 64 % Ni and <b>inferred</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>resources</b> of 28. 5 Mt at 2. 7 % Ni (Nov. 2008). The sulfides are hosted by a suite of ∼ 1. 4 Ga ultramafic–mafic, sill-like, and chonolithic intrusions that form part of the approximately 500 km long Kabanga–Musongati–Kapalagulu igneous belt in Tanzania and Burundi. The igneous bodies are up to about 1 km thick and 4 km long. They crystallized from several compositionally distinct magma pulses emplaced into sulfide-bearing pelitic schists. The first magma was a siliceous high-magnesium basalt (approximately 13. 3 % MgO) that formed a network of fine-grained acicular-textured gabbronoritic and orthopyroxenitic sills (Mg# opx 78 – 88, An plag 45 – 88). The magma was highly enriched in incompatible trace elements (LILE, LREE) and had pronounced negative Nb and Ta anomalies and heavy O isotopic signatures (δ 18 O + 6 to + 8). These compositional features are consistent with about 20 % contamination of primitive picrite with the sulfidic pelitic schists. Subsequent magma pulses were more magnesian (approximately 14 – 15 % MgO) and less contaminated (e. g., δ 18 O + 5. 1 to + 6. 6). They injected into the earlier sills, resulting in the formation of medium-grained harzburgites, olivine orthopyroxenites and orthopyroxenites (Fo 83 – 89, Mg# opx 86 – 89), and magmatic breccias consisting of gabbronorite–orthopyroxenite fragments within an olivine-rich matrix. All intrusions in the Kabanga area contain abundant sulfides (pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and minor chalcopyrite and pyrite). In the lower portions and the immediate footwall of two of the intrusions, namely Kabanga North and Kabanga Main, there occur numerous layers, lenses, and veins of massive Ni sulfides reaching a thickness of several meters. The largest amount of high grade, massive sulfide occurs in the smallest intrusion (Kabanga North). The sulfides have heavy S isotopic signatures (δ 34 S wr[*]=[*]+ 10 to + 24) that broadly overlap with those of the country rock sulfides, consistent with significant assimilation of external sulfur from the Karagwe–Ankolean sedimentary sequence. However, based partly on the relatively homogenous distribution of disseminated sulfides in many of the intrusive rocks, we propose that the Kabanga magmas reached sulfide saturation prior to final emplacement, in staging chambers or feeder conduits, followed by entrainment of the sulfides during continued magma ascent. Oxygen isotope data indicate that the mode of sulfide assimilation changed with time. The heavy δ 18 O ratios of the early magmas are consistent with ingestion of the sedimentary country rocks in bulk. The relatively light δ 18 O ratios of the later magmas indicate less bulk assimilation of the country rocks, but in addition the magmas selectively assimilated additional S, possibly through devolatization of the country rocks or through cannibalization of magmatic sulfides deposited in the conduits by preceding magma surges. The intrusions were tilted at ca. 1. 37 Ga, during the Kibaran orogeny and associated synkinematic granite plutonism. This caused solid-state mobilization of ductile sulfides into shear zones, notably along the base of the intrusions where sulfide-hornfels breccias and lenses and layers of massive sulfides may reach a thickness of > 10 m and can extend for several 10 s to > 100 m away from the intrusions. These horizons represent an important exploration target for additional nickel sulfide deposits...|$|R
