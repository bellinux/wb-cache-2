5|$|In 1996, the Castillonnais {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the French Ministry of Agriculture, due {{to the efforts of}} a small number of breed enthusiasts, though by that time only 50 purebred mares remained. The breed association's name was changed to L’association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP) (National Association of Castillonnais Horses of the Ariège Pyrenees), and is headquartered in Castillon-en-Couserans. Le Conservatoire du Patrimoine Biologique Régional de Midi-Pyrénées (Conservatory of the Biological Heritage of the Midi-Pyrénées Region), an organization that <b>has</b> <b>worked</b> <b>to</b> protect the diversity of animal species in the region since 1980, is also committed to protecting the breed.|$|E
5|$|The canals were nationalised in 1948, {{and long-distance}} {{commercial}} traffic {{had all but}} ended by 1958.

It was designated as a cruising waterway in the Transport Act 1968, with potential for leisure use, and since then, it has been enjoyed by recreational boaters, by walkers and by fishermen. In 1997, the Chester Canal Heritage Trust was formed and <b>has</b> <b>worked</b> <b>to</b> promote the canal and its heritage.

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and <b>has</b> <b>worked</b> <b>to</b> analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members have worked on analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E

In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.|$|E
