30|$|The {{results of}} {{different}} maturity and stability indices indicated {{the choice of}} bulking agents is important for composting performance {{and the quality of}} the end product. Applying different bulking agents in composting influence temperature, OUR, GI, dehydrogenase activity and β-glucosidase activity. The <b>final</b> GI <b>values</b> <b>for</b> food waste composting with sawdust as a bulking agent was found to generate more mature compost with less phytotoxicity. The choice of bulking agent did not affect dehydrogenase and β – glucosidase activities values at the end of the composting for both treatments, but the <b>final</b> <b>value</b> <b>for</b> phosphodiesterase activity for FS was much lower than that for FP. High dehydrogenase and β-glucosidase activities during the third week of composting for FP indicate high microbial activities. To generate a high temperature and a longer duration of high temperature to kill pathogens and sterilize the compost, peat was considerably more effective. Both sawdust and peat are effective bulking agents for bench-scale composting. The choice depends on the availability of the bulking agent and land in the target community, the price of the bulking agent and its transportation, and the desired quality (e.g., higher maturity or stability) of the end compost.|$|R
