500|$|Williamson's first {{professional}} work {{may have been}} helping Hogarth pencil some Tarzan Sunday pages in 1948, although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his Tarzan work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story [...] "The World's Ugliest Horse" [...] in Eastern Color's seminal series Famous Funnies #166 (May 1948), and a two-page Boy Scouts story, his first comics narrative, in New Heroic Comics #51 (Nov. 1948). (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with Frank Frazetta, of a three-page crime story, [...] "The Last Three Dimes", in Standard Comics' Wonder Comics #20 [...] ) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him Tarzan work, Williamson [...] "just couldn't do it. ... I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> my little brain that {{he wanted me to}} do it exactly the way that he did it," [...] and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the Tarzan-like feature [...] "Ka'a'nga" [...] in Fiction House's Jungle Comics.

500|$|The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth is {{a revised}} and {{expanded}} version of The Lost Caverns of Tsojconth, a tournament adventure that Gygax wrote for WinterCon V, a gaming convention {{sponsored by the}} Metro Detroit Gamers (MDG) in 1976. It is {{based in part on}} one of Rob Kuntz's dungeon levels, as Kuntz helped Gygax revise the tournament version. [...] This original version consisted of eight loose sheets, an outer folder, and a zip-locked bag; only several hundred copies were printed. In the May 1980 issue of Dragon, Gygax said [...] "Rob Kuntz has the reworked Lost Caverns module which must be finalized" [...] and that [...] "We want to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> print as soon as possible." [...] Lawrence Schick later suggested that [...] "there's evidence that Gary considered Tsojcanth part of a longer Greyhawk campaign, placing the adventure between T1–T4 The Temple of Elemental Evil and WG4 The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun. (By this reckoning, The Village of Hommlet, The Temple of Elemental Evil, and Tsojcanth are thus the [...] "lost" [...] WG1 through WG3 modules.) So, Tsojcanth was published in the S series because it got completed out of order, but was too good to delay." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Chima's expulsion, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "BB Invitational Golf Tournament" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests took turns putting a golf ball {{in an attempt to}} <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a hole. If a HouseGuest missed, their ball went into a {{rotating}} wheel, with various numbers labeling sections in the wheel. The HouseGuest who's ball landed in the highest number each round was eliminated from the competition, with the last HouseGuest remaining winning the competition. When a HouseGuest was eliminated from the competition, they could claim a prize, one of which was the Head of Household position. Jordan was the winner. On Day 44, Jordan chose to nominate Lydia and Natalie for eviction. Shortly afterwards, Kevin, in an attempt to save himself and his allies, lied to Jeff and claimed that he had heard Russell stating he would evict Jeff the following week; Jeff quickly told this to Jordan, and the two believed him. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Kevin, and Michele were selected to compete. On Day 47, HouseGuests competed live in the [...] "Before or After" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to determine whether one event in the house happened before or after another event by stepping either up or down on a staircase; an incorrect answer resulted in elimination, and the last HouseGuest remaining was the winner. Jordan was the winner of the Power of Veto. Minutes later, she chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. Lydia then became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to one. She became the second member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
500|$|There were no fatal {{accidents}} at {{the production}} plant, {{although it had}} a higher accident rate than other Manhattan Project production facilities due to the haste to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> operation. When the crews attempted to start the first rack {{there was a loud}} noise and a cloud of vapor due to escaping steam.

Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12, which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons. Total S-50 production was [...] It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week. [...] "If I had appreciated the possibilities of thermal diffusion," [...] Groves later wrote, [...] "we would have gone ahead with it much sooner, taken a bit more time on the design of the plant and made it much bigger and better. Its effect on our production of U-235 in June and July 1945 would have been appreciable." ...|$|E

Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as [...] "demoniac madness": [...] "He rages most of all {{at the thought that}} eternity might <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> its head to take his misery from him!" ...|$|E
