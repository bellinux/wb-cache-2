40|$|ABSTRACT The {{policy in}} the Netherlands {{concerning}} waste recognises an order of preference, with prevention as the ideal solution, followed by reuse (either direct or after treatment) and confined disposal as the least preferred option. The reuse of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is the cheapest removal option {{and one that is}} frequently used. Treatment of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is more expensive than disposal and hence difficult to stimulate. Consequently, 2002 saw the introduction of a tax of € 13. 48 per ton on the disposal of treatable <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> The environmental objective was to cancel out the economic advantage of disposal over processing and thus to encourage treatment. The introduction of this tax measure has had a number of positive effects:- In-situ sediment site investigations have been extended to include the determination of the sand content, and more attention is being paid to identifying sandy and non-sandy batches;- More accurate records of the dredging, transportation and disposal processes are being drawn up;- Treatment is being carried out under a quality assurance system geared towards maximising sand production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{laboratory}} scale study {{was carried out}} using Starkey medium to demonstrate the feasibility of using microbial methods for the bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated spoils. Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> that were produced during the dredging of oil well access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 ± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 ± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 ± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 ± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 ± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 ± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %). We therefore conclude that Acidithiobacillus sp isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> have the potential for the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> Key words: Acidithiobacilli Bioleaching Bioremediation Dredging Heavy metal pollution oil exploratio...|$|R
