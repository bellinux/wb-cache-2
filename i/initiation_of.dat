5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido.

40|$|Background—Using fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG), we {{characterize}} for {{the first}} time the electrophysiological patterns <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> and termination <b>of</b> reentrant fetal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the most common form of life-threatening fetal arrhythmia. Methods and Results—In contrast to the expectation that reentrant SVT is initiated by spontaneous premature atrial contractions (PACs) and is terminated by spontaneous block, 5 distinct patterns <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> and 4 patterns of termination were documented, with the most common patterns <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> involving reentrant PACs. Waveform morphology and timing, including QRS and ventriculoatrial interval, were assessed. This enabled detection of such phenomena as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, QRS aberrancy, and multiple reentrant pathways that were crucial for defining the rhythm patterns. In addition, fMCG actocardiography revealed an unexpectedly strong association between fetal trunk movement and the <b>initiation</b> and termination <b>of</b> SVT, suggesting that autonomic influences play a key role. Conclusions—This study demonstrates that the patterns <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> and termination <b>of</b> fetal SVT are more diverse than is generally believed and that the most common patterns <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> involve reentrant PACs. The ability to discern such patterns can help elucidate the underlying mechanisms and guide antiarrhythmic drug therapy. fMCG provides a noninvasive means of analyzing complex tachyarrhythmia in utero, with efficacy approaching that of postnatal electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring.
