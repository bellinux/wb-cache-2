5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, or they die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the <b>germination</b> <b>rate</b> from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a <b>germination</b> <b>rate</b> of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% <b>germination</b> <b>rate</b> under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} effects of seed mass, {{temperature}} (16 °C, 24 °C, 30 °C), and seed age (1 year, 7 years, 20 years) on the <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> of two arid zone plant species that differ in seed mass, but occur within the same genus (Frankenia) to determine whether these factors, {{or a combination of}} these factors, influence <b>germination</b> <b>rates.</b> Frankenia serpyllifolia sens. lat. produces one or two larger seeds per fruit whereas F. foliosa produces up to 27 smaller seeds per fruit. Both of these species co-occur geographically in northern South Australia and experience similar abiotic conditions (unpredictable rainfall, extremes in temperature, poor soil conditions). The results showed that germination success by Day 21 was similar between the species, whereas we found significant differences in <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> during the first week. Frankenia serpyllifolia sens. lat. seeds germinated rapidly and were less temperature dependant for germination success. Frankenia foliosa seeds were relatively slower to germinate and <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> were higher at lower temperatures. Differences in <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> were demonstrated to result from an interaction between seed mass/seed age (ηp 2 = 0. 30), and an interaction between seed age/temperature (ηp 2 = 0. 19), but only minimally from an interaction between seed mass/seed age/temperature (ηp 2 = 0. 08).

40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} and endozoochorous dispersal {{have important}} effects on population dynamics, i. e. seed bank formation, {{spatial and temporal}} bet-hedging, avoidance of crowding and decreased sib-competition. Seeds having primary dormancy do not germinate, even if adequate environmental and dispersal conditions are met, until an after-ripening period is completed. This study examined the effects on <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> of seed dispersal by vertebrates and primary dormancy (i. e. how <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> changed in time) in the prickly pear Opuntia rastrera from the southern Chihuahuan Desert. Ripe fruits, scats of coyote, mule deer, woodrat, common pig and pellets of the northern raven were collected in 1992 during the ripe fruit peak (August).

40|$|Egyptian {{broomrape}} (EB), Phelipanche aegyptiaca, is {{a devastating}} root parasite, causing enormous crop losses around the world. Maize {{has the potential}} to influence the growth of other plants through releasing certain allelochemicals and is able to induce germination of at least three broomrape species. To determine whether maize {{could be used as a}} trap crop for EB, 10 maize cultivars were tested for their ability to induce EB germination. The results showed that maize cultivars can induce EB germination, and that <b>germination</b> <b>rates</b> in a cut-root experiment and a hydroponic experiment were consistent. Maize cvs Changcheng 799 and Zhengdan 958 induced the highest EB <b>germination</b> <b>rates,</b> while cvs Luyu 13 and Zhengyu 203 were the least effective. These four maize cultivars were further studied in a pot experiment. Rhizosphere soil, rhizosphere soil extracts, root extracts and shoot extracts from these cultivars were all able to induce EB germination, with cv.

25|$|The {{germination}} percentage {{is simply the}} proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The <b>germination</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the length of time}} it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by {{germination percentage}} plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the <b>germination</b> <b>rate</b> might be very low.|$|E
25|$|A large {{variety of}} {{pathogens}} and nematodes also infect red imported fire ants. Pathogens include Myrmecomyces annellisae, Mattesia spp., Steinernema spp., a mermithid nematode, Vairimorpha invictae, {{which can be}} transmitted via live larvae and pupae and dead adults and Tetradonema solenopsis, which can be fatal to {{a large portion of}} a colony. Individuals infected by Metarhizium anisopliae tend to perform trophallaxis more frequently and have an enhanced preference to quinine, an alkaloid substance. Phorid flies with Kneallhazia solenopsae can serve as vectors in transmitting the disease to the ants. Weakening the colony, infections from this disease are localised within the body fat, with spores only occurring in adult individuals. The mortality of an infected colony tends to be greater in contrast to those that are healthy. These ants are a host to Conidiobolus, Myrmicinosporidium durum, and Beauveria bassiana, each of which are parasitic fungi. Infected individuals have spores all over their bodies and appear darker than usual. The toxicity from antimicrobial property of volatiles produced by the ants can significantly reduce the <b>germination</b> <b>rate</b> of B. bassiana within the colony.|$|E
