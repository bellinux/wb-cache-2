5|$|Vix pervenit: On Usury and Other Dishonest Profit was an <b>encyclical,</b> {{promulgated by}} Pope Benedict XIV on November 1, 1745, which {{condemned}} {{the practice of}} charging interest on loans as usury. Because the <b>encyclical</b> was addressed to the Bishops of Italy, it is generally not considered ex cathedra. The Holy Office applied the <b>encyclical</b> to {{the whole of the}} Roman Catholic Church on July 29, 1836, during the reign of Pope Gregory XVI.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice of artificial contraception in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal <b>encyclical</b> Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal <b>encyclical</b> Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.|$|E
5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal <b>Encyclical</b> is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the <b>encyclical</b> varies depending on the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The title of a Papal <b>Encyclical</b> is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E

5|$|The {{text of the}} <b>encyclical</b> was {{destroyed}} in several countries. In France, the ban on usury persisted until the French Revolution of 1789, the same year in which Turgot's Mémoire sur les prets d'argent, a defense of usury, was allowed to be published.|$|E

5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar.

5|$|After {{violations}} of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 <b>encyclical</b> Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews in the Holocaust, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E

5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum <b>encyclical</b> of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and <b>encyclical</b> letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
25|$|The <b>encyclical</b> Divino afflante Spiritu, {{published}} in 1943, emphasized {{the role of}} the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in Greek and Hebrew. Noting improvements in archaeology, the <b>encyclical</b> reversed Pope Leo XIII's <b>encyclical,</b> which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the Latin Vulgate. The <b>encyclical</b> demands a much better understanding of ancient Jewish history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate biblical studies for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in sermons and religious instruction.|$|E
