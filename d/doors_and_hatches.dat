25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} only carried half {{of their}} maximum capacity; there are many versions as to the reasoning behind half-filled lifeboats. Some sources claimed {{they were afraid of}} the lifeboat buckling under the weight, others suggested it was because the crew were following strict maritime tradition to evacuate women and children first. Additionally, <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> were locked to prevent passengers on the lower decks from easily gaining access to and swamping the boats. Few men were allowed into the lifeboats on the port side, while the starboard side only allowed many men into boats after women and children boarded. Some of the final lifeboats were overfilled, and passengers noticed the seawater line was near the rim on some of the lifeboats.|$|E
500|$|Abe's {{request was}} denied, and Shinano {{departed}} as scheduled with the escorting destroyers at 18:00 on 28 November. Abe commanded {{a crew of}} 2,175 officers and men. Also on board were 300 shipyard workers and 40 civilian employees. Watertight <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> were left open for ease of access to machinery spaces, as were some manholes in the double and triple-bottomed hull. Abe preferred a daylight passage, since it would have allowed him extra time to train his crew and given the destroyer crews time to rest. [...] However, {{he was forced to}} make a nighttime run when he learned the Navy General Staff could not provide air support. Shinano carried six Shinyo suicide boats, and 50 Ohka suicide flying bombs; her other aircraft were not planned to come aboard until later. Her orders were to go to Kure, where she would complete fitting out and then deliver the kamikaze craft to the Philippines and Okinawa. Traveling at an average speed of , she needed sixteen hours to cover the 300 miles (480km) to Kure. [...] As a measure of how important Shinano was to the naval command, Abe was slated for promotion to rear admiral once its fitting out was complete.|$|E
500|$|Vanguards {{design was}} revised again, while {{the ship was}} under {{construction}} in 1942, to reflect {{lessons learned from the}} loss of the [...] battleship [...] and operations with the other battleships. The space between the inboard and outboard propeller shafts was increased from [...] to prevent a single torpedo from wrecking both shafts, and watertight access trunks were added to all spaces below the deep waterline to prevent progressive flooding through open watertight <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> as happened to Prince of Wales. This change and the relocation of some of the [...] ammunition handling rooms from the lower deck to the middle deck seriously delayed the ship's completion. The design requirement that the guns of 'A' turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0° of elevation was sacrificed to allow her freeboard forward to be increased, and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing sea spray in head seas. The ship's fuel supply was increased from [...] to [...] to prevent the fuel shortage problems suffered by [...] and [...] during their pursuit of the [...] The Unrotated Projectile mounts were deleted from the design, and the light anti-aircraft armament was increased to a total of 76 two-pounders in one quadruple and nine octuple mounts and 24 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were also added in 12 twin mounts. Space for these was made available by removing the two floatplanes, the catapult, and their associated facilities.|$|E

50|$|Hatchbacks may be {{described}} as three-door (two entry <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> the <b>hatch)</b> or five-door (four entry <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> the <b>hatch)</b> cars. A model range may include multiple configurations, as with the 2001-2007 Ford Focus which offered sedan (ZX4), wagon (ZXW), and three or five-door hatchback (ZX3 and ZX5) models. The models typically share a platform, drivetrain and bodywork forward of the A-pillar. Hatchbacks may have a removable rigid parcel shelf, liftable with the tailgate, or flexible roll-up tonneau cover to cover the cargo space behind the rear seats.|$|R
2500|$|Taihōs chief {{damage control}} officer {{eventually}} ordered the ship's general ventilation system switched to full capacity and, where possible, all <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> opened {{to try to}} rid the ship of fumes. Unfortunately, this simply resulted in saturation of areas previously unexposed to the vapors and increased the chances of accidental or spontaneous ignition. About 14:30 that afternoon, 6½ hours after the initial torpedo hit, Taihō was jolted by a severe explosion. A senior staff officer on the bridge saw the flight deck heave up. The sides blew out. Taihō dropped out of formation and began to settle in the water, clearly doomed. Though Admiral Ozawa wanted to go down with the ship, his staff prevailed on him to survive and to transfer his flag to the cruiser [...] Taking the Emperor's portrait, Ozawa transferred to Haguro by destroyer. After he left, Taihō was torn by a second thunderous explosion and sank stern first at 16:28, taking 1,650 officers and men out of a complement of 2,150 down with her.|$|E
2500|$|Port-side torpedo {{damage caused}} rapid {{compartment}} flooding; prompt counter-flooding by four damage-control parties {{under the command}} of Lt. Commander John S. Harper and early closure of all water-tight <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> ordered by Harper's assistant, Archie P. Kelley, prevented the ship from capsizing. Water damage ruined much of the ship's communications gear, including its battle-phone batteries. An experimental sound-powered telephone circuit connecting the central station with the damage-control parties, tested during the previous summer's damage-control drills, remained operative but was unused. Captain Mervyn S. Bennion, unaware that Harper and Kelly had begun damage-control efforts, ordered Lieutenant C. V. Ricketts to begin counter-flooding the starboard compartments. Ricketts, delayed at his battle station and AA-gun batteries, arrived to find 30 to 40 starboard compartments already flooded. In his report, Ricketts wrote that he witnessed the flooding of one compartment. He then ordered all remaining starboard compartments flooded and returned to the bridge to help move the captain, mortally wounded by shrapnel. Harper's report on the counter-flooding of [...] "all available voids", as directed, indicated that Ricketts' assistance had been unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, {{the wreck}} of Maine was rediscovered by Advanced Digital Communications, a Toronto-based {{expedition}} company, in about 3,770 feet (1,150 m) of water roughly 3 miles (4.8km) northeast of Havana Harbor. The company had been working with Cuban scientists and oceanographers from the University of South Florida College of Marine Science, on testing underwater exploration technology. The ship had been discovered east of where it was believed it had been scuttled; according to the researchers, during the sinking ceremony and {{the time it took}} the wreck to founder, currents pushed the Maine east until it came to rest at its present location. Before the team identified the site as Maine, they referred to the location as the [...] "square" [...] due to its unique shape, and at first they did not believe it was the ship, due to its unexpected location. The site was explored with an ROV. According to Dr. Frank Muller-Karger, the hull was not oxidized and the crew could [...] "see all of its structural parts". The expedition was able to identify the ship due to the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> on the wreck, as well as the anchor chain, the shape of the propellers, and the holes where the bow was cut off. Due to the 1912 raising of the ship, the wreck was completely missing its bow; this tell-tale feature was instrumental in identifying the ship. The team also located a boiler nearby, and a debris field of coal.|$|E

The self-destruct atomic bomb is automatically armed when it detects a containment breach, triggering its detonation countdown {{to prevent the}} spread of the infection. As the bomb arms, the scientists realize that given Andromeda's ability to generate matter directly from energy, the organism would be able to consume the released energy and ultimately benefit from an atomic explosion, growing into a super-colony within a day.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to other detailed changes, power sliding <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> a power <b>hatch</b> became available as options. The Mitsubishi 3.0 L V6, which no longer met emissions standards in California and the northeastern U.S., was discontinued, {{and a more}} powerful 3.8L engine, based on the 3.3L, became available. All Wheel Drive continued to be offered on high end models. Other innovative available features included remote operated sliding <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> rear <b>hatch,</b> which could be opened and closed at {{the push of a}} button, either inside the vehicle, or with the keyless entry fob.|$|R
60|$|All the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> were {{securely}} closed {{when the}} gale first sprung up; therefore everything below was {{in much the}} same condition as before the storm.

50|$|The {{original}} Formal Investigation in 1974 {{concluded that}} the most likely reason for her loss {{was that she was}} overwhelmed by a succession of very large waves in heavy seas and capsized.

50|$|To ensure stealth capabilities, {{anechoic}} coatings of radar absorbent materials (RAM) {{have been}} used in the load-bearing structures over large areas of the ship. This strategy leads to significant weight saving compared to the conventional construction technique of applying RAM cladding to the external surfaces. The ship's profile has a faceted appearance with no right angle structures and few orientations of reflective panels. <b>Doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> are flush with the surfaces and the windows are flush without visible coaming (edge of window aperture) and are fitted with radar reflective screens. The vessels are additionally protected by the Rheinmetall MASS sensor / decoy system.|$|E

50|$|On 17 December 2004 the RFI {{concluded}} that these open chutes, <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hatches</b> had compromised the ships watertight integrity and, {{combined with a}} following (and as already noted) heavy sea led to flooding on the factory deck. The RFI also postulated that an attempted emergency manoeuvre by the Gauls officer of the watch (a perfectly logical move to try to turn into the sea) caused 100 tonnes of floodwater to surge across to the starboard {{side of the ship}} leading to capsize and a catastrophic loss of stability. Further flooding then took place through open doors, chutes and hatches until the Gaul lost her reserves of buoyancy, she then sank very rapidly, stern first.|$|E

It is rumored that only 11 of these smaller Vans were built and sold as the CitiVan but an unknown more were built and sold in 1979 as the first year Comuta-Van. The main design differences between the 1979 Comuta-Van and the later Postal Comuta-Van is that the much smaller 1979 Comuta-Van has swing out side <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> a <b>hatch</b> back window.

The Ratel's wheels, if damaged, are also much easier to repair or replace than tracks. The vehicle also has multiple <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> hatches; the two main doors are located in the vehicle's sides, but a small rear <b>door</b> <b>and</b> roof <b>hatches</b> allow the crew to exit the vehicle from many directions at once, or to more easily dismount under cover during an ambush.|$|R
