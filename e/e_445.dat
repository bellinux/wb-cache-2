At the same time, the <b>E</b> <b>445</b> A substitution does not affect intraprotein electron re-equilibration after the photolysis of CO bound to ferrous heme d in the one-electron-reduced enzyme (the so-called “electron backflow”). The backflow is coupled to membrane potential generation. Electron transfer between hemes d and b 558 is electrogenic. In contrast, {{electron transfer}} between hemes d and b 595 is not electrogenic, although heme b 595 is the major electron acceptor for heme d during the backflow, and therefore {{is not likely to be}} accompanied by net H+ uptake or release.

40|$|DnaA is the {{initiator}} of DNA replication in bacteria. A mutant DnaA named DnaAcos {{is unusual}} {{because it is}} refractory to negative regulation. We developed a genetic method to isolate other mutant DnaAs that circumvent regulation to extend our understanding of mechanisms that control replication initiation. Like DnaAcos, one mutant bearing a tyrosine sub-stitution for histidine 202 (H 202 Y) withstands the regulation exerted by datA, hda and dnaN (b clamp), and both DnaAcos and H 202 Y resist inhib-ition by the Hda-b clamp complex in vitro. Other mutant DnaAs carrying G 79 D, E 244 K, V 303 M or <b>E</b> <b>445</b> K substitutions are either only partially sensi-tive or refractory to inhibition by the Hda-b clamp complex in vitro but are responsive to hda expres-sion in vivo. All mutant DnaAs remain able to interact directly with Hda. Of interest, both DnaAcos and DnaAE 244 K bind more avidly to Hda. These mutants, by sequestrating Hda, may limit its availability to regulate other DnaA molecules, which remain active to induce extra rounds of DNA repli-cation. Other evidence suggests that a mutant bearing a V 292 M substitution hyperinitiates by escaping the effect of an unknown regulatory factor.

40|$|The {{replication}} protein NS 1 {{is essential}} for genome replication and protein production in parvoviral infection. Many of its functions, including recognition and site-specific nicking of the viral genome, helicase activity, and transactivation of the viral capsid promoter, are dependent on ATP. An ATP-binding pocket resides {{in the middle of}} the modular NS 1 protein in a superfamily 3 helicase domain. Here we have identified key ATP-binding amino acid residues in canine parvovirus (CPV) NS 1 protein and mutated amino acids from the conserved A motif (K 406), B motif (E 444 and <b>E</b> <b>445),</b> and positively charged region (R 508 and R 510). All mutations prevented the formation of infectious viruses. When provided in trans, all except the R 508 A mutation reduced infectivity in a dominant-negative manner, possibly by hindering genome replication. These results suggest that the conserved R 510 residue, but not R 508, is the arginine finger sensory element of CPV NS 1. Moreover, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), complemented by computer simulations, was used to assess the binding properties of mutated fluorescent fusion proteins. These experiments identified ATP-dependent and -independent binding modes for NS 1 in living cells. Only the K 406 M mutant had a single binding site, which was concluded to indicate ATP-independent binding. Furthermore, our data suggest that DNA binding of NS 1 is dependent on its ability to both bind and hydrolyze ATP...|$|E
40|$|Study Design. Systematic Review. Objective. To {{summarize}} evidence concerning physical prognostic {{factors for}} development of Late Whiplash Syndrome (LWS). Summary of Background Data. There have been 3 previous systematic reviews of prognosis of whiplash with conflicting findings. The Quebec Task Force concluded that high priority {{should be given to}} determining prognostic factors. Subsequently their review was updated by Cote et al (Spine 2001; 26 : <b>E</b> <b>445</b> - 58) and most recently by Scholten-Peeters et al (Pain 2003; 104 : 303 - 22). Methods. We searched electronic databases from their inception to August 2006 using a prespecified search strategy. We included prospective cohort and case control studies that studied physical prognostic factors at baseline. Two independent reviewers selected articles, extracted data, and assessed quality. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity between studies. Instead, levels of evidence were generated by grouping similar findings from cohorts. Results. Thirty-eight articles from 26 cohorts were reviewed. The majority of articles (25 of 38) were rated as low quality. No studies were rated as high quality. Only a minority of studies used validated prognostic measures and/or outcome measures. High initial neck pain intensity, neck pain related disability, and cold hyperalgesia all had moderate evidence for an association with the development of LWS. No factor was rated as having strong evidence. Conclusion. Pain has a central role to play as a prognostic factor for the development of LWS. Other physical factors commonly used in the clinical setting showed inconclusive evidence for their influence on prognosis. There is a need for improved quality of studies with consistent use of validated measures of all categories of prognostic factors and outcome. This may then provide a clearer understanding of prognosis of Whiplash Associated Disorders and therefore facilitate effective management of this costly problem. ...|$|E

The line shape of spectra of photodissociation of one-electron-reduced and two-electron-reduced enzymes is strikingly {{different from that of}} the fully reduced enzyme. The difference demonstrates that in the fully reduced enzyme photolysis of CO from heme d perturbs ferrous heme b(595) causing loss of an absorption band centered at 435 nm, thus supporting interactions between heme b(595) and heme d in the di-heme oxygen-reducing site, in agreement with previous works. Photolyzed CO recombines with the fully reduced enzyme monoexponentially with tau similar to 12 mu s, whereas recombination of CO with one-electron-reduced cytochrome bd shows three kinetic phases, with tau similar to 14 ns, 14 mu s, and 280 mu s. The spectra of the absorption changes associated with these components are different in line shape. The 14 ns phase, absent in the fully reduced enzyme, reflects geminate recombination of CO with part of heme d. The 14 -mu s component reflects bimolecular recombination of CO with heme d and electron backflow from heme d to hemes b in similar to 4 % of the enzyme population. The final, 280 -mu s component, reflects return of the electron from hemes b to heme d and bimolecular recombination of CO in that population. The fact that even in the two-electron-reduced enzyme, a nanosecond geminate recombination is observed, suggests that namely the redox state of heme b(595), and not that of heme b(558), controls the pathway(s) by which CO migrates between heme d and the medium.

40|$|Anoctamin 1 (Ano 1, or TMEM 16 A) is a Ca 2 +-activated {{chloride}} {{channel that}} is gated by both voltage and Ca 2 +. We have previously identified {{that the first}} intracellular loop that contains a high density of acidic residues mediates voltage- and calcium-dependent gating of Ano 1. Mutation of the four consecutive glutamates (444 EEEE 447) inhibits the voltage-dependent activation of Ano 1, whereas deletion of these residues decreases apparent Ca 2 + sensitivity. In the present study, we further found that deletion of 444 EEEEEAVKD 452 produced a more than 40 -fold decrease in the apparent Ca 2 + sensitivity with altered activation kinetics. We then systematically mutated each acidic residue into alanine, and analyzed the voltage- and calcium dependent activation of each mutation. Activation kinetics of wild type Ano 1 consisted of a fast component (τfast) that represented voltage-dependent mode, and a slow component (τslow) that reflected the Ca 2 +-dependent modal gating.

One hundred and twenty bovine incisors were selected and grounded with 600 -grit silicon paper to get an incisor platform, simulating a human molar incisal surface. The teeth were included in polystyrene resin blocks and the periodontal ligament was simulated with polyether material in pairs with 2 different distances: d 11 - 11. 0 mm of pontic distance and d 18 - 18. 0 mm of pontic distance. Teeth were prepared, resulting in incisal-distal and incisal-mesial Class II boxes. Then, samples were restored with a standardized composite inlay adhesive fixed partial denture (AFPD) made in laboratory resin (Sinfony, 3 M Espe), generating 4 groups: Int- direct fiber-reinforcement (Interlig, Angelus); FiLab- laboratory unidirectional fiber-glass bundle (Fibrex Medial) associated to a laboratory multidirectional fiber-glass bundle (Fibrex Junciona l, Lab Fibrex, Angelus); and FiPon- laboratory unidirectional fiber-glass bundle associated with pre-manufactured fiber-glass pontic (Fibrex Pontic, Angelus). The AFPD samples were fixed with dual-cure resin cement (Rely-X ARC) and after 24 hours were submitted to a mechanical testing machine with a compressive axial load {{at the center of the}} pontic, with a crosshead-speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. Fracture modes were classified according to 3 categories. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (P <. 05). The analysis revealed that the fiber-reinforcement (P <. 001) and pontic distance (P <. 001) were significant. The failures were most prevalent among resin and fiber, in absence of fractures of the fibers or dental structure.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of VPg {{was found to be}} TLPPELSIIEIP, which mapped to the region 326 - 337 of ORF 2 product and the cleavage site between the protease domain and VPg was identified to be E 325 -T 326. The cleavage site between VPg and RNA dependent RNA polymerase was predicted to be <b>E</b> <b>445</b> -T 446 based on the amino acid sequence analysis of the polyprotein from different sobemoviruses. ORF 3 is nested within ORF 2 in a m 1 reading frame. The potential ribosomal frame shift signal and the downstream stem-loop structure found in other sobemoviruses are also conserved in SeMV RNA sequence, indicating that ORF 3 might be expressed via m 1 frame shifting mechanism. ORF 4 encodes the coat protein of SeMV, which shows 76 and 66 % identity with SBMV-Ark and SCPMV, respectively. Thus the comparison of the non-coding regions and the ORFs of SeMV with other sobemoviruses clearly revealed {{that it is not a}} strain of SBMV. Phylogenetic analysis of six different sobemoviruses, including SeMV, suggests that recombination event is not frequent in this group and that SeMV is a distinct member of the genus sobemovirus. The analysis also shows sobemoviruses infecting monocotyledons and dicotyledons fall into two distinct clusters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the kinds of variables involved in the coming out process of lesbians. These variables were used as predictors of disclosure and their relative predictive strengths were assessed. Data were gathered anonymously through a questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were distributed through friendship networks, feminist organizations, gay churches, women 2 ̆ 7 s bookstores and a university women 2 ̆ 7 s centre. In addition to questions about demographics, the questionnaire included measurements of certainty with regard to a lesbian identity, length of time required to establish a positive identity, extent of socialization with lesbians and gay males, political awareness/involvement, self-esteem, disclosure and disclosure-related fears and problems. A total of 305 women returned the questionnaire. All were living in Canada or the United States, most were white, most were relatively certain about their identity and relatively pleased with it. They varied considerably in age, income, education, and in the other measures listed above. Positive correlations were found between certainty of lesbianism, good feelings about lesbianism, and socialization with the lesbian/gay male subculture. A positive correlation was found between self-esteem and feelings about being a lesbian. Time required to establish a positive lesbian identity was negatively correlated with age of acquiring a lesbian identity, time period (year) of establishing a lesbian identity, and disclosure-related fears. Political awareness/involvement was the best predictor of all types of disclosure. High scorers disclosed more. The presence of disclosure-related problems was also a consistent predictor of the extent of disclosure. Other predictors varied in strength depending on target persons or situations. Self-esteem was not a predictor of disclosure. The study was useful in describing the pattern of variables involved in the coming out process. It served to emphasize the importance of political considerations both in lesbian identity formation and in disclosure. Dept. of Psychology.

40|$|Context Bariatric surgery {{has proven}} to be the most {{effective}} method of treating severe obesity. Nevertheless, the acceptance of bariatric surgery is still questioned. The surgical complications observed in the early postoperative period following surgeries performed to treat severe obesity are similar to those associated with other major surgeries of the gastrointestinal tract. However, given the more frequent occurrence of medical comorbidities, these patients require special attention in the early postoperative follow-up. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these complications are directly associated with a greater probability of control. Method The medical records of 538 morbidly obese patients who underwent surgical treatment (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery) were reviewed. Ninety-three (17. 2 %) patients were male and 445 (82. 8 %) were female. The ages of the patients ranged from 18 to 70 years (average = 46), and their body mass indices ranged from 34. 6 to 77 &# 8197;kg/m 2. Results Early complications occurred in 9. 6 % and were distributed as follows: 2. 6 % presented bleeding, intestinal obstruction occurred in 1. 1 %, peritoneal infections occurred in 3. 2 %, and 2. 2 % developed abdominal wall infections that required hospitalization. Three (0. 5 %) patients experienced pulmonary thromboembolism. The mortality rate was 0, 55 %. Conclusion The incidence of early complications was low. The diagnosis of these complications was mostly clinical, based on the presence of signs and symptoms. The value of the clinical signs and early treatment, specially in cases of sepsis, were essential to the favorable surgical outcome. The mortality was mainly related to thromboembolism and advanced age, over 65 years. Contexto A cirurgia bari&# 225;trica tem mostrado ser o m&# 233;todo mais eficaz de tratamento da obesidade grave. No entanto, sua aceita&# 231;&# 227;o como terapia padr&# 227;o-ouro ainda &# 233; questionada. As complica&# 231;&# 245;es cir&# 250;rgicas observadas no in&# 237;cio do per&# 237;odo p&# 243;s-operat&# 243;rio de cirurgias para o tratamento da obesidade grave s&# 227;o semelhantes aos associados a outras cirurgias de grande porte do trato gastrointestinal. N&# 227;o obstante, dada a ocorr&# 234;ncia mais frequente de comorbidades associadas &# 224; obesidade m&# 243;rbida, esses pacientes necessitam de aten&# 231;&# 227;o especial no p&# 243;s-operat&# 243;rio.

Resultados As complica&# 231;&# 245;es imediatas ocorreram em 9, 6 % e foram distribu&# 237;dos da seguinte forma: 2, 6 % apresentaram sangramento, obstru&# 231;&# 227;o intestinal ocorreu em 1. 1 %, infec&# 231;&# 245;es peritoniais ocorreram em 3, 2 % e 2, 2 % desenvolveram infec&# 231;&# 245;es da parede abdominal requerendo hospitaliza&# 231;&# 227;o. Tr&# 234;s (0, 5 %) pacientes tiveram tromboembolismo pulmonar. Conclus&# 227;o A padroniza&# 231;&# 227;o de cirurgia para o tratamento da obesidade m&# 243;rbida tem contribu&# 237;do significativamente para os baixos &# 237;ndices de complica&# 231;&# 245;es e mortalidade. A incid&# 234;ncia de complica&# 231;&# 245;es precoces foi baixa.

40|$|Plant growth {{depends on}} the {{integration}} of environmental cues, nitrogen fixation and phytohormone-signaling pathways. The growth and development of Gracilaria dura was significantly influenced by the association of bacterial isolates. The putative bud-inducing epiphytic Exiguobacterium homiense and endophytic Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus licheniformis were examined {{for their ability to}} fix nitrogen and produce indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA). These bacterial isolates were identified to the species level by biochemical tests, fatty acid and partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The B. pumilus, B. licheniformis and <b>E.</b> homiense produced <b>445.</b> 5, 335 and 184. 1 μg mL− 1 IAA and 12. 51, 10. 14 and 6. 9 mM mL− 1 ammonium, respectively, as determined using HPLC and spectroscopy. New bud regeneration observed after the addition of total protein of the bacterial isolates suggests that IAA is conjugated with protein. The epi- and endophytic bacterial isolates were able to induce five and 10 new buds per frond, respectively, in comparison to the control, where one to two buds were observed. The combination of 25 °C and 30 ‰ showed the optimum condition for bud induction in G. dura when incubated with the total protein of B. pumilus. Our finding revealed {{for the first time that}} IAA coupled with nitrogen fixation induce and regenerate new buds in G. dur...|$|R
40|$|Three genes {{involved}} in gluconate metabolism, gntR, gntK, and gntU, which code for a regulatory protein, a gluconate kinase, and a gluconate transporter, respectively, were cloned from Escherichia coli K- 12 {{on the basis}} of their known locations on the genomic restriction map. The gene order is gntU, gntK, and gntR, which are immediately adjacent to asd at 77. 0 min, and all three genes are transcribed in the counterclockwise direction. The gntR product is 331 amino acids long, with a helix-turn-helix motif typical of a regulatory protein. The gntK gene encodes a 175 -amino-acid polypeptide that has an ATP-binding motif similar to those found in other sugar kinases. While GntK does not show significant sequence similarity to any known sugar kinases, it is 45 % identical to a second putative gluconate kinase from <b>E.</b> coli,gntV. The <b>445</b> -amino-acid sequence encoded by gntU has a secondary structure typical of membrane-spanning transport proteins and is 37 % identical to the gntP product from Bacillus subtilis. Kinetic analysis of GntU indicates an apparent Km for gluconate of 212 microM, indicating that this is a low-affinity transporter. Studies demonstrate that the gntR gene is monocistronic, while the gntU and gntK genes, which are separated by only 3 bp, form an operon. Expression of gntR is essentially constitutive, while expression of gntKU is induced by gluconate and is subject to fourfold glucose catabolite repression. These results confirm that gntK and gntU, together with another gluconate transport gene, gntT, constitute the GntI system for gluconate utilization, under control of the gntR gene product, which is also responsible for induction of the edd and eda genes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway...|$|R

As dietas foram formuladas para atender à demanda de animais em mantença, sendo 50 % da energia proveniente do volumoso e 50 % do concentrado, contendo os seguintes níveis de inclusão de farelo de glúten de milho 21 : 0, 10, 20 e 30 %. Foram calculadas as concentrações de Lactobacillus spp. e Streptococcus spp. nas fezes expressas em log 10 UFC/g (unidades formadoras de colônias por grama de fezes), e as espécies-alvo foram identificadas por Multiplex PCR e Multiplex PCR-RFLP, respectivamente para Lactobacillus spp. e Streptococcus spp. Não foi observado efeito (p> 0, 05) das dietas sobre as populações dos gêneros. Das espécies-alvo do gênero Lactobacillus, quatro foram detectadas (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. delbruekii, L. acidophilus e L. gasseri). Das espécies pesquisadas do gênero Streptococcus, foram detectadas os três grupos alvo: S. bovis/S. infantarius, S. equinus e S. gallolyticus. A inclusão de FGM 21 até o nível de 30 % do concentrado não alterou a quantidade dos gêneros estudados no intestino grosso de equinos. A espécie de Lactobacillus predominante nas fezes de equinos recebendo dietas alta fibra foi L. rhamnosus e de Streptococcus foi S. equinus. In {{order to}} study the {{concentrations}} and target species of Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. in the feces of horses fed with increasing levels of Corn Gluten Meal 21 (CGM 21), four adult crossbred horses housed in individual stalls were used, {{with an average age}} of 2. 8 years and weighing 445 (+/- 20) kg in maintenance, in a 4 x 4 latin square. The diets were formulated {{to meet the demands of}} the animals in maintenance, with 50 % of energy from forage and 50 % concentrate containing the following levels of corn meal 21 : 0, 10, 20 and 30 %. The concentrations of Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. in feces were calculated and expressed in Log 10 CFU/g (colony forming units per gram of feces) and the target species were identified by multiplex PCR and multiplex PCR-RFLP respectively for Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. There was no diet effect (p> 0. 05) on the populations of genres of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.

40|$|Freshwater finfish species {{richness}} {{and level of}} endemism in East, and South and South-East Asia that included 17 nations were studied using available databases, and included nation-wise distribution, habitat types, and conservation status. The number of endemic finfish species in the region was 559, belonging to 47 families. Families Cyprinidae and Balitoridae accounted for 43. 5 % and 16. 2 % {{of the total number}} of endemic species in the region, respectively, followed by Sisoridae (25), Gobiidae (20), Melanotaeniidae (19), and Bagridae (16), and the other 41 families had at least one endemic species. Nation-wise the most number of endemic freshwater finfish species occur in India (191), followed by China (88), Indonesia (84), and Myanmar (60). In India, the endemic species accounted for 26. 4 % of the native freshwater fish fauna, followed by South Korea (16. 9 %), the Philippines, (16. 3 %) and Myanmar (15. 7 %). Statistically significant relationships discerned between the number of indigenous and endemic {{species richness}} to land area (X la in 10 3 km 2) of the nations in the region were, Y in = 218. 961 Ln(X la) – 843. 1 (R 2 = 0. 735; P < 0. 001) and Y <b>e</b> = 28. <b>445</b> Ln X la − 134. 47 (R 2 = 0. 534; P < 0. 01), respectively, and between indigenous and endemic species richness was Y e = 0. 079 X n − 1. 558 (R 2 = 0. 235; P < 0. 05). The overall conservation status of endemic finfish in Asia was satisfactory in that only 92 species were in some state of vulnerability, of which 37 species (6. 6 %) are endangered or critically endangered. However, the bulk of these species (83. 7 %) were cave- and or lake-dwelling fish. However, nation-wise, the endemic freshwater finfish fauna of the Philippines and Sri Lanka, based on the imperilment index, were found to be in a highly vulnerable state. Among river basins, the Mekong Basin had the highest number of endemic species (31. 3 %). The discrepancies between databases are highlighted and the need to consolidate information among databases is discussed. It is suggested that the Mekong Basin be considered as a biodiversity hotspot, and appropriate management strategies be introduced in this regard. </div...|$|R
40|$|About this release This release {{features}} a large collection of classes representing polar and cryosphere-related environments and environmental processes, primarily prepared by @kaiiam. These semantics are in aid of efforts {{such as the}} Alfred Wegener Institute's Frontiers in Arctic Marine Monitoring programme. Knowledge was harvested from numerous resources - such as the review by Boetius et al. (2015, Nat Rev Microbiol 13 : 677 – 690) - which are cross referenced in each class. Efforts to align with existing resources have been initiated, e. g. : [URL] Past and ongoing work related to this project is organised in project cryophile. This work has also motivated the general development of the environmental process hierarchy. A number of other requests, such as that for fissures (see # 466) are also bundled in this release. As usual, the hyperlinks to the terms will be live once OntoBee runs its import cycle over the weekend; however, the PURLs are valid immediately. To better axiomatise the new classes and enhance existing ones, we have also imported numerous classes from other OBO projects, detailed below.
