5|$|Holmes was a {{stand-up}} style goaltender; {{later on in}} his career, Holmes wore a cap when in goal to protect <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> objects thrown by spectators, as it presented a tempting target to them. Holmes coached minor-league teams after his retirement, notably the Toronto Millionaires of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL) and the Cleveland Indians of the International Hockey League (IHL). Holmes died on June 27, 1941, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida and was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Isa Abdulhasan Ali Hussain was a 60-year-old Bahraini {{who died}} on 17 February morning {{immediately}} after riot police fired at <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> point-blank range. Hussain {{was a part of}} a group of protesters who marched back towards Pearl Roundabout after being dispersed when police shot him. Eyewitnesses say he went near security forces asking them to allow young people help the injured protesters. However, police claimed he was with a group of protesters who attacked them using metal rods, swords, molotov cocktails, stones and other weapons. His funeral was held on 18February in Karzakan and was attended by thousands of mourners. An unnamed policeman charged with his murder was acquitted on 27 September 2012.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} following Hard Justice that Shane Douglas was originally supposed to handle interview duties for the show, but {{came down with}} the stomach flu {{and was replaced by}} Terry Taylor. Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly deep cut on the top of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E

5|$|In the foreground, {{a drunken}} freemason, {{identified}} by his apron and set square medallion as the Worshipful Master of a lodge, is being helped home by his Tyler, as {{the contents of}} a chamber pot are emptied onto <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> a window. In some of the prints, a woman standing back from the window looks down on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with sword and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>from</b> the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010–11 NHL season, Crosby had a 25-game point streak, {{which began}} November 5, 2010, against the Anaheim Ducks, and ended December 28, 2010, against the New York Islanders. During this streak he had 27 goals (including three hat-tricks), 24 assists, and 51 points. This streak was tied for 11th longest point streak in NHL history, {{and he was}} named First Star of the Month in both November and December. On January 3, 2011, Crosby was {{selected}} as a 2011 All-Star, along with teammates Evgeni Malkin, Marc-André Fleury, and Kris Letang. However, neither Crosby nor Malkin were available {{to play in the}} All-Star Game due to injuries and rookie Jeff Skinner along with Paul Stastny were named as replacements. In consecutive games — the 2011 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2011 against the Washington Capitals, and then January 5 against the Tampa Bay Lightning — Crosby suffered hits to <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> Dave Steckel and Victor Hedman, respectively. After experiencing several concussion symptoms, Crosby did not return {{for the rest of the}} regular season, and he missed the 2010–11 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Penguins were further crippled when Evgeni Malkin suffered a torn ACL and MCL, taking him out for the rest of the season. This left the Penguins without the services of their two highest scoring players. Despite Crosby's injury and subsequent absence for the final 41 games of the season, he finished as the Penguins' leading scorer. His 66 points in 41 games were 16 points ahead of the second highest team scorer, defenceman Kris Letang. In doing this, Crosby set an NHL record for fewest games played by an NHL team's points leader.|$|E

25|$|He was {{revealed}} to be Sakura's older brother, originally named Kai, and is also immortal. He hates humans for two reasons: 1) He thinks {{they are trying to}} control Sakura 2) the emperor put him in a water chamber to drown him over and over again, which eventually did drive him to what is described as insanity.

25|$|Weapons {{are linked}} to several superstitions and {{cultural}} beliefs in South Asia. Drawing a weapon without reason is forbidden and considered by Hindus to be disrespectful to the goddess Chandika. Thus the saying that a sword cannot be sheathed until it has drawn blood. It was a mother's duty to tie a warrior's sword around his waist before war or a duel. In addition, she would cut her finger with the sword and make a tilak on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> a drop of her blood. Weapons themselves were also anointed with tilak, most often from the blood of a freshly-decapitated goat (chatanga). Other taboos include looking at one's reflection in the blade, telling the price or source of acquisition, throwing {{it on the ground}} or using it for domestic purposes.|$|E
25|$|Outside of {{professional}} wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars over his head, and headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using {{his head to}} break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken {{over the side of}} his head using a sledge hammer, and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his forehead to drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal. Ferraro first discovered this ability as a teenager when, while chasing younger brother around the house during an argument, crashed head first into a large oak door.|$|E

25|$|After {{the rise}} of the being Gog, Alan Scott allies with the Justice Society members that oppose Gog's simplistic view of the world. However, after encountering a Justice Society from an {{alternate}} universe in which his daughter Jade is still alive, he considers asking the seemingly all powerful being to raise his daughter from the dead. Later, Sandman learns that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will {{no longer be able to}} survive without him. The rest of the JSA arrive to kill Gog by separating <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The Society members ally with Gog in an attempt to protect him until they see him attempt to attack a Society member. All of Gog's followers, including Magog, turn on him, causing Gog's blessing on them to be undone. The JSA are able to topple Gog and send him to the Source Wall, but Alan is unable to see his daughter.|$|E
25|$|As a defender, Cannavaro {{was known}} in {{particular}} for his concentration, anticipation, awareness and positional sense. Despite his relatively small stature for a defender, he was highly regarded for his aerial ability, courtesy of his elevation, physical strength, athleticism, timing and heading accuracy, which enabled him to outjump larger players, and made him particularly adept at defending crosses, or at scoring with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> set-pieces. Throughout his career, he {{made a name for}} himself as a dynamic, consistent, tenacious and complete defender, known for his acceleration, speed, reactions, and agility, as well as his tackling ability, and in particular, his precise sliding challenges. Due to his wide range of skills, he excelled in a zonal marking system, but was also an excellent man-marker. Nicknamed Canna ("reed"), by his former Italy defensive teammate Paolo Maldini, as a reference to his surname and mental strength, in addition to his ability as a defender, Cannavaro was also known for his leadership, determination, strong temperament and charisma, both on and off the pitch, as well as his ability to organise his defence. Cannavaro also attributes his positive character, calm composure under pressure and self-assurance in his abilities, as well as his diet, work-rate and discipline in training, as some of the key reasons for his success as a footballer, as well as his ability to inspire confidence in his teammates.|$|E
500|$|As a player, Holmes wore a {{baseball}} cap in net to protect <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> spectators spitting tobacco or throwing other objects at it. Holmes was bald, and as described by the Windsor Star, [...] "his shining bald dome presented a tempting target". Holmes played a stand-up style, and relied on proper positioning to stop the puck. Holmes' play was consistent, and he was relaxed and nonchalant in the nets, leading some to describe his play as almost lazy.|$|E

500|$|Sir Stephen Strange is {{executed}} by James, {{and his head}} put on a pike. With his magic, his spirit can still communicate in a telepathic way, allowing him to explain the warning that he received from Uatu {{now that he is}} dead and no longer bound by Uatu's original compulsion. His wife Clea takes <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the pike and sets off for America with Virginia and Rojhaz. Clea believes that Strange's suspicions were wrong: Virginia is not the Forerunner, it is her blond-haired, blue-eyed [...] "Native American" [...] companion.|$|E
500|$|While in a {{facility}} {{on the outskirts}} of Hanoi known as [...] "The Zoo", he was forced to endure a torture called [...] "the wall", in which he, as well as other prisoners, were forced to stand facing a wall in his cell with his hands above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the time a gong sounded at 5:30 in the morning until it sounded again at 10:00 at night. After two weeks, the knee injury he suffered when he ejected had worsened, and he was taken to a hospital where the infection was drained. After a two-day respite while he recuperated, [...] "the wall" [...] torture continued for two more months. Coker called this [...] "probably my worst experience in Vietnam".|$|E
500|$|He {{prefers to}} receive {{the ball in the}} air, because he can always beat smaller players in the air but they can take {{advantage}} of better acceleration and quicker reactions on the ground. According to David Pleat, a major factor in Birmingham's 2011 League Cup win was [...] "telling him to do what he does best and flick the ball on with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> direct diagonal balls played from both wings". Nevertheless, he is technically competent, scoring goals with his feet and providing assists for others. A 2009 feature in Mundo Deportivo assessed Žigić as one of those few tall players with a good touch on the ball, and in 2010, German international defender Per Mertesacker described him as [...] "technically a good player and very smart tactically".|$|E

500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, he returned to France, was trained as a pilot, and served in the French aviation corps and Captain Eddie Rickenbacker's 94th Aero Squadron. [...] He was with the 94th from November 1917 to June 1918, when he switched to the 27th Aero Squadron, where he stayed until November 1918. [...] At the 27th his duties included working at the Aircraft Acceptance Park test facility at Orly. [...] Prinz subsequently told journalists that he crashed 14 to 18 airplanes, was nicknamed [...] "America's German Ace" [...] as a result, (he was also called [...] "Crash Ace Prinz) {{and that he was}} wounded in the war and carried a silver plate in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> his last plane crash. In an October 1918 article, war correspondent George Seldes described how Prinz was separated from his flight on his first venture into German territory, and returned home with minor injuries after a perilous journey.|$|E
500|$|To lend {{a strong}} air of realism to Gordon's death, {{the scene was}} created by {{combining}} various special effects during filming with post-production visual effects. Plastic razor wire with blood tubing aided in the initial phases of the decapitation; it would slightly sink into Brown's neck as pressure was applied, forcing out the fake blood. For the aftermath, Brown laid down on the floor, and the visual effects department removed <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the shot and recreated it as a three-dimensional model. The department decided to [...] "push {{it a little bit}} farther" [...] by having the head rocking into place and the mouth twitching, but Standards and Practices found it too graphic and forced them to remove the motion. Established in the first-season episode [...] "Dead Man's Blood" [...] were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the design has been subtly improved with each vampire episode. Though the special effects makeup department used molds of the actors' mouths to create the fanged acrylic dentures, McNab noted that {{it was very difficult to}} speak while wearing them. Blood-like makeup around the actors' mouths helped to round out the vampiric visages.|$|E
500|$|Nearly 20 {{visual effects}} studios worked on Captain America: Civil War {{including}} Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Dneg, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. {{in a scene}} that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, [...] "In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age {{that we wanted to}} target, which was {{around the time of the}} film Less Than Zero [...]" [...] He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision. The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:We visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters. Method Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climatic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climatic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more [...] "classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look" [...] that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20 minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, [...] "We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them." [...] Luma Pictures, who also worked on Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's Bleeding Edge armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.|$|E
