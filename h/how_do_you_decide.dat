[...] He went on in 1993, with Dr Sam Everington of the Medical Practitioners Union to devise a project that would try and actually determine whether discrimination was real. They took two sets of application forms one with an Asian name and one with an English name. They constructed applications so that they were {{almost exactly the same}} in terms of the age of the applicant, in terms of where the applicant qualified and in terms of their experience. They then sent one application with an English name and one with an Asian name to 30 hospitals which were advertising vacancies. They found that the white applicant was twice as likely to be short-listed as the Asian applicant. As a result of complaints he and Everington were arrested and charged with making fraudulent job applications. Their paper was published in the BMJ and they were threatened by the General Medical Council with a charge of behaviour which was unbecoming of the medical profession. On further investigation they discovered that ethnic minority doctors were 6 {{times more likely to be}} brought before the Professional Conduct Committee of the General Medical Council than white doctors.|$|E

The book, which builds on stories Chang wrote as {{a correspondent for the}} Wall Street Journal (and currently garnering glowing reviews and widespread coverage), follows the lives of young rural women making new lives for themselves in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan. Susan Jakes: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>you</b> wanted {{to write a book about}} migrant workers in China? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> want to try to figure out? Was there a weakness in the existing reporting on this subject that you wanted to address? Leslie Chang: The book project began with a bit of an agenda. I had already read some stories in the foreign press, including the Wall Street Journal, about how terrible the conditions in the factories were. The stories tended to focus on the worst cases, the abuses, the miseries, the horrible bosses, the injuries. They tended to portray migration as a desperate act without much of a pay-off for people. I had a suspicion that there must be more to this, that perhaps things were not so black and white. I also thought that, for a young person coming from a farming village this whole experience in the city might appear very different than it does to us as Western observers.

Teve como objetivo apreender o sentido e o significado do corpo prÃprio do profissional de saÃde no processo de cuidar/cuidado do outro corpo prÃprio que estÃ morrendo no contexto do hospital. Optou-se por uma abordagem qualitativa, na vertente da fenomenologia existencial, a qual contempla a compreensÃo e a interpretaÃÃo do sentido, considerando o sujeito como ser histÃrico-cultural que produz o sentido e o significado do mundo percebido. Foram utilizadas entrevistas com dez profissionais definidos como sujeitos do estudo. As entrevistas foram norteadas pelas questÃes: Como vocÃ chegou a cuidar de doentes terminais? Como vocÃ sente o seu corpo cuidando dos doentes terminais? ApÃs as transcriÃÃes, os depoimentos foram analisados individualmente resgatando os temas: ConsciÃncia Perceptiva do Corpo, Espacialidade do Corpo no Mundo, Limites da ExistÃncia no Corpo. A anÃlise visou Ã reflexÃo hermenÃutica sobre o fenÃmeno, engendrando a apreensÃo do sentido e do significado: do corpo prÃprio do profissional de saÃde em uma perspectiva deste corpo como consciÃncia, que continuamente necessita ser cuidado na essÃncia da sua natureza, durante o processo de cuidar/cuidado do outro corpo prÃprio que estÃ morrendo. HÃ, portanto, um corpo prÃprio encarnado que se direciona ao mundo, a outro, elege figuras em meio a fundos, diante de possibilidades que o meio lhe oferece e posiÃÃes que o corpo toma diante deste. Quando o corpo torna-se o âponto de vista do mundoâ, em lugar de um objeto, a estrutura espaÃo-temporal da existÃncia perceptiva Ã reavivada e o pensamento objetivo em geral Ã suprimido. HÃ uma reestruturaÃÃo intencional consciente que possibilitou o desenvolvimento de tecnologia para o cuidado transdisciplinar do corpo como consciÃncia pela dinÃmica dos sentidos, utilizando o mÃtodo fenomenolÃgico existencial Ã luz de Merleau-Ponty. In this study, it is {{intended}} to understand the proper body of the health professional when taking care of the other one who is dying. Its goal was to grasp the senses and the meaning of the proper body of the health professional in the process of caring/taking care of the other proper body who is dying within the hospital context. To build intimacy room in the hospital to hear the testimonies of the health professionals about their experiences in taking care of the other one who is dying. To reach that, it was chosen to use a qualitative approach, within the existential phenomenology, which includes the understanding and the interpretation of the meaning, considering the subject as a historical-cultural being who captures the senses and the meaning of the perceived world. It was carried out interviews with ten professionals defined as subjects of study. The interviews presented mainly the following questions: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> {{to take care of the}} terminal patients? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> perceive your body when you take care of terminal patients? After the transcriptions, the testimonies were individually analyzed rescuing these themes: Perceptive Conscience of the body, the place the body occupies in the world, limits of the existence in the body. The analysis aim was the hermeneutical reflection about the phenomenon, grasping the senses and the meaning: the proper body of the health professional in a perspective of this very body as conscience, that continually needs to be taken care of. Therefore, there is a body that directs itself embodied the world, to another elected figures in the funds, before the possibilities that the medium offers and positions that the body takes on this. When the body becomes the "point of view of the world" rather than an object, the structure of space-time existence is reawakened perceptual and objective thinking is usually deleted. There is a conscious intentional restructuring that enabled the development of technology for interdisciplinary care of the body as consciousness by the dynamics of the senses, using the existential phenomenological method in the light of Merleau-Ponty...|$|R

40|$|Grammatical {{gender in}} French {{language}} {{is one of}} the biggest guessing games for a native English speaker. Why a table is feminine and a book is masculine is a question that plagues those learning French as a second language. In French, all nouns have gender, masculine and feminine. The complication: only a small percentage of the nouns are assigned gender semantically leaving the remaining which are assigned gender seemingly arbitrarily. For English native speakers, the distinction of these basic parts in a foreign language is not a natural skill. The simple fact that nouns are either feminine or masculine is troubling to students of the French language. This struggle of the English native speaker with French grammatical gender presents a valuable opportunity to study how grammatical gender is acquired. This project is a study of French grammatical gender acquisition of English native speakers. First, it examines the existing methods by which grammatical gender is acquired. The research then contrasts the acquisition of grammatical gender in second language learning to the acquisition for native French speakers. This paper then factors in the different variables that affect how grammatical gender is learned as a second language. These variables include age, level of French, motivation, type and amount of explicit review, and positive and negative feedback. I created a survey of students from high school French levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 asking them to identify the gender of a series of French nouns, some of which can be determined by gender by general rules, some exceptions, and nouns that are typically used within various contexts. This project summarizes the results as well as compares them to the students’ responses to the following: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> learn to <b>decide</b> between masculine and feminine nouns? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel about <b>how</b> well you can distinguish M/F? and What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know about masculine and feminine nouns in French? This research summarizes the pedagogy surrounding grammatical gender and its effectiveness. Processing this study thus acts as a chance to improve personal acuity with grammatical gender. Furthermore, it provides a guide for how to communicate grammatical gender in French to students. Along with the research, I provide general curricula of how to communicate grammatical gender in the French foreign language classroom. This is accompanied by complete lesson plans highlighting grammatical gender as either a focus completely on masculine vs feminine nouns, a review or frontloading activity. This paper and curricula represent the attempt to understand the many facets in the acquisition of grammatical gender in order to apply a knowledgeable approach to the instruction of grammatical gender in French...|$|R

Two experiments show that errors in testimony damage the overall credibility of witnesses who were {{confident about the}} erroneous testimony more than that of witnesses who were not confident about it. Furthermore, after making an error, less confident witnesses may appear more credible than more confident ones. Our interpretation of these results is that people make inferences about source calibration when evaluating testimony and other social communication. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> whether another person is a reliable source of information? In everyday life, you may rely on the other person’s expressions of confidence, history of accurate (and erroneous) statements, and opportunity to be well informed {{on the subject of}} the assertion, as well as on your own inferences about the person’s motives and character and, in some cases, your beliefs about his or her expertise.
