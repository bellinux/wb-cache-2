50|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{from the}} International Genealogical Index (IGI) is mixed and inconclusive. The IGI {{itself is a}} {{valuable}} but flawed resource. The current online database - which I shall term “IGI 2” - contains records contributed {{by members of the}} Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), many of which are questionable. The original pass through Britain’s parish records by LDS members was free of personal contributions and was available on microfiches in such centres as the library of the Society of Genealogists. I shall term this database “IGI 1”. This original database excluded many Catholic records, owing to the reluctance of Catholic priests to allow their records being transcribed by the LDS. It also failed to record some nonconformist register entries. Given these caveats, an examination of the 1,623 records of Ainscoughs in Lancashire in the original IGI 1 shows that the earliest recorded event was the christening of Thomas Ainscough - son of John - on 27 April 1549 in Chorley. The next was the marriage of Kateryn Aynscow to John Brindill (Katherine Ainscough & John Brindle) on 17 January 1550 in the parish of Chorley. In the same year, on 20 January and in the same parish, Richard Aynscow married “Jone Leeds”. John, Katherine and Richard may have been siblings and quite possibly were born in the 1520s. The records in IGI 1 are drawn almost exclusively from Anglican records, but these three Ainscoughs may well have come from the Lincolnshire connection.|$|E
40|$|Two {{putative}} hybrids between Kalmia and Rhododendron, their suspected progenitor {{species and}} related taxa were submitted to DNA sequencing of cpDNA trnL-F and nrDNA ITS regions {{in order to}} test whether there was DNA sequence evidence both for hybridization per se and for the direction of the cross should one be evident. Comparison of eight DNA sequences from these putative hybrids with Rhododendron and Kalmia species showed clear <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> within Rhododendron. No evidence of Kalmia DNA was detected. These putative intergeneric hybrids appear to be mutants of Rhododendron and not of hybrid origin...|$|E
40|$|Cranial {{computed}} tomography (CT) with modified temporal lobe technique, 0. 15 T {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and single photon emission {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) were carried out on 30 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Lateralising abnormalities were detected in 21 / 30 patients overall. Specific lesions were detected by CT in one patient and by MRI in seven patients (in one case bilateral). In addition CT detected asymmetry of the sylvian fissures or temporal horns in 10 patients, and MRI in eight patients. SPECT detected lateralising abnormalities in 19 patients (in five cases bilateral). It is concluded that low field MRI is superior to modified CT in demonstrating subtle structural lesions of the temporal lobe. Functional scanning with SPECT supports the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of an epileptic focus in a substantial proportion of cases and may improve the selection of patients for surgery...|$|E

40|$|Upper Precambrian diamictites in Varangerfjorden (northern Norway) {{have been}} {{examined}} for <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> whether glaciogenic, gravity flow or polygenetic. Studies of geomorphology, sedimentology and surface microtextures on quartz sand grains are integrated to provide multiple pieces of evidence for the geological agents responsible for {{the origin of the}} diamictites. The documented sedimentary and erosional structures, formerly interpreted in a glaciogenic context (e. g., diamict structure, pavements and striations) have been reanalysed. Field and laboratory data demonstrate that, contrary to conclusions reached in many earlier studies, the diamictites and adjacent deposits did not originate from glaciogenic processes. Evidence from macrostructures may occasionally be equivocal or can be interpreted as representing reworked, glacially derived material. Evidence from surface microtextures, from outcrops which are believed to exhibit the most unequivocal signs for glaciation, display no imprint at all of glaciogenic processes, and a multicyclical origin of the deposits can be demonstrated. The geological context implies (and no geological data contradict this) an origin by gravity flows, possibly in a submarine fan environment. This reinterpretation of the diamictites in northern Norway may imply that the palaeoclimatological hypothesis of a deep frozen earth during parts of the Neoproterozoic has to be revised...|$|E
40|$|Part II of this Article {{addresses}} the threshold issue of when a court may consider a medical accident {{as one that}} ordinarily does not occur {{in the absence of}} negligence. This part criticizes the blanket rejection of res ipsa loquitur in Georgia malpractice opinions. Judicial hostility toward res ipsa loquitur in these cases is based in large part on a misunderstanding of the so-called presumption of due care. This part then explains how an inference of negligence may be harmonized with traditional fault-based malpractice doctrine. Finally, this part addresses judicial concerns about the sufficiency of evidence. It is argued that circumstantial evidence of negligence is no less inherently trustworthy than direct evidence. Part III discusses the role of res ipsa loquitur in malpractice cases involving multiple defendants. It is demonstrated that the selection between a narrow or expansive use of res ipsa loquitur in this situation depends on value preferences distinct from the circumstantial <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of the doctrine. The particular value choices do not depend on whether negligence is inferable from the accident. Rather, these choices involved the broader question of what objectives underlie tort law generally. The relevant policy considerations and some of their implications are discussed in an effort to provide the framework for future decisions...|$|E
40|$|Small adenocarcinomas of the colorectum {{showing no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> from an adenoma {{have been called}} de novo carcinomas, a name that implies an origin via a {{different}} molecular genetic mechanism than the usual colorectal carcinoma which develops from an adenoma. Using microsatellite analysis, 35 early (pT 1) de novo and 36 pT 1 ex-adenoma carcinomas were compared using 8 microsatellite loci at 6 different chromosomal loci (1 p, 2 p, 8 p, 5 q, 17 p, and 18 q) known or hypothesized to be important for colorectal carcinogenesis. The rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 17 p locus (near the p 53 gene) was significantly higher in the de novo than in the ex-adenoma group (73 vs. 37 %, P = 0. 004). The rates of LOH at the other loci (including the APC and DCC genes) {{and the rate of}} MSI were not significantly different in the two groups. These results indicate that de novo carcinomas of the colorectum develop via a similar carcinogenetic pathway as conventional ex-adenoma carcinomas; however, their higher rate of LOH at 17 p is evidence for a biologically more advanced lesion with more frequent p 53 mutations, consistent with clinicopathological data indicating that de novo carcinomas are more aggressive than ex-adenoma carcinomas...|$|E

30|$|For {{a couple}} of decades, economists have been using field {{experiments}} in order to directly measure hiring discrimination in the labor markets. Strong <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> based hiring discrimination has been detected in various developed countries 1 such as Australia (Riach and Rich, 1991), the USA (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004) and France (Duguet et al., 2010, 2011). However, one of the striking observations {{that can be made}} on most of these studies concerns the proxies that are used to signal the applicants’ national origin. If it is evident that first name and surname provide a relevant signal of national origin to the recruiter, {{it is also possible that}} they provide a signal of religious closeness. This issue is widely ignored in the literature, yet there are several good reasons to believe that religion matters. Becker’s aversion theory (Becker, 1957) provides an intuitively plausible explanation for the existence of hiring discrimination based on religion. A statistical component (Phelps, 1972, Arrow 1973) might also play a role. This could occur if recruiters link religious closenesses with economic outcomes in a differential manner. Many studies indeed show that religious membership does influence economic outcomes, especially economic growth (Barro and McCleary, 2003), women’s position in the labor market (Algan and Cahuc, 2006), economic attitudes (Guiso et al., 2003) and employment prospects (Pattachini et al., 2012).|$|E
