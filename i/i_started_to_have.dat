50|$|The second stage: As soon as <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> learn, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{explore the}} {{situation}} {{in order to understand}} it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment.

50|$|Eventually, artistic {{differences}} {{created a}} power struggle between Meade and Walker. The result was Walker being asked to leave the band and Defenestration falling apart:“Todd Walker and I had the usual power struggle, and the other guys and I kicked him out,” Meade says. “When we got another guitarist, things were just awful. We started working at an algae farm because we were so broke. It was basically slave labor with 12-hour workdays at $5.00 an hour no overtime. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a breakdown.”Though he dove headfirst into to writing songs, it became apparent to Meade that the new incarnation of Defenestration was lacking something. Frustrated and demoralized, Meade packed it in and returned to Norman, where {{he took a job}} at indie shop Shadowplay Records. Defenestration was no more.|$|E
5000|$|Korine came up {{with the}} idea for the film after the release of Julien Donkey-Boy, but his drug use and general disillusionment (along with {{fund-raising}} difficulties) prolonged the process. In a February 2007 interview with Screen International, he said: [...] "I'd been making movies since I was virtually a kid, and it had always come very easily. At a certain point after the last movie, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this general disconnect from things. I was really miserable with where I was. I began to lose sight of things and people started to become more and more distant. I was burnt out, movies were what I always loved in life and I started to not care. I went deeper and deeper into a dark place and to be honest movies were the last thing I was thinking about - I didn't know if I was going to be alive. My dream was to evaporate. I was unhealthy. Whatever happened during that time, and I won't go into the details, maybe it was something I needed to go through." [...] In a 2003 interview with the New York Post, former girlfriend Chloë Sevigny revealed that the formerly straight edge Korine had become addicted to heroin and methadone while they were together, with Korine's substance abuse issues contributing to the end of their relationship.|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} {{itself was}} essentially completed in a three-week period in March 2007. [...] "The painting <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{be done in}} one go. Once <b>I</b> <b>started,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> carry on until it was finished," [...] says Hockney. [...] "The deadline wasn't the Royal Academy. The deadline was the arrival of spring, which changes things. The motif is one thing in winter, but in summer it's one solid mass of foliage - so you can't see inside and it's not as interesting to me." [...] The solution was to sketch a grid showing how the scene would fit together over 50 panels. Each individual panel was painted in situ and as they were completed his assistant, Jean-Pierre Gonçalves de Lima, would digitally photograph them and then make them into a computer mosaic. With this mosaic he could chart his progress, since he could have only six panels on the wall at any one time. Gradually, {{with the help of}} the constantly updated computer mosaic, Hockney built up the picture.|$|R

40|$|Through my Creative Non-Fiction Writing thesis, I have {{attempted}} to challenge {{the boundaries of the}} genre, after D’Agata and the works of other contemporary creative non-fiction writers. However, I have also challenged the boundaries of our own frame for reality that defines the human experience. As I began writing this, I asked myself: can we write about spaces or do we write spaces ourselves, interlacing the city into an imagined space? I didn 2 ̆ 7 t realize that I had forgotten the most important question of all: do spaces write us? These stories are predominantly about my search for “authentic” space, for the “real” city—and I have tried to challenge the idea of authenticity through the style of my writing, in addition to the narratives, lyric essays, and arguments in my thesis. I’ve lived in six cities over the past five years, and yet, each time, in the end, I return to Munich. There is something about the urban fabric there, a tear I can sense, or perhaps it is inside of me, waiting to be filled. And somewhere along the way, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this idea that I could write about this city, collecting the pieces of my experiences. I was left with a collage of moments, moments of a city that was mine—not knowing that the city is bigger than any of us, a character that cannot be captured by any means. Not knowing the impact the city might have on me...|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} a {{long and}} intense {{experience}} like a PhD in physics, there is normally a long queue of people to thank. My first thanks go to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Helmut Satz, for giving me this chance in a delicate moment of my life in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> doubts on myself.

40|$|This is a thought-‐provoking {{paper that}} makes a very simple point: follow simple rules for {{financial}} stability. Less is more. Simple rules are more robust than complicated regulation. The paper persuasively argues and presents supporting evidence that simple rules are, in most environments, more efficient at predicting crises. <b>To</b> <b>start</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make a disclosure: I fully endorse the spirit of this paper. It is generally better to use simple rules in public policy, albeit not always possible. However, my role of the discussant is not to congratulate the authors nor to emphasize features consistent with our priors, but to provide comments and questions regarding the main results of the paper. This should strengthen the case for simple rules, although {{at the end of}} my review I will conclude that implementing simple rules is quite hard to do, in particular given the complexities of financial markets. Rules today are increasingly complex, and they may be quite ineffective in preventing a financial crisis. But current problems do not necessarily come from the use of complex rules. Take just for example the case of Spain, the creator of dynami...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} about Crows over a Wheatfield, Sharp {{explained that she}} had avoided writing about legal topics for many years: “I found legal work to be a respite from writing, and writing to be an escape from legal work.” Sharp told Philadelphia Inquirer book critic Carlin Romano, “It’s almost fortuitous {{that this is a}} book with legal themes. Because when <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> write, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> characters in mind, a story…. Obviously, as a lawyer, I have very definite views about law and how women are treated. But I exorcised those demons {{in the course of my}} profession and I never really felt compelled to write about them.” [...] Sharp has noted, however, that her exposure to the dramas of court life greatly affected her writing: “You spend a lot of time as a criminal lawyer puzzling people together, making sense of their motives and figuring out how their lives’ circumstances led them down the wrong roads, or in some cases why nothing led to where they are but their own questionable selves. Watching trials also had a profound effect on how I perceived the nature of narrative authority in writing, and on my assumptions about truth itself. As a defense lawyer in any case, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> view a crime from many perspectives - the defendant’s, the victim’s, the prosecutor’s, the jurors’. You’re forced to understand, repeatedly, that a single act has multiple, contradictory meanings. From the day I watched my first trial, I was never able to write the same way again.” ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} my {{intention}} before this {{to remain in the}} West, even if I was made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain that here was the point for the commanding general to be. No one else could, probably, resist the pressure that would be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans and pursue others. I determined, therefore, before <b>I</b> <b>started</b> back <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Sherman advanced <b>to</b> my late position, McPherson to Sherman's in command of the department, and Logan to the command of McPherson's corps. These changes were all made on my recommendation and without hesitation. My commission as lieutenant-general was given to me on the 9th of March, 1864. On the following day, as already stated, I visited General Meade, commanding the Army of the Potomac, at his headquarters at Brandy Station, north of the Rapidan. I had known General Meade slightly in the Mexican war, but had not met him since until this visit. I was a stranger to most of the Army of the Potomac, I might say to all except the officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican war. There had been some changes ordered in the organization of that army before my promotion. One was the consolidation of five corps into three, thus throwing some officers of rank out of important commands. Meade evidently thought that I might want to make still one more change not yet ordered. He said to me that I might want an officer who had served with me in the West, mentioning Sherman specially, to take his place. If so, he begged me not to hesitate about making the change. He urged that the work before us was of such vast importance to the whole nation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should {{stand in the way of}} selecting the right men for all positions. For himself, he would serve to the best of his ability wherever placed. I assured him that I had no thought of substituting any one for him. As to Sherman, he could not be spared from the West.|$|R
40|$|I {{am going}} to speak tonight about the {{intersection}} of environmental justice and concepts of social wealth. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> by <b>having</b> you consider what you usually visualize {{when you think about}} the environment – likely what comes to mind is a picture of a beautiful place, pristine and protected. What comes to mind for me a place in Huntington Park, an inner ring suburb in Southern California, called la Montaña, or the mountain. This isn't a natural feature – rather, it is a pile of concrete rubble that was placed next to a neighborhood after the Northridge quake of 1994 when freeways in the area collapsed. The neighborhood residents struggled for about eight years to try to get that mountain cleaned up because it was causing respiratory and other problems. Eventually, their organizing efforts led to a change in the city council and forced a state agency to clean up their neighborhood. In my view, there is as much beauty in that group of people at La Montaña and their struggle for social justice as there is in the kind of pristine landscape that comes to mind when we generally think about the environment. We need to keep this in mind as we think through the relationship between environmental justice and social wealth; we nee...|$|R
