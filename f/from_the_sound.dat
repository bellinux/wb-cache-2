5|$|With the others, Corr has {{released}} six studio albums, two compilation albums, one remix album and two live albums. Andrea has also pursued a solo career, releasing her debut album, Ten Feet High, in 2007. The album moved away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the Corrs and features a dance-pop sound. Her next album, released on 30 May 2011, was entirely {{made up of}} covers of songs that were important to her when younger.|$|E
5|$|Jørgen Olufsen's House (Jørgen Olufsens Gård) on Østerågade is Denmark's best {{preserved}} merchant's {{mansion in}} the Renaissance style. Built mainly of sandstone in 1616, {{it also has}} a half-timbered section. The style is reminiscent of similar buildings in the north of Germany and in the Netherlands. Olufsen, Jens Bang's half brother, was not only a successful merchant but also mayor of Aalborg. When it was built, the residence with its integrated warehouse was on the Østerå, an inlet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> with access for barges.

5|$|Public {{transportation}} in Marysville and Snohomish County {{is provided by}} Community Transit. The agency operates all-day local bus service in Marysville on four routes, connecting to Smokey Point, the Tulalip Indian Reservation, Lake Stevens, Everett and Lynnwood. Community Transit also operates five commuter express routes during peak hours from park and ride facilities in Marysville to the Boeing Everett Factory, Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus. Marysville {{is one of the}} largest cities in the metro area excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit regional service area, but expressed interest in joining the regional transit authority in the 1990s. The city plans to receive Swift Bus Rapid Transit service from Community Transit by 2028, and has been listed as a candidate for future Sounder commuter rail and Link light rail service.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with Counter battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of its guns firing. A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E
5|$|When it was re-released in 1947, {{it earned}} an {{impressive}} $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, {{and was one}} of the top ten releases of the year. Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it to retain its position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as Ben-Hur, but it was finally overtaken by The Sound of Music in 1966. The 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most lucrative picture after Doctor Zhivago from the latter half of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the release, with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million, placing it second only to The Graduate for that year. Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only The Sound of Music, The Graduate and Doctor Zhivago making more for their distributors. A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> of Music, bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of 1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing the record again the following year to The Godfather.|$|E

25|$|Kerrang! is a UK-based {{magazine}} {{devoted to}} rock music, currently published by Hamburg based Bauer Media Group. It {{was first published}} on 6 June 1981 as a one-off supplement in the Sounds newspaper. Named after the onomatopoeic word that derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> made when playing a power chord on a distorted electric guitar, Kerrang! was initially devoted to {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal and the rise of hard rock acts. In the early 2000s it became the best-selling British music weekly.|$|E
25|$|The first {{practical}} application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I. In France in 1917, Paul Langevin {{and his coworkers}} developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector consisted of a transducer, made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a hydrophone to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring {{the amount of time}} it takes to hear an echo <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{location}} (see: Sound localization) {{represents the}} cognitive placement {{of a sound}} in an environmental context; including the placement of a sound on both the horizontal and vertical plane, the distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> source and {{the characteristics of the}} sonic environment. In a thick texture, it is possible to identify multiple sound sources using a combination of spatial location and timbre identification. It is the main reason why we can pick the sound of an oboe in an orchestra and the words of a single person at a cocktail party.|$|E

25|$|Juice Box Records was an {{independent}} record label in the United Kingdom, based at Riverside Studios in West London. It {{was established by}} Simpson in 1992, after he left SME Records, and closed in 1998. It took its name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> system that Simpson operated with MC Tunes. The label provided an outlet for seven years for Simpson's work, with thirty three titles released under various other pseudonyms such as The K.G.B. and Ricky Rouge, and collaborations between Simpson and artists including Lisa May, DJ Tamsin, Goldie (as 'The 2 G's'), and Finley Quaye.|$|E
25|$|Scratch bands, {{also known}} as fungi bands and {{formerly}} string bands, are a distinctive form of folk ensemble; they have survived the decline of other Virgin Islander folk traditions, through adapting to newly imported instrumentation and songs, and becoming {{a part of a}} more general revival of interest in folk culture on the islands. The name scratch band may derive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> produced by scraping the squash, an instrument similar to the Puerto Rican guiro, but larger, or from the word squash itself, used to refer to the bands first by American visitors and then by locals.|$|E

40|$|In old {{researches}} about music, it {{has been}} clarified that music basically belongs to the nature and, consequently, natural elements.

Through research in old mythological narrations, and literary texts, one could assume an intrinsic relationship between music and such sweet-singing mythological birds as phoenix, sphinx, Song-song, holy birds like Kership-tah, and other birds including swan and ring dove...|$|R
25|$|Early in {{the evening}} of March 31, 1865, Union V Corps commander, Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, {{recognized}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of battle that Sheridan's cavalry was being pushed back at Dinwiddie Court House and sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade to reinforce Sheridan. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been wrecked by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan.|$|E
25|$|Strings were {{historically}} made {{of animal}} gut, usually {{from the small}} intestine of sheep (sometimes in combination with metal) and are still made of gut or a synthetic substitute, with metal windings on the lower-pitched strings. Modern manufacturers make both gut and nylon strings, and both are in common use. Gut is more authentic for playing period pieces, though unfortunately it is also more susceptible to irregularity and pitch instability due to changes in humidity. Nylon offers greater tuning stability, but is seen as anachronistic by purists, as its timbre differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of earlier gut strings. Such concerns are moot when more recent compositions for the lute are performed.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Kelly joined Universal Pictures for {{a two-year}} stint. He joined 20th Century Fox in 1965 but {{had little to}} do—partly due to his {{decision}} to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons. His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit A Guide for the Married Man (1967) where he directed Walter Matthau. Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox – buoyed by the returns <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> of Music (1965) – commissioned Kelly to direct Hello, Dolly! (1969), again directing Matthau along with Barbra Streisand. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won three.|$|E
