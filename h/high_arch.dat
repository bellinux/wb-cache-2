But for general service the gable is the proper and natural form, and may be taken as representative of the rest. Then this gable may either project unsupported from the wall, a, Fig. XLVIII., or be carried by brackets or spurs, b, or by walls or shafts, c, which shafts or walls may themselves be, in windows, carried on a sill; and this, in its turn, supported by brackets or spurs.

Let us watch the sun for a moment as it climbs: when it is a quarter up, it will give us the arch a, Fig. XXXI.; when it is half up, b, and when three quarters up, c. There will be an infinite number of arches between these, but we will take these as sufficient representatives of all.

40|$|Differences in the {{location}} and incidence of lower extremity injuries have been reported between <b>high</b> and low <b>arched</b> individuals. These differences {{might be related to}} functional differences between the two foot types. In particular, the characteristics of the medial longitudinal arch may influence foot function. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate forefoot and rearfoot kinematics as well as tibial shock in participants with both <b>high</b> and low <b>arches.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifteen <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> and 15 low arched males were recruited. Tibial acceleration as well as forefoot, rearfoot and shank kinematic data were collected as participants ran at 3. 5 m/s wearing gait sandals. Variables of interest included peak tibial acceleration in addition to rearfoot eversion excursion, forefoot eversion excursion, forefoot eversion velocity, forefoot abduction excursion and forefoot abduction velocity. MANOVA and effect sizes were used to investigate kinematic differences between groups. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed that foot type had an effect on the kinematic variables of interest (p = 0. 04). Forefoot abduction excursion (<b>High</b> <b>arched</b> = 4. 7 ± 1. 3 degrees, Low arched 3. 8 ± 1. 0 degrees) and forefoot abduction velocity (<b>High</b> <b>arched</b> = 96. 0 ± 24. 8 degrees/s, Low arched = 69. 3 ± 13. 3 degrees/s) were greater in the <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> group. Tibial shock (p = 0. 24) and other kinematic variables were similar between groups. Conclusion: Clear evidence of forefoot and rearfoot motion as a shock attenuation mechanism was not found. Differences in the foot kinematics during early stance were highlighted by a smaller forefoot abduction excursion and reduced forefoot abduction velocity in low <b>arched</b> compared to <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> individuals. It is suggested that low arched feet may have a reduced available range of motion through which the forefoot can pass before reaching the end range of motion point. Clinical Relevance: Foot kinematics during early stance warrant further investigation to establish a specific link to injury risk...|$|R

And they sat at the head of that valley and they gazed down for some while thereinto, and they beheld that valley with great joy because it was so fair and fruitful. For in it were several meadow-lands, all smiling with verdure, and there were many fields of growing corn, and these fields and meadows rose ever upward until they cut against the sky, as smooth with fertility as though carved out with the edge of a sharp keen knife. And beside the river were banks of reeds and rushes and pollard willows and thickets of alder and aspen. And the broad highroad followed the course of the stream and there were several mills in the valley and broad ponds of water with bosky trees and with houses clustered upon the banks thereof.

[...] When on the goddess first I cast my sight, [...] Scarce seemed her stature of a cubit's height;[95] [...] But swelled to larger size, the more I gazed, [...] 260 [...] Till to the roof her tow'ring front she raised. [...] With her, the temple ev'ry moment grew, [...] And ampler vistas opened to my view: [...] Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend, [...] And arches widen, and long aisles extend.[96] [...] 265 [...] Such was her form, as ancient bards have told, [...] Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold; [...] A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears, [...] And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears.[97] [...] Beneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine [...] 270 [...] (Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine.[98] [...] With eyes on Fame for ever fixed, they sing; [...] For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string; [...] With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays, [...] And last, eternal, through the length of days. [...] 275 [...] Around these wonders as I cast a look, [...] The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook, [...] And all the nations, summoned at the call, [...] From diff'rent quarters fill the crowded hall: [...] Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard; [...] 280 [...] In various garbs promiscuous throngs appeared;[99] [...] Thick as the bees that with the spring renew [...] Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew, [...] When the winged colonies first tempt the sky, [...] O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly, [...] 285 [...] Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield, [...] And a low murmur runs along the field.[100] [...] Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend, [...] And all degrees before the goddess bend;[101] [...] The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage, [...] 290 [...] And boasting youth, and narrative old age.[102] [...] Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same: [...] For good and bad alike are fond of fame. [...] Some she disgraced, and some with honours crowned;[103] [...] Unlike successes equal merits found.[104] [...] 295 [...] Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns, [...] And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains. [...] First at the shrine the learned world appear, [...] And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer. [...] Long have we sought t' instruct and please mankind, [...] 300 [...] With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind; [...] But thanked by few, rewarded yet by none, [...] We here appeal to thy superior throne: [...] On wit and learning the just prize bestow, [...] For fame is all we must expect below. [...] 305 [...] The goddess heard, and bade the muses raise [...] The golden trumpet of eternal praise:[105] [...] From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound, [...] That fills the circuit of the world around; [...] Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud; [...] 310 [...] The notes at first were rather sweet than loud: [...] By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise, [...] Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies, [...] At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed, [...] Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;[106] [...] 315 [...] Less fragrant scents th' unfolding rose exhales, [...] Or spices breathing in Arabian gales. [...] Next these the good and just, an awful train, [...] Thus on their knees address the sacred fane. [...] Since living virtue is with envy cursed, [...] 320 [...] And the best men are treated like the worst, [...] Do thou, just goddess, call our merits forth, [...] And give each deed th' exact intrinsic worth.[107] [...] Not with bare justice shall your act be crowned, [...] (Said Fame,) but high above desert renowned:[108] [...] 325 [...] Let fuller notes th' applauding world amaze, [...] And the loud clarion labour in your praise. [...] This band dismissed, behold another crowd [...] Preferred the same request, and lowly bowed; [...] The constant tenour of whose well spent days [...] 330 [...] No less deserved a just return of praise. [...] But straight the direful trump of slander sounds; [...] Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds; [...] Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies, [...] The dire report through ev'ry region flies, [...] 335 [...] In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung, [...] And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue. [...] From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke [...] Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:[109] [...] The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies, [...] 340 [...] And withers all before it as it flies. [...] A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore, [...] And proud defiance in their looks they bore: [...] For thee, (they cried,) amidst alarms and strife, [...] We sailed in tempests down the stream of life; [...] 345 [...] For thee whole nations filled with flames and blood, [...] And swam to empire through the purple flood. [...] Those ills we dared, thy inspiration own, [...] What virtue seemed, was done for thee alone. [...] Ambitious fools! (the queen replied, and frowned) [...] 350 [...] Be all your acts in dark oblivion drowned; [...] There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone, [...] Your statues mouldered, and your names unknown![110] [...] A sudden cloud straight snatched them from my sight, [...] And each majestic phantom sunk in night. [...] 355 [...] Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen; [...] Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien. [...] Great idol of mankind! we neither claim [...] The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame! [...] But safe in deserts from th' applause of men, [...] 360 [...] Would die unheard of, as we lived unseen; [...] 'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight [...] Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite. [...] O let us still the secret joy partake, [...] To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake.[111] [...] 365 [...] And live there men, who slight immortal fame? [...] Who then with incense shall adore our name? [...] But, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride [...] To blaze those virtues, which the good would hide. [...] Rise! muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath, [...] 370 [...] These must not sleep in darkness and in death. [...] She said: in air the trembling music floats, [...] And on the winds triumphant swell the notes:[112] [...] So soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,[113] [...] Ev'n list'ning angels leaned from heav'n to hear: [...] 375 [...] To farthest shores th' ambrosial spirit flies, [...] Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies. [...] Next these, a youthful train their vows expressed,[114] [...] With feathers crowned, with gay embroid'ry dress'd, [...] Hither, they cried, direct your eyes, and see [...] 380 [...] The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry; [...] Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays, [...] Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days; [...] Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care [...] To pay due visits, and address the fair: [...] 385 [...] In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade, [...] But still in fancy vanquished ev'ry maid; [...] Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell, [...] Yet, would the world believe us, all were well. [...] The joy let others have, and we the name, [...] 390 [...] And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.[115] [...] The queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies, [...] And at each blast a lady's honour dies.[116] [...] Pleased with the strange success, vast numbers pressed [...] Around the shrine, and made the same request: [...] 395 [...] What! you (she cried) unlearn'd in arts to please, [...] Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigued with ease,[117] [...] Who lose a length of undeserving days, [...] Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise? [...] To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall, [...] 400 [...] The people's fable, and the scorn of all. [...] Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound, [...] Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round, [...] Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud, [...] And scornful hisses run through all the crowd. [...] 405 [...] Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done, [...] Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;[118] [...] Or who their glory's dire foundation laid [...] On sov'reigns ruined, or on friends betrayed;[119] [...] Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix, [...] 410 [...] Of crooked counsels and dark politics; [...] Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne, [...] And beg to make th' immortal treasons known. [...] The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire, [...] With sparks, that seemed to set the world on fire. [...] 415 [...] At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast, [...] And startled nature trembled with the blast. [...] This having heard and seen, some pow'r unknown [...] Straight changed the scene, and snatched me from the throne.[120] [...] Before my view appeared a structure fair, [...] 420 [...] Its site uncertain, if in earth or air; [...] With rapid motion turned the mansion round; [...] With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound; [...] Not less in number were the spacious doors, [...] Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores; [...] 425 [...] Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day, [...] Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way. [...] As flames by nature to the skies ascend,[121] [...] As weighty bodies to the centre tend, [...] As to the sea returning rivers roll, [...] 430 [...] And the touched needle trembles to the pole; [...] Hither, as to their proper place, arise [...] All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies, [...] Or spoke aloud, or whispered in the ear; [...] Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here. [...] 435 [...] As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes [...] The sinking stone at first a circle makes; [...] The trembling surface, by the motion stirred, [...] Spreads in a second circle, then a third; [...] Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance, [...] 440 [...] Fill all the wat'ry plain, and to the margin dance: [...] Thus ev'ry voice and sound, when first they break, [...] On neighb'ring air a soft impression make; [...] Another ambient circle then they move; [...] That, in its turn, impels the next above;[122] [...] 445 [...] Through undulating[123] air the sounds are sent, [...] And spread o'er all the fluid element. [...] There, various news I heard of love and strife, [...] Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life, [...] Of loss and gain, of famine, and of store, [...] 450 [...] Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore, [...] Of prodigies, and portents seen in air, [...] Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair, [...] Of turns of fortune, changes in the state, [...] The falls of fav'rites, projects of the great, [...] 455 [...] Of old mismanagements, taxations new:[124] [...] All neither wholly false, nor wholly true. [...] Above, below, without, within, around, [...] Confused, unnumbered, multitudes are found, [...] Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away; [...] 460 [...] Hosts raised by fear, and phantoms of a day: [...] Astrologers, that future fates foreshew, [...] Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few; [...] And priests, and party-zealots, num'rous bands [...] With home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands; [...] 465 [...] Each talked aloud, or in some secret place, [...] And wild impatience stared in ev'ry face.[125] [...] The flying rumours gathered as they rolled, [...] Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told; [...] And all who told it added something new, [...] } [...] 470 [...] And all who heard it, made enlargements too; [...] } [...] In ev'ry ear it spread, on ev'ry tongue it grew. } [...] Thus flying east and west, and north and south, [...] News travelled with increase from mouth to mouth. [...] So from a spark, that kindled first by chance, [...] 475 [...] With gath'ring force the quick'ning flames advance;[126] [...] Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire, [...] And tow'rs and temples sink in floods of fire. [...] When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung, [...] Full grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue, [...] 480 [...] Through thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow, [...] And rush in millions on the world below. [...] Fame sits aloft,[127] and points them out their course, [...] Their date determines, and prescribes their force; [...] Some to remain, and some to perish soon; [...] 485 [...] Or wane and wax, alternate, like the moon. [...] Around, a thousand winged wonders fly, [...] Borne by the trumpet's blast, and scattered through the sky. [...] There, at one passage, oft you might survey, [...] A lie and truth contending for the way; [...] 490 [...] And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent, [...] Which first should issue through the narrow vent: [...] At last agreed, together out they fly, [...] Inseparable now, the truth and lie;[128] [...] The strict companions are for ever joined, [...] 495 [...] And this or that unmixed, no mortal e'er shall find. [...] While thus I stood, intent to see and hear, [...] One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:[129] [...] What could thus high thy rash ambition raise? [...] Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise? [...] 500 [...] 'Tis true, said I, not void of hopes I came, [...] For who so fond as youthful bards of fame? [...] But few, alas! the casual blessing boast, [...] So hard to gain, so easy to be lost.[130] [...] How vain that second life in others' breath, [...] 505 [...] Th' estate which wits inherit after death![131] [...] Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign; [...] Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine! [...] The great man's curse, without the gains, endure, [...] Be envied, wretched, and be flattered, poor; [...] 510 [...] All luckless wits their enemies professed, [...] And all successful, jealous friends at best. [...] Nor fame I slight, nor for her favours call; [...] She comes unlooked for, if she comes at all. [...] But if the purchase cost so dear a price, [...] 515 [...] As soothing folly, or exalting vice; [...] Oh! if the muse must flatter lawless sway, [...] And follow still where fortune leads the way;[132] [...] Or if no basis bear my rising name, [...] But the fall'n ruins of another's fame; [...] 520 [...] Then teach me, heav'n! to scorn the guilty bays; [...] Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise; [...] Unblemished let me live, or die unknown; [...] Oh! grant an honest fame, or grant me none! ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryCiliopathies are a broad {{class of}} human {{disorders}} with craniofacial dysmorphology {{as a common}} feature. Among these is <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> palate, a condition that affects speech and quality of life. Using the ciliopathic Fuz mutant mouse, we find that <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> palate does not, as commonly suggested, arise from midface hypoplasia. Rather, increased neural crest expands the maxillary primordia. In Fuz mutants, this phenotype stems from dysregulated Gli processing, which in turn results in excessive craniofacial Fgf 8 gene expression. Accordingly, genetic reduction of Fgf 8 ameliorates the maxillary phenotypes. Similar phenotypes result from mutation of oral-facial-digital syndrome 1 (Ofd 1), suggesting that aberrant transcription of Fgf 8 is a common feature of ciliopathies. <b>High</b> <b>arched</b> palate is also a prevalent feature of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) hyperactivation syndromes. Thus, our findings elucidate the etiology for a common craniofacial anomaly and identify links between two classes of human disease: FGF-hyperactivation syndromes and ciliopathies...|$|R
5000|$|Studies {{analyzing}} {{the correlation between}} flat feet and physical injury in soldiers have been inconclusive, but none suggests that flat feet are an impediment, at least in soldiers who {{reached the age of}} military recruitment without prior foot problems. Instead, in this population, there is a suggestion of more injury in <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> feet. A 2005 study of Royal Australian Air Force recruits that tracked the recruits over the course of their basic training found that neither flat feet nor <b>high</b> <b>arched</b> feet had any impact on physical functioning, injury rates or foot health. If anything, there was a tendency for those with flat feet to have fewer injuries. [...] Another study of 295 Israel Defense Forces recruits found that those with <b>high</b> <b>arches</b> suffered almost four times as many stress fractures as those with the lowest arches. A later study of 449 U.S. Navy special warfare trainees found {{no significant difference in the}} incidence of stress fractures among sailors and Marines with different arch heights.|$|R
