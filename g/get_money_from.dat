5|$|As {{part of a}} plot to {{discredit}} both Dart {{and the government of}} Texas, Edwards persuaded some abolitionists in Cincinnati to give him money with which he would supposedly liberate the slaves on his plantation in Texas, which he no longer owned. Edwards also tried to <b>get</b> <b>money</b> <b>from</b> the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in New York, but its leader, Lewis Tappan, did not trust him and no money was forthcoming from that source. Edwards then went to England, bearing forged letters of introduction from, among others, Daniel Webster and the American Secretary of State, John Forsyth. One of these letters was to Lord Spencer, who was so impressed he gave Edwards £250 as a loan. While in England, Edwards defrauded a company in Liverpool of about $20,000, and then used part of the funds to repay Lord Spencer. The Republic of Texas ambassador in London warned the English government against Edwards. Tappan also sent warnings, so Edwards was unable to acquire more money in England and had returned to the United States by June 1841.|$|E
5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's business group is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to <b>get</b> <b>money</b> <b>from</b> his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E

500|$|Their Child is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film begins with Ellen Stokes whose extravagant lifestyle is outside {{the means of the}} family. While their only son is hosting a birthday party, the husband informs Ellen that they are financially ruined because of her. Ellen attempts to <b>get</b> <b>money</b> <b>from</b> her uncle, who refuses, and a friend of the family soon comes to her aid with a loan.

The film was released on October 21, 1910, and was met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Uribe was {{alleged to}} have been {{involved}} in a shooting in his native Dominican Republic. A farmer named Antonio Gonzalez Perez accused Uribe of wounding him with a pellet gun. Despite claims by the San Cristóbal Province District Attorney that there was no firm evidence that Uribe was involved in the incident, a judge decided to press forward with the case. Although a defense motion to bar him from leaving the country was rejected, it was ruled on January 5, 2007, that Uribe must appear before a court on the 15 and the 30 of every month until the case was resolved. Uribe, who denied any involvement in the case, suggested that he might not play baseball until the legal proceedings were concluded. He was confident that he would win in court, and the White Sox expected him to be free for spring training. In February, his name was cleared of any involvement with the shooting, and the court ruled he no longer had to appear on the 15 and 30 of every month. Uribe called the incident [...] "blackmail", saying it was an attempt by Perez to <b>get</b> <b>money</b> <b>from</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several years, the Métis, unhappy with the Canadian government's {{handling}} of their land rights, move farther west across the Prairies. [...] There as well, they see their petitions to the government repeatedly ignored and their rights trampled on. [...] Finally, after being ignored for too long, the Métis search for Riel in Montana, {{in the hope that}} his return will force the Canadians to take their claims seriously. [...] He is reluctant at first, as he has started a family and settled down as a schoolmaster. [...] In the hopes that he will <b>get</b> <b>money</b> <b>from</b> the Canadian government for his tenure administering the Red River settlement (by this time known as Winnipeg), he moves his family to Batoche (now in Saskatchewan) in mid-1884. [...] Macdonald has returned to the prime ministership and conspires with George Stephen, president of the financially burdened Canadian Pacific Railway, to use the situation to gain support for finishing the railway. [...] By inciting a violent revolt amongst the Métis, the government can justify funding the railway to move troops to the Prairies. [...] The Métis under Riel respond with arms as intended. [...] Riel declares [...] "Rome has fallen!" [...] and breaks from the Catholic Church. [...] He breathes the Holy Spirit into his followers, thereafter known as the Exovedate. [...] Tensions build until the bloodshed at the Battle of Duck Lake, where Riel and his followers drive back the North-West Mounted Police. [...] Macdonald takes this as a cue to send two thousand troops to the area. [...] At the Battle of Fish Creek, the outnumbered Métis manage to drive back the Canadians, but at the Battle of Batoche, while Riel is increasingly immersed in religious activities, the Métis finally suffer defeat. [...] In the hope that his trial will provide an opportunity to get the Métis' story to the public, Riel surrenders instead of fleeing.|$|E

In 1990, the Daily Mirror and TV programme The Cook Report claimed that Scargill and the NUM had received money from the Libyan government.

2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to the people who do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to <b>get</b> <b>money</b> <b>from</b> people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
