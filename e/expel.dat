5|$|After {{the victory}} at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking {{the beginning of a new}} phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would <b>expel</b> (or help <b>expel)</b> the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to <b>expel</b> Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E
50|$|If a student(s) {{has been}} <b>expelled</b> from two schools, then any state school is legally allowed to refuse {{admittance}} of that student. (Schools on special measures may refuse to admit {{a student who}} has been <b>expelled</b> from only one school.) Therefore, a student who has been <b>expelled</b> from two schools might be totally removed from the state education system. As a result, it is rare for a pupil to be <b>expelled</b> (or permanently excluded) in the UK's state sector.|$|R

Burton resigned from office on June 4, 1906, before the Senate could act.|$|E
5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use grass {{as a source of}} folic acid.

5|$|Gosiewski {{ordered the}} use of fire to <b>expel</b> the Russian opponents; the fires caused the death of 60,000 people in Moscow.

5|$|In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform, {{the purpose}} of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the {{international}} communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc. Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin Split obliged its members to <b>expel</b> Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Nordic {{countries}} placed {{pressure on}} the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) to <b>expel</b> the South African Movement for its racial policies. South African Scouting responded to this by combining all branches of the Movement into a single Boy Scouts of South Africa organisation at a conference known as Quo Vadis that was held on 2 July 1977.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile Enver, still {{fearing that}} the Russians {{would accept the}} Ottoman apology, decided to interfere. Just before the message was sent, he {{inserted}} a passage that accused the Russians of instigating the conflict. On 1 November the message arrived in Petrograd. Foreign Minister Sazonov responded with an ultimatum, demanding that the Ottomans <b>expel</b> the German military mission. The Ottomans rejected this proposal.|$|E
5|$|There is {{consensus}} among military historians that the Battle at Sedan sealed {{the fate of}} Belgium and France. On 14 May, the Allied forces had been wrongfooted and through the failures in deployment had effectively lost the campaign.

5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{changes of}} more than 1–2°C (1.8–3.6°F) or salinity changes can kill some species of coral. Under such environmental stresses, corals <b>expel</b> their Symbiodinium; without them coral tissues reveal the white of their skeletons, an event known as coral bleaching.|$|E

40|$|An <b>expelling</b> {{machine was}} {{developed}} for extracting oil from decorticated sunflower seeds. The <b>expelling</b> unit consists of an auger with decreasing pitches and the heating of seeds is achieved by generated steam, which heats the surrounding of seeds passage. The machine was tested at auger speeds of 30, 40, 50 rpm respectively and three throughputs. Results showed that performance efficiencies increased with auger speed and throughput. <b>Expelling</b> efficiency of over 70 % was obtained. The machine has <b>expelling</b> capacity of 24. 4 litres/hr. of oil and throughput capacity of 502. 64 kg/day...|$|R

5|$|When Ellis {{was caught}} {{drinking}} and smoking marijuana {{in a high school}} bathroom during his senior year, the school agreed not to <b>expel</b> him if he agreed to play for the school's baseball team. He appeared in four games and was named all-league. Ellis then attended Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC), a junior college.|$|E
5|$|When {{people with}} active {{pulmonary}} TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they <b>expel</b> infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 µm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each {{one of these}} droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).|$|E
5|$|After being {{contacted}} by Dean, Castiel, now wearing a new suit and trenchcoat and driving a stolen car {{as he can}} no longer teleport, returns to the bunker where he comes up with the plan to have Crowley help <b>expel</b> Gadreel from Sam. Castiel knocks Gadreel out and comforts Dean when the torture they have Crowley perform to bring forth Sam's mind proves too much for Dean. Castiel is furious to learn that it is Gadreel, blaming him for all the evil in the universe, but Dean calms him down. When Gadreel proves resistant to their efforts to <b>expel</b> him, Dean tries to have Castiel possess Sam to let him know of the situation but he can't without Sam's permission. Crowley agrees to do it instead in exchange for his freedom and though Castiel is reluctant, he removes Sam's anti-possession tattoo. The plan works and Sam expels Gadreel. After leaving Crowley to deal with Abaddon, Castiel heals Sam's injuries from the torture and informs him he can finish his healing from the Trials over time as Gadreel did most of the job. He remains behind with Sam as Dean leaves on his own.|$|E
50|$|Like many Maoist organisations, the RCL was {{regularly}} convulsed {{by internal}} disputes and splits.

Later, the organisation's first chairman was <b>expelled.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{crossbred}} fmishing gilts (initial weight = 150 lb) {{were used}} to evaluate the effects of feeding <b>expelled</b> soybean meal (41 % analyzed CP) or conventionally extracted soybean meal (46. 5 % analyzed CP) on growth performance. Gilts were fed a control diet containing conventionally processed soybean meal or diets containing <b>expelled</b> soybean meal formulated to replace conventionally extracted soybean meal on either a guaranteed protein basis or an analyzed protein basis. Thus, the effects of possible variation in the protein content and quality of <b>expelled</b> soybean meal as a result of expeller processing could be established. Gilts fed either diet containing <b>expelled</b> soybean meal had decreased average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) and tended to have poorer feed efficiency (FIG) than gilts fed conventionally processed soybean meal. Although not statistically different, gilts fed the <b>expelled</b> soybean meal diet formulated on a guaranteed protein content basis tended to have poorer ADG than those fed the <b>expelled</b> soybean meal formulated on an analyzed protein content. These results suggest that improper processing and the potential variation present in <b>expelled</b> soybean meal used in this experiment resulted in decreased pig performance...|$|R
