5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, unlike the YF-23, weapon firings and high (60°) {{angle of attack}} (AoA, or high-Alpha) flights were carried out on the YF-22. Though not a requirement, the {{aircraft}} fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays. <b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F-16 at low-speed maneuvering. The first prototype, PAV-1, achieved Mach1.58 in supercruise, while PAV-2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach1.43; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0. <b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> continued until 28December1990, by which time 74 flights were completed and 91.6 airborne hours were accumulated. Following <b>flight</b> <b>testing,</b> the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production.|$|E

5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{the serial}} number 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a {{seaplane}} took place that December. <b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability; {{the addition of a}} large ventral fin, connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E

Since the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> was officially started on October 29, AC105 has successively conducted 83 flights in the routes among ten airports in Chengdu, Guiyang, Guilin, Haikou, Fuzhou, Zhoushan, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Yinchuan and Xianyang to simulate operations in routes. The cumulative flight time was 173 hours and 55 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the scope}} of <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> {{engineering}} efforts may vary among organizations, all point to a common theme: <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineering is an interdisciplinary effort to test an asset in its operational flight environment. Upfront planning where design, implementation, and test efforts are clearly aligned with the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> objective are keys to success. This chapter provides a top level perspective of <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineering for the non-expert.

5|$|Due to delays with {{delivery}} of jet engines {{and production of}} the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied. This proved problematic later.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings. <b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials. During 1990–1991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in ground effect. As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E

5|$|As the USMC {{wanted a}} {{substantially}} improved Harrier without {{the development of}} a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in 1976. The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with <b>flight</b> <b>testing.</b> McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes. Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer. The aircraft performed three vertical take-offs and hovered for seven minutes at Lambert–St. Louis International Airport. The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979, but crashed that November due to engine flameout; the pilot ejected safely. <b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> of these modified AV-8s continued into 1979. The results showed greater than expected drag, hampering the aircraft's maximum speed. Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement. Positive test results in other areas, including payload, range, and V/STOL performance, led to the award of a development contract in 1979. The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially, followed by a further 324.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anticipated}} efficiency gains and development work, Airbus {{announced that the}} new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that {{the weight of the}} modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits. Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>testing</b> of the XF-104s {{began with}} the first flight in March 1954, encountering several problems, {{some of which were}} resolved; however, {{performance}} of the XF-104 proved better than estimates and despite both prototypes being lost through accidents, the USAF ordered 17 service-test/pre-production YF-104As. Production Starfighters proved popular, both with the USAF and internationally, serving with a number of countries, including Jordan, Turkey, and Japan.|$|E
50|$|Other prototypes {{will undergo}} other systems tests until the {{satisfaction}} of the regulators.

5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> of the prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as}} two auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the directional stability of the aircraft. The fuselage was lengthened to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal stabilizer {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|On 15May 1930, barely {{two weeks}} after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to {{structural}} failure while performing an inverted loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member had done so in an emergency.

5|$|Originally {{designed}} as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it. Development was then {{taken up by the}} U.S. Army for a tactical combat aircraft requirement, a sort of high-performance helicopter. In <b>flight</b> <b>testing,</b> the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> of this system.
