The Paris {{newspaper}} Le Monde reports that it is made from chicken livers, <b>fresh</b> <b>thyme</b> and thyme flowers, full cream, white Dijon mustard, butter, and water, plus salt and pepper. According to Le Monde, the chicken livers are blanched in one pan with the thyme until they start to turn colour.

The chicken livers are then finely minced and pressed through a strainer into the reduced cream.

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} various plant extracts on Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from spoiled chilled tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) was evaluated in this study. In {{the first stage}} of this study, red tilapia was subjected to chilled storage (4 °C) for 3 weeks, and spoilage bacteria were isolated and identified from the spoiled fish. Pseudomonas was the dominant bacteria isolated from the spoiled fish and further identification revealed that P. putida, P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas spp. were the main species of this group. In the second stage, methanolic extracts of 15 selected plant species were screened for their antimicrobial activity, by agar disc diffusion method, against the Pseudomonas isolates. Results indicated that most of the extracts had different degrees of activity against the bacterial isolates. The strongest activity was exhibited by bottlebrush flower (Callistemon viminalis) extract. This was followed by extracts from guava bark (Psidium guajava) and henna leaf (Lawsonia inermis).

40|$|Background: Because of {{increasing}} resistance to current antibiotics, many {{attempts have been}} made by the researchers to find new compounds of plant derivatives as substitute for non-effective antibiotics. This research was performed to study the antibacterial properties of aquatic and alcoholic extracts of thyme on the clinical and standard strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Material and methods: After drying, the <b>thyme</b> <b>leaves</b> were added to ethanol 85 º and distilled water separately. Then the compounds of plant were extracted by distillation method. The antibacterial properties of extracts were investigated by tube dilution method in broth media. By using different concentrations of the extracts, MIC & MBC were determined and equal amounts of these concentrations were added to excavated wells in Mueller – Hinton agar. Then the mean diameter of growth inhibition zones for extracts and strains were compared. Results: Certain concentrations of the alcoholic extract showed significant antibacterial effect. Alcoholic extract with 0. 780 mg/ml showed growth inhibitory effect and bactericidal effect on strains, whereas the aquatic extract didn’t show any effect on the given strains. Conclusion: Some of the concentrations of the alcoholic extract showed pronounced antibacterial activity on the strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli but it is necessary to do more studies on its antibacterial effects...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} to study {{the changes in the}} content and composition of chlorophylls and carotenoids in ground <b>thyme</b> <b>leaves</b> as a function of supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane extraction. the results indicated that the maximum oleoresin yield could be obtained with supercritical carbon dioxide at 400 bar and 35 or 55 °C and sub-critical propane at 50 bar. Pigment solvating capacity of supercritical carbon dioxide increased with the increase of extraction pressure. Substantial variation was noticed in pigment composition between raw material, oleoresin and residues (powders after extraction). Chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a and the Mg-free derivatives were the dominant pigments in the raw material with other derivatives being minor constituents. After extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide at 35 °C and pressures higher than 200 bar, epimerisation and oxidation of chlorophylls lead to marked accumulation of artefacts in the residues. The content of oxidized chlorophylls was increased proportionally to the increase of the extraction pressure. The brownish green coloured-oleoresins contained only pheophytins indicating that rapid substitution of Mg with hydrogen atoms on the molecules takes place during extraction of such pigment by supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane. The marked conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytins was found in oleoresin extracted by supercritical fluid extraction at 55 °C and 100 bar...|$|R

40|$|Thymus daenensis, a {{perennial}} herb, is often grown {{in areas that}} experience drought conditions during its growing period.

The interactive effects of foliar application of chitosan and drought stress on dry matter, essential oil yield, and selected physiological characteristics including photosynthetic pigments, osmotic adjustment, and lipid peroxidation of Thymus were investigated in a two-year study from 2014 to 2015. Treatments consisted of 0, 200, and 400  μL L− 1 chitosan applied to plants grown under field capacity, mild drought stress (50 % field capacity), and severe drought stress (25 % field capacity). Dry matter yield decreased substantially as drought stress intensified. However, essential oil content increased under stress conditions, with the highest essential oil yield obtained from plants under mild drought stress. Foliar application of chitosan compensated to some extent for dry matter and oil yield reduction of plants grown under drought stress. The highest essential oil yield (1. 52  g plant− 1) was obtained by application of 400  μL L− 1 chitosan under the mild stress condition in 2015 when plants were mature.
