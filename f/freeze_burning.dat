The lesions are usually, but not always, made in the frontal lobes. Tissue may be destroyed by cutting, <b>burning,</b> <b>freezing,</b> electric current or radiation.|$|R

But he had great faith in Rose's good sense, and it never occurred to him that she was making a little Casabianca of herself, with the difference of <b>freezing</b> instead of <b>burning</b> at her post.|$|R
5000|$|A blister {{is a small}} {{pocket of}} body fluid (lymph, serum, plasma, blood, or pus) within the upper layers of the skin, {{typically}} caused by forceful rubbing (friction), <b>burning,</b> <b>freezing,</b> chemical exposure or infection. Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid, either serum or plasma. However, blisters can be filled with blood (known as [...] "blood blisters") or with pus (if they become infected).|$|R
30|$|Human {{life without}} access to plants and {{bacteria}} would be miserable. Plants and bacteria, which have existed for billions of years, have often robust protection system, {{which can be used}} by humans. Our Palaeolithic forefathers did on annual basis receive their daily food from at least five hundred plants and also, as the food they ate often were stored in the soil, a rich supply of various microorganisms. The food of modern food is based on nutrients received from {{only a small number of}} plants; 80 % of the nutrients come from 17 plants and 50 % of the calories from eight grains. Furthermore, the main part of Western foods is extensively processed; growth enhancement, separation, condensing, drying, <b>freezing,</b> irradiation, <b>burning,</b> microwaving, toasting, adding various ingredients and especially heating. It is well-known that some important plant ingredients start disappearing already when heated above 28 oC, important plant enzymes and microbes above 42 o C, dys-functioning proteins be added above 80 oC and heterocyclic amines and also trans-fatty acids from about 130 oC, and increasing as the heating of the food increases further, all changes being negative to human health.|$|R
5000|$|Pin firing, {{also known}} as thermocautery, is the {{treatment}} of an injury to a horse's leg, by <b>burning,</b> <b>freezing,</b> or dousing it with acid or caustic chemicals. This is supposed to induce a counter-irritation and speed and/or improve healing. This treatment is used more often on racehorses than on other performance horses. It is sometimes used {{in the treatment of}} bucked shins or splint, curb, or chronic bowed tendons. There was also the theory that it would [...] "toughen" [...] the leg of the horse. This treatment is prevalent in equine veterinary books published in the early 20th century; however many present-day veterinarians and horse owners consider it barbaric and a cruel form of treatment. It is not generally taught in veterinary schools today.|$|R

(At least, as long as Grumpy is around?) We'll have to wait two long weeks for the answer to that <b>burning</b> (<b>freezing?)</b> question, thanks to the American Music Awards. At least Once prepared for its off week by giving us both halves of a two-parter—a story that, {{when all is said and}} done, maybe didn't need to be told over the course of two hours, though it was nice to see the show take some time to privilege character over plot tonight. The hour also revealed the answers to a few of the season's long-simmering unsolved mysteries—including how Elsa ended up trapped within the anti-magic urn. Could this indicate the end of the Arendelle fairybacks, considering that backstory seems to be fairly complete at this point? If it does, will you miss them—or are you looking forward to the show not spending quite so much time on the Frozen crew?" ...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} {{primordial}} star formation {{suggest that the}} first stars in the universe may have been very massive. Stellar models indicate that non-rotating Population III stars with initial masses of 140 − 260 M die as highly energetic pair-instability supernovae. We present new two-dimensional simula-tions of primordial pair-instability supernovae done with the CASTRO code. Our simulations begin at earlier times than previous multidimensional models, {{at the onset of}} core collapse, to capture any dynamical instabilities that may be seeded by collapse and explosive burning. Such instabilities could enhance explosive yields by mixing hot ash with fuel, thereby accelerating nuclear burning, and affect the spectra of the supernova by dredging up heavy elements from greater depths in the star at early times. Our grid of models includes both blue super-giants and red supergiants over the range in progenitor mass expected for these events. We find that fluid instabilities driven by oxygen and helium burning arise at the upper and lower boundaries of the oxygen shell ∼ 20 - 100 seconds after core bounce. Instabilities driven by <b>burning</b> <b>freeze</b> out after the SN shock exits the helium core. As the shock later propagates through the hydrogen envelope, a strong reverse shock forms that drives the growth of Rayleigh–Taylor insta-bilities. In red supergiant progenitors, the amplitudes of these instabilities are sufficient to mix the supernova ejecta...|$|R
5000|$|Psychosurgery is a {{surgical}} operation that destroys brain tissue {{in order to}} alleviate the symptoms of mental disorder. The lesions are usually, but not always, made in the frontal lobes. Tissue may be destroyed by cutting, <b>burning,</b> <b>freezing,</b> electric current or radiation. The first systematic attempt at psychosurgery is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt who operated on six patients in 1888. In 1889 Thomas Claye Shaw reported mental improvement {{in a case of}} General Paralysis of the Insane after a neurosurgical intervention. This led to a lively debate in the British Medical Journal on the usefulness of neurosurgery for the treatment of insanity. In the 1930s the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz developed {{a surgical}} technique for the treatment of mental illness and called it [...] "leucotomy" [...] or [...] "psychosurgery". Moniz' technique was adapted and promoted by American neurologist Walter Freeman and his neurosurgeon colleague James W. Watts. They called their operation, where burr holes are drilled {{in the side of the}} skull and the white matter is sliced through in order to sever the connections between the frontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain, lobotomy. In the United Kingdom it became known as the standard Freeman-Watts prefrontal leucotomy. British psychiatrist William Sargant met Freeman on a visit to the United States and on his return to England encouraged doctors at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol to instigate a programme of psychosurgery.|$|R
40|$|Thyroxine {{secretion}} {{rate was}} measured in I 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction. The test was repeated after one week in 5 cases and after three months in 7 cases. No significant difference in thyroxine secretion wasfound at any time after myocardial infarction compared {{with a group of}} patients awaiting operation. This is contrary to the effect of surgery on thyroid function and to the claimed uniformity of metabolic response to injury irrespective of type of trauma. Injury to tissue is followed not only by local reactions but also by a sequence of general reactions which affect the body as a whole. Born (I 970) has claimed that these general reactions constitute a pattern which is very much the same whatever the type of injury, be it trauma, haemorrhage, <b>burning,</b> <b>freezing,</b> or even acute infection. Clearly myocardial infarction {{can be viewed as a}} localized tissue trauma and might be expected to cause wide-spread metabolic effects (Opie, I 97 I). The well-established alterations in lipid metabol-ism that occur as early as the second day after myocardial infarction (Fyfe et al., I 97 I) are probably reactions of this type and it is of interest that similar changes have been re-ported after surgical trauma (Man et al., I 946). The rises in serum free fatty acid concentra-tion which occur soon after infarction and which have been related to the development of cardiac arrhythmias (Oliver, Kurien, and Greenwood, I 968) are also in this category. Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, which can persist for months (Sowton, i 962), are another important example. Since reaction to injury involves the whole body, the possibility that the effects have an endocrine basis has to be considered. After acute myocardial infarction, Valori, Thomas, and Shillingford (I 967) found increased urin-ary excretion of both adrenaline and nor-adrenaline. McDonald et al. (I 969) report that the plasma adrenaline concentration is unchanged but that noradrenaline concentra-tion is significantly raised. Siggers, Salter, and Fluck (I 97 I) found that raised plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline after myo...|$|R
