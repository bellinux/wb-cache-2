5|$|Life's Shop Window is a 1914 American silent drama film {{directed}} by J. Gordon Edwards and starring Claire Whitney and Stuart Holmes. It {{is a film}} adaptation of the eponymous 1907 novel by Annie Sophie Cory. The film depicts the story of English orphan Lydia Wilton (Whitney), and her husband Bernard Chetwin (Holmes). Although Wilton's marriage <b>is</b> <b>legitimate,</b> it was conducted in secret, and she is accused of having a child out of wedlock. Forced to leave England, she reunites {{with her husband in}} Arizona. There, she is tempted by infidelity with an old acquaintance, Eustace Pelham, before seeing the error of her ways and returning to her family.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland {{has produced a}} relative dearth of remains from this period {{in comparison to the}} Neolithic and later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC. In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period. There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it <b>is</b> <b>legitimate</b> to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland, although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown.|$|E

25|$|One {{might say}} {{the second stage}} of the {{amplifier}} is just a voltage follower, transmitting the voltage at the collector of the input transistor to the top of R2. That is, the monitored output signal is really the voltage at the collector of the input transistor. That view <b>is</b> <b>legitimate,</b> but then the voltage follower stage becomes part of the feedback network. That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, the war {{on drugs}} led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize {{proceeds}} of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and {{it is up to the}} individual to prove that the source of funds <b>is</b> <b>legitimate</b> if they want the funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.|$|E
25|$|According to emperor Constantine, Croats made a {{pact with}} Pope Agatho (678-681) in which they agreed not to attack {{neighboring}} nations or lead any conquest wars, while the Pope promised them {{that they would be}} protected by God and Saint Peter in return. Since emperor Constantine did not mention the Pope's name, historians have different opinions about the agreement. Some, like Franjo Rački, Nada Klaić, and Tadija Smičiklas, consider it to be fake, while others, like Ferdo Šišić, believed that it <b>is</b> <b>legitimate</b> mostly due to the style of writing which matches with that of the Roman Curia. Šišić believed that this event took place in the 9th century during the reign of Duke Branimir. According to other sources, the Pope addressed Slavs as the converted people, so Stjepan Krizin Sakač believed that Croats indeed made an agreement with Pope Agatho in year 679.|$|E

500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{recalls the}} commandment, [...] "You shall not kill" [...] and then adds to it the proscriptions against anger, hatred and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to love their enemies. The Catechism asserts that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>legitimate</b> {{to insist on}} respect for one's own right to life." [...] Kreeft says, [...] "self-defense <b>is</b> <b>legitimate</b> {{for the same reason}} suicide is not: because one's own life is a gift from God, a {{treasure}} we are responsible for preserving and defending." [...] The Catechism teaches that [...] "someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow." [...] Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility.|$|E
500|$|Such a [...] "meaning-vector" [...] {{provides}} {{a description of}} the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it <b>is</b> <b>legitimate</b> to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. However, since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions which must be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.|$|E
500|$|Desmond, Sayid and Lapidus {{experience}} turbulence while {{flying the}} 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) {{distance from the}} island where they were stranded to Lapidus' team's freighter, the Kahana. Desmond's consciousness travels back eight years to 1996, when he is serving with the British Army's Royal Scots Regiment. [...] Moments later, when his consciousness returns to the present day, he neither knows where he is nor recognizes his companions, and has no memory of his life since 1996. [...] After the helicopter lands, Desmond continues to jump between 1996 and 2004. He is taken to the sick bay, where a man named Minkowski is strapped to a bed because he is experiencing similar problems. [...] Minkowski explains that someone sabotaged the radio room two days earlier and that Desmond's ex-girlfriend Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) {{has been trying to}} contact the freighter. [...] Sayid uses the satellite phone to contact Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) on the island and explains that Desmond appears to have amnesia. Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), a physicist from the freighter, asks Jack whether Desmond has recently been exposed to a high level of radiation or electromagnetism. Jack is unsure, and so Daniel speaks to Desmond and asks him about his situation. [...] Desmond responds that he believes that he is in 1996 and is serving with the Royal Scots. Faraday understands and tells Desmond that when he returns to 1996, he needs to go to the physics department of The Queen's College, Oxford University in England to meet with Daniel's past self, and gives Desmond some mechanical settings to relay, along with an extra phrase that Daniel assures him will convince Daniel's past self that the story <b>is</b> <b>legitimate.</b>|$|E
