40|$|Introduction: Comprehensive {{evaluation}} of measles-specific humoral immunity after vaccination {{is important for}} determining new and/or additional correlates of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Methods: We used a novel proteome microarray technology and statistical modeling to identify factors and models associated with measles-specific <b>functional</b> protective <b>immunity</b> in 150 measles vaccine recipients representing the extremes of neutralizing antibody response after two vaccine doses. Results: Our findings demonstrate a high seroprevalence of antibodies directed to the measles virus (MV) phosphoprotein (P), nucleoprotein (N), as well as antibodies to the large polymerase (L) protein (fragment 1234 to 1900 AA). Antibodies to these proteins, in addition to anti-F antibodies (and, to a lesser extent, anti-H antibodies), were correlated with neutralizing antibody titer and/or were associated with and predictive of neutralizing antibody response.

40|$|The International Criminal Court {{has issued}} a warrant of arrest for the arrest and {{surrender}} of the incumbent president of Sudan, AlBashir, holding that his current position as Head of State is not an obstacle for the Court’s jurisdiction.

The <b>functional</b> cellular <b>immunity</b> test is a promising method to establish the diagnosis of immune dysfunctions.

40|$|Aging {{is often}} {{associated}} with a decline in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Here, we show that <b>functional</b> cell-mediated <b>immunity</b> is required for the maintenance of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Sudden imposition of immune compromise in young mice caused spatial memory impairment, whereas immune reconstitution reversed memory deficit in immune-deficient mice. Analysis of hippocampal gene expression suggested that immune-dependent spatial memory performance was associated with the expression of insulin-like growth factor (Igf 1) and of genes encoding proteins related to presynaptic activity (Syt 10, Cplx 2). We further showed that memory loss in aged mice could be attributed to age-related attenuation of the immune response and could be reversed by immune system activation. Homeostatic-driven proliferation of lymphocytes, which expands the existing T cell repertoire, restored spatial memory deficits in aged mice. Thus, our results identify a novel function of the immune system in the maintenance of spatial memory and suggest an original approach for arresting or reversing age-associated memory loss...|$|R

Further, Italy argued that as the incident occurred within India's Contiguous Zone India lacked jurisdiction over the vessel. Despite the limits as set out in UNCLOS, India relied on customary international law to assert jurisdiction leading one academic commentator to note that [...] "India wants to press its maritime sovereignty to the limit through an intersection of UNCLOS grants and readings of its own statutes".

No doubt, under the Maritime Zones Act, Parliament expressly asserted sovereignty of this country over the territorial waters but simultaneously, asserted its authority to determine/alter the limit of the territorial waters". This finding meant that under Indian law India's contiguous zone could be treated as part of India's territorial sea, effectively granting India a territorial sea of 24 nautical miles despite it only being entitled to a 12 nautical mile territorial sea under international law. However, the Supreme Court found that the State of Kerala did not have jurisdiction beyond the 12 nautical mile limit and that a special federal court be established to try the marines.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{profound}} immunodeficiency {{associated with}} allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplan-tation is permissive to uncontrolled replication of latent human herpesviridae such as cytomegalovirus. Morbidity and mortality associated with viral dissemination or its treatment are significant. Although adoptive cellular therapy with virus-specific T cells offers the potential for accelerating pathogen-specific immune reconstitution, the risk of induction of graft-versus-host disease and the logistics of production of clonal T cell populations restrict application. Methods. We investigated the ability of cytomegalovirus-specific mixed CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell lines, generated by short-term ex vivo culture of donor lymphocytes with donor monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with virus lysate, to restore antiviral immunity in 30 allogeneic transplant recipients {{at high risk of}} both uncontrolled viral replication and of graft-versus-host disease. Results. There were no immediate toxicities and no excess of graft-versus-host disease. Massive in vivo ex-pansions of cytomegalovirus-specific T lymphocytes occurred, temporally associating with periods of viral repli-cation, suggesting that antigen exposure was necessary for optimal cytomegalovirus-specific immune reconstitution.
