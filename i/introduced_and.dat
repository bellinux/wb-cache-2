5|$|To {{increase}} viewership, {{the third}} season format {{was changed to}} include two separate mysteries that would be <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> resolved {{in a series of}} non-overlapping story arcs. Three of the regulars in the second season were written out of the series, two new characters were <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> two others were upgraded from recurring roles. The third season received generally mixed critical reviews compared to previous seasons.|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} single weights and {{measures}} was <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency. Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, {{with the exception of}} serving the Vatican, though the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the Siege of Gaeta in 1860, marking the end of foreign service.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of animals and insects live in Texas. It is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of {{reptiles}} and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all. At least 12 species have been <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> now reproduce freely in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} <b>introduced,</b> <b>and</b> {{there is increasing}} awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are a {{distinctive}} lineage of parrots notable for their crests {{and lack of}} colour in their plumage. Generally large and noisy, they are a familiar part of the Australian (and Tasmanian) landscape. Six species are found in Tasmania, {{two of which are}} considered to be aviary escapees and hence <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> one a vagrant.|$|E

By using this set, we <b>introduce</b> <b>and</b> define the notion of Sı-continuity and {{investigate}} some of its properties. In particular, Sı-open sets and Sı-continuity are used to extend some known results of continuity...|$|R
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas <b>introduced,</b> <b>and</b> Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E
5|$|Following {{deregulation}} in October 1986, a {{small number}} of service changes were made, with a new route from Guildford to Chiddingfold being <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> a service to Gomshall withdrawn. At the same time, a new brand name, Hobbit, was introduced for Tillingbourne's minibus operations. Barry King left the company in December 1986 and was replaced as Managing Director by Chris Bowler.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, a new fiscal {{system was}} <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> the {{hundreds}} were gradually included into larger administrative units called len, with a castle {{serving as the}} administrative center. This new administrative development {{was a result of}} the increased power of the aristocracy. In each len, a noble man was put in charge, with the title lensmand.|$|E

5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially motivated {{by the prospect of}} military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.|$|E
5|$|Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied {{birds with}} short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. Seven {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in Tasmania, two {{of which have been}} <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> another three are vagrants.|$|E
5|$|Substitutes, {{such as the}} wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were <b>introduced,</b> <b>and</b> {{versatile}} vegetables such as eggplant {{were used}} as alternatives to meat. Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned tomato paste and puree, hummus, tahina, and mayonnaise in tubes. Meat was scarce, {{and it was not}} until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy.|$|E

5|$|The Zimbabwean dollar {{was first}} redenominated on 1 August 2006 under a {{currency}} reform campaign codenamed Operation Sunrise and involving the motto Zero to Hero. New-style bearer cheques {{of the second}} dollar (ISO 4217:ZWN) was <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> replaced those of the first dollar (ZWD) at the ratio of 1000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|The family Anatidae {{includes}} the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These are adapted for an aquatic existence, with webbed feet, bills that are flattened {{to a greater}} or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. In Tasmania, 15 species have been recorded, of which one has been <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> three are vagrants.|$|E
5|$|The island's rabbit population, {{introduced}} {{for farming}} in the 12th century, suffers from myxomatosis, which effectively contains the numbers. The island has been grazed since 1989, initially by goats, {{but also by}} sheep since 1992. In 1997 Soay sheep were <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> as of 2008 there are 28 sheep grazing wild on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{refurbished}} (as of 2015) and work began on 2 January 2007. Additional CCTV cameras and Help Points were installed, {{bringing the total}} to 77 cameras in the station and nine Help Points, the latter upgraded with new induction loops to better aid hearing-impaired passengers. In addition, new communications equipment was <b>introduced</b> <b>and</b> damaged signs were replaced with new ones.|$|E
