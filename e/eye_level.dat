5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the characteristics of}} daylight in a scholastic environment was carried out by comparing SPDs and CCTs of the natural source (sky) during typical winter days with contemporaneous measurements of spectral irradiances and CCTs detected at the <b>eyes</b> <b>level.</b> Data obtained from these measurements together with those detected with artificial light, were used to evaluate the effects on melatonin suppression during the day according to the procedure proposed by Rea et al [2]. Despite illuminances on desks under natural and artificial light corresponded to the EN 12464 - 1 Standard requirements, the irradiances detected at <b>eye's</b> <b>level,</b> which are essential for melatonin suppression, do not appear to always guarantee the necessary circadian stimulus. Consequently it can be inferred that much care should be devoted in designing lighting systems in educational environments in order to take into account their effects on the human circadian system synchronization...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E

25|$|The 787's cabin {{windows are}} larger than any other civil air {{transport}} in-service or in development, with dimensions of , and a higher <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> so passengers can maintain {{a view of the}} horizon. The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement. Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism-based smart glass (supplied by PPG Industries) allowing flight attendants and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking, reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world, but the most opaque setting still has some transparency. The lavatory, however, has a traditional sunshade.|$|E
25|$|The poodle is an active, {{intelligent}} and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, {{the length of}} body measured from the breastbone {{to the point of}} the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, <b>eye</b> <b>level.</b> The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains were}} found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, {{the son of}} Hagakol'. Nicu Haas, an {{anthropologist}} at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating {{that the man had}} been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together {{to the front of the}} cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at <b>eye</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To compare Ologen implant versus mitomycin-C (MMC) in {{combined}} trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy as {{a treatment}} of primary congenital glaucoma. Setting. Sohag University Hospital, Egypt. Design. A prospective comparative study. Methods. Thirty-four eyes of twenty-one patients with primary congenital glaucoma were included in this study. All patients were subjected to preoperative evaluation including complete anterior segment examination under general anesthesia. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: patients of the first group (group A) underwent combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy with Ologen implantation while those of the second group (group B) underwent combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy with MMC application. Results. Postoperatively, the IOP in group A was as follows: 8 <b>eyes</b> developed IOP <b>levels</b> less than 14 [*]mmHg (complete success), 3 <b>eyes</b> had <b>levels</b> between 14 and 16 [*]mmHg (accepted result), 2 <b>eyes</b> had <b>levels</b> between 16 and 20 [*]mmHg (guarded result), and only 2 <b>eyes</b> showed <b>levels</b> exceeding 20 [*]mmHg (failed procedure), while in group B, 7 eyes showed complete success, 3 eyes had accepted result, 3 eyes had guarded result, and 2 eyes had failed procedure. Conclusion. Ologen is a safe and effective adjuvant in combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy for treatment of primary congenital glaucoma...|$|R

25|$|The frieze is 113 meters long, {{which makes}} it the longest {{surviving}} frieze of Greek Antiquity after the Parthenon frieze. On the western side it is interrupted by the ca. 20 meter wide stairway, which cuts into the foundation on that side and leads to a superstructure with columns. On {{both sides of this}} stairway there are projections constructed and decorated {{in a manner similar to}} the rest of the encircling frieze. The three-wing superstructure is relatively narrow compared with the base. The pillars surrounding the superstructure have platforms with profiles and Ionic capitals. There are many statues on the roof: a quadriga of horses, lion griffins, centaurs and deities, as well as uncompleted gargoyles. The upper hall gives a spacious impression thanks to the widely spaced columns. An additional columned hall was also planned for the inner courtyard where the fire altar itself was located, but not implemented. A frieze was installed there at <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> depicting the life of the mythical founder of the city, Telephus. Although no remains of paint have been found, it can be assumed that the entire structure was brightly painted in antiquity.|$|E
500|$|Lutyens' design, with {{flanking}} objects, recumbent {{figure and}} a Stone of Remembrance set {{in front of}} the cenotaph, is reminiscent of his earlier cenotaph in Southampton. While many First World War memorials feature sculpture or overt religious symbolism, Manchester's, like many of his memorials, uses abstract and ecumenical shapes inspired by classical architecture. Its effigy of the unknown soldier raised high on the pylon rather than at <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> is reminiscent of ancient tower tombs. The sculpture's position high above <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> gives the soldier anonymity, complimenting the abstract shapes of the structures and allowing an onlooker to project an image of their own choosing onto it.|$|E

He said that hypocrisy was [...] "at the top of the list" [...] of the themes he wanted to explore in the story. While all of the adults in the film are attempting to live perfect lives, they cannot see that their children are driven to suicide, antidepressant addiction and kidnapping [...] for instance, Terri is so obsessed with her upcoming wedding that she does not realize her son is missing.|$|E

Tussauds Studios elaborated on this, creating the station and surrounding theme design. Wardley also worked alongside Stengel Engineering and landscape architects to develop a layout for the ride and surrounding area, which could be exciting for both riders and non-riders; for example, the final inversion was built at the <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> of an observer and the queue makes its way {{all the way around the}} quarry in which the track sits.|$|E

500|$|Depending on the source, Wacha shows a {{wide range}} of potential. [...] Scouting reports {{initially}} projected him for a potential of two plus-plus pitches (fastball and changeup) with command of both. [...] Baseball Prospectus noted that his polish due to pitch command helped fast-track him to the Major Leagues. [...] However, a dearth of vigorous fastball life escalates the importance of command. [...] Wacha offsets the shortage of sizable vertical movement with the pronounced descent through which his fastball, changeup and curve travel to create an additional obstacle as hitters to attempt square the bat on the pitch. [...] In addition, the drop in elevation changes the hitter's <b>eye</b> <b>level.</b> [...] Wacha was previously criticized for a heavy reliance on the fastball from lacking a solid breaking pitch. [...] Before refining his curveball, Baseball Prospect Nation commented that development of a slider [...] "to even only an occasional 'show-me' pitch would add another element to his game and allow him to become more refined in his pitch sequencing ability to work through a lineup." ...|$|E
