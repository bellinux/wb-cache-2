25|$|The main {{complaint}} {{made by the}} Baltringen peasants was {{the fact}} that they were serfs. They also requested the reduction of rents and annual duties in kind, as well as the abolition of <b>death</b> <b>duty.</b> Furthermore, they asked not to be burdened with socage any longer and to be allowed to utilise timber from the forests. They also opposed the little tithe but were prepared to pay great tithe in order to provide for the upkeep of their respective local priest.|$|E
25|$|Richard {{was born}} in Burford, {{near the town of}} Wyche (modern Droitwich, Worcestershire) and was an orphan member of a gentry family. On the death of their parents Richard's elder brother was heir to the estates but he was not old enough to inherit, so the lands were subject to a feudal wardship. On coming of age his brother took {{possession}} of his lands, but was required to pay a medieval form of <b>death</b> <b>duty</b> that left the family so impoverished, that Richard had to work for him on the farm. His brother also made Richard heir to the estate. According to Richard's biographers, friends tried to arrange a match with a certain noble lady. However Richard rejected the proposed match, suggesting that his brother might marry her instead; he also reconveyed the estates back to his brother, preferring a life of study and the church.|$|E

At a Remembrance Day address in 1952, Treatt criticised radical student politics embodied by the [...] "long-haired intellectual types": [...] "My {{belief in the}} value of university life and in higher education generally is a strong and abiding one...the sort of long-haired type I am thinking about may not even have a university degree. He is encased in self satisfied assurance of his own mental superiority." [...] In his speech at the Lyceum Hall, Treatt warned of Australia's attitudes on its success: [...] "A sort of mental haze seems to obscure the vision splendid that lies before this country. We are proud of being a British country, a country with British traditions, institutions, and all those things which go to make up what we call our 'British heritage. But this pride is not matched by a pride in being Australian. This seems to me one of the strongest sources of our weakness." ...|$|E

Therefore, {{to the extent}} that they are successful, one might expect <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> to inhibit the trend for wool-growing properties to become more capital-intensive.

Galanas was a form of weregild and represented the value of a person's life in the event of a homicide and was set at three times the sarhad, though the sarhad was also payable by the killer.

2500|$|In December 1893, an Opposition motion {{proposed}} by Lord George Hamilton {{called for an}} expansion of the Royal Navy. Gladstone opposed increasing public expenditure on the naval estimates, in the tradition of free trade liberalism of his earlier political career as Chancellor. All his Cabinet colleagues, however, believed in some expansion of the navy. He declared in the Commons on 19 December that naval rearmament would commit the government to expenditure {{over a number of years}} and would subvert [...] "the principle of annual account, annual proposition, annual approval by the House of Commons, which...is the only way of maintaining regularity, and that regularity is the only talisman which will secure Parliamentary control". In January 1894, Gladstone wrote that he would not [...] "break to pieces the continuous action of my political life, nor trample on the tradition received from every colleague who has ever been my teacher" [...] by supporting naval rearmament.

With another look round at the furniture, {{as if to}} gauge his sister's exact position, Soames went out towards Piccadilly. The evening was drawing in--a touch of chill in the October haze. He walked quickly, with his close and concentrated air. He must get through, for he wished to dine in Soho. On hearing from the hall porter at the Iseeum that Mr. Dartie {{had not been in}} to-day, he looked at the trusty fellow and decided only to ask if Mr. George Forsyte was in the Club. He was. Soames, who always looked askance at his cousin George, as one inclined to jest at his expense, followed the pageboy, slightly reassured by the thought that George had just lost his father. He must have come in for about thirty thousand, besides what he had under that settlement of Roger's, which had avoided <b>death</b> <b>duty.</b> He found George in a bow-window, staring out across a half-eaten plate of muffins.

Again I say, look at the facts. The Inland Revenue report for last year shows that £313,000,000 of property passing on death became subject to <b>death</b> <b>duties,</b> and of that sum £228,000,000 was personalty and not real estate, leaving only £85,000,000 real estate, and of that £85,000,000 only £22,000,000 was agricultural land. These <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> are represented as being levied entirely upon a small class of landed gentry and nobility, but, as a matter of fact, there is collected from that class in respect of agricultural land only seven per cent. of the whole amount of money which the Exchequer derives from death duties.[19] ...|$|R

60|$|The World State in {{this ideal}} {{presents}} {{itself as the}} sole landowner of the earth, with the great local governments I have adumbrated, the local municipalities, holding, as it were, feudally under it as landlords. The State or these subordinates holds all the sources of energy, and either directly or through its tenants, farmers and agents, develops these sources, and renders the energy available {{for the work of}} life. It or its tenants will produce food, and so human energy, and the exploitation of coal and electric power, and the powers of wind and wave and water will be within its right. It will pour out this energy by assignment and lease and acquiescence and what not upon its individual citizens. It will maintain order, maintain roads, maintain a cheap and efficient administration of justice, maintain cheap and rapid locomotion and be the common carrier of the planet, convey and distribute labour, control, let, or administer all natural productions, pay for and secure healthy births and a healthy and vigorous new generation, maintain the public health, coin money and sustain standards of measurement, subsidise research, and reward such commercially unprofitable undertakings as benefit the community as a whole; subsidise when needful chairs of criticism and authors and publications, and collect and distribute information. The energy developed and the employment afforded by the State will descend like water that the sun has sucked out of the sea to fall upon a mountain range, and back to the sea again it will come at last, debouching in ground rent and royalty and license fees, in the fees of travellers and profits upon carrying and coinage and the like, in <b>death</b> <b>duty,</b> transfer tax, legacy and forfeiture, returning to the sea. Between the clouds and the sea it will run, as a river system runs, down through a great region of individual enterprise and interplay, whose freedom it will sustain. In that intermediate region between the kindred heights and deeps those beginnings and promises will arise that are the essential significance, the essential substance, of life. From our human point of view the mountains and sea are for the habitable lands that lie between. So likewise the State is for Individualities. The State is for Individuals, the law is for freedoms, the world is for experiment, experience, and change: these are the fundamental beliefs upon which a modern Utopia must go.|$|E
