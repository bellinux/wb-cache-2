50|$|In fungi, {{the ability}} of the {{alternative}} oxidase to bypass inhibition of parts of the electron transport chain can contribute to fungicide resistance. This is seen in the strobilurin fungicides that target complex III, such as azoxystrobin, picoxystrobin and <b>fluoxastrobin.</b> However, as the alternative pathway generates less ATP, these fungicides are still effective in preventing spore germination, as this is an energy-intensive process.|$|E
50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, Fenarimol, Propiconazole, Myclobutanil, and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, Fenarimol and Myclobutanil were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, Fenarimol was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. Myclobutanil also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). Myclobutanil is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and fenarimol is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, Metconazole and others. Pyraclostrobin and <b>Fluoxastrobin</b> have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E
40|$|Pesticides {{are among}} the most {{extensively}} chemicals used in the world today and they are also among the most hazardous compounds for the human. This study was designed to use the plasmid relaxation assay to describe the association of markers of DNA damage with pesticide exposure. The DNA damage activity of <b>fluoxastrobin</b> and imazamox were checked on pBluescript M 13 + plasmid DNA (3. 2 kb) in the absence and presence of Cu(II) ions. It has been found that the <b>fluoxastrobin</b> and imazamox can effectively promote cleavage of plasmid DNA in the absence and presence of Cu(II) ions. DNA cleavage was found to be concentration and dependent. In conclusion, the present study showed that <b>fluoxastrobin</b> and imazamox can induce DNA damage,  which warrants for further investigations to correctly evaluate the hazards of exposure to these chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) of cereals {{is one of}} the most {{important}} pre-harvest diseases worldwide. One possible method to reduce the intensity of FHB and mycotoxin levels is to apply fungicides to wheat at the flowering stage. This paper reports the efficacy of fungicides to control FHB and reduce the associated mycotoxin biosynthesis. In a two-year experiment eight combinations of fungicides were tested. Ear inoculation with a suspension of conidia of Fusarium culmorum representing the DON chemotype, confirmed by PCR assay, was conducted during anthesis. All fungicides significantly reduced FHB severity. The best control and the highest wheat yield were obtained after the application of spiroxamine + prothioconazole at GS 29 - 32, combined with prothioconazole + <b>fluoxastrobin</b> at GS 49 - 55 (yield 166. 5 % of the control) or tebuconazole and prothioconazole (165. 8 %). All the other protection programs resulted in higher yields (117. 1 – 138. 5 % of the control). A clear relation was observed between the disease intensity and mycotoxin concentrations...|$|E
40|$|To {{accurately}} estimate {{exposure of}} bees to pesticides, analytical methods {{are needed to}} enable quantification of nanogram/gram (ng/g) levels of contaminants in small samples of pollen or the individual insects. A modified QuEChERS extraction method coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis was tested to quantify residues of 19 commonly used neonicotinoids and fungicides and the synergist, piperonyl butoxide, in 100 mg samples of pollen and in samples of individual bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Final recoveries ranged from 71 to 102 % for most compounds with a repeatability of below 20 % for both pollen and bumblebee extracts spiked at 5 and 40 ng/g. The method enables the detection of all compounds at sub-ng/g levels in both matrices and the method detection limits (MDL) ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 84 ng/g in pollen and 0. 01 to 0. 96 ng/g in individual bumblebees. Using this method, mixtures of neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiacloprid) and fungicides (carbendazim, spiroxamine, boscalid, tebuconazole, prochloraz, metconazole, <b>fluoxastrobin,</b> pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin) were detected in pollens of field bean, strawberry and raspberry at concentrations ranging from MDL, and in some bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations between 0. 80 to 30 ng/g. This new method allows the analysis of mixtures of neonicotinoids and fungicides at trace levels in small quantities of pollen and individual bumblebees and thus will facilitate exposure assessment studies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fusarium {{head blight}} {{is a very}} {{important}} disease of small grain cereals with F. graminearum {{as one of the most}} important causal agents. It not only causes reduction in yield and quality but from a human and animal healthcare point of view, it produces mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) which can accumulate to toxic levels. Little is known about external triggers influencing DON production. Results: In the present work, a combined in vivo/ in vitro approach was used to test the effect of sub lethal fungicide treatments on DON production. Using a dilution series of prothioconazole, azoxystrobin and prothioconazole + <b>fluoxastrobin,</b> we demonstrated that sub lethal doses of prothioconazole coincide with an increase in DON production 48 h after fungicide treatment. In an artificial infection trial using wheat plants, the in vitro results of increased DON levels upon sub lethal prothioconazole application were confirmed illustrating the significance of these results from a practical point of view. In addition, further in vitro experiments revealed a timely hyperinduction of H 2 O 2 production as fast as 4 h after amending cultures with prothioconazole. When applying H 2 O 2 directly to germinating conidia, a similar induction of DON-production by F. graminearum was observed. The effect of sub lethal prothioconazole concentrations on DON production completely disappeared when applying catalase together with the fungicide. Conclusions: These cumulative results suggest that H 2 O 2 induced by sub lethal doses of the triazole fungicide prothioconazole acts as a trigger of DON biosynthesis. In a broader framework, this work clearly shows that DON production by the plant pathogen F. graminearum is the result of the interaction of fungal genomics and external environmental triggers...|$|E

The published article can be found at: [URL] publisher and the author(s) have made this article open access. An increasing number of studies suggest an important role of host immunity {{as a barrier to}} tumor formation and progression. Complex mechanisms and multiple pathways are involved in evading innate and adaptive immune responses, with a broad spectrum of chemicals displaying the potential to adversely influence immunosurveillance. The evaluation of the cumulative effects of low-dose exposures from the occupational and natural environment, especially if multiple chemicals target the same gene(s) or pathway(s), is a challenge. We reviewed common environmental chemicals and discussed their potential effects on immunosurveillance. Our overarching objective was to review related signaling pathways influencing immune surveillance such as the pathways involving PI 3 K/Akt, chemokines, TGF-β, FAK, IGF- 1, HIF- 1 α, IL- 6, IL- 1 α, CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 /PDL- 1 could individually or collectively impact immunosurveillance. A number of chemicals that are common in the anthropogenic environment such as fungicides (maneb, <b>fluoxastrobin</b> and pyroclostrobin), herbicides (atrazine), insecticides (pyridaben and azamethiphos), the components of personal care products (triclosan and bisphenol A) and diethylhexylphthalate with pathways critical to tumor immunosurveillance. At this time, these chemicals are not recognized as human carcinogens; however, it is known that they these chemicals can simultaneously persist in the environment and appear to have some potential interfere with the host immune response, therefore potentially contributing to promotion interacting with of immune evasion mechanisms, and promoting subsequent tumor growth and progression...|$|E
