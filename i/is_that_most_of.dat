5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|It {{was a major}} {{intelligence}} disaster, says Steven.

25|$|A major {{obstacle}} facing the producers <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet leadership {{took part in}} the war; Many high-ranking officers and politicians were portrayed in the films with their wartime ranks, and the actors depicting them had to receive the models' blessing.|$|R
50|$|A final {{change in}} the B-47E <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the windows in the}} nose were deleted, with only one left on each side. However, many {{pictures}} of B-47Es show them with the full set of windows used on the B-47B. Whether the number of windows varied through B-47E production, or whether these were B-47Bs updated to B-47E specification, is unclear.|$|R
5|$|The country became {{independent}} in 1977. Fédération Djiboutienne de Football {{was founded in}} 1977 and joined FIFA in 1994. Football {{is one of the}} most popular sports in the country. Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States. Another issue facing women's football in Africa <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from FIFA.|$|E
25|$|The second {{advantage}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the state-owned}} firms are being privatized under the general policies of article 44 in the Iranian constitution. Under the circumstances, people {{are allowed to}} buy the shares of newly privatized firms.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reasons the}} Mexican Catholic Church has officially {{condemned}} {{the worship of}} Santa Muerte <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> her rites are modeled after Catholic liturgy, and some of Santa Muerte devotees eventually split from the Catholic Church and began vying for control of church buildings.|$|E

30|$|The metric {{of average}} years of {{schooling}} is not statistically significant {{for any of the}} types of inefficiency scores. This result suggests that education level may have no impact on waste gas and wastewater emission. The reason for this lack <b>of</b> impact may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the waste gas and wastewater <b>that</b> <b>are</b> produced in China are emitted by the industrial sector. This sector is not influenced by personal decision-making.|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} surveys, {{software}} developers still perceive current inspection tools as insufficient.

50|$|Another {{consequence}} of the 2002 regulations <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these <b>were</b> hurriedly enacted by President Musharraf before the new government took office. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> the new laws <b>that</b> <b>were</b> anti-democratic and were not intended to promote public activism but to increase his control of the public.

25|$|Analysts {{say that}} Lazcano's death does not signify {{the end of}} Los Zetas. As seen in other {{instances}} when top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the organizations occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, but the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these replacements are younger, less-experienced members {{who are likely to}} resort to violence to maintain their reputation.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} of today's Army <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its combat units are understrength in {{manpower}} due to budgetary limitations; the current Table of Organization and Equipment being established {{at a time}} during which the Army could rely on larger budgets and conscripted troops. Current plans call {{for the expansion of}} all combat units until all combat units are again full-strength, as soon as budget constraints allow for the induction of new volunteer service personnel of both genders.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of parabolic antennas <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the structure of}} the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies, that is a wide bandwidth. All that is necessary to change the frequency of operation is to replace the feed antenna with one that works at the new frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{feature of}} the monks <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them are itinerant, moving from one monastery or {{location}} to another, never staying {{in the same place}} for long. Many form a floating group of wanderers, where they participate in festivals together, share work and thus form a collective identity. They gather in certain places cyclically, particularly on festivals such as Navratri, Maha Shivaratri and Kumbh Mela. Many walk very long distances over a period of months from one sacred location to another, across India, in their spiritual pursuits.|$|E
25|$|The next {{crisis was}} {{followed}} by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the Berlin into east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north-south lines, trains were not allowed to stop for passengers and become Geisterbahnhöfe ("ghost stations"), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the years <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion.|$|E
25|$|Neither government, however, extends its {{citizenship}} to all persons born in Northern Ireland. Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent {{who is a}} British or Irish citizen.

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} faced by pediatric safety and quality efforts <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean, however, that all {{remaining}} differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, {{some aspects of}} precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific {{understanding of how the}} climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the government's assurances that seats will be increased in the institutes so that the general category students don't get affected, another point raised against reservation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the seats reserved for SC/ST candidates remain empty and hence any more reservation {{is a waste of}} resources. A major concern among them is also the fact that implementing reservation in institutes of higher education would be difficult unless the quality of faculty in them is diluted. They back this point by the fact that all IITs and IIMs are facing shortage of faculty and hence increasing the seats will lead to deterioration of education. For example, while IIT Kharagpur requires 667 faculties, it currently has only 470. Similarly, IIT Bombay has just 401 faculties as against the required 529.|$|E
