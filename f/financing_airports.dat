40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the financing of}} U. S. public airports in a turbulent era of change, and projects toward the future. It begins by briefly outlining historical patterns that have changed the industry, and airport facilities in particular. It then develops basic principles of public finance as applied to public infrastructure, followed by the applicable principles of management. Following that, the current airport financing system is analyzed and contrasted with a socially optimal financing system. A concluding section suggests policy reforms and their likely benefits. The principles of finance and management discussed here are elementary. However, their implications are radical for U. S. airport policy. There {{is a great deal}} of room to improve the allocation of aviation infrastructure resources. The application of these basic principles makes it evident that in many cases, current practice is wasteful, environmentally unsound, overly costly, and inequitable. Future investments in public aviation capital will continue to be wasteful until more efficient pricing systems are instituted. Thus, problem in the U. S. is not one of insufficient investment in airport infrastructure, but investment in the wrong types of infrastructure. In the U. S., the vast majority of publically-owned airports are owned by local governments. Thus, while the federal government bad a great deal of influence in <b>financing</b> <b>airports,</b> ultimately these are local decisions. The same is true with many other public infrastructure issues. Katz and Herman (1997) report that in 1995, U. S. net public capital stock equaled almost $ 4. 6 trillion, 72 % of which ($ 3. 9 trillion) was owned by state and local governments, most of it in buildings, highways, Streets, sewer systems, and water supply facilities. Thus, public infrastructure finance is fundamentally a local government issue, with implications for federal and state governments in the design of their aid programs...|$|E

25|$|In 1995, the Florida state {{legislature}} created the High Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) {{and came up}} with a public-private partnership model. Government would build the system leveraging state dollars with federal funds and tax-free bonding. The private sector was to invest money in the project, help design and build the network, and be given the franchise to operate the trains (known as design-build-maintain-operate, or DBOM). Trains would be privately owned, similar to how the airline industry operates in a publicly <b>financed</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|R

40|$|Air {{transport}} liberalisation in Europe {{has produced}} some major {{changes to the}} networks operated by airlines and the services available at airports. Within this context the degree of airport dependency in terms of market, spatial and temporal concentration {{is important to know}} from an economic geography and risk management perspective. A composite index called the Airport Dependency Index (ADI) is developed to measure airport dependency based on the concept of the relative Gini coefficient. Liberalisation has had varying impacts depending on the size and type of airport and so a comparison is made of the degree of dependency at a large sample of European airports using the ADI. The ADI has the potential to provide insight on the sustainability and worthiness of <b>financing</b> <b>airport</b> projects, and on whether airports should diversify further their activities by investing in the growth and expansion of their network...|$|R

5|$|From 1950, Braathens SAFE started flying charter {{services}} to Europe with Douglas DC-6, mainly to Copenhagen and Paris. DNL protested because Braathens SAFE was charging too low ticket prices, while DDL protested against the flights to Copenhagen. In September 1951, Braathens SAFE offered Danish authorities to fly all domestic routes without subsidies, {{but this was}} rejected because such a permit could only be issued to Danish airlines. After World War II, only Fornebu, Stavanger Airport, Sola and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik were in use as land airport. A plan for construction was passed by parliament in 1952, that based the <b>financing</b> of <b>airports</b> as joint civilian and military airports, with funding from NATO.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{property}} was originally owned by Don Inman, who maintained and operated the grass airstrip known as Seaside-Gearhart airport from 1946 through the 1950s. By 1960, the post-World War II general aviation boom was well under way, {{and state and}} federal governments were <b>financing</b> small <b>airport</b> development under the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. Members of the community convinced the State of Oregon to purchase the airport and install a paved runway, taxiways and parking ramp. The Oregon Department of Aviation operated the airport as Seaside State Airport until 1990, at which time it was chosen as one of several airports targeted for divestiture by the state, and subsequently deeded to the city of Seaside.|$|R
40|$|Government {{ownership}} of airports is inefficient and {{has led to}} large financial deficits in Canada. Terminals I and 11 at Pearson Airport are {{in desperate need of}} redevelopment. The Pearson Airport Agreements between the Federal Government and the Pearson Development Corporation ("PDC") to redevelop and operate Terminals I and II at Pearson Airport pursuant to a long term lease would have benefitted the Government through the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the airports while being relieved of the burden of <b>financing</b> <b>airport</b> expansion. The cancellation of the Pearson Airport Agreements based on the faulty reasoning of the Nixon Report was contrary to the public interest. The Canadian Government plans to "commercialize" Airports which involves leasing them to Airport Authorities. The federal government has reached an agreement on terms for transfer of Pearson Airport to the Greater Toronto Airport Authority ("GTAA"). Pearson airport {{will be one of the}} first airports to be transferred to local control under the Liberal governments Canadian Airport Authority model. Commercialization amounts to a transfer of Airports from one part of the public sector to another. It is plagued by many of the inefficiencies that characterize Government operated Airports. Pearson Airport has significant market power. Pearson Airports market power can effectively be diffused by separating the airport's airside and groundside functions, and basing airside ownership on slots. Terminals I, II and III will be sold separately and will become the responsibility of several airport companies who will compete for Airlines and Passengers. Runways, taxiways and the apron would be owned and operated by a Corporation made up of investors and third party brokers...|$|R
50|$|The airport broke {{ground on}} Phase I {{of a new}} Concourse A North on 29 February 2016. This {{concourse}} was initially envisioned as a separate satellite terminal for international flights, but the airport later found additional domestic gates were needed more than international capacity. This first phase is estimated to open in Spring 2018 and includes tearing down the old individual rental car buildings, closing the overflow Cell Phone Parking Lot north of the Terminal A ramp, expanding the ramp and taxiways, and building 9 new gates. The second phase will add 16 more gates to the concourse, predicted to open in 2022. Both expansions are estimated to total $500,000,000, <b>financed</b> by <b>airport</b> revenue bonds and future passenger facility charges.|$|R

[...] The high-risk, high-yield bonds (top rate of 6.5%) were issued by the Branson Regional Airport Transportation Development District. The City of Branson will pay a subsidy of $8.24 to Branson Airport LLC for each arriving visitor with an annual cap of $2 Million.

40|$|On 7 February 2005, the European Commission {{published}} draft “Community {{guidelines on}} the <b>financing</b> of <b>airports</b> and start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports” for consultation.

It is submitted here that such an attempt is highly problematic, given {{the absence of a}} coherent and objective justification for start-up aid in its proposed form. The Commission should not depart from its long-standing hostility to operating aid for reasons of perceived political expediency. At the very least, the Commission should limit the distortive effects of such aid to the greatest possible extent, in particular by limiting it to routes to and from truly regional airports...|$|R
40|$|The {{volume of}} air {{passengers}} and cargo in the Asia-Pacific region has grown significantly {{over the past}} decade due to the strong impetus of economic growth as well as trade and economic integration at both the regional and global levels.

40|$|Airlines, in the past, {{have had}} an {{important}} influence on airport operations through privileges granted them by the airport lease agreements. Airport administrators and sponsoring agencies have agreed to grant these privileges because much of airport capital investment has been amortized with airline money.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2011, GAO has identified 11 areas across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) where fragmentation, overlap, or potential duplication exists and 13 areas of opportunity for cost savings or enhanced revenue collections. In these reports, GAO has suggested 53 total actions to the department and Congress to help strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of DHS operations. In GAOs 2013 annual report on federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives that have duplicative goals or activities, GAO identified 6 new areas where DHS could take actions to address fragmentation, overlap, or potential duplication or achieve significant cost savings. For example, GAO found that DHS {{does not have a}} department-wide policy defining research and development (R&D) or guidance directing components how to report R&D activities. Thus, DHS does not know its total annual investment in R&D, which limits its ability to oversee components R&D efforts. In particular, GAO identified at least 6 components with R&D activities and an additional $ 255 million in R&D obligations in fiscal year 2011 by DHS components that was not centrally tracked. GAO suggested that DHS develop and implement policies and guidance for defining and overseeing R&D at the department. In addition, GAO reported that by reviewing the appropriateness of the federal cost share the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) applies to agreements <b>financing</b> <b>airport</b> facility modification projects related to the installation of checked baggage screening systems, TSA could, if a reduced cost share was deemed appropriate, achieve cost efficiencies of up to $ 300 million by 2030 and be positioned to install a greater number of optimal baggage screening systems. GAO has also updated its assessments of the progress that DHS and Congress have made in addressing the suggested actions from the 2011 and 2012 annual reports. As of March 2013, of the 42 actions from these reports, 5 have been addressed (12 percent), 24 have been partially addressed (57 percent), and the remaining 13 have not been addressed (31 percent). Although DHS and Congress have made some progress in addressing the issues that GAO has previously identified, additional steps are needed to address the remaining areas to achieve associated benefits. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the government and the municipalities during the construction of the main airports in Sweden in the period 1921 - 1967. It is shown that after the initial phase, when the municipalities were assigned the responsibility for <b>financing</b> and constructing <b>airports,</b> a substantial government intervention occurred between 1935 and 1950. The introduction of a market-oriented transport policy in the 1950 s, however, limited the government funds for investments in airports during the post-war period, forcing the municipalities to share the financial responsibilities for such infrastructure. In turn, this meant that the mode of regulating the infrastructure for civil aviation diverged from the common national regulatory pattern of infrastructure in Sweden...|$|R

25|$|Molde Municipality {{accepted}} the priority, but determined in June 1965 {{that they were}} free to <b>finance</b> an <b>airport</b> themselves. The municipal administration started working on plans and on 26 April 1966 Braathens SAFE confirmed that the airline was willing to connect Molde to Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. Årø was aided in 1968 when the Civil Aviation Administration altered the priority of the airports, placing Molde at the top. It cited lower investments, stipulated at 13.2 million Norwegian krone rather than 22.4 million for Kvernberget. The municipality contacted contractor Olav T. Meisinger, who came with a bid for the leveling of the site. The municipality secured a loan from Kommunal Landspensjonskasse and applied the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1969 for permission to start construction. They stated they were neutral, while the Ministry of Local Government was positive. By then construction of Kristiansand Airport, Kvernberget was already under way, with the airport opening on 30 June 1970.

The ministry stated that this was {{because they did not}} want to use the limited state funds, that were entirely generated from user fees, to invest in airports that the state had chosen to not operate. It also stated that investments should be concentrated on security rather than increased capacity, and that the airport operating company had sufficient capital to finance the investments.
