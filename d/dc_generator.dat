5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} the Edison company, Tesla was working on {{patenting}} an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Tesla worked {{for the rest of}} the year obtaining the patents that included an improved <b>DC</b> <b>generator,</b> the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E

25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a 24 volt <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> on the {{starboard}} (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} <b>DC</b> <b>generator.</b> The <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E
2500|$|In a diesel–electric locomotive, {{the diesel}} engine drives either an {{electrical}} <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> (generally, less than [...] net for traction), or an electrical AC alternator-rectifier (generally [...] net {{or more for}} traction), the output of which provides power to the traction motors that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The paper analyses {{the possibility}} of reducing the initial current of synchronous motor used for powering an excavator in an open coal-pit. The main generator group, which consists of three <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> S = 1250 kW, reaches the torque moment through synchronous motor with salient poles usage, Sr = 1250 kW. The motor is accelerated as asynchronous squirrel cage motor, drawing attention to the machine acceleration period till the moment it enters synchronism. During this period, lasting up to 15 seconds, {{it is necessary to}} connect the rotor winding through a resistor, to start the acceleration as asynchronous motor and pull the machine into synchronism. After that, a synchronous motor powers the <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> and operates as a synchronous compensator. The excitation circuits of electromotor were originally powered by the <b>DC</b> <b>generators.</b> Now, these systems are replaced by more efficient thyristor static converters. In this way, the excavator efficiency is increased, a faster response of excitation circuit is obtained and initial currents of synchronous motor are significantly reduced...|$|R
50|$|The C428 {{would have}} been a 2,750-horsepower, four-axle locomotive, powered by the same engine as the C628. Due to the {{complexity}} of <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> at this level of power, the AC powered C430 was developed instead.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regenerative}} brake concept was further {{developed in the}} early 1980s by David Arthurs, an electrical engineer, using [...] components, military surplus, and an Opel GT. The voltage controller to link the batteries, motor (a jet-engine starter motor), and <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> was Arthurs'. The vehicle exhibited [...] fuel efficiency, and plans for it were marketed by Mother Earth News.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{traction}} motors and generator were DC machines. Following {{the development of}} high-capacity silicon rectifiers in the 1960s, the <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> was replaced by an alternator using a diode bridge to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the commutator and brushes in the generator. [...] Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed {{of the possibility of}} a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a flashover, which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} high-speed diesel train, {{which was}} to become the InterCity 125, was to be formed of a rake of passenger coaches sandwiched between two power cars, one at each end. The decision to use two power cars was taken {{very early in the}} project as design engineers had calculated that the train would need 4,500 horsepower to sustain the required speed of 125 miles per hour on the routes for which it was being designed (the Great Western Main Line, Midland Main Line, and the Cross Country Route), and it was quickly established that no single [...] "off-the-shelf" [...] diesel engine was capable of producing such power. Also a factor in the decision was that the use of two locomotives, operating in push–pull formation, would cause less wear on the rails than a single, much heavier, locomotive. The framework of the new locomotive, classified British Rail Class 41, was built at Crewe Works before being transferred to Derby Litchurch Lane Works for completion. The design of the locomotive incorporated a driving desk fitted around the driver, a sound-proofed door between the cab and the engine room, and, unusually, no side windows. The prototype became the first diesel locomotive in British railway history to use AC alternators in place of a <b>DC</b> <b>generator,</b> with the output converted to DC when used for traction.|$|E
50|$|The {{four large}} water turbines, {{some of the}} largest built up to that time, were made by S. Morgan Smith Works of York, Pennsylvania. There were two small {{penstocks}} plus turbines for the two <b>DC</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures such}} as Integrated Power Management Systems and variable speed <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> have resulted in reduction {{in the rate of}} diesel consumption by 1.2 million liters, leading to savings of [...] across 900 sites.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} dynamometers {{are used for}} the {{assessment}} of the performance of rotating machines up to a maximum speed of 24,000 rpm and maximum rating of 24 kW. Variable loads may be applied using eddy current brakes or <b>DC</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{self-excited}} shunt-wound <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> {{is shown}} on the left, and a magneto <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> with permanent field magnets is {{shown on the}} right. The shunt-wound generator output varies with the current draw, while the magneto output is steady regardless of load variations.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} {{excitation}} {{consists of a}} smaller direct-current (<b>DC)</b> <b>generator</b> fixed on the same shaft with the alternator. The <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> generates {{a small amount of}} electricity just enough to excite the field coils of the connected alternator to generate electricity. A variation of this system is a type of alternator which uses direct current from the battery for excitation, after which the alternator is self-excited.|$|E
50|$|Supplying {{power for}} the 24 stator (non-rotating) field coil magnets on the AC {{generators}} was a small direct current generator with another <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> in standby mode for immediate substitution if needed. If one <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> failed or needed maintenance the other one could be used.All four AC generators power were connected to each other, when long-term demand increased and {{it was found that}} tying generators together improved frequency control, by synchronizing action.|$|E
50|$|A {{resistor}} {{electrical brake}} (not a regenerative brake) was installed. During braking the motors were {{disconnected from the}} catenary and operated as <b>DC</b> <b>generators.</b> The power generated was dissipated by the brake resistors mounted on the roof, cooled by the air flow.|$|R
50|$|In Poland Vapor steam {{generators}} were fitted to diesel passenger locomotives SP45. The boilers were removed in the 80s and 90s {{and replaced with}} 3 kV <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> driven by main engine, when maintenance became too expensive and remaining cars not fitted with electric heating were withdrawn from service.|$|R
50|$|The first diesel {{electric}} locomotives, {{and many}} of those still in service, use <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> as, before silicon power electronics, it was easier to control the speed of DC traction motors. Most of these had two generators: one to generate the excitation current for a larger main generator.|$|R
50|$|The {{key feature}} of the Ward Leonard control system {{is the ability to}} {{smoothly}} vary the speed of a DC motor, including reversing it, by controlling the field windings and hence the output voltage of a <b>DC</b> <b>generator.</b> As the speed of a DC motor is dictated by the supplied voltage, this gives simple speed control. The <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> could be driven by any means, provided that also supplied a voltage source for the field windings. This 'prime mover' could be an AC motor, or it could be an internal combustion engine (its application to vehicles was patented by H.W. Leonard in 1903).|$|E
5000|$|Critical field {{resistance}} {{is a term}} {{that is associated with}} a shunt <b>DC</b> <b>generator.</b> In a DC Shunt Generator, the voltage induced across the Armature Va is directly proportional to the Flux acting across it, The Flux in a <b>DC</b> <b>Generator</b> is directly proportional to the field current If. By Ohm's Law [...] V = IR [...] The critical field {{resistance is}} defined as the maximum field circuit resistance (for a given speed) with which the shunt generator would excite. The shunt generator will build up voltage only if field circuit resistance is less than critical field resistance.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{suggested}} a new mathematical model, based on which it can be justified the self-excitation <b>DC</b> <b>generators,</b> either shunt or series excitation, by self-organization phenomena that appear to overcome threshold values (self-excitation in these generators is an avalanche process, a positive feedback, considered at first glance uncontrollable) ...|$|R
50|$|Motor {{vehicles}} require {{electrical energy}} to power their instrumentation, keep the engine itself operating, and recharge their batteries. Until about the 1960s motor vehicles tended to use <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> with electromechanical regulators. Following the historical trend above {{and for many}} of the same reasons, these have now been replaced by alternators with built-in rectifier circuits.|$|R
50|$|The DD35s were {{initially}} quite unreliable; {{some of this}} was blamed on sand from the internal sandboxes getting in electrical gear, so new sandboxes were fitted on the walkways in 1969. The DD35s were among the last EMD road units to be built with <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> and old-fashioned switchgear, which were more maintenance intensive than the later AC/DC equipment.|$|R
50|$|This {{change was}} needed because higher {{voltages}} transmit power more efficiently over small wires. To increase the output voltage, a <b>DC</b> <b>generator</b> must be spun faster, but beyond a certain speed this is impractical for very large power transmission generators.|$|E
50|$|In a shunt-wound generator, {{output voltage}} varies {{inversely}} with load current. In a series-wound generator, output voltage varies directly with load current. A {{combination of the}} two types can overcome the disadvantages of both. This combination of windings is called a compound-wound <b>dc</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

50|$|A Station:-The first {{power plant}} {{consisted}} of 24 General Electric direct current (<b>DC)</b> <b>generators</b> installed in four groups of six. Each group was belt {{driven by a}} 300HP Austral Otis horizontal compound slow speed steam engine. The terminal voltage was 3 kV DC and the electricity was used for street lights, trams, lifts and city buildings. Steam was supplied from four Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers. In 1897 four General Electric 75KW alternators were added. They were belt driven by the existing engines. Output was 2 kV and 72 Hz. In 1900 a Peach three-crank compound 2500HP steam engine was installed. It was coupled to a Johnson & Phillips 120KW alternator. The alternating current (AC) {{was used in the}} surrounding suburbs via transformers. 1905 saw further expansion with one 200KW alternator, 4x350KW vertical Belliss steam engines that were direct-coupled to <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> at 460V <b>DC.</b> This was to augment the city supply. Steam was supplied by another four Babcock boilers.|$|R
50|$|By 1904 the North Road station's {{capacity}} was at 5,935 kW, {{with six}} Lancashire boilers and ten Babcock & Wilcox boilers, steaming nineteen Willans engines, coupled directly to <b>DC</b> <b>generators.</b> It was decided a larger station would be needed, {{and the site}} was chosen at Southwick. When this station was opened in 1906 the old station became less required, and so in 1908 North Road station was closed down.|$|R
50|$|The C630 was {{launched}} in 1965, prompted the impending launches of locomotives by both GE and EMD of equivalent size, {{and was the first}} production locomotive to use AC technology, as <b>DC</b> <b>generators</b> were too large and complex to be used at such high powers. It was powered by a 3,000-horsepower, 16-cylinder, Model 251E engine. It {{was launched}} in 1965, and remained in production until 1967, with 77 units produced.|$|R
