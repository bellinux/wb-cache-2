25|$|If a {{positive}} potential VG is applied at the <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> {{with respect to}} the cathode, the breakdown of the junction J2 occurs at a lower value of VAK. By selecting an appropriate value of VG, the thyristor can be switched into the on state quickly.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} the {{terminals}} refer to their functions. The <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> may {{be thought of as}} controlling the opening and closing of a physical gate. This gate permits electrons to flow through or blocks their passage by creating or eliminating a channel between the source and drain. Electron-flow from the source terminal towards the drain terminal is influenced by an applied voltage. The body simply refers to the bulk of the semiconductor in which the gate, source and drain lie. Usually the body terminal is connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, {{depending on the type of}} the FET. The body terminal and the source terminal are sometimes connected together since the source is often connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, although there are several uses of FETs which do not have such a configuration, such as transmission gates and cascode circuits.|$|E

In an [...] "enhancement mode" [...] MOSFET, voltage applied to the <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> increases the conductivity of the device.

2500|$|All {{international}} arrivals (except flights with customs preclearance) {{are handled}} at the International Arrivals Building, located {{to the west}} of Terminal A. This building was formerly used by Northwest Airlines between 2007 and 2009 when they offered non-stop flights from Bradley to Amsterdam.

2500|$|In a {{conventional}} thyristor, {{once it has}} been switched on by the <b>gate</b> <b>terminal,</b> the device remains latched in the on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current {{to remain in the}} on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (IL). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the holding current (IH). In normal working condition the latching current is always greater than holding current. In the above figure IL [...] has to come above the IH on y-axis since IL>IH.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposed}} compromise {{was opposed}} by JetBlue Airways and other low-fare carriers, {{who argued that}} the gate reductions at Love would harm their ability to begin service there, and by area congressmen who opposed provisions of the deal that they believed would restrict competition in passenger service at other airports within an [...] radius of DFW and Love, including Collin County Regional Airport in the nearby city of McKinney. The compromise was also opposed by Love Field Terminal Partners, owners of the old Legend Airlines terminal.

50|$|Reading {{or writing}} a logic one {{requires}} the wordline is driven to a voltage {{greater than the}} sum of VCC and the access transistor's threshold voltage (VTH). This voltage is called VCC pumped (VCCP). The time required to discharge a capacitor thus depends on what logic value is stored in the capacitor. A capacitor containing logic one begins to discharge when the voltage at the access transistor's <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> is above VCCP. If the capacitor contains a logic zero, it begins to discharge when the <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage is above VTH.|$|E
