5|$|English {{word order}} {{has moved from}} the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost {{exclusively}} subject–verb–object (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters {{of two or more}} verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to try to open it.|$|E

5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E

After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position for which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to be seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|Although Jennings {{dreamed of}} {{following}} in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, {{his first job}} was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him to {{the small town of}} Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{attended}} Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, {{where he}} participated in several school plays {{and contributed to the}} school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically. During his adolescence, he briefly fronted A Shot in the Dark, a Rolling Stones cover band. When he was younger, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E

After Hensley spoke with her, she accepted {{the doctrine of}} snake handling. He soon proposed marriage, which she accepted. They lived in the Soddy-Daisy area for several months. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that she would travel with him and read Bible passages during his services, she left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage, and their union was soon dissolved. In 1951, Hensley married Sally Norman in Chattanooga. After their marriage, she traveled with him as he ministered in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's arch-rival Roman Dmowski, {{traveled}} to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring {{to discourage the}} Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure. Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy {{to the end of}} Piłsudski's life. In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{and mixing}} {{took place at}} Tico-Tico Studios in Kemi, Finland. The studio's {{schedule}} was too full for a single recording session, so Kalmah had to book time to record the album in three separate sessions, between the months of May and August, 2009. The majority of tracks were recorded in May, beginning with Janne Kusmin's drums, which were completed by May 12. Kusmin {{was not able to}} play as well as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> because he had not been practicing. As a result, several of his drum parts were changed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E

5|$|When Andersen {{returned}} to Norway after the German surrender in 1945, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to reunite {{with his wife}} Ruth.

Andersen and Bergstrøm later married.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of Boys in the Sand, Casey Donovan became an {{underground}} celebrity. While he never achieved the mainstream film career for which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped,</b> he continued his career in pornography and translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage, including a successful national tour in the gay-themed play Tubstrip and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of The Ritz. His fame also allowed him success as a high-priced escort. He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry, making films for the next fifteen years until his death from AIDS-related illness in 1987.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his heart attack, in early 1991 Ryzhkov stood as the Communist {{candidate in the}} first election of the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). At the election on 12 June 1991, he gained 13,395,335 votes, equal to 16.9% of the electorate. Boris Yeltsin beat him decisively with 57%. Ryzhkov's vice presidential candidate was Boris Gromov, a Soviet war veteran who led the Soviet military during {{the final stages of}} the war in Afghanistan. Most of Ryzhkov's votes came from the countryside, while <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to win over voters who were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result of perestroika and Gorbachev's leadership, even though the latter supported his candidacy.|$|E

60|$|Raoul started, {{and gave}} thanks mentally that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come on board, as this {{statement}} showed that his enemies had received only too accurate information {{of his recent}} movements. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>hopes,</b> however, of being able yet to change their intentions and of putting them on a wrong scent.|$|R

5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> {{to write his}} thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

According to analysts, Hu wanted to transfer his ally Wang Yang out of Chongqing before these problems intensified. Bo was initially reluctant to go to Chongqing and was reportedly unhappy with his new assignment. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> to become vice-premier instead, but Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-premier Wu Yi argued against Bo's promotion to vice-premiership. In particular, Wu was critical of Bo's penchant for self-promotion, and Wen cited international lawsuits against Bo by Falun Gong adherents {{as a barrier to}} his holding higher office.|$|E
