2500|$|In February 2014, Time was {{met with}} {{controversy}} {{for the release of}} a cover featuring Enrique Peña Nieto and the legend Saving Mexico (written by Michael Crowley), as the cover article's title inside the magazine. The controversial article praised the president and his cabinet for reforms like opening oil fields for foreign investment {{for the first time in}} 75 years (a reform towards which Mexican citizens have shown mixed feelings), ending the Mexican drug wars (which was not completely accurate), and even going as far as saying [...] "the opposition party blocked major reforms that were necessary", that [...] "American leaders could learn a thing or two from their resurgent southern neighbor" [...] and saying Mexicans citizens' [...] "alarms were replaced with applause". The last part proved false, when the cover immediately spawned heavy amounts of backlash on social media, becoming a meme which spawned multiple parody covers ranging from changing the legend to mock words like [...] "Selling Mexico", [...] "Slaving Mexico", [...] "Starving Mexico", [...] "Who <b>is</b> <b>saving</b> Mexico from this ass-hole?" [...] to editing Peña Nieto into clown make-up, dressed as the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, the Pope, to one featuring an old lady holding a gun with the legend [...] "Saving Mexico... pero de Peña Nieto" [...] (but from Peña Nieto). Multiple articles criticized the article, and some websites even asked Time magazine if Peña Nieto paid for the cover story. This prompted Michael Crowley, the writer of the article, to post on Twitter: [...] "Remarkable how many critics of Mexico's president seem to believe I must have literally taken a bribe to write a positive story about him".|$|E

2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he <b>is</b> <b>saving</b> Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{composed}} {{several other}} new themes for the film, {{to represent the}} titular villain Ultron; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger Vision. Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound [...] "almost heroic", since Ultron thinks he <b>is</b> <b>saving</b> the world, [...] "but dissonant and tweaky enough" [...] to reflect that [...] "he doesn't quite have it right" [...] and is still a villain. The melody is simple {{so that it is}} easy to remember, but starts flat by one note to make the theme sound slightly [...] "off", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played [...] "ahead by a beat" [...] the second time; [...] "not only out of tune, but out of time." [...] The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone. Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an [...] "unrequited romance and this kind of sad situation" [...] with [...] "the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [...] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken." [...] Tyler wrote the [...] "lullaby" [...] to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello. For the Vision's theme, Tyler [...] "wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and had kind of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic". He tried to reflect the character's role as a messianic figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth, and said, [...] "you don’t really know what side he’s on. You have this guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way." [...] The theme is an adagio that is [...] "not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery." [...] To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds. Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, [...] "trying to say more with less for Vision". The music for the visions that the Scarlet Witch gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a [...] "randomly played" [...] vibraphone and strings such as a harp to create a [...] "dreaminess" [...] and [...] "hypnotic effect".|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Maturin is the series' other hero. A former Irish radical, he is a ship's {{surgeon who}} has sailed with Aubrey {{since his first}} voyage as Commander. Unlike many {{surgeons}} in this era, Maturin is a physician, and is highly regarded for his intimate knowledge of anatomy and diseases. His skills have saved {{the lives of many}} of his shipmates. [...] He is acknowledged as a man of high breeding (The Fortune of War, p.48), and while on land he is consulted by such prominent figures as the Duke of Clarence. Maturin is also well known in the scientific community as a naturalist, specializing in comparative anatomy of birds but also willing to examine (and sometimes dissect) any interesting animal that crosses his path. His qualities as a doctor are only outshone by his skills as an intelligence agent, a profession only suspected by those he sails with but one by which he has occasionally confounded Napoleon's attempts at European domination. Despite spending so much time aboard ships, Maturin has little knowledge of their qualities and terminology, which does not stop him from trying to explain various sailing terms and maneuvers to people even less informed. His appearance—small, pale, and usually dishevelled—does not make him very appealing to the opposite sex, but that does not deter him from trying to win the heart of the beautiful Diana Villiers. Unfortunately, Maturin, from what he claims is a spirit of pure philosophical enquiry, is a regular dabbler in any intoxicating drug that comes his way. Though skirting the line that separates [...] heavy use from addiction, he has dabbled in laudanum, a tincture of opium, coca leaves, and other local intoxicants ranging from bhang to khat, depending on where he happens to be at the moment. Maturin also has the sometimes distressing habit of bringing both live (wombats, a hive of bees, [...] "a most discriminating" [...] sloth) and dead animal (and human) specimens on board ship. Most are tolerated (even the bees) due to the crew's respect for Stephen's talents as a physician and natural philosopher, some, such as severed human hand and a narwhal's horn are seen as lucky talismans. He was born [...] "the wrong side of the blanket" [...] to an Irish father and a Catalan mother. He spent his childhood in both Ireland and Catalonia, and inherited land from his Catalan relatives. He is fluent in many languages, including English, Irish and Catalan from his upbringing, and French, Italian, Castilian Spanish and local dialects on the islands, Portuguese, Dutch, among others, and spent time learning Urdu on the long journey in HMS Surprise. On occasion he helps his shipmates out of a predicament by speaking one language in the accent of another, as part of the ruse de guerre common in the Royal Navy. He draws the line there, as his role on board ship <b>is</b> <b>saving</b> lives, not taking them. He makes an exception in The Letter of Marque, on the mission to cut out the French frigate Diane: he imprisons the intelligence officer, and then joins the fight on deck by coolly killing the ship's captain with his pistol and then his sword.|$|E
