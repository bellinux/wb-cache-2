60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> this pleasantry {{until his}} face {{looked like a}} cracked mask.|$|E
60|$|Bridge awoke {{about the}} same time, and turned lazily over, raising himself upon an elbow. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> Billy.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Service. Come on, let's go and dine. How {{about the}} Midland?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> his little joke {{as he led}} the way toward the street.|$|E
60|$|Twiddling a small object, a door-key of {{peculiar}} make, in his hand, <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> stolidly <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|I thought I {{had never}} seen Ham grin to {{anything}} like {{the extent to which}} <b>he</b> sat <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> us now.|$|R
50|$|Satish {{seems to}} agree with Arun as <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> him. After some time, the train steams in. Satish and Arun board it. Satish 's mother and the {{stranger}} stand on the platform talking to the boys. The train starts, Satish says, Good-bye, mother. They wave to each other. Not to be left behind, Arun also utters the farewell words, Good-bye, mother. He continues to gaze at the woman until she disappears in the crowd.|$|R
60|$|Buell was superbly {{mounted on}} a sleek bay, and he looked {{very much the same}} jovial fellow I had met on the train. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> the {{disfigured}} men.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> the idea, {{and then}} he {{continued}} his way towards the Smiling Pool. He hoped he might find another Duck there, and he approached the Smiling Pool very, very carefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied, [...] "I guess not. I'm {{making good}} wages here. So long as I can keep from riling Cassidy they're sure." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> Weston. [...] "It's your call." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] said <b>he,</b> still <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> the couple, [...] "let us have {{as little}} {{sentiment}} as possible, and, Pen, my good fellow, {{tell us the}} whole story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam is {{thinking}} of what he and Grace are going to do," [...] said Dick. [...] "And you and Nellie will likely have a cottage across the way," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> Tom.|$|R
6000|$|Reinhart's {{features}} formed. [...] "Call off the attack." [...] His uniform was torn. A deep bloody gash {{crossed his}} cheek. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> sourly <b>at</b> Dixon, pushing his tangled hair {{back out of}} his face. [...] "Quite a fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|Softly {{stepping}} {{among the}} clods came Tony, he {{of the race}} of Goths, {{who worked in the}} kitchen. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> Burney's elbow, and that unhappy man, full of race animosity and holding urbanity in contempt, growled at him: [...] "What d'ye want, ye--Dago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{the crowd}} from the flying-field were running toward him, yelling. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> the foolish sight they made with their {{legs and arms}} strewn about {{in the air as}} they galloped over the rough ground. Lieutenant Haviland came up, panting: [...] "All right, o' man? Good!" [...] He seized Carl's hand and wrung it. Carl knew that he had a new friend.|$|E
60|$|A tumbling, muffled {{noise from}} within the dark house startled him. Then he heard her voice:--'There are clothes.' He rose {{and went to the}} foot of the stairs, and {{gathered}} up the garments she had thrown down. Then he came back to the fire, to rub himself down and dress. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> his own appearance when he had finished.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Yes. H'm! I didn't {{understand}} what that fool was saying. [...] . But never mind! It will teach the scoundrel to disturb me {{at this time of}} the day," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> me with savage cynicism.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish, Mr. Stephens, {{you would}} strike my donkey-boy with your whip if {{he hits the}} donkey again," [...] cried Miss Adams, jogging up on a high, raw-boned beast. [...] "Hi, dragoman, Mansoor, you tell this boy that I won't have the animals ill used, and {{that he ought to}} be ashamed of himself. Yes, you little rascal, you ought! <b>He's</b> <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> me like an {{advertisement}} for a tooth paste. Do you think, Mr. Stephens, that if I were to knit that black soldier a pair of woollen stockings he would be allowed to wear them? The poor creature has bandages round his legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Train off the track? Well, I snum!" [...] {{cried the}} farmer. Then he {{set down the}} lantern and aided in {{bringing}} Nat Poole to the flooring of the barn. [...] "Putty cold, I'll bet a quart o' shellbarks," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> the lad's wet and shivering figure.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{so heavy}} that I wellnigh dropped it. [...] "All ri'!" [...] said I, and <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> {{me through the}} cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given me, with red seals at either end and along its edge. [...] "If this isn't money," [...] said I, [...] "it's {{platinum}} or lead." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little later}} who should appear peeping over {{the stone wall}} but Reddy Fox. It seemed very bold of Reddy, but really it wasn't nearly as bold as it seemed. You see, Reddy knew that Farmer Brown's boy and Bowser the Hound were over in the Old Pasture, {{and that he had}} nothing to fear. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> Chatterer in the most {{provoking}} way. It made Chatterer angry just to see him.|$|E
60|$|On {{the beach}} a curious scene took place. Whaleboat after {{whaleboat}} was being hurriedly manned and shoved off. It had grown still darker. The stagnant calm continued, and the sand shook under their feet with each buffet {{of the sea}} on the outer shore. Narii Herring walked leisurely along the sand. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> the very evident haste of the captains and buyers. With him were three of his Kanakas, and also Tai-Hotauri.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Ricardo {{had slipped}} off the table, and was prowling about the room in an oblique, {{noiseless}} manner. <b>He</b> flashed a <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> Schomberg in passing, and a snarling: ...|$|R
60|$|Turning suddenly, she plunged {{over the}} shingle towards the wide, populous bay. <b>He</b> {{remained}} alone, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> the smashing turmoil, careless of her departure. He would easily catch her.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Phelan calls McNulty {{into his}} {{chambers}} and Greggs accompanies him. He asks about a memo from Burrell that states he is shutting the case down for getting into areas beyond its mandate, and {{they agree to}} the opposition involved with it. He then calls Burrell and insists that the wiretaps {{be used for the}} full duration, threatening Burrell with a contempt charge for early termination of the wiretap. <b>He</b> <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> the detectives and asks them, [...] "Whoâ€™s your daddy now?" [...] Later, McNulty tails Stringer and sees him leave a taxi and switch to his car. McNulty follows Stringer and discovers he is taking an introductory economics class at a nearby community college.|$|R
60|$|The {{boatswain}} made no reply, {{except to}} grin with great intelligence as he followed his charge upstairs again. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> intervals until {{the return of}} Susan and Miss Polson, who, trying to look unconcerned, came in later on, both apparently suffering from temper, Susan especially. Amid the sympathetic interruptions of these listeners Chrissie recounted her experiences, while the boatswain, despite his better sense, felt like the greatest scoundrel unhung, a feeling which was fostered by the remarks of Susan and the chilling regards of Miss Poison.|$|E
6000|$|He {{put his arm}} {{about her}} waist; it was a large, strong, {{sophisticated}} arm, and very agreeable; <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> her with a devastating knowingness, while Kennicott glowed inanely. She flushed; she was alarmed by {{the ease with which}} the big-city man invaded her guarded personality. She was glad, in retreat, to scamper ahead of the two men up-stairs to the hall-room in which Hugh slept. All the way Kennicott muttered, [...] "Well, well, say, gee whittakers but it's good to have you back, certainly is good to see you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the sounds}} of man's {{activity}} suddenly commenced, for there was a clatter forward where the Spaniards flung the loose covers from the hatch, and a harsh rattle of chain mingled with the soft patter of their naked feet. In another few moments a sharp, musical clinking broke out, and Austin saw Tom, who {{had served as a}} steamer's donkey-man, straighten his bent back when a rush of white vapour whirled with a strident hissing about the locomotive boiler, which now drove the winch. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> Austin, and glanced at the misty creek, far down which a faint screaming was dying away.|$|E
60|$|Wildly and more--wildly <b>he</b> teetered, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> me his gloating hatred. Then {{came the}} end. All four holds broke {{at the same}} time, and I fell, back-downward, looking up at him, my hands and feet still {{clutching}} the broken twigs. Luckily, there were no wild pigs under me, and my fall was broken by the tough and springy bushes.|$|R
60|$|But Paula, {{different}} in other ways, was {{different in}} this. He {{had never seen}} her display cattishness, never known her {{to be on the lookout}} for other women on the chance of catching them tripping-- except in relation to him. And <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> again <b>at</b> the deliciousness of the affair with Mrs. Dehameney which had been an affair only in Paula's apprehension.|$|R
6000|$|He, too, {{attempted}} a laugh--and came forward {{holding out his}} hand. [...] "What, come back! How d'ye do, Crawley?" [...] he said, the nerves of his mouth twitching as <b>he</b> tried to <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> the intruder.|$|R
6000|$|By-and-bye, he {{returned}} to lay the cloth for supper; it having been arranged between Mrs Todgers and the young ladies, that they should partake of an exclusive veal-cutlet together {{in the privacy of}} that apartment. He entertained them on this occasion by thrusting the lighted candle into his mouth, and exhibiting his face in a state of transparency; after the performance of which feat, he went on with his professional duties; brightening every knife as he laid it on the table, by breathing on the blade and afterwards polishing the same on the apron already mentioned. When he had completed his preparations, <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> the sisters, and expressed his belief that the approaching collation would be of 'rather a spicy sort.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The smooth-faced {{man with}} the tusk rose at once with a sigh, put down the steel fork with {{which he had been}} operating, and departed, {{recognising}} that Meinheer Muller was not a commanding officer to be trifled with, but his companion, the Vilderbeeste, demurred. [...] "What," [...] he said, tossing his head so as to throw the long black hair out of his eyes, [...] "am I not fit to sit at meat with a couple of accursed English--a rooibaatje and a woman? If I had my way he should clean my boots and she should cut up my tobacco;" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> the notion till eyebrows, whiskers, and moustache nearly met round his nose, causing him to look {{for all the world like}} a hairy-faced baboon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had no time}} to vex over my pain, {{for worse}} things were upon me. All the chiefs were crying out in horror. The coffin, {{head-end}} up, had not sunk. It bobbed {{up and down in the}} sea astern of us. And the canoe, without way on it, bow-on to sea and wind, was drifted down by sea and wind upon the coffin. And the glass of it was to us, so that we could see the face and head of Kahekili through the glass; and <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> us through the glass and seemed alive already in the other world and angry with us, and, with other-world power, about to wreak his anger upon us. Up and down he bobbed, and the canoe drifted closer upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>grinning</b> down <b>at</b> them, [...] "the way {{to conquer}} is to act, and he who acts {{promptly}} {{is sure to}} win. This makes a very good prison, from which I am sure you cannot escape. Please amuse yourselves in any way you like, but I must beg you to excuse me, as I have business {{in another part of}} my castle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, zoolum! What oppression!' growled the Jat {{from his}} corner. 'All {{for the sake}} of a jest too.' <b>He</b> had been <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> the freedom of the Saddhu's tongue. 'Thy charms do not work well today, Holy One!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{months it}} is come the seventh since he come in by that very back door--and I hadn't {{set eyes on}} him for seven long years. He stood in the door watchin' me, and {{suddenly}} he let off a yelp--like a dog, and there <b>he</b> was <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> the fright he'd given me. 'Good old Aunty Flo,' he says, 'ain't you dee-lighted to see me?' he says, 'now I'm Reformed.'" ...|$|R
