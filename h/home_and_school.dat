5|$|Born in {{the city}} of St Albans, Hertfordshire, Gibbs {{attended}} How Wood primary school, and as a nine-year-old striker helped his team win a district six-a-side competition. Gibbs began training with and supporting Watford from an early age, and was watching from the Main Stand at Vicarage Road as Watford sealed the Fourth Division title in 1978. Although part of Watford's youth system, he occasionally played for St Albans City's youth team due to their close proximity to his <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school.</b> He also played for Hertfordshire schools at under-14 to under-16 levels.|$|E

Improving the surrounding <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> environment with parent management training and classroom management {{can improve the}} behavior of children with ADHD.

25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> environment {{can improve the}} behavior of children with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E

500|$|Shankly {{wrote in}} his {{autobiography}} that times were hard during his upbringing and that hunger was a prevailing condition, especially during the winter months. He admitted {{that he and his}} friends used to steal vegetables from nearby farms; bread, biscuits and fruit from suppliers' wagons, and bags of coal from the pits. Shankly admitted the act was wrong but claimed it was [...] "devilment more than badness" [...] and the root cause was their constant hunger, but he insists that he and his friends learned from their mistakes and became better people in later years. He was at school from age five until 14. Discipline at both <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> was strict but Shankly said it was character-building. His favourite subject was geography and he played football as often as possible, especially in the school playground, but there was no organised school team.|$|E

In their work Success in Reading and Writing, authors Barbara J. Blackford, Helen Cappleman and Betty Cramer suggest the book be read aloud to children in kindergarten, and the teacher should subsequently quiz members of the class {{to see if they can}} recall items from the boy's shopping list. Authors Diane Stirling, Linda McKay, Georgia Archibald and Shelley Berg recommend the story in their book Character Education Connections: For School, Home and Community, in order to teach children the character trait of responsibility: [...] "A willingness to be accountable for your own actions without blaming others." ...|$|E

60|$|Her {{marriage}} had carried Ellen {{out of the}} narrow world of <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> into another that had seemed at first vastly larger, if only on account of its freedom from the perpetual achievement of small economies. Hitherto the urgent necessity of these had filled life with irksome precautions and clipped the wings of every dream.

60|$|The {{defects and}} {{advantages}} {{of such a}} training were obvious in Fleeming throughout life.

Such as it was at least, his <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> training was now complete; and you are to conceive the lad as being formed in a household of meagre revenue, among foreign surroundings, and under the influence of an imperious drawing-room queen; from whom he learned a great refinement of morals, a strong sense of duty, much forwardness of bearing, all manner of studious and artistic interests, and many ready-made opinions which he embraced with a son's and a disciple's loyalty.|$|E

60|$|In any case, it is Charlotte Brontë who enters Victorian literature. The {{shortest}} way of stating {{her strong}} contribution is, I think, this: that {{she reached the}} highest romance through the lowest realism. She did not set out with Amadis of Gaul in a forest or with Mr. Pickwick in a comic club. She set out with herself, with her own dingy clothes, and accidental ugliness, and flat, coarse, provincial household; and forcibly fused all such muddy materials into a spirited fairy-tale. If the first chapters on the <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> had not proved how heavy and hateful sanity can be, there would really be less point in the insanity of Mr. Rochester's wife--or the not much milder insanity of Mrs. Rochester's husband. She discovered the secret of hiding the sensational in the commonplace: and Jane Eyre remains the best of her books (better even than Villette) because while it is a human document written in blood, {{it is also one}} of the best blood-and-thunder detective stories in the world.|$|E

School was over, absolutely over, and it was chiefly present {{to him that he}} was never to go to school again. It was high summer. The [...] "breaking up" [...] of school had been hilarious; and the excellent maxim, [...] "Last Day's Pay Day," [...] had been observed by him with a scrupulous attention to his honour. He had punched the heads of all his enemies, wrung wrists and kicked shins; he had distributed all his unfinished copybooks, all his school books, his collection of marbles and his mortarboard cap among such as loved him; and he had secretly written in obscure pages of their books, [...] "remember Art Kipps." [...] He had also split the anæmic Woodrow's cane, carved his own name deeply in several places about the premises, and broken the scullery window. He had told everybody so often that he was to learn to be a sea captain that he had come almost to believe the thing himself. And now he was <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> was at an end for him for evermore.|$|E
