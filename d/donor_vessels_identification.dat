40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} for forming an autologous graft by distending a <b>donor</b> blood <b>vessel</b> and harvesting the distended {{portion of the}} vessel. Also provided is a device for in vivo or in vitro vessel distension. Typically the device is implanted, for example using endoscopic techniques, in a patient sometime prior to another surgery on that patient which includes implanting a vascular graft. The device includes a stretching mechanism which {{is attached to a}} <b>donor</b> blood <b>vessel,</b> means for operating the stretching mechanism to cause the vessel to distend, and a controller, preferably externally located, for controlling the operating means. In a preferred embodiment, the device includes a pair of opposed straps, attached to a healthy, small-diameter <b>donor</b> blood <b>vessel</b> such as a femoral artery in the leg. The straps are displaced from each other {{over a period of time}} to continuously distend or elongate the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel.</b> The distended portion of the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> is excised at the time of the bypass surgery. The ends of the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> are then sutured end to end to repair the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel,</b> a procedure common in vascular repair and generally accomplished without complication. The result is a totally autologous, living vascular graft. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sometimes the {{superficial}} temporal artery (STA) {{is not available}} for an extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass procedure. An alternative vessel for an EC-IC bypass is the posterior auricular artery (PAA) if it extends to the temporoparietal area with a diameter large enough. We assessed the prevalence of an appropriate PAA as an alternative <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> and report three illustrative {{cases in which the}} PAA was used for EC-IC bypass surgery. Methods: A literature search was performed {{on the use of the}} PAA as a <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> for bypass surgery. Secondly, a prospective database of bypass surgeries was reviewed to calculate the prevalence of a PAA with a diameter of at least 1 mm in the parietotemporal area. Finally, three illustrative cases are reported that describe various indications for the revascularisation procedures with their clinical, surgical and imaging features. Results: Two articles have previously described the use of the PAA for bypass surgery and their results are summarised. The prevalence of a PAA that would be appropriate for an EC-IC bypass in patients with intracranial vascular pathology is 5. 7...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{addition}} to prosthetic rehabilitation, maxillary defects {{can also be}} surgically reconstructed. Soft-tissue reconstruction employs a radial forearm or latissimus dorsi muscle flap, while bony reconstruction can be achieved using a fibula, iliac crest, or scapular flap. Reconstruction using a scapular flap is further divided into two subgroups: the traditional scapular flap with the circumflex scapular artery as the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> and the scapular angle flap with the angular artery originating from the thoracodorsal artery as the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on four patients who underwent successful reconstruction with a free scapular angle flap between 2009 and 2011, following maxillary resection due to malignancy. RESULTS: Vertical positioning of the scapular angle flap enables reconstruction of the facial contour, whereas its horizontal alignment and microvascular anastomosis makes a bony reconstruction of the hard palate possible. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility, low rate of donor site morbidity {{and shape of the}} scapular angle flap [...] which resembles that of the hard palate [...] render it ideal for plastic reconstruction. The suitability of bone quality for dental rehabilitation with implants is a topic of controversial discussion. The scapular angle flap represents an alternative to obturator prosthesis for the reconstruction of maxillary defects ≥ grade I according to Okay et al...|$|R

40|$|Background—Smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) {{accumulation}} in the intima of vessels {{is a key}} event in the pathogenesis of transplant atherosclerosis. The traditional hypothesis that SMCs in the lesion are derived from the media of the <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> has been challenged by recent observations, but the cell origin is still not well established. Methods and Results—Here, we use a simplified model of artery allografts in transgenic mice to clearly identify the source of SMCs in transplant atherosclerosis. Aortic segments donated by BALB/c mice allografted to ROSA 26 (C 57 B/ 6) mice expressing -galactosidase (gal) in all tissues showed that neointimal cells derived exclusively from host cells. It was also demonstrated that SMCs of neointimal and atherosclerotic lesions in vessels allografted to mice expressing -gal only in SMCs (SM-LacZ) or to apoE-deficient/SM-LacZ mice originated from the recipient, and not <b>donor</b> <b>vessels.</b> Interestingly, bone marrow transplantation of SM-LacZ -gal–expressing cells into aortic allograft recipients revealed completely negative -gal staining of neointimal and atherosclerotic lesions. However, a population of -gal–positive cells in lesions of allografts was observed in chimeric mice with ROSA 26 -gal–expressing marrow cells. When bone marrow cells from both ROSA 26 and SM-LacZ mice were cultured and stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB, -actin and -gal double-positive cells were found, suggesting that bone marrow cells have an ability to differentiate into SMCs. Conclusions—Thus, we provide strong evidence that SMCs of neointimal and atherosclerotic lesions in allografts ar...|$|R

Further, certain complications (such as <b>donor</b> <b>vessel</b> dissection or thrombosis) are unique to CTO–PCI.

In this technique the vessels are held together with circumferential ligatures over an inserted metal ring.

The actual anastomosis with the Rosenbach ring took fifteen seconds and did not require cardiopulmonary bypass.
