5|$|In 2011, Warner Home Video {{released}} a 50th anniversary edition on Blu-ray Disc and DVD, {{making it the}} first home video release where the film is present on its original aspect ratio. For this release, the film was completely restored <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> from an 8K scan of the original 65mm negative. The restoration cost $1 million, {{and was one of}} the highest resolution restorations ever made by Warner Bros. A new musical soundtrack-only option and six new featurettes (one of which was an hour long) were also included.|$|E
5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself and to other band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of Hands and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's <b>Frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>Frame</b> and 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E

50|$|Two {{specific}} types of analytic frames are case and aspect based <b>frames.</b> <b>Framing</b> <b>by</b> case refers to researchers using concepts to classify the phenomena they study, while <b>framing</b> <b>by</b> aspect refers to using concepts to characterize the phenomena. For example, a scientists describing a restaurant, a bus, a coffeehouse and a waiting room as a noninteraction places is assigning them into the same category, thus <b>framing</b> them <b>by</b> case. <b>Framing</b> <b>by</b> aspect is going further and differentiating between cases in a given category (how exactly is noninteraction achieved in those places, what forms of social interaction are permitted in those places, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Later {{models were}} {{fitted with a}} bashplate between the lower <b>frame</b> downtubes (<b>by</b> <b>frame</b> number TB879). The bashplate was dual purpose: to stop dirt {{entering}} the air filter, and also to protect the carburettor from damage. Even later models (<b>by</b> <b>frame</b> number TB1029) were fitted with a further small light steel plate shielding the carburettor float bowl and fitted under {{the heads of the}} front two engine mounting bolts.|$|R
5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a forklift truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E
25|$|In about 2008, {{the film}} was {{digitally}} restored by Prasad Studios, which removed dirt, tears, scratches, and other defects <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eadweard Muybridge's {{sequential}} photography {{of movements}} broken down <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> {{produced in the}} late 19th century depicting {{a wide variety of}} subjects in motion, were known in Europe {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met Étienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His freeze-framed images evoked time and motion. Displayed in a grid, the subject is captured in split-second intervals.|$|E
50|$|The {{dining room}} {{contains}} a fireplace {{much like the}} one in the parlor. The bay window {{at one end of the}} room was used as a tea area. The doors throughout the house are <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> oak <b>frames</b> with a frosted levered window. The doors are all hung on decorative iron hinges.|$|R
5000|$|The main facade is {{oriented}} to the west, ending in gables and arched portal, framed in cornices forming an angle in the centre. This portal is adorned by three concentric circles, being surmounted by cartouche with the inscription [...] "DE ANNO 1752". Above this are two windows with sills, lintel, <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> sash <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|An S and S Coupling {{also known}} as a Bicycle Torque Coupling or BTC is a {{coupling}} which enables bicycle frames to be separated into smaller pieces, usually to facilitate packing and transporting. They can be built into the <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> the <b>frame</b> manufacturer when the frame is originally assembled or they can be added to a frame after it is finished. A special spanner is available for tightening and loosening the couplers.|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} half of the 20th century, Norman McLaren, who was one of the pioneers in {{animated}} movies, made several animated films in which he directly hand-painted the images, and in some cases, also the soundtrack, on each frame of the film. This approach was previously employed in the early years of movies, late 19th and early 20th century. One of the precursors in color hand painting <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> was the Aragonese Segundo de Chomon, that worked with Melies.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, 2006, G4 took Anime Unleashed off the air. In a {{commercial}} that aired on G4, promoting the network's newest additions {{and changes in}} late March and April 2006, it contained both a clip of anime and a quick flash of the Anime Unleashed logo, the logo being more visible when watched <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame.</b> Despite this, and indications by G4 personnel that the block might {{have a chance of}} returning, it never came back on the air and G4 quietly canceled it.|$|E
25|$|A Scanner Darkly is a 2006 American {{animated}} science-fiction thriller film {{directed by}} Richard Linklater, {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick. The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near-future dystopia constantly under intrusive high-tech police surveillance {{in the midst of a}} drug addiction epidemic. The film was shot digitally and then animated using interpolated rotoscope, an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame,</b> for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated look. It was distributed by Warner Independent Pictures.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{existence and}} uniqueness of symmetric approximation of <b>frames</b> <b>by</b> normalized tight <b>frames</b> and of symmetric orthogonalization of bases by orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces. A crucial role {{is played by}} the Hilbert-Schmidt property of a certain operator related to the initial frame or basis...|$|R
50|$|In a {{strip of}} movie film, {{individual}} <b>frames</b> are separated <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> lines. Normally, 24 frames are needed for one second of film. In ordinary filming, the frames are photographed automatically, one after the other, in a movie camera. In special effects or animation filming, the frames are often shot one at a time.|$|R
500|$|Klein {{bicycles}} were {{famous for}} their paintwork, and offered {{a large number of}} custom colours and patterns. The paint used was a Durethane enamel non-metallic paint that cost up to [...] per gallon. The Klein logo was debossed into the <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> painting the <b>frame</b> in the colour of the logo, then applying a mask and painting the pattern.|$|R
25|$|Evans also {{explained}} {{that from the}} earliest stages of development, the team had access to rough cuts of the film, digital models and textures from the visual effects department, motion capture data, sound effects, soundtrack material, still photography from the set, Alan Lee and John Howe's pre-production concept art, and material from the props department. In the case of animating the character of Aragorn, the developers even had Viggo Mortensen and the film's swordmaster, Bob Anderson, came into the studio and perform some of the sword fighting techniques from the film, enabling the development team to recreate the physicality of the character exactly, <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of the process is the {{scanning}} of the film negatives or prints into a digital picture and sound raw format. Depending on the film's condition, it may undergo a physical cleaning before the scanning could begin. The scanned materials will then undergo an automated and a painstaking <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> digital restoration process. The process involves the digital removal of dirt, scratches, fingerprints, discolorations, molds, tape marks, and other damages in the scanned materials. The process also involves the correction of color, brightness, and contrast into its original form often consulting the original cinematographers of each films whenever possible. Subtitles and watermarks, if present, are also remove in the process. The process also involves the restoration and remastering of sound. This involves the syncing of sound to the picture {{and the removal of}} unnecessary noises such as eradicate pops and whistles. Extreme measures were also done to remove copyrighted songs from some films. Dozens of technicians, engineers, and artists work hundreds of hours for each film with restoration cost ranging anywhere between twenty-five thousand pesos and ten million pesos per film.|$|E
25|$|Released on September 12, 2002 in Japan and September 24 in North America, The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 is an {{interactive}} database for the PS2 that documents {{the development of}} Metal Gear Solid 2. It contains a gallery of all the 3D models of characters, scenery and objects {{that were used in}} the game (as well as unused assets), along with corresponding concept art when available. All the real-time cutscenes (or polygon demos) are also available to view (without audio), with the option to pause them at any point, change the camera angle and move them <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame.</b> Other content include storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, preview trailers, music tracks (with the option to play alternate patterns when applicable), the finalized screenplay, Hideo Kojima's original draft (available in Japanese only), a development timeline, and a gallery of Metal Gear Solid related products and merchandise. The disc also includes a sampler selection of VR training missions that were later featured in Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance. In Europe, the disc was bundled as a bonus with the PS2 version of Substance instead of having a stand-alone release. It was also included in the Japanese 20th Anniversary re-release of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on July 2007.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tight frames can be {{characterized}} as those frames which possess optimal numerical stability properties. In this paper, we consider the question of modifying a general frame to generate a tight <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> rescaling its <b>frame</b> vectors; a process which can also be regarded as perfect preconditioning of a <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> a diagonal operator. A frame is called scalable, if such a diagonal opera-tor exists. We derive various characterizations of scalable frames, thereby including the infinite-dimensional situation. Finally, we provide a geometric interpretation of scalability in terms of conical surfaces. 1...|$|R

500|$|The second video, {{directed}} by Irish-born British film director Steve Barron, {{is the most}} recognized video for the song. It was filmed in 1985 at Kim's Café (now called [...] "Savoy" [...] cafe) and on a sound stage in London. The video used a pencil-sketch animation / live-action combination called rotoscoping, in which the live-action footage is traced over <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> to give the characters realistic movements. Approximately 3,000 frames were rotoscoped, which took 16 weeks to complete.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the imaginative layouts of Little Nemo, Sammy Sneeze was confined to a rigid grid and followed a strict formula: Sammy's sneeze would build <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame,</b> contorting the protagonist's face until it erupted in the second-to-last panel. [...] In the closing panel he suffered the consequences—often {{a kick in the}} rear. [...] McCay targeted middle-class pretensions such as consumerism and squeamishness over bodily functions, while reaffirming the social order by ensuring that Sammy received punishment.|$|E
500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the [...] "shower scene" [...] never once shows a knife {{puncturing}} flesh. However, a <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame</b> {{analysis of the}} sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all {{the doors and windows}} and would leave the bathroom and shower door open. She never realized until she first watched the film [...] "how vulnerable and defenseless one is".|$|E

500|$|In 1944 Donen and Kelly choreographed {{the musical}} Anchors Aweigh, {{released}} by MGM in 1945 and starring Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The most famous scene {{in this film}} is when Kelly dances with the cartoon mouse Jerry. The animation was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and is credited to cartoonist Fred Quimby, but {{the idea for the}} scene was Donen's. Originally Donen and Kelly wanted to use either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck for the sequence and met with Walt Disney to discuss the project. At the time Disney was working on a similar idea in The Three Caballeros and was unwilling to allow one of his characters to appear in an MGM film. They spent two months shooting Kelly's dancing and Donen spent a year perfecting the scene <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame.</b> According to Barbera [...] "the net result at the preview of Anchors Away that I went to, blew the audience away." ...|$|E
500|$|The piece {{begins with}} three patrons taking their first sip of Guinness in a London pub. To {{the accompaniment of}} Sammy Davis, Jr.'s {{rendition}} of [...] "The Rhythm of Life" [...] from the 1969 film version of the 1966 Broadway musical Sweet Charity, a reverse-motion sequence begins. The three men retreat from the bar and into the street, other patrons disappearing as they pass. As they move down the street, a reverse time-lapse-style sequence transforms their clothes to match a rapidly changing urban scene, which progresses through modern-day London to the Edwardian period. Electric lights transform into gas lamps and buildings begin to disappear <b>frame</b> <b>by</b> <b>frame.</b> A short cutaway sequence shows the city regressing into the past, shrinking to a small Saxon settlement before disappearing entirely. Returning to the main sequence, the three men's clothes and hairstyles are adjusted into Bronze Age equivalents as they pass through thickening woodland. A close-up {{of one of the}} characters shows his features quickly transformed into those of a caveman. The trio are then frozen in an ice age glacier.|$|E

50|$|In the {{installation}} Lunch Break (2008), designed {{in collaboration with}} architects Escher Gunewardena, a single tracking shot slowly slides down a locker-filled corridor where ironworkers at a Maine shipyard eat their lunch (teasing the 11-minute event into 83 minutes of film). The soundtrack, designed in collaboration with composer Becky Allen and filmmaker James Benning, weaves the diegetic tones created by worker’s voices with industrial sounds and music. In a series of accompanying photographs, Lockhart depicts the workers interacting with each other, including a series of independent business run by the ironworkers catering to their coworkers. Finally eighteen more formalized still-lives of the workers’ lunch boxes serve as portraits of their owners—in each case, the worker is both <b>framed</b> <b>by</b> and <b>frames</b> the work place.|$|R
