50|$|In an anarcho-capitalist society, law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>courts,</b> and {{all other}} {{security}} services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through compulsory taxation. Money, along with all other goods and services, would be privately and competitively provided in an open market. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based dispute resolution organizations under tort and contract law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies.|$|R

In addition to accusations of sexual abuse, facilitators, reportedly, have fallen in love with their communication partners and, relying on FC for consent, initiated sexual, physical contact with people in their care, raising serious ethical and legal problems for facilitators, protective service agencies, law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>court</b> officials, educators, and family members alike.|$|R

Any such costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.|$|R

50|$|Anarcho-capitalism (also {{referred}} to as free-market anarchism, market anarchism, and private-property anarchism) is a political philosophy which advocates {{the elimination of the}} state in favor of individual sovereignty in a free market. In an anarcho-capitalist society, law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>courts,</b> and all other security services would be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation, and money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by privately run law rather than through politics.|$|R

40|$|Judicial {{enforcement}} of foreign annulled awards has engendered fervent debate. Pursuant to Article V(1) (e) of the New York Convention, the <b>enforcement</b> <b>court</b> may refuse to enforce an award {{which has been}} set aside in 2 ̆ 2 the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made. 2 ̆ 2 Yet some <b>enforcement</b> <b>courts</b> have allowed <b>enforcement</b> notwithstanding such annulment, primarily on two bases. The first basis is that Article V(1) (e) is a discretionary ground for non-enforcement. The second basis is that Article VII(1) of the New York Convention allows enforcement {{through the application of}} the more favourable law. This paper examines the judicial disparities in determining the enforceability of foreign annulled awards, and explores the reasons for such disparities. It analyses the various approaches to enforcing foreign annulled awards, highlighting any controversies and challenges for the judiciary. It emphasises the need for harmonious and effective interaction between annulment and {{enforcement of}} arbitral awards, as well as between recognition of foreign judgements and foreign awards. It offers recommendations on determining the enforceability of foreign annulled awards under New York Convention Articles V(1) (e) (the annulment exception to enforcement), VII(1) (the more favourable enforcement provision) and V(2) (b) (the public policy exception to enforcement) ...|$|R

50|$|Public {{policy is}} {{determined}} by a range of political institutions, which give policy legitimacy to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes {{the use of force}} in applying or implementing policy (through government control of law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>court</b> systems, imprisonment and armed forces). The legislature, executive and judicial branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or arm's length bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government commissions, tribunals, regulatory agencies and electoral commissions.|$|R
