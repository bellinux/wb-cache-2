Due to this, the Malaysian federal government are alleged as practising a bias management to immigrants for political intention to change the population demography as special treatment only been given to asylum seekers who are Muslims.|$|E

In Georgia, the team quickly rose to the top despite being very young and without the traditional “paying dues” period <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were so believable in their role as power monsters. They gained a reputation for being very stiff and not selling simply because they could and as a result most of their matches ended quickly.

She referred to 22 Indonesian women and named four women needing help and stated the amount of their debts. She called for donations to be made directly to the director of the Dammam women's prison in order to reimburse the women's debts and free them.|$|E
500|$|Putnam cited {{examples}} from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties. The answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about {{such things as the}} nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lack the same neurochemistry as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "highly implausible" [...] conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as the [...] "likelihood argument".|$|E

Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very few of our protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in what I would call a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally unblemished gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> could [...] "stare at his ass for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude".

500|$|On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a {{march in}} Brick Lane, {{organised}} by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding {{a ban on}} alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as [...] "strongly linked" [...] to Anjem Choudary's banned group Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted [...] "hundreds" [...] would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come {{from as far away}} as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: “What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them that <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E
500|$|Days {{prior to}} this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that [...] "there is no {{precedent}} where government will go after people for costs <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have {{money to pay for}} it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for", although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, [...] "We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong". Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.|$|E

500|$|This government, which {{soon came}} to be known as the [...] "Thirty Tyrants" [...] for its excesses and atrocities, rapidly set about {{establishing}} its control over the city. The oligarchs, led by Critias, one of the [...] "overseers" [...] and a former exile, summoned a Spartan garrison to ensure their safety and then initiated a reign of terror, executing any men who they thought might possess sufficient initiative or a large enough following to effectively challenge them. It was this campaign that first drove a wedge between Theramenes and the leaders of the Thirty; initially a supporter of Critias, Theramenes now argued that it was unnecessary to execute men who had shown no sign of wishing the oligarchy harm <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had been popular under the democracy. This protest, however, failed to slow the pace of the executions, so Theramenes next argued that, if the oligarchy was to govern by force, it must at least expand its base; fearful that Theramenes might lead a popular movement against them, Critias and the leaders of the Thirty issued a list of 3,000 men who would be associates in the new government. When Theramenes again objected that this number was still too small, the leaders arranged for a military review to be staged after which the citizens were ordered to pile their arms; with the help of the Spartan garrison, the oligarchs then confiscated all arms except those belonging to the 3,000.|$|E
