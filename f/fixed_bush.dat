50|$|The ASP was a {{reworked}} Smith & Wesson Model 39 or 39-2, {{employing a}} shortened slide; a <b>fixed</b> <b>bushing</b> (in lieu of the Smith & Wesson designed collet bushing); the unique Guttersnipe sight system; clear Lexan grip-panels; a fully ramped and throated, shortened barrel; and a smoothed and radiused profile to ensure no risk of snagging on the draw.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>bushing</b> was tightly {{fitted to}} the {{shortened}} barrel and dry-lubricated by Teflon-S, which {{was applied to}} all components of the pistol, {{with the exception of}} the clear Lexan grip panels. This coating is somewhat more durable than the more typical Teflon formulations used in cooking appliances and utensils. The unique sighting system, referred to as the [...] "Guttersnipe", was a narrowing U-channel with fluorescent yellow panels that would form three triangles, all pointed at the target when the sight was properly aligned.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{coefficient}} of friction for the bronze material (CuZn 25 Al 6) with insert graphite beds and other bronze material (CuSn 12) are investigated in this paper. Friction coefficient was investigated experimentally by the testing machine Tribotestor` 89 which uses {{the principle of the}} ring on ring method. The external <b>fixed</b> <b>bushing</b> was exposed to the normal load of the same size in all tests. Process of load was increased from level 50 N to 600 N during run up 300 s, after the run up the appropriate level of load was held. The internal bushing performed a rotational movement with constant sliding speed. The value of sliding speed was changed individually for every sample (v = 0. 2 (0. 3, 0. 4) m. s- 1). The forth test had a rectangular shape of sliding speed with direct current component 0. 3 m. s- 1 and the amplitude 0. 1 m. s- 1 period 300 s, the whole test took 2100 s. Th...|$|R

60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} Wilfrid, {{who had his}} eyes <b>fixed</b> on a <b>bush</b> from which four or five shots had been fired, waiting for another puff of smoke to {{indicate}} the exact position in which the man was lying, heard the sharp report of Mr. Atherton's rifle.|$|R
60|$|The thrilling, pathetic tone {{in which}} these words were uttered {{affected}} me not a little; and when the ceremony was over I continued staring vacantly at the speaker, ignorant {{of the fact that}} the beautiful young girl had her wide-open, startled eyes <b>fixed</b> on the <b>bush</b> which, I vainly imagined, concealed me from view.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Somasco's mine, and Carnaby--when I ask for it, {{with all}} that lies beneath me here," [...] he said, and sat very still a space, with eyes that had lost their keenness <b>fixed</b> upon the <b>bush.</b> He {{did not see the}} big balsam in front of him nor the dusky firs, for it was once more the picture of a woman with red-gold hair {{standing}} in an English rose garden his fancy painted him.|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 180 bovine mandibular {{permanent}} incisors, extracted {{and stored in}} 10 % formaldehyde solution, were used. After 7 days of fixation, they were cleaned, and the periodontal tissue that adhered to their roots was removed. When cleaning was concluded, they were <b>fixed</b> in reduction <b>bushes</b> measuring 25 × 20 (PVC, Tigre, Joinvile, Brazil) with self-polymerizing acrylic resin and stored in water under refrigeration for 7 days at a temperature of 5 °C.|$|R
50|$|The {{axle box}} guide, which is welded to the bogie frame has a polymer washer (homopolymer acetal guide) <b>bush</b> <b>fixed</b> at the head. A polymer packing ring and {{a guide ring}} is {{attached}} with the Acetal guide bush. These two components act as piston rings for the axle box guide. In {{order to ensure that}} the packing ring and the guide ring retain their respective place, a dashpot spring is fixed which applies continuous pressure on the piston ring.|$|R
60|$|He was unpleasantly {{conscious}} of it then, which was partly why he lay raised on his elbow, {{with his eyes}} <b>fixed</b> on the <b>bush</b> that shut in the narrow strip of land. It rose before him, laced with tangled creepers, mysterious, and shadowy, {{and it seemed to}} him that somebody or something was watching him from its dim recesses. He had been {{conscious of}} the same sensation when he plodded with a Spanish seaman along the narrow trail to the dug up beach, an hour earlier, but it was stronger now, and instinctively he slipped his hand into a pocket where the pistol he had bought in Grand Canary lay. Then he laughed in a listless fashion, for they had seen no more of the negroes since the blowing up of the headman's house, and he felt that he had not them to fear. There was, in fact, no tangible cause for apprehension at all.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the <b>Bushing,</b> <b>fixed</b> in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} Malcolm wandered {{along the bank}} closely {{examining}} the bushes as he went, {{to see if any}} boats might be concealed among them, for the fishermen and boatmen would naturally try to save their craft when they heard that the Imperialists were destroying them. He walked three miles up the river without success. As he returned he kept his eyes <b>fixed</b> on the <b>bushes</b> on the opposite bank. When within half a mile of the camp he suddenly stopped, for his eye caught something dark among them. He went to the water's edge and stooped, the better to see under the bushes, and saw what he doubted not to be the stern of a boat hauled up and sheltered beneath them. He leapt to his feet with a joyful exclamation. Here was the means of crossing the river; but the boat had to be brought over. Once afloat this would be easy enough, but he was sure that his own strength would be insufficient to launch her, and that he should need the aid of at least one man. On returning to camp he called aside the sergeant of his company, James Grant, who was from his own estate in Nithsdale, and whom he knew to be a good swimmer.|$|R
40|$|The Optimized Route Capability (ORC) concept {{proposed}} by the FAA facilitates traffic managers to identify and resolve arrival flight delays caused by bottlenecks formed at arrival meter fixes when there exists imbalance between arrival fixes and runways. ORC makes use of the prediction capability of existing automation tools, monitors the traffic delays based on these predictions, and searches the best reroutes upstream of the meter fixes based on the predictions and estimated arrival schedules when delays are over a predefined threshold. Initial implementation and evaluation of the ORC concept considered only reroutes {{available at the time}} arrival congestion was first predicted. This work extends previous work by introducing an additional dimension in reroute options such that ORC can find the best time to reroute and overcome the 'firstcome- first-reroute' phenomenon. To deal with the enlarged reroute solution space, a genetic algorithm was developed to solve this problem. Experiments were conducted using the same traffic scenario used in previous work, when an arrival rush was created for one of the four arrival meter <b>fixes</b> at George <b>Bush</b> Intercontinental Houston Airport. Results showed the new approach further improved delay savings. The suggested route changes from the new approach were on average 30 minutes later than those using other approaches, and fewer numbers of reroutes were required. Fewer numbers of reroutes reduce operational complexity and later reroutes help decision makers deal with uncertain situations...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the designs}} of other early {{semi-automatic}} pistols, Browning's design used a full length slide that covered {{the full length of}} the barrel, as opposed to other designs which utilized a barrel and bolt that slid in grooves machined in the frame. In the Browning design, the slide fitted into rails in the frame, and was integral with the bolt. The barrel rode in locking grooves machined into the interior of the slide, but attached to swinging links secured to the frame, one at the front and one at the rear. When the slide is forward (i.e., in battery), the length of the links holds the barrel up, locking it securely into matching grooves in the slide. Upon recoiling, the barrel and slide move backwards a short distance, locked together, until the arc of the links pulls the barrel downwards, disengaging it from the slide and halting its rearward motion. The barrel then stops moving, while the slide continues rearwards, extracting and ejecting the fired cartridge case and then returns forward, loading a fresh cartridge from the magazine. The barrel is caught, and moved forward with the slide, the camming action of the links lifting it again to lock into the matching grooves. This is identical to the modern style of short recoil action as developed for the later M1911, with the exception of employing both front and rear links, which causes the whole barrel to remain parallel to the slide as it drops out of the locking grooves. The M1911, and most other pistols since, found that it was only necessary to use a single rear link and locking grooves in the rear. When the slide retracts, only the rear of the barrel is dropped, causing it to tilt relative to the slide, while a <b>fixed</b> barrel <b>bushing</b> holds the front of the barrel in place when the slide is in battery, yet allows for movement of the slide and barrel. This approach was found to work perfectly well, and saved in complexity, cost of manufacture, as well as simplicity of assembly and disassembly.|$|R
