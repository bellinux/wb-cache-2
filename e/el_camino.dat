5|$|During the 1930s, two U.S. highways, both {{formed in}} 1926, were {{extended}} into California using <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Sierra. The southern terminus of U.S.395 was extended from Spokane, Washington to San Diego, using <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Sierra from near {{what is now}} Topaz Lake to Inyokern, by 1935. By 1937, U.S. Route 6 was extended from Colorado, mostly along the Midland Trail, to Long Beach using <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Sierra south of Bishop. As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering US6 was truncated at Bishop, and the route from the separation with US395 to I-5 was renumbered SR14.|$|E
5|$|When the Bayshore Highway was {{completed}} in 1937, U.S. Route 101 signs were moved to it from <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real, and <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> became U.S. Route 101 Alternate. Businesses along <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> created the <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real Association to protest the move and resulting loss of business, and by 1939 the main route had been moved back, with the Bayshore Highway becoming U.S. Route 101 Bypass. The two routes split in San Jose at the junction of First and Second Streets near Keyes Street, with the <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> route mostly following the present SR 82 and the Bayshore route using locally maintained Second, Reed, and Fourth Streets to reach the state-maintained Bayshore Highway. In San Francisco, they rejoined at the present location of the Alemany Maze, with the <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> route following Alemany Boulevard from near the city line; from there US 101 continued north on Bay Shore Boulevard, Potrero Avenue, and 10th and Fell Streets to Van Ness Avenue, meeting the Bay Bridge approach (US 40/US 50) at Bryant and Harrison Streets. The Bryant/Harrison one-way pair was added to Route 68 (which already included the bridge) in 1937 and removed in 1947 along with the bridge; in 1961 the new freeway approach became part of Route 68, which was extended back over the bridge to Route 5 at its Oakland landfall.|$|E

5|$|Sierra Highway or <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Sierra is a road in Southern California, United States. <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Sierra {{refers to}} {{the full length of}} a trail formed in the 19th century, rebuilt as {{highways}} in the early 20th century, that ran from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe following parts of modern State Route 14, U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89. Two portions of this road are currently signed as Sierra Highway. The first is an old alignment of SR14/U.S. Route 6 from Los Angeles to Mojave. This road is also signed with the unusual designation of State Route14U through the city of Santa Clarita. The second part signed as Sierra Highway is a portion of US395 in Bishop.|$|E
5|$|Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges {{were built}} across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled {{up at the}} north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real towards San Jose as the only {{reasonable}} alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the additional traffic that the bridge would attract.|$|E

In 2001, Gagnon packed up his mobile studio and moved The <b>El</b> <b>Caminos</b> into a lake house in Gainesville, GA. Here, Gagnon tracked all 13 songs while playing lead guitar.

5|$|The Bayshore Freeway {{is a part}} of U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. {{state of}} California. It runs along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay, {{connecting}} San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway is also known as James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards. Before 1964, it was mostly marked as U.S. Route 101 Bypass, with US 101 using the present State Route 82 (<b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real).|$|E
5|$|In May 1769, Gaspar de Portolà {{established}} the Fort Presidio of San Diego {{on a hill}} near the San Diego River. It was the first settlement by Europeans {{in what is now}} the state of California. In July of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcalá was founded by Franciscan friars under Junípero Serra. By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in California of the historic mission trail <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real. Both the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971. While the <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September, {{and the rest of}} the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining traffic signal. Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.|$|E
5|$|From I-5 to I-15, SR76 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is {{not part}} of the National Highway System, a network of {{highways}} that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR76 is legally eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The part of the highway from the western terminus to Douglas Drive is also named for Tony Zeppetella, an Oceanside police officer killed while on duty performing a traffic stop in 2003. In 2014, SR76 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,400 between East Palomar Road and the eastern terminus at SR79, and 55,000 between Airport Road and <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real in Oceanside, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E
5|$|The roadway {{carrying}} the SR76 designation begins at County Route S21 (CRS21) in Oceanside, although Caltrans {{does not consider}} the road west of I-5 {{to be part of}} the route, and it is not in the legal definition. There is soon an interchange with I-5, after which SR76 becomes a four-lane expressway known as the San Luis Rey Mission Expressway. From I-5 to Mission Avenue, the highway parallels the San Luis Rey River until it passes by Oceanside Municipal Airport. During this stretch, SR76 intersects Loretta Street, Canyon Drive, Benet Road, Airport Road, and Foussat Road. There are two overpasses: one over Mission Avenue, and one over <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> Real, before the road intersects Douglas Drive, the main road to the San Luis Rey gate of Camp Pendleton. After an intersection with Rancho Del Oro Road, SR76 passes over Mission Avenue again before intersecting with Old Grove Road, Frazee Road, a turnoff into the Towne Center North shopping center, and College Boulevard.|$|E
