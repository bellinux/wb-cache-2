Aim for calculating stress {{intensity}} factor (short for SIF) of different position plates with eccentric crack, and the change tendency between different positions and SIF, the crack model is built by finite element software, and the SIF change tendency line with different width plates is got. It is seen from the von Mises stress cloud chart of ANSYS that the deformation of plate is effected by crack; {{as the center of}} crack is gradually close to the edge of plate, SIF is increasing. When the distance between the center and edge of crack is decreasing down to 3 / 8, SIF is increasing fiercely, that means, the plate at this time has already reached the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture.</b> If continue loading the stretch, the crack will be apparent on the plate. And the curvature equation is got by index decay adapting...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultrasonic}} nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) on the fatigue behavior of Ti 6 Al 4 V (TC 4) in simulated body fluid (SBF) was investigated. UNSM {{with the condition}} of a static load of 25 N, vibration amplitude of 30 μm and 36, 000 strikes per unit produced about 35 μm surface severe plastic deformation (SPD) layers on the TC 4 specimens. One group was treated with a hybrid surface treatment (UNSM + TiN film). UNSM technique improves the micro hardness and the compressive residual stress. The surface roughness is increased slightly, {{but it can be}} remarkably improved by the TiN film. The fatigue strength of TC 4 is improved by about 7. 9 % after UNSM. Though the current density of corrosion is increased and the pitting corrosion is accelerated, UNSM still improved the fatigue strength of TC 4 after pre-soaking in SBF by 10. 8 %. Interior cracks initiate at the deformed carbide and oxide inclusions due to the ultrasonic impacts of UNSM. Corrosion products are always observed at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> surface to both interior cracks and surface cracks. Coating a TiN film on the UNSMed surface helps to improve the whole properties of TC 4 further...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{inspections}} and electron micrographic observations {{have been carried}} out on the shaped specimens from the chips of iron (0. 009 %C) and S 15 C steel. It is expected that the informations on the deformation structure and properties of the material after heavy straining under very high rate of strain can be derived from the experiments. 　The results are shown in brief. 　 1) The top of the iron chip shows itself in wavy lamellae piled up in the cutting direction. 　 2) Tensile specimen of the chip failed in brittle feature apparently, while the steps of slip plane {{can be found in the}} narrow zone at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> surface. 　 3) The fracture surface comprises about 20 ～ 30 % of dimple pattern and 70 ～ 80 % of rather flat area. The dimple pattern with a diameter of about 0. 3 μ implies the generation of a large number of microcracks in heavily strained zone. 　 4) The flow stress of the chip, being different from the case of small amount of strain by conventional dynamic testing, is not always smaller than that of the specimen with the corresponding strain by compressing statically. 　 5) Electron micrographs on the etched surface of sectioned chip are characterized by lamellae with uniform spacing, which are not observed in the deformed specimen compressed statically. This implies in comparison of cutting with uniaxial straining that it is difficult to consider the workhardening to be independent of the deformation path...|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy of poking reduction, bone grafting and pedicle screw implanting through injured vertebra in treatment <b>of</b> thoracolumbar burst <b>fracture.</b> Methods 　Fifty-seven patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures between January 2013 and December 2013 were treated in Chengdu Military General Hospital by poking reduction, bone grafting and pedicle screw implanting through injured vertebra. All {{the patients were}} observed and recorded for basic conditions and complications. At pre-operation, 1 week post-operation and last follow-up, pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and neurological function score (ASIA) were recorded and the compression ratio <b>of</b> anterior <b>edge</b> and posterior <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> vertebra, compression ratio of spinal canal and Cobb angle were measured and statistically analyzed in all the patients. Results 　All the patients acquired surgical success with operation time about 70 - 120 min and blood loss about 120 - 280 ml. There was no spinal cord or nerve injury and no dural tear during the surgery. All the patients were followed up for 12 to 36 months and the neurological function significantly recovered. X-ray and CT examination at last follow-up showed good fracture healing, good position and no loosening of internal fixation device. At 1 week post-operation and last follow-up, VAS, compression ratio <b>of</b> anterior <b>edge</b> and posterior <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> vertebra, compression ratio of spinal canal and Cobb angle were significantly lower than those at pre-operation (P 0. 05). Conclusions 　Poking reduction, bone grafting and pedicle screw implanting through injured vertebra can effectively restore height of injured vertebra and reduce the compression of spinal canal, which will help correction of spinal kyphosis and recovery of spinal cord function. This method can well maintain height of injured vertebra and significantly reduce risk of long-term vertebral collapse. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2016. 09. 0...|$|R

All patients underwent pre-operative examination of bone mineral density with T-score ≤- 2. 5 and augmentation of pedicle screw fixation with injection of 1. 5 ml bone cement in adjacent to fractured vertebra. All patients {{were treated with}} anti-osteoporosis therapy pre- and post-operation, ob¬served and recorded with basic conditions and complications. At pre-operation, one-week post-operation and last follow-up, pain vi¬sual analogue scale (VAS) and neurological function score (ASIA) of all patients were recorded, and the compression rats of anterior and posterior <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> vertebra, and compression rats of spinal canal and Cobb angel of all patients were measured. Results　All the 53 patients were successfully undergone operation in about 90 - 140 min with blood loss of about 150 - 350 ml. No spinal cord or nerve injury, dural tear and obvious leakage of bone cement and screw loosening occurred during operation. All patients were followed up for 12 to 36 months and the neurological function obviously recovered contrasted with pre-operation. X-ray and CT examination at last follow-up showed good fractures healing, good position and non-loosening of internal fixation device and non-leakage of bone cement. At one week post-operation and last follow-up, VAS, compression rats <b>of</b> anterior <b>edge</b> and posterior <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> vertebra, compression rats of spinal canal and Cobb angel were significantly lower than those at pre-operation (P 0. 05).

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. The mechanisms controlling the onset of minor slope instability at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> rocky plateaux exhibiting lateral spreading phenomena are yet to be fully understood. Hypotheses have recently been introduced to explain the influence of groundwater within these plateaux on geomorphological processes leading to slope instability. We present a back analysis of a recent landslide which occurred on 27 th February 2014 {{in the town of}} San Leo, Italy. The role of the softening of basal clay shales and erosion due to seepage is investigated using finite element geomechanical models. Both processes were observed in the field and are related to groundwater discharging along the contact between the rocky slab and the clay-rich substratum. Fracture propagation paths involving pre-existing discontinuities and intact rock bridges failure were simulated using a simplified discrete fracture network (DFN) model coupled with a Voronoi polygonal mesh approach. Model results allow the failure to be classified as a secondary toppling phenomenon. Moreover, a critical amount of undermining was indicated by the models agreeing with field observations made prior to the failure. Based on the modelling results, an interpretation of the overall mechanism inducing failures at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> rock slabs is given. In particular, the inter-relationships between groundwater flow and geomorphic processes acting within the rock masses are presented...|$|R

To determine the chemical characteristics of the pieces, Antonio Martínez of the Physics Department of the UPR and Pablo Llerandi of General Studies at University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus (UPR-RP) have been involved in an initiative to complete studies on X-ray diffraction and spectrography, in order to further pinpoint the properties of the prime matter. In order to determine the characteristics of the traces the high power microscopes of the UPR-RP were used to carry out high magnification studies in which perpendicular striations were noted as part of a pointer drag technique. Some pieces do display characters that were added later than those in the others, implying that some were created afterwards. However, the manner in which some of the pieces have been intemperized (in particular the presence of differential intemperization in some that has rounded the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> in only one of the sides) is inconsistent with them being fabrications that were forged in the late 1870s and then stored indoors ever since, instead suggesting that they were exposed to the elements for a prolonged time period. Further efforts are being made to fund a collaboration with Leiden University to advance this research area with their specialists.|$|R

I have hardly said {{anything}} about waves of torrents or waterfalls, as I do not consider them subjects for beginners to practice upon; but, as many of our younger artists are almost breaking their hearts over them, it may be well to state at once that it is physically impossible to draw a running torrent quite rightly, the luster of its currents and whiteness of its foam being dependent on intensities of light which art has not at its command. This also is to be observed, that most young painters make their defeat certain by attempting to draw running water, which is a lustrous object in rapid motion, without ever trying their strength on a lustrous object standing still. Let them break a coarse green-glass bottle into a great many bits, and try to paint those, with all their undulations and <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture,</b> as they lie still on the table; if they cannot, of course they need not try the rushing crystal and foaming <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> the stream. If they can manage the glass bottle, let them next buy a fragment or two of yellow fire-opal; {{it is quite a}} common and cheap mineral, and presents, as closely as anything can, the milky bloom and color of a torrent wave: and if they can conquer the opal, they may at last have some chance with the stream, as far as the stream is in any wise possible. But, as I have just said, the bright parts of it are not possible, and ought, as much as may be, to be avoided in choosing subjects. A great deal more may, however, be done than any artist has done yet, in painting the gradual disappearance and lovely coloring of stones seen through clear and calm water.|$|R

Using state-of-the-art 3 D coupled thermo-mechanical numerical models, we simulate for the first time, crustal deformation at the onset of oceanisation along large offset oblique margins. Our models show that obliquity causes oceanic rift propagation to stall, resulting in an apparent polyphased tectonic evolution, and in some circumstances leads to the formation of hyper-extended margins. As a result, conjugate margins located at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> future <b>fracture</b> zones are highly asymmetric from rifting to spreading, with their lengths differing by a factor of 5 to 10, before the the final phase of break-up occurs.

SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers.

During the subsequent remodeling phase, osteoclasts are very active. A major paradigm of osteoclast biology has emerged {{with the discovery of}} the receptor activator nuclear factor kB (RANK), its ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG), which are heavily involved in bone resorption, regulating osteoclast activity. RANK is a membrane receptor on osteoclasts and immune system cells, and binding with RANKL is necessary to promote differentiation, survival and activation of osteoclastic cells. OPG acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL and prevents RANK–RANKL binding. In contrast to RANKL and RANK, which are produced in small amounts and the expression of which is mainly restricted to the skeletal and immune system, OPG is produced in high concentrations by cells of the osteoblast lineage and by many different tissues and cell types, such as smooth muscle, endothelial and epithelial cells [5, 6].

This class of sheet metals are prone to edge fracture during stamping production, and the fracture often occurs at much lower strain than that predicted based on the forming limit curves. The uncertainty in predicting edge fracture represents a great challenge in the application of AHSS. This dissertation is focused on the better understanding <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> <b>fracture</b> phenomenon through experimental observation and computer modeling with the consideration of microstructure effect. In this dissertation, Hole Expansion (HE) test was used to investigate the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> two AHSS, Dual Phase DP 780 and DP 980. The HE test includes two processing steps: hole punching and hole expanding. The punching process creates holes <b>of</b> various sheared <b>edge</b> morphologies, which are the input to the hole expanding process, along with the intrinsic property of material, produce a joint effect on the crack initiation and propagation on the sheared edges during HE test. The hole punching process was first investigated. The sheared edges were analyzed with image processing, and the relative heights <b>of</b> sheared four <b>edge</b> zones were measured, which were used to determine the strain distributions <b>of</b> sheared <b>edges.</b> The punching process was further simulated with FEA, and referenced with the experimental observations. <b>Fracture</b> mechanism <b>of</b> hole punching process was deduced. The process of crack initiation and propagation in hole expanding process was studied the next. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe cracks on the sheared edges. FEA simulation was applied to investigate the effect <b>of</b> sheared <b>edge</b> geometry on the stress evolution in the hole expanding process. The interaction of two neighboring parallel cracks in the crack propagation process was analyzed to explain the effect of crack population on the main crack propagation. To investigate the microstructure effect on the edge fracture, the dual phase grain structure and its effect on mechanical properties and <b>fracture</b> behavior <b>of</b> DP steels were analyzed. Based on HE test results and observed DP steel grain structures, a criterion to predict edge fracture was proposed. This criterion includes mesoscale grain structure features of DP steels, and it can be applied to predict the HE test results of DP steels.

40|$|Two {{examples}} of en echelon mining-induced fractures seen in hard-rock mines provided {{a basis for}} inferring that fracture zones and bedding plane separations immediately surrounding mine openings are promoted by oblique shear into the openings. It is hypothesized that initial fractures or separations form {{at the corners of}} openings as a result of high stress and physical constraint on the rock's ability to deform elastically toward the opening. These conditions result in a locally preferred direction of shearing. The shearing, in turn, generates tensile stress that initiates a progression <b>of</b> systematically offset <b>fractures</b> approximately parallel to the direction of greatest compressive stress. The fractures or bedding separations create tabular rock layers that amplify shearing displacement through bending and dilation. Such shearing effectively reduces and redistributes the compressive stress, but significant dilation is an inevitable consequence. The combination of dilation and shearing and the progressive development <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> zones have important implications with respect to ground support. The concept <b>of</b> mining-induced <b>fractures</b> forming as a result of shear is illustrated by two examples from coal mines. First, fractures seen at longwall faces probably result from shear associated with subsidence. The fracture zone that develops approximates or possibly defines the draw angle of subsidence. As the face advances, fractures extend downward along the lower <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> zone, while upper extensions <b>of</b> the <b>fractures</b> are pressed closed. Fracture zones in entry roofs provide a second practical example. Here, mining-induced fractures typically follow bedding planes. The shear zone model suggests that the first bedding separations develop near the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the roof and successive separations progress upward and toward the center. However, if the direction of greatest stress is inclined with respect to the roof, a fracture or bedding separation zone may propagate from one side only and also extend higher. Because coal ahead of the face provides some support against lateral shear deformation, bedding separation is inhibited near the face. Rock bolts installed close to the face ultimately become more strained and bent than bolts installed a few meters from the face, and bolts installed through the more remote part of a separation zone may ultimately experience the greatest tensile and bending strains. This model is supported by field data documenting progressive bolt failures that rapidly propagated downward across the roof during face advance...|$|R

Fractures within the Entrada Sandstone at the Salt Valley Anticline are associated with salt mobility within the underlying Paradox Formation. The fracture relationships observed at Salt Valley (along with examples from Paleozoic strata at the southern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Holbrook basin in northeastern Arizona, and sandstones of the Frontier Formation along the western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming), show that although each fracture domain may contain consistently oriented fractures, the orientations and patterns <b>of</b> the <b>fractures</b> vary considerably from domain to domain. Most <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> patterns in the brittle sandstones are related to local stresses created by subtle, irregular flexures resulting from mobility of the associated, interbedded ductile strata (halite or shale).

While the cubic law for single-phase flow has been well established for parallel-plate fractures theoretically and experimentally, no reliable measurements of multi-phase flow in frac-tures have been reported. This work reports the design and fabrication of an apparatus for visualization of two-phase flow and for measurement of gas-liquid relative permeability in realistic rough-walled rock fractures. A transparent replica of a natural rock fracture from a core specimen is fabricated by molding and casting in clear epoxy. Simultaneous flow of gas and liquid with control of capillary pressure at inlet and outlet is achieved with the Hassler “sandwich ” design: liquid is injected to the fracture through a porous block, while gas is injected directly to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> through channels in the porous block. A similar arrangement maintains capillary separation of the two phases at the outlet. Pressure drops in each pha::e across the fracture, and capillary pressures at the inlet and outlet, are controlled by means of pumps and needle valves, and are measured by differential and absolute pressure transducers. The clear epoxy cast <b>of</b> the natural <b>fracture</b> preserves the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> and pennits visual observation of phase distributions.

The process <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> healing starts following the disruption of vessels that causes hematoma and activates thrombotic factors in the coagulation cascade. This leads to an inflammatory response within which cytokines and growth factors recruit osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal cells that generate a granulation tissue at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fractured</b> bone. The granulation tissue is then replaced by bone, formed either by intramembranous (direct) bone formation or through a hyaline cartilage tissue that is subsequently mineralized to woven bone through endochondral (indirect) bone formation (Shapiro, 2008; Ghiasi et al., 2017). This then results in the fracture being stabilized and the tissue is later remodeled. Manually inflicted <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the rat tibia with either internal or external fixation have been described by several authors as a model to study fracture healing. The inadequate stability of internal or external fixation leads to variable degrees of displacement and repeated movement of the bone fragments during the healing period (Slätis and Rokkanen, 1965, 1967; Glatt et al., 2017). The ideal experimental <b>fracture</b> should be <b>of</b> consistent site, with the standard degree of bone damage, soft tissue injury, stability and displacement of the bone fragments, and the time needed for bone union should also be standardized (Greiff, 1978). The soft tissues also have an important role in fracture bone healing. For example, callus formation around the fracture provides temporary stabilization. The release of various mediators and sprouting of newly formed blood vessels are also contributed by the soft tissues in the milieu. In addition, the surrounding muscles contribute to stabilization and strengthening of the long bone fracture (Otto et al., 1995; Loi et al., 2016).|$|R

40|$|The {{sector of}} Antarctica facing Australia east of 139 °E is {{characterized}} by the abundance of exceptionally long oceanic fracture zones that are collinear to post-rift right-lateral strike–slip fault systems developed at the northeastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic continent. High-resolution reflection seismic profiles indicate recent strike–slip activity at the southeastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Balleny <b>Fracture</b> Zone, similar to what is observed onshore in North Victoria Land. The architecture, kinematics, and timing of this intraplate deformation at the northeastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Antarctica cannot be reconciled with typical plate tectonic kinematics, in particular, with a classical divergent plate boundary environment. Here we show that combined geological and geophysical data in northeastern Antarctica support the post-rift southeastward reactivation of the passive margin east of 139 °E along intraplate rightlateral strike–slip deformation belts. These deformation belts include oceanic transform faults and their collinear oceanic fracture zone and continental shear zone extensions. A striking consequence is that there is intraplate accommodation of transform fault slip in this region of Earth's surface along fracture zones and a long-active region of intracontinental deformation that is ‘reusing’ prior plate boundary fault zones. As the intraplate termination of plate boundary transform faulting is not predicted by classical plate tectonic theory; this region {{is one of the most}} clear examples of the transition from rigid to semi-rigid plate tectonic deformation during the formation and long-lived incubation of a potential new plate boundary...|$|R
40|$|We {{have found}} an impact crater {{that is likely}} < 6000 years old. Burckle crater is in the central Indian Ocean on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fracture</b> zone at 30. 87 ° S 61. 36 °E. The crater is 29 ± 1 km wide and is the {{inferred}} source of layers with high magnetic susceptibility in 3 deep sea cores. Each layer goes {{to the top of}} the core. Two out of 3 of the cores have basal Pleistocene ages and the basal age of the third is unknown. The high susceptibility layers contain broken plagioclase, spinel periodotite, and chrysotile asbestos. One sample contains pure Ni with drops of oxidized Ni. Because pure Ni melts at 1453 °C, it is very likely that the drops formed during an impact. The high susceptibility layers from 2 cores are over 5 times thicker than they should be for a 29 km wide source crater. We also find that a 29 km wide source crater cannot vaporize enough seawater to produce meters of rain, even in a restricted region between 4750 and 7250 km from the crater. Thus, we infer that Burckle crater was produced as part of a Shoemaker-Levy type impact of a comet. The fragmented comet also produced two other large impact centers, one in the northwest Pacific and another in the central eastern Pacific. Where the rainout from these impact centers overlaps, we see deluge events that are over a week long. The impact event also produced devastating tsunamis, winds, and associated social upheaval. We date the event to around 2807 B. C...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} <b>of</b> two-parametric <b>fracture</b> criterion to {{the problem}} of cracks limit equilibrium in homogeneous media or at an interface of two different materials is considered. The necessary condition of the crack tip limit equilibrium is the equality of the energy release rate and the rate of the energy dissipation by the bonds (the first condition <b>of</b> <b>fracture).</b> The second condition <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> is the condition of the bond limit stretching at the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the bridge zone. Based on these two fracture conditions t he regimes of the bridged zone and the crack tip equilibrium and growth are considered. The estimations of the equilibrium size of the bridged zone, the adhesion fracture energy and the critical stress (the interface strength) depend on the crack size are found...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we have {{reported}} that nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), which generate NO, modulate fracture healing. However, the cellular sources of the NOS isoforms during the course <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> healing have not been studied systematically. The {{purpose of this study}} was to localize the cellular distribution of NOS isoforms (inducible NOS [iNOS], endothelial NOS [eNOS], and neuronal NOS [bNOS]) by in situ hybridization and immunohistology after femoral fractures in rats. The iNOS signal was detected during the initial stages (on day 4 and day 7) <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> healing in 52 +/- 2 % (mean +/- SE, n = 7) of cells within the intramembranous region, along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the periosteal callus. The iNOS signal in callus cells declined to an undetectable level on day 14. eNOS was detected during the middle stages (on day 7 and day 14) <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> healing in cells lining the blood vessels and also in 49 +/- 3 % of cells in the chondral region. The bNOS signal was found to be increased at the later stages (day 14 and day 21) <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> healing in 51 +/- 3 % of cells at the junction between fibrous tissue and cartilage within the fibrochondral region. In summary, the expression of NOS isoforms during fracture healing was time dependent and cellular distinctive...|$|R

40|$|Discretization of {{the wave}} {{operator}} for purposes of solving problems in the dynamics of crack growth numerically, introduces noncausality associated with the nonlinearity <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> criterion at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the crack, i. e. with an imperfect formulation <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> criterion in the discretized case. The noncausality {{can be attributed to}} jumps from one inertial coordinate system to another as successive particles at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a digitized crack are triggered into motion. It is shown that there is an equivalent explanation in terms of the incompatibility <b>of</b> the short-range <b>edge</b> conditions and the long-range correlations of slip on the crack in the discretized case. The noncausal effects can lead to supersonic crack growth, and in some cases to infinite crack growth velocities. A proposal for amelioration of the problem is offered...|$|R
