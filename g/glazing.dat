40|$|This thesis {{maintains}} that <b>glazes</b> may be colored or textured {{by the addition}} of common substances such as metal filings, gravels, sands, or local clays. Three basic <b>glazes</b> were chosen: one transparent, one mat, and one semi-mat. To these basic <b>glazes</b> more than fifty inorganic materials were added in separate test batches. A diversity of results was produced ranging from a glossy, sand-speckled <b>glaze</b> to a rough <b>glaze</b> made with aluminum shavings; from a white, iridescent <b>glaze</b> made with gypsum to a dull gun-metal black <b>glaze</b> made with brass shavings; from a transparent colorless <b>glaze</b> made with aspirin tablets to a dark green translucent <b>glaze</b> made with copper filings. This study can be used as the basis for a unit on <b>glazes</b> in a secondary school classroom; its purpose is to serve as an introduction to <b>glazes,</b> while teaching the students an appreciation of some of the earth’s abundant raw materials and how they can be used in ceramic <b>glazes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Most pottery {{produced}} in recent centuries has been <b>glazed.</b> Tiles {{are almost always}} <b>glazed,</b> and modern architectural terracotta is very often <b>glazed</b> architectural terra-cotta. <b>Glazed</b> brick is also common. Domestic sanitary ware is invariably <b>glazed,</b> as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for overhead power lines.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{smoothness}} is {{an important}} characteristic of ceramic <b>glazes</b> as it influences chemical resistivity, glossiness and stainability of <b>glazes.</b> Surface crystallinity of zirconia-based and titania-based <b>glazes</b> (as two common opaque <b>glazes),</b> calcium-zinc based matte <b>glaze</b> and also two transparent <b>glazes</b> with different compositions were studied in this work. Degree of surface crystallinity measured by stereological methods using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that transparent <b>glaze</b> has the minimum degree of crystallinity (2. 1 %) and the maximum amount (25. 4 %) was obtained for matte <b>glaze.</b> In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the <b>glaze</b> mineralogy. Optical surface profiler showed that the smoothest surface belongs to titania-based opaque <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 0157 µm) and transparent <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 0168 µm). In contrast, the roughest <b>glaze</b> surface corresponded to the matte <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 2772 µm). The results suggest that surface roughness is influenced by crystallinity of surface, but degree of surface crystallinity {{is not the only}} parameter that can influence the surface roughness. The most important factor is the morphology of the crystals grow and their protrusion from the surface. © 201...|$|R
5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using <b>glazing</b> and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position.

It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E
5|$|The restorations {{completed}} in 1971 made the structure {{wind and water}} tight, added extra windows and installed fresh <b>glazing,</b> but {{as it was then}} abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by vandalism led to further structural deterioration.

50|$|Traditionally the <b>glazes</b> {{that are}} used are mostly slipware or <b>glazes</b> formed from the purest and {{smallest}} particles found in the clay body. Two main <b>glazes</b> are applied to the pots. The first of these is a yellow <b>glaze</b> that is formed by adding chalk to the natural clay body. The <b>glaze</b> is an off-white before the firing and after turns into a warm yellow. The second <b>glaze</b> is made similarly, but instead of adding chalk, the villagers use burned batteries, and some compound in the batter ash turns the <b>glaze</b> black when fired.|$|R
50|$|A crack {{that appears}} in any stage of firing {{increasing}} gets worse through multiple firings. Cracks may also go unnoticed until after the <b>glazed</b> firing. In <b>glazed</b> ware the <b>glaze</b> causes stress due to the thermal expansion. The interaction of the <b>glaze</b> and the clay body causes stress on the pot in <b>glaze</b> firing.|$|R
50|$|In this recipe, the {{addition}} of alkali helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the <b>glaze</b> as well. With the development of tin <b>glazes,</b> the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from Persia in the 14th century: a glass-frit of quartz and potash, a lead-tin calx and a calcination of limestone and quartz. Afterwards, with the spread of tin <b>glazes,</b> lead gradually became the principal background in tin <b>glazes,</b> though {{a small proportion of}} alkali was still introduced in order to increase the fusibility. No specific recipes alluding to tin <b>glazes</b> in Spain have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white <b>glazes</b> in Spain were lead-silica <b>glazes</b> with tin oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline <b>glazes</b> or lead-alkaline <b>glazes</b> have been found. Piccolpasso recorded several <b>glazes</b> used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, lime, soda and potash <b>glazes.</b> It is believed early Spanish <b>glazes</b> were similar.|$|R
5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. Above the door is an oculus window that originally had <b>glazing</b> bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and timber sills. The original upper floor windows have been replaced in the 19th or 20th century while the ground floor windows are modern but within the original openings.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the <b>glazing,</b> body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the <b>glazing,</b> occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E
25|$|The use of lead <b>glaze</b> {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali <b>glazes</b> {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali <b>glazes</b> must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful <b>glaze</b> must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the <b>glaze.</b> It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the <b>glaze</b> and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the <b>glaze</b> contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as <b>glazes</b> are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead <b>glaze</b> has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali <b>glazes.</b> Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead <b>glaze</b> matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali <b>glaze,</b> rendering it less prone to crazing. A <b>glaze</b> should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead <b>glaze</b> mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali <b>glazes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Zinc Crystal <b>Glaze</b> has {{its limits}} in {{practical}} use of commercial <b>glaze</b> due to the sensitive firing schedule. In order to overcome these limits, and to improve the practical usage, this study is aimed to develop a stable zinc crystalline <b>glaze.</b> This study altered the quantity of nuclear formation of zinc crystal <b>glaze</b> {{in order to control}} the willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4) formation in the <b>glaze.</b> The addition of ZrO 2 to zinc crystal <b>glaze</b> influences the quantity of nuclear formation and its preservation; thus ZrO 2 was used to control the optimal firing temperature {{and the size of the}} crystal formation in the <b>glaze</b> to find a zinc crystal <b>glaze</b> capable of withstanding various ranges of temperatures...|$|R
5|$|The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on {{the island}} of Shikoku was {{completed}} in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for <b>glazing.</b> Although the hall has been called one of his finest projects, it drew criticism {{at the time of its}} construction for relying too heavily on tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like <b>glazing</b> that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose <b>glazing</b> to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw some major {{engineering}} projects including Thomas Telford's (1757–1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829–31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812–14). In the 1850s {{the possibilities of}} new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored {{in the building of}} commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–6), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted <b>glazing.</b> Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856-8, using massive rubble blocks.|$|E
50|$|Early Stamford <b>glazes</b> are {{essentially}} lead <b>glazes</b> {{and it has}} been suggested they were unique among early English <b>glazes</b> as they contain traces of silver but not tin. The <b>glaze</b> was applied with a brush and can be pale yellow, orange, pale green and smoke blue. This depended on many factors including <b>glaze</b> composition, iron content and whether fired in reduced or oxidised conditions.|$|R
50|$|During the Kofun {{period of}} Japan, Sue ware was {{decorated}} with greenish natural ash <b>glazes.</b> From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored <b>glazes</b> were introduced. The three colored <b>glazes</b> of the Tang Dynasty were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the <b>glazes</b> have not been recovered. Natural ash <b>glaze,</b> however, was commonly used throughout the country.|$|R
50|$|Current ash <b>glazes</b> usually contain {{less than}} 50% wood ash {{compared}} to before when {{the majority of}} the <b>glaze</b> was ash. The decrease in ash percentage is to give the artist some control over the chemical make up and result of the <b>glaze.</b> Currently, ash <b>glazes</b> are mostly used by artists as a decorative tool, but some still use ash <b>glaze</b> ware. In Korea, the traditional ash <b>glaze</b> composed of only ash and water is used to make functional pottery such as bowls, cups, and teapots.|$|R

5|$|Green Park {{railway station}} opened in 1870 as the {{terminus}} of Midland Railway's Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line. For {{some of its}} life, it was known as Bath Queen Square. It includes a vaulted glass roof in a single-span wrought iron arch structure. Parts of the distinctive glass roof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the <b>glazing</b> was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the Beeching Report, passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself {{is used as a}} pedestrian passageway to and from the city; {{there are a number of}} small shop units in the former station buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Tenmokus {{are known}} for their variability.

5|$|In {{the belief}} {{that it would be}} {{operated}} by smokeless locomotives, the line had been built with little ventilation and a long tunnel between Edgware Road and King's Cross. Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers and the ventilation was later improved by making an opening in the tunnel between Gower Street and King's Cross and removing <b>glazing</b> in the station roofs. With the problem continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values. This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report, which reported that a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the line was electrified before these were built.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and <b>glazing</b> materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
