Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in the other five groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support.

5|$|In 1943, Drenović {{was awarded}} the Order of Karađorđe's Star by King Peter, based on a {{recommendation}} by Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović. Following the Italian capitulation, Drenović agreed to all the actions of his Chetniks being performed in close cooperation with local German units, and was informed {{at the end of}} the year that Ustaše units would again be stationed in Serb-inhabited areas. In October 1943, a team from the 1st Battalion of the 4th Brandenburg Division under Oberleutnant Hermann Kirchner began working alongside Drenović's Chetniks in northwest Bosnia, operating forward reconnaissance groups and developing contact with anti-communist farmers to keep an eye on Partisan troop movements. There were about 950 Chetniks serving under Drenović that year, positioned around Manjača and Glamoč. Drenović had about 400 Chetniks under his command by the following year. <b>His</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only Chetnik band that the Ustaše trusted fully during the war.

5|$|Tătărescu became {{leader of}} the cabinet in January 1934, as the fascist Iron Guard had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on 30 December 1933 (the five-day premiership of Constantin Anghelescu ensured {{transition}} between the two governments). <b>His</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> second PNL cabinet formed during Carol's reign, and the latter's failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a tight connection being established between Carol and the young liberals, with Tătărescu backing the process leading {{to the creation of}} a royal dictatorship. One of Tătărescu's first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the Mayor of Bucharest, Dem I. Dobrescu (who was backed by the National Peasants' Party) — making use of his prerogative, he removed Dobrescu from office on 18 January.|$|E
