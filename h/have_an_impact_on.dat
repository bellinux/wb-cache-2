Upon next, the police men are sitting on the bar stool next to the bar man and are presented a tape. Meanwhile, it is shown in a flashback in sepia that, while the men were bar-fighting, Stan was grabbing the money from the cards and ran out of the bar. The video ends with one of the police man punching the bar man. Scenes interspersed throughout the main plot present Stan singing in front of an old-fashioned wall, sporting a white worn blouse and hot pants. An editor from Los 40 Principales cited the video for [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] as one of the singer's best clips ever.

Game creator Brian Fleming was influenced by the climbing and parkour aspects of the first Crackdown in designing the gameplay for Infamous. The series' mainstay gameplay of collecting orbs in an open world environment to increase a character's abilities, was also copied by another similar game called Prototype.
