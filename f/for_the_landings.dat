5|$|During March, in {{preparation}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings</b> on the peninsula, Robinson led four sorties into the extensive sea minefields around the beaches and bays of Gallipoli. On one of these, his minesweeper {{was struck by}} small calibre shells 84 times and the other operations were scarcely less dangerous but, {{in spite of the}} Turkish resistance, Robinson was able to clear wide lanes for the invasion forces.|$|E

They {{revisited}} Tokyo on 25 February and hit the island of Hachino {{off the coast of}} Honshū the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings.</b> Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E

5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, paving the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings</b> on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before {{the first of the}} new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Formidables air {{group had a}} {{strength}} of 36 Corsairs and 18 Avengers. She arrived in San Pedro Bay in the Philippines on 4 April to await {{the return of the}} BPF from their efforts to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, as part of the preparations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings</b> on Okinawa. Formidable was called forward six days later to join the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (1st ACS) of the BPF on operations as a replacement for Illustrious, which was in poor mechanical shape. She arrived on 14 April and contributed aircraft when the attacks recommenced two days later. The commander of 1842 Squadron was killed {{on the first day of}} operations while strafing buildings at Nobara airfield. After refuelling and two more days' attacks, the BPF sailed on 20 April for San Pedro Bay to replenish its ships for further operations.|$|E
5|$|Final {{preparations}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings</b> in the Brunei Bay area {{took place}} in May 1945. After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps' movement from Australia to Morotai, General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June. The 9th Division's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May. The 24th Brigade Group was assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan, and the 20th Brigade Group was tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island. Both brigades were to land simultaneously {{on the morning of}} 10 June. The invasion of the Brunei Bay region was to be preceded by attacks on Japanese bases and transport infrastructure across western and northern Borneo by United States and Australian air units, as well as three days of minesweeping operations in the bay itself.|$|E

5|$|Lorraine {{spent the}} bulk of her career in the French Mediterranean Squadron. During World War I, she was {{stationed}} at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from leaving the Adriatic Sea, but she saw no action. She was modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s, and in 1935 her amidships 340mm gun turret was removed and aircraft facilities were installed in its place. After the outbreak of World War II, Lorraine carried a shipment of gold from the French treasury to Bermuda before returning {{to operate in the}} Mediterranean. At the French surrender in July 1940, Lorraine was moored in Alexandria, where she was disarmed by the Royal Navy. After joining the Free French Naval Forces in December 1942, Lorraine was refitted for active service. She provided gunfire support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings</b> in Operation Dragoon in August–September 1944 and bombarded German positions around La Rochelle in April 1945. After the end of the war, Lorraine was used was a gunnery training ship and then a barracks ship until late 1953, when she was stricken and sold to shipbreakers.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} Unicorn, she sailed for the Mediterranean on 13 August to prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings</b> at Salerno (Operation Avalanche), {{reaching}} Malta a week later. Her air group was reinforced {{at this time}} by four more Martlets each for 878 and 890 Squadrons. She was assigned to Force H for the operation which was tasked to protect the amphibious force from attack by the Italian Fleet and provide air cover for the carriers supporting the assault force. The Italians {{made no effort to}} attack the Allied forces, and the most noteworthy thing that any of her aircraft did was when one of 890 Squadron's Martlets escorted a surrendering Italian aircraft to Sicily. Before the Illustrious steamed for Malta she transferred six Seafires to the Unicorn to replace some of her aircraft wrecked in deck-landing accidents. Four of these then flew ashore to conduct operations until they rejoined Illustrious on 14 September at Malta.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{arrived in}} Ulithi on 20 March, and was {{assigned}} to Task Force 54 the next day. She put to sea {{to take part in}} the invasion of Okinawa. The ship was placed in Task Unit 54.2.3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March. On the afternoon of the following day, Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on the island, from 13:50 to 16:30. Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning; Wichitas gunners shot down one of the aircraft. Later that day, the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion. She continued to shell the island through 28 March. The next day, she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition. The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover underwater demolition teams as they cleared beach obstacles. Wichita continued to support the demolition teams the next day, as well as shelling targets ashore. On 31 March, Wichita bombarded the sea wall to create a breach in preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>landings.</b>|$|E
