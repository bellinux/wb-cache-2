40|$|We address here, {{by means}} of finite-element {{computational}} modeling, two features of heart mechanics and, most importantly, their timing relationship: {{one of them is}} the ejected volume and the other is the twist of the heart. The corner stone of our approach is to take the double helical muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>band</b> as the dominant active macrostructure behind the pumping function. We show that this double helical model easily reproduces a physiological maximal ejection fraction of up to 60 % without exceeding the limit on local muscle fiber contraction of 15 %. Moreover, a physiological ejection fraction can be achieved independently of the excitation pattern. The left ventricular twist is also largely independent of the type of excitation. However, the physiological relationship between the ejection fraction and twist can only be reproduced with Purkinje-type excitation schemes. Our results indicate that the proper timing coordination between twist and ejection dynamics can be reproduced only if the excitation front originates in the septum region near the apex. This shows that the timing of the excitation is directly related to the productive pumping operation of the heart and illustrates the direction for possible bioinspired pump design...|$|E

40|$|Although neurons often fire in bursts, {{most of what}} {{is known}} about {{glutamate}} signaling and postsynaptic receptor activation is based on experiments using single stimuli. Here we examine the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by bursts at the parallel fiber to stellate cell synapse. We show that brief stim-ulus trains generate prolonged AMPA receptor (AMPAR) - and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) -mediated EPSCs recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp. These EPSCs contrast with the rapid AMPAR-mediated EPSC evoked by a single stimulus. The pro-longed AMPAR-mediated EPSC is promoted by high-frequency and high-intensity trains and can persist for hundreds of milli-seconds. This EPSC is also increased by L-trans- 2, 4 -PDC, an inhibitor of glutamate transporters, suggesting that these trans-porters usually limit the synaptic response to trains. These prolonged EPSCs reflect both receptor properties and a long-lasting glutamate signal. In addition, several experiments dem-onstrate that glutamate spillover can contribute to receptor activation. First, imaging stimulus-evoked changes in presyn-aptic calcium establishes that distinct parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>bands</b> can be activated. Second, activation of parallel fibers that do not directly synapse onto a given stellate cell can evoke indirect AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in that cell. Third, ex-periments using the use-dependent NMDAR blocker MK- 801 show that these indirect EPSCs reflect glutamate spillover in response to trains. Together, these findings indicate that stim-ulus trains can generate a sustained and widespread glutamate signal that can in turn evoke large and prolonged EPSCs me-diated by ionotropic glutamate receptors. These synaptic prop-erties may have important functional consequences for stellate cell firing.

40|$|Actually, the Coriolis {{acceleration}} component {{experienced by}} axi-Downmagnetic tapes, paper sheets, textile <b>fibers,</b> <b>band</b> saws, aerial cable tramways, and crane hoist cables. Despite many advantages of these devices, noise and vibrations, particularly transverse vibra-tions, {{associated with the}} devices have limited their applications. For example, in magnetic tape drives, the vibration of a tape leads to signal modulation and accelerates the wear of the tape; in band saws, the vibration of a blade results in poor cutting quality. Therefore, understanding transverse vibrations of axially moving strings {{is important for the}} design of the devices. Furthermore, for high precision applications, it is desirable to introduce suitable control mechanisms to reduce vibrations of axially moving strings in order to improve performance of the devices. A string is a one-dimensional continuum that offers no resis-tance to bending. Since the gravitational force is sufficiently small compared with the tension force, the equilibrium configuration is a straight line. Many slender engineering elements such as belts, cables, strips, chains, tapes, ropes, and thread lines can be mod-eled as strings because their bending stiffness is relatively small. If slender engineering elements have rather large bending stiff-ness, they will be treated as moving beams. Slender engineering elements with curved equilibrium configurations will be treated as moving cables ~loose strings!. As for engineering elements that have considerable width, two-dimensional continuum models such as membranes, plates or shells should be used. The investigations on transverse vibrations and control of axi-ally moving strings have theoretical significance, because an axi-ally moving string is a simplest representative of distributed gy-roscopic systems. Axially moving strings, beams, cables, membranes, and plates all fall into the class of axially moving ally moving materials imparts a skew-symmetric or gyroscopic term to their governing equations.
