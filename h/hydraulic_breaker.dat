5000|$|The first <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker</b> [...] "Hydraulikhammer HM 400" [...] {{was invented}} in 1967 by German company Krupp (today German company Atlas Copco) in Essen.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{the rock}} drills, the company also {{produced}} drill rigs and developed 'down the hole' drill primarily for quarrying. The company developed a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker,</b> known as the Holbuster, but was {{ahead of its time}} and it was not a commercial success. Later developed by others, it is now a common sight.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{bucket of}} many skid loaders {{can be replaced}} {{with a variety of}} specialized buckets or attachments, many powered by the loader's hydraulic system. These include backhoe, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker,</b> pallet forks, angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, stump grinder, tree spade, trencher, dumping hopper, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} expand the range of {{activities}} of an excavator, attachments, such as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breakers</b> {{have been developed to}} be applied to buckets. However, {{it is very difficult to}} predict the dynamic behavior of hydraulic impact devices such as breakers because of high non-linearity. Thus, the purpose of this study is to optimize the impact performance of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breakers.</b> The ultimate goal of the optimization is to increase the impact energy and impact frequency and to reduce the pressure pulsation of the supply and return lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>breakers</b> usually use a {{hydraulic}} motor driving a sealed pneumatic hammer system, as {{a hydraulic}} hammer would develop a low strike speed and transfer unacceptable shock loads to the pump system.|$|R
50|$|The {{main product}} {{marketing}} functions {{are located in}} Essen, Germany, but design, development and production are located in facilities worldwide. In Essen, specialized teams design and produce medium-size to heavy rig-mounted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breakers,</b> from 550 kg (1,212 lb.) up to 4,200 kg (9,259 lb.)

50|$|There {{are various}} methods for {{excavating}} trenches in rock - principally drill and blast, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breakers</b> and chain trenchers. Selection of a trench excavation method {{must take into}} account a range of rock and machine properties. It is suggested that the advantages of using chain trenchers in suitable rock outweigh the limitations and may have cost benefits and fewer adverse environmental effects compared with alternative methods.|$|R
50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have allowed for portable <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breakers.</b> The jackhammer {{is connected with}} hydraulic hoses to a portable hydraulic powerpack: either a petrol or diesel engine driving a hydraulic pump; or a mini-excavator or skid-steer via a power take-off driveshaft to the machine's hydraulic system. Hydraulic power sources are more efficient than air compressors, making the kit smaller, cheaper or more powerful than a comparable pneumatic version.|$|R
50|$|The TRM systemâ€™s {{inherent}} {{advantage is}} {{the simplicity of}} the installation process. The piles are driven to refusal or to a required penetration depth {{with the use of a}} high-impact high-frequency <b>hydraulic</b> hammer (i.e. <b>Breaker</b> hammer).|$|R
40|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker</b> for {{construction}} machinery generally {{used for the}} destroying and disassembling of buildings, crashing road pavement, breaking rocks at quarry and so on. So the measurement of the impact energy of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker</b> is very important thing to prove its capability to manufacturers and customers. In this study, the test system for measuring the impact energy of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker</b> was designed and constructed.

40|$|Selecting and {{dimensioning}} {{the best}} circuit protection for an application {{can be very}} hard. To make this easier for the employees at Ericsson Power Solutions a guideline has been developed. Questions the employees had regarding circuit protection have been answered. Manufacturers have been consulted and IEC and UL standards have briefly been investigated. A guideline consisting of derating rules for melting fuses and <b>hydraulic</b> magnetic circuit <b>breakers</b> has been developed. Considerations {{have been made in}} order for the guideline to be of help when designing circuit protection at Ericsson Power Solutions. One of the main issues has been to determine which current is to be derated since the current often includes ripple. How to investigate if a circuit breaker will endure a pulse was unclear and has now been clarified also both reoccurring and single pulses can now be dealt with. Altitude derating is required above a certain altitude. A general model for temperature influence on trip time for magnetic <b>hydraulic</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> has been determined. Finally, one melting fuse and one circuit breaker were designed according to the guideline. The result was close to the ratings of the protections used today but none the less slightly changed...|$|R
40|$|This project operate an {{environmental}} assessment of total waste {{was conducted by}} using a life cycle assessment (LCA), that examines the environmental benefits of recycling production waste from Atlas Copco at Stena recycling. Atlas Copco is a company engaged {{in the development and}} production of rig-mounted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breakers</b> and handheld air breakers and handheld motorized rotisserie. Stena recycling is a recycling company engaged in recycling, processing and refining of metals, paper, electronics waste and hazardous waste. The {{purpose of this study is}} to focus on Stena customer Atlas Copco and evaluate environmental benefits between to recycle and not to do it. The result shows that the total energy gain, resulting from the recycling of waste fractions, lands at 6 Â  990 Â  089 MJ, corresponding to drive 3 times around the Equator with a truck (40 t). The result shows that recycling 3040 kg paper provides an energy gain of (38 Â  600 MJ) compared with burning paper (19 Â  500 MJ) is 19 Â  100 MJ, which corresponds to heat a house for 11 weeks. The result also shows that the energy gain from the waste fraction can heat 77 houses for a whole year. The conclusion is that environmental benefits will be greater recycling the waste fractions not recycling them at all. If everyone does their part in the recycling, we can help preserve our world for future generations by reducing the environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|Many devices, {{for example}} {{contactors}} and solenoid actuated valves, rely on ferromagnetic components moving {{under the influence}} of electromagnetic force for their operation. The popularity of this technology {{stems from the fact that}} it is an elegant, cost effective and robust way to convert electrical energy into mechanical work. From a product design point of view it is very important to quantify the magnitude of the electromagnetic force and to predict the behaviour of ferromagnetic components {{under the influence of}} this force. In most cases these forces are estimated by means of first order calculations or Finite Element Methods. It is plausible, as this dissertation shows, that direct measurement can be used to replace or supplement theoretical methods to obtain these forces. However, limited previous work describing methods and techniques for the measurement of these electromagnetic forces, are available in the public domain. In general, prior work in this field [12] is very specialised and limited with respect to the range of forces that can be measured, and not easily adaptable to a product design environment. This thesis proposes a novel piece of equipment for the measurement of electromagnetic forces acting on ferromagnetic components, and a method to predict product performance based on these measurements. The measurement equipment, and product performance prediction, is described and evaluated for the case of low voltage <b>hydraulic</b> magnetic circuit <b>breakers.</b> Low voltage <b>hydraulic</b> magnetic circuit <b>breakers</b> are a particularly interesting subject as it contains one source of electromagnetic force acting on two ferromagnetic components. The two ferromagnetic components have different equations of motion, with dramatically different damping coefficients. A further complication in the operation of <b>hydraulic</b> magnetic circuit <b>breakers</b> is that these ferromagnetic components can move separately or simultaneously. The motion of the components is influenced by the magnitude of the applied electromagnetic force and their position relative to each other. Low voltage <b>hydraulic</b> magnetic circuit <b>breaker</b> performance is subject to the combined motion of these two ferromagnetic components. This work concludes that the method for measuring electromagnetic forces with the aim of predicting device performance is feasible, and that it produces good results where electromagnetic forces need to be known to high accuracies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} experimental observations {{as well as}} theoretical {{formulations of}} the flow structure in the turbulent shear layer in spilling breakers. The theoretical model is developed {{within the framework of}} a three-layer system, with the top layer being the two-phase (air/water) turbulent surface layer, and the bottom layer comprising the single phase (water) irrotational flow. The model development in the single phase (water) turbulent shear layer is guided by and validated with PIV flow measurements of a turbulent <b>hydraulic</b> jump. The <b>breaker</b> shear layer is seen to resemble a classical mixing layer with entrainment of fluid into the reverse flow region localized about the mean surface. Preliminary results are reported on interfacial boundary conditions which account for the contributions from the surface layer as well as the evolution of turbulent and mean quantities in the breaker shear layer. Such interfacial boundary conditions can be incorporated into Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes numerical models for simulating the spatio-temporal evolution of the turbulent and mean flow in spilling breakers. 1...|$|R
40|$|This is the publisherâ€™s final pdf. The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be}} found at: [URL] To the best of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal employees when contributing to this work. Angiosperm and coniferous tree species utilize a continuum of hydraulic strategies. Hydraulic safety margins (defined as differences between naturally occurring xylem pressures and pressures that would cause hydraulic dysfunction, or differences between pressures resulting in loss of hydraulic function in adjacent organs (e. g., stems vs. leaves) tend to be much greater in conifers than angiosperms and serve to prevent stem embolism. However, conifers tend to experience embolism more frequently in leaves and roots than angiosperms. Embolism repair is thought to occur by active transport of sugars into empty conduits followed by passive water movement. The most likely source of sugar for refilling is from nonstructural carbohydrate depolymerization in nearby parenchyma cells. Compared to angiosperms, conifers tend to have little parenchyma or nonstructural carbohydrates in their wood. The ability to rapidly repair embolisms may rely on having nearby parenchyma cells, which could explain the need for greater safety margins in conifer wood as compared to angiosperms. The frequent embolisms that occur in the distal portions of conifers are readily repaired, perhaps due to the abundant parenchyma in leaves and roots, and these distal tissues may act as <b>hydraulic</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> that prevent tension-induced embolisms in the attached stems. Frequent embolisms in conifer leaves may also be due to weaker stomatal response to changes in ambient humidity. Although there is a continuum of hydraulic strategies among woody plants, there appear to be two distinct â€˜behaviorsâ€™ at the extremes: (1) embolism prevention and (2) embolism occurrence and subsequent repair...|$|R
40|$|The {{major fire}} and fire injury {{findings}} for all metal/nonmetal mining categories for 1990 - 2001 {{are shown in}} tables 64 - 65. Table 66, partly illustrated in figure 22, shows the number of fires, fire injuries, fire fatalities, risk rates, employees' working hours, and lost workdays for all metal/nonmetal mining categories by time period. For all metal/nonmetal operations (including stone and sand and gravel), a total of 518 fires occurred during 1990 - 2001; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities (Ewhr = 4, 012 x 106 hr, In = 0. 015, LWD = 36, 204). Thirty fires and 26 injuries involved contractors. The greatest number of fires and fire injuries occurred at surface operations; the highest risk rate values were also calculated for surface operations. The number of fires increased during the first four 2 -year time periods (1990 - 1991, 1992 - 1993, 1994 - 1995, and 1996 - 1997), then decreased {{during the last two}} periods (1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). The number of injuries showed a decrease throughout the periods, accompanied by an increase in employees' working hours. Twenty-five firefighting interventions by mine rescue teams in underground mines and at least 30 interventions at surface operations were required to combat these fires. However, 45 fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. Ninety-seven fires were detected late, and 30 fires were undetected. The ignition sources that caused the greatest number of fires were flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame (169 fires or 33 % with 137 injuries), hydraulic fluid/fuel sprayed onto equipment hot surfaces (89 fires or 17 % with 46 injuries and 3 fatalities), heat source/explosion and flammable liquids/ gas/refueling fuel on hot surfaces (98 fires or 19 % with 73 injuries), electrical short/arcing (51 fires or 10 % with 16 injuries), and spontaneous combustion/hot material (46 fires or 9 % with 17 injuries). The flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame source caused fires usually involving welders' clothing or oxyfuel/grease and other materials (including chute and dust collector liners, flammable liquids, belt material, crusher, hopper and shaker deck materials, washer plants, equipment mechanical components, stampler <b>breaker,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fluid, rubber tires and hoses, gear boxes, bin feeder, dump rope cables, screen liner and screen panel, kiln and shaft material, pipelines, liquor pumps, wood pallets, electrical junction boxes, handrails, grease, refuse, shop and wood). The spontaneous combustion/hot material and electrical fires were usually detected late due to lack of combustion gas/smoke detection systems. At least 55 of the 89 mobile equipment hydraulic fluid/fuel fires became large fires (requiring 12 mine rescue team interventions in undergroun...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} the impact loads delivered to the housing of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker</b> quantitatively. Striking forces caused vibrations in the equipment housing, which were experimentally measured, and frequency response functions were also found through modal impact experiments. Transfer path analysis (TPA) method of the data quantified the impact loads delivered to the housing. TPA method can analyze the relationship between the vibration energy and the transfer path of an excitation source and so explore the way in which vibrations on each path contribute to the entire vibration profile. The impact loads of each part derived by TPA method were compared with the impact loads in the chisel derived from strain gauge measurements of the striking energy. This comparison validated the TPA approach. This study describes the basic concepts and components of TPA method and also reviews its applicability to mechanical equipment that experiences impact vibrations and impact loads...|$|E

The vast definitions of weathered rock always resulted to disputes between the practitioners, client and contractor in interpreting the rock state. Issues of excavation technology and rate of payment will arise. Thus, lead to wrongly selection of excavation tool and unproductive excavation, time consuming and loss of claim. This research shall explain the characterization of weathered granite and sandstone in Malaysia and method of engineering classification for excavation purposes. Rock cutting technology attached on excavation works on site also being discussed in aspects of excavability index. The field observations on site were also carried out to get the genuine data of rock cutting techniques applied on site for various grade of weathered rock. A series of laboratory testing also been carried out to determine the significant properties of weathered granite and sandstone, strength, texture, cyclic load and also to evaluate the excavation efficiencies of the weathered rocks. Cyclic load test is a simulation test of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>breaker</b> used on site. Ripping is {{known as one of the}} excavation method which used to excavate rock. This method is suitable for weak rock which is very hard to excavate by the normal excavator nevertheless feeble to blast. From this study, it shows that the excavation efficiency had direct proportional to the increasing of weathering grade.
