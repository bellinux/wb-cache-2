5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The {{fact that they were}} eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians.|$|E

Addressing the question if a new convention of space and time is needed he wrote in 1912: [...] "Shall we be obliged to modify our conclusions? Certainly not; we had adopted a convention because it seemed convenient and we had said that nothing could constrain us to abandon it. Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all.

My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> found files with evidence.

Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor! Why I say it is so difficult to be restrained, is that my learned friend has thrown in everything that concerns every accused in this case, and says 'that is why I don't want Kantor to get bail.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian {{victory would}} not have been {{complete}} without the capture of 'Area Flat Top', an adjacent peak and part of enemy defences on Point 4875. The 13 JAK Rifles had captured Flat top feature of Point 4875 on the afternoon of 5 July after a fierce battle with Pakistani forces. But the enemy launched an immediate counterattack to take back the Area Flat Top they had lost. [...] "Young Captain NA Nagappa was holding Flat Top. He had a small force but he fought ferociously to beat back the offensive. The first counter-attack was beaten back. The Pakistanis too were facing the same problem of climbing, with the Indian Army on top shooting at them. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not have the will to do it but the carpet-firing by our troops did not let them come to the top," [...] a 79 Infantry Brigade officer said. There was a seesaw battle taking place at the Area Flat Top. All of a sudden, a shell hit Area Flat Top, seriously injuring Captain Nagappa who was shooting at the advancing Pakistani soldiers. Splinters pierced through both his legs and he fell unconscious. Taking advantage of this situation, the Pakistanis started climbing faster.|$|E

2500|$|In 323BC, Zhongshan {{formed a}} {{vertical}} alliance, allying itself with Wei, Han, Zhao, and Yan, {{in order to}} defend themselves against larger states like Qin, Qi, and Chu. This alliance allowed the states in it to claim the title of wang (a title roughly equivalent to King). King Wei of Qi, who had 11 years earlier taken the title of wang for himself, objected to this, saying: [...] "I am ashamed to be a king if the ruler of Zhongshan can be one too". He later went on to say: [...] "I am a state of ten thousand chariots and Zhongshan {{is one of a}} thousand chariots, how dare she [...] assume a title the equal of mine?". An important part of this statement can be seen in his reason for denouncing them claiming kingship <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were non-Chinese (Huaxi), which would very likely have been mentioned in the insult if it were true. The fact that Zhongshan was invited to the five state alliance is seen as another proof of them being Chinese, as a barbarian (Yi) country would never be invited to such an alliance. After this, King Wei of Qi asked Wei and Zhao to join him in attacking Zhongshan, to force them to abolish their title of wang, however, King Cuo sent an advisor, Zhang Deng, to these states, and successfully sowed discord and distrust amongst them, and no such alliance was formed.|$|E

Neither is it that they are afraid of not going to heaven. Their expectation almost always is, that they are going thither. But they do not care much to go to heaven. They are willing enough to go there, because they know that they must go somewhere. But their notions of what heaven will be like are by no means clear. They have sung rapturous hymns in church or chapel about the heavenly Jerusalem, and passing Jordan safe to Canaan's shore, with no very clear notion of what the words meant--and small blame to them.|$|E
