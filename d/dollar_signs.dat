The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed <b>dollar</b> <b>signs</b> on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

The documentary was narrated by Patrick Duffy, who had starred in the television series Dallas during this time. The program also included interviews with several former SMU boosters.|$|E

[...] Even so, Davenport felt the figure seemed to lack something until the cartoonist took the <b>dollar</b> <b>signs</b> from the cufflink and placed them inside every check of the cartoon Hanna's suit. [...] Davenport likely acted {{at the suggestion of}} his cartoonist colleague at the Journal, M. de Lipman, who had depicted McKinley as Buddha in a loincloth with Hanna as his attendant, robes ablaze with an array of <b>dollar</b> <b>signs.</b> According to Hearst biographer Kenneth Whyte, [...] "whatever its origins, Davenport's 'plutocratic plaid', as it became known, was an instant hit." ...|$|E

500|$|Davenport's {{cartoons}} ran a {{few times}} per week in the Journal, generally on an inside page.

500|$|Davenport's {{cartoons}} had {{an effect}} on Hanna. West Virginia Senator Nathan B. Scott remembered being with Hanna as he viewed his caricature wearing a suit covered with <b>dollar</b> <b>signs,</b> trampling women and children underfoot, and hearing the Ohioan state, [...] "that hurts". Hanna could not make public appearances without having to field questions about the cartoons. Nevertheless, publisher J.B. Morrow, a friend of both McKinley and his campaign manager, stated that Hanna [...] "took his course regardless of local criticism". McKinley made no attempt to deflect criticism from Hanna and in fact kept a file of Davenport cartoons that particularly amused him. [...] Despite Hanna's discomfiture, both men were content to have Hanna attacked if it meant that McKinley would not be.|$|E
500|$|In Telengard, {{the player}} travels alone through a dungeon fraught with monsters, traps, and treasures {{in a manner}} similar to the {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons.

The game is set in real time and cannot be paused, so the player must visit an [...] "inn" [...] to save their game progress. In the early releases (e.g., Apple II), the game world has no sound and is represented by ASCII characters, such as slashes for stairs and <b>dollar</b> <b>signs</b> for treasure.

500|$|Well known music critic, Robert Christgau, excoriated what he {{considered}} to be Idol's attempt to co-opt cyberpunk for commercial gain.

[...] However, unlike some critics who asserted Idol had no genuine interest in cyberculture, Christgau assumed he did and that this was to be expected, as many subcultures are eventually adopted by mainstream society.

500|$|William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal was {{hostile to}} McKinley {{throughout}} the campaign; {{prior to the}} Republican convention, Alfred Henry Lewis accused Hanna of {{acting on behalf of}} a syndicate, controlling McKinley. During the general election campaign, the Democratic newspapers, especially the papers owned by Hearst, attacked Hanna for his supposed role as McKinley's political master.

The cover features an abstract portrayal of Badu, who dons vintage nameplate knuckle rings bearing the album title and an Afro decorated in a bric-a-brac manner with various emblems. Badu and Emek sought to reflect the former's perspective on various topics, including music, religion, governments, and economics, and incorporate emblems to depict American culture and modern society. Images featured in the Afro include those of flowers, spray cans, <b>dollar</b> <b>signs,</b> power plants, musical notes, toilets, raised fists, needles, laptops, turntables, handcuffs, broken chains, bar codes, drugs, and guns. The album's interior artwork features ominous, psychedelic, futuristic, and apocalyptic imagery. The artwork includes illustrations of a red-eyed Uncle Sam pointing a gun, robotic creatures tattooing each other, a bar code bearing the alphanumeric message [...] "50C1AL 5Y5T3M", and a suited skeleton with a dollar sign on its skull lecturing to a headless audience from a podium that bears the pyramid image from the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. The illustration of a soft melting fork, hypodermic needle, and spoon is an adaptation of Salvador Dalí's 1931 painting The Persistence of Memory.|$|E
