40|$|Two summer {{outbreaks}} of <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> (HF) {{are described in}} a microprocessor factory (factory A) and a printing factory (factory B). The air in each factory was humidified intermittently and controlled by present humidistats operating to maintain a relative humidity of 45 % by an air handler incorporating a spray humidifier in factory A and two ceiling mounted spray humidifiers in factory B. Questionnaire data from each workforce suggested that although symptoms apparently occurred most commonly in both factories on return from holiday (41 / 57, 71. 9 %), many subjects (24 / 40, 60 %) in factory A also had intermittent symptoms of ill defined periodicity for some time before the disorder was recognised. Similar intermittent symptoms with no discernible pattern occurred in factory B in {{a smaller number of}} subjects (4 / 17, 23. 5 %), all of whom were night or rotating shift workers. Both episodes of <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> after return from summer holiday developed when nocturnal air temperatures were unseasonably low; not on the day of return to work but two days later (factory A) and one day later (factory B). Symptoms were most common in most workers who had circulating serum IgG antibody measured by ELISA to humidifier sludge in factory B (14 / 17, 82. 9 %) but were most common in IgG antibody negative subjects in factory A (27 / 40, 67. 5 %). A more classic form of <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> redeveloped in factory B during winter when meteorological recordings suggested that humidification of intake air was more continuous. <b>Humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> in winter may have been the major influence on the formulation of the symptom pattern thought to be relevant for recognition of the disorder. A form of the illness, however, can occur during the summer which is camouflaged by intermittent humidification when the symptoms appear to be more closely associated with cool nocturnal air intake and unrelated to the pattern of attendance at work...|$|E

40|$|Sixty staff {{working in}} a {{hospital}} operating theatre, where a case of <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> had been identified, were studied together with 49 subjects working {{in other parts of}} the hospital. They each had a blood test for serology, a skin test, and a chest radiograph and completed a questionnaire. The theatre staff also had pulmonary function tests. The theatre humidifier was found to contain several organisms including amoebae and antigens cross-reacting highly with those implicated in previous outbreaks of <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever.</b> Of the 60 exposed subjects, 25 had developed antibodies, nine had probable symptoms of <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever,</b> and six possible symptoms. There was a strong association between symptoms and antibodies (p = 6 x 10 (- 5) by Fisher's exact test). The development of antibodies was also related to duration of exposure in the theatre (p less than 0. 01 by X 2 test for trend) and inversely to smoking (p = 0. 0073 by Fisher's exact test) but not to history of atopy. Because of the presence of antigens and because certain biocides added were ineffective in controlling antigenic build-up the humidifier was switched off. Eight months later specific IgG levels in the theatre staff sera, estimated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, had fallen on average by 25 %. Inhalation challenge with humidifier water was performed in eight subjects. Four subjects reacted to the challenge, including both those with antibodies and previous symptoms...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> (Monday sickness) {{occuring}} {{in office}} staff {{in a factory}} processing rayon presented as pyrexia with a polyuria and leucocytosis {{on the first day}} back to work after a break during the winter half of the year. Chest radiographs showed no abnormalities but pulmonary function tests indicated mild airways obstruction in the affected group as a whole. Respirable dust samples taken on a Monday when 11 cases occured were not pyrogenic, indicating that a mechanism other than direct pyrogen activity produced the pyrexia. Efforts were then directed to determining an immunological basis for the episodes. In particular, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, previously held responsible for <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever,</b> was studied. During the episode of 11 cases, the number of viable airborne spores of this organism was far higher than on Mondays when no cases occured. In a second episode of nine cases, however, the airborne viable count was of the same order as non-episode Mondays...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRecently, an {{increasing}} number of patients were presented to our clinics with febrile and respiratory symptoms associated with exposure to a new type of domestic ultrasonic humidifier. We report on 11 patients who developed recurrent episodes of fever, cough and dyspnea after repeated exposure to ultrasonic misting fountains at home. A diagnosis of extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) or toxic alveolitis was {{made on the basis of}} the history and the clinical, radiological, laboratory and immunological findings. Eight patients were subjected to inhalative challenge tests with their own ultrasonic misting fountains, and all of them exhibited positive reactions. Nine patients were diagnosed with an EAA (humidifier lung) and two patients with a toxic alveolitis (<b>humidifier</b> <b>fever).</b> This study demonstrates the potential for ultrasonic misting fountains to cause illness in the home. In view of the increasing popularity of these devices, humidifier lung and <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained pulmonary or flu-like illnesses with fever...|$|E
40|$|Permanence {{within a}} {{building}} is frequently associated with health complaints identified as several clinical syndromes. Contamination by bacterial products {{may play a}} predominant role {{in some of these}} clinical syndromes, like building-related asthma, <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> or the sick building syndrome (SBS). Indeed, on one side, in air-conditioned systems, the physical conditions are optimal for microbial development and for endotoxin production (from the membrane of gram negative bacteria) and on the other side, inhalation of endotoxin has demonstrated the onset of a bronchial obstruction and an increase in airway reactivity leading to non specific chest complaints. Nevertheless, this hypothesis on aetiopathogenesis of SBS remains to be demonstrated by environmental and lung functional studies on the building site. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether occupational exposure to raw tobacco causes respiratory or allergic diseases, {{an excess of}} respiratory symptoms, a decrease in lung function, or parenchymal changes in chest radiography among Finnish cigar workers. METHODS: This cross sectional study included all Finnish cigar workers (n = 106) exposed to raw tobacco and also a group of unexposed matched referents. Data were collected with a self administered questionnaire, flow volume spirometry, measurements of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, chest radiography and skin prick tests. A questionnaire was also sent to former workers of the factory. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chest radiography findings. Nine of 102 tobacco workers had pulmonary fibrosis of at least 1 / 0 (according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 1980 classification) and the corresponding figure was five for the referents. The tobacco workers tended to have a low forced vital capacity (FVC), and they had impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 second and lower means of the maximal expiratory flow at 25 % of the FVC significantly more often than the referents. Diffusing capacity tended to be lower among the referents. The referents more often had atopy and earlier atopic diseases than the exposed workers. These results indicate the possibility of selection among the exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: No excess of prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the tobacco workers was found. According to the questionnaire episodes of allergic alveolitis may have occurred in the cigar factory workers. However, in the absence of impairments in lung function and radiological changes it was not possible to distinguish <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> and allergic alveolitis. In exposure conditions that include humidification of the air <b>humidifier,</b> <b>fever</b> and allergic alveolitis constitute a risk for tobacco workers.

Several systems can be used although in terms of installation and running costs a simple radiator system is far more economical than air conditioning with complete temperature and humidity control. Humidity control requires the introduction of water into a moving current of air, and in such a system baffle plates are often used to eliminate large droplets; also any unused water is usually recirculated. Organic dust drawn into the system and settling on the baffle plates and in the mixing chamber may be utilised by micro-organisms introduced from the atmosphere and from the water supply, and a biomass builds up. Microbial material is then voided into the working atmosphere by the ventilation system...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis or <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> {{were attributed to}} the inhalation of organic material aerosolized by a chilled-water spray humidification system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to isolate and characterize the serologically detectable antigen(s) present in extracts obtained from the humidification system. By using bicarbonate or phenol-water extractions or both, the antigen was isolated and characterized, using colorimetry, gas-liquid chromatography, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and X-ray fluorescence. Carbohydrates, hexosamines, phosphorus, and even-numbered saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were constituents of the serologically detectable antigen. When tested in in vivo and in vitro assays, the antigen had demonstrable endotoxin activity. All subjects with biopsy-proven lung disease and a majority of subjects suspected of having lung disease had antibodies directed toward the purified endotoxin. The data strongly suggest that an aerosolized bacterial endotoxin is a putative agent inducing lung disease...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evaluate the in vitro effects of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide on viability and function of human alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and saline bronchial lavage from 12 normal, nonsmoking volunteers. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of E. coli endotoxin for 1 and 24 h. Endotoxin (10 microgram/ml and more) was cytotoxic for alveolar macrophages after 24 h of incubation and induced significant inhibition of phagocytosis, adherence, and spreading. The effects of endotoxin on alveolar macrophage viability and function were dose and time dependent and were not influenced by indomethacin. Thus, human alveolar macrophages, like other mononuclear phagocytes, are extremely sensitive to endotoxin effects; these observations may be relevant in conditions in which endotoxin may be in contact with alveolar macrophages in vivo: endobronchial infections with gram-negative organisms, byssinosis, chronic bronchitis of grain handles, and <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the clinical and sociomedical outcome {{in patients with}} various clinical manifestations of humidifier disease and work related asthma after removal from further exposure. METHODS: Follow up investigation (range 1 - 13 years) of respiratory symptoms, spirometry, airway responsiveness, sickness absence, and working situation in patients with (I) <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> (n = 12), (II) obstructive type of humidifier lung (n = 8), (III) restrictive type of humidifier lung (n = 4), and (IV) work related asthma (n = 22). All patients were working at departments in synthetic fibre plants with microbiological exposure from contaminated humidification systems or exposure to small particles (< 1 micron) of oil mist. RESULTS: At follow up patients with work related asthma were less often symptom free (37 %, 7 / 19) than patients with humidifier disease (I, II, III) (67 %, 16 / 24). Mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) of patients with obstructive impairment had been increased significantly at follow up but still remained below the predicted value. Mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of patients with initially restrictive impairment had returned to normal values at follow up. Airway hyperresponsiveness at diagnosis persisted in patients with obstructive impairment (II + IV 14 / 17, but disappeared in patients with <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> (3 / 3) and restrictive type of humidifier lung (2 / 2). In patients with obstructive impairment (II + IV), FVC and FEV 1 at diagnosis were negatively associated with the duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis {{and the number of}} years of exposure. Those with positive pre-employment history of respiratory disease had a lower FEV 1 at diagnosis. Sickness absence due to respiratory symptoms decreased in all groups of patients after removal from further exposure, but this was most impressive in patients with the humidifier lung (II, III) and patients with work related asthma (IV). At follow up 83 % of the patients were still at work at the same production site, whereas 11 % received a disability pension because of respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: In patients with work related respiratory disease caused by exposure from contaminated humidification systems or oil mist, removal from further exposure resulted in clinical improvement, although, especially in those with obstructive impairment, signs persisted.

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} survey investigating "building sickness" {{was carried out}} in two buildings with similar populations of office workers but differing ventilation systems, one being fully air conditioned with humidification and the other naturally ventilated. The prevalence of symptoms related to work was assessed by a questionnaire administered by a doctor. A stratified, randomly selected sample of workers was seen (84 % response). Building sickness includes several distinct syndromes related to work, most of which were significantly more common in the air conditioned building than the naturally ventilated building [...] namely, rhinitis (28 % v 5 %), nasal blockage and dry throat (35 % v 9 %), lethargy (36 % v 13 %), and headache (31 % v 15 %). The prevalence of work related asthma and <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> was low and did not differ significantly between the two buildings. An environmental assessment of the offices was performed to attempt to identify possible factors responsible for the differences in the prevalence of disease.

None of these factors differed between the buildings, suggesting that building sickness is caused by other factors...|$|E
40|$|In a {{synthetic}} fiber production site with recirculating cold water humidification systems and small-size-particle (. 0. 1 µ, 1 µ) oil mist exposure, humidifier disease was diagnosed in several workers. The patients could {{be divided into}} three groups illustrating the clinical spectrum of humidifier disease: <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> (toxic inhalation fever) (12 patients); an asthma-like syndrome (8 patients); and allergic alveolitis (4 patients). Natural challenge at the work place, monitored by parameters such as peak-flow, spirometry, blood leucocyte count, and body temperature, provided important diagnostic information. In patients with chronic allergic alveolitis, a gradual recovery during an exposure-free period indicated a work-related causation, more than changes during challenge in normal work. In some patients, the fungus Sporothrix schenckii, hitherto unknown as a sensitizer, may {{have been at least}} one of the causative antigens. Measured levels of viable fungi (# 100 CFU/m 3) and endotoxin (64 pg/m 3) in air samples were much lower than those at which health effects usually are reported. Small-size-particle oil mist exposure may have underestimated the exposure to microorganisms, but otherwise an adjuvant role to this type of co-exposure might also be postulated. In contrast to allergic alveolitis, the asthma-like syndrome appeared to be more common in patients with a history of atopy and of smoking. Am. J. Ind. Med...|$|E
40|$|Background Since the mid- 1990 s, {{outbreaks}} of asthma and {{extrinsic allergic alveolitis}} (EAA) have been identi-fied in workers exposed to metalworking fluids (MWFs). The cause of these outbreaks remains to be determined. Aims To identify and review all previously published occupational lung disease case definitions and diag-nostic criteria that have been utilized during MWF outbreak investigations. Methods Respiratory outbreaks due to MWFs were identified by a systematic literature search for articles published between 1990 and October 2011. Investigations reporting the usage of disease case defini-tions or diagnostic criteria for respiratory disease were reviewed and summarized. Results The literature search identified 35 papers relating to 27 {{outbreaks of}} respiratory disease in MWF-exposed workers. Fourteen case definitions for MWF-related respiratory disease were identified: seven for EAA, five for occupational asthma and one each for <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> and industrial bron-chitis. A single paper was identified where any comparison of different disease case definitions (for EAA) had been performed. Conclusions A range of case definitions and diagnostic criteria for MWF respiratory disease have been utilized in outbreak investigations, but the majority have been produced for individual outbreak investigations without previous validation. It {{may be difficult to}} compare the findings of future workplace studies without a more standardized approach to case identification and diagnosis.

40|$|Objective: Follow-up {{study of}} {{exposure}} and acute exposure-effects after modification to steam humidification of a contaminated cold water system which had caused {{an outbreak of}} <b>humidifier</b> <b>fever</b> in a synthetic-fibre plant. Methods: Before and after modification of the system aerobiological measurements were performed. Concentrations of fungi and bacteria, in colony forming units (cfu) per m(3), were measured by stationary air sampling with an Andersen sampler. Endotoxin levels (pg/m(3)) were determined by Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay in pooled dust from personal air sampling. An indication of exposure levels of oil-mist was obtained by monitoring with a direct leading optical photometer. Changes as acute exposure effects in spirometry and white blood cell count, during an afternoon shift were compared in exposed and non-exposed workers before and after modification. Results: Measured levels of fungi, total bacteria, Gramnegative bacteria and endotoxins {{both before and after}} modification were below levels which would be expected {{to be associated with the}} exposure-effects. However, after modification, we found that the statistically significant differences in levels of bacteria and endotoxins with a department without humidification no longer existed. Mean oil-mist concentrations were below 1 mg/m(3), with short-time peak exposure during certain tasks of up to 5 mg/m(3) Before modification, in exposed workers there was significantly more decline of spirometry, and more increase of white blood cell count during the first afternoon shift, compared with nonexposed workers. In exposed workers, the white blood cell count increase was positively associated with decline of spirometry. After modification, differences between exposed and non-exposed workers no longer existed. Conclusion: Follow-up investigation of acute exposure-effects demonstrated the effectiveness of remedial actions taken against a contaminated humidification system. Follow-up of exposure-effects in particular is recommended when there is doubt about the interpretation of exposure measurements...|$|E
