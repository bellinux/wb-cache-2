5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the oldest}} of the Stanley girls, Mimi was the last of them to die. Cynthia, Sean and Ono {{attended}} her funeral on 12 December 1991: McCartney, Harrison, and Starr all sent <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Despite the animosity between Cynthia and Mimi, Varcoe remembered Cynthia crying throughout the whole funeral, and said that Mimi had always spoken positively about her. Mimi was cremated at the Poole Crematorium and the reception was at the Harbour Heights Hotel. The whereabouts of her ashes is unknown. Ono put Mimi's house up for sale on the same day as the cremation, but it was demolished in 1994, so a four-bedroomed house could be built on the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{homecoming}} celebration {{went on for}} days. Officials and {{the general}} population of the island crowded the shoreline to cheer their returning monarch. Speeches were made in both English and Hawaiian, and some people stood on rooftops for a glimpse. <b>Floral</b> <b>arrangements</b> permeated the city, welcome-home signs were displayed, and music was everywhere. Along his route to Iolani Palace, the procession passed beneath numerous festooned arches erected for his homecoming. A daytime parade was held in his honor. The palace was opened for the public to personally greet the King. The Honolulu Fire Department and the Poola Association began an evening torchlight parade at a bell tower brightly lit with Chinese lanterns, and proceeded through the streets of downtown Honolulu to the palace.|$|E

25|$|The feast day {{for this}} {{neighborhood}} is 8 December. The façade of the La Conchita Church {{is decorated with}} a large flower portal, usually donated by a sister community of Coyoacán such as Los Reyes or La Candelaria. The festival begins with chamber music and then the patron image of the Virgin Mary is “awakened” with the song Las Mañanitas as she is surrounded by numerous <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements</b> for mass. On the plaza {{in front of the}} church, wind bands play while participants share tamales and atole. Later in the night, student musical groups perform callejoneadas where they roam the streets playing music as a traveling party.|$|E
25|$|The seeds {{themselves}} {{do not contain}} significant amounts of opiates. But a poppy tea consumed in some areas and {{often referred to as}} doda has been controversial for containing ground opium poppy plant, especially the seed head, and contains significant levels of opiates. Popular in some South Asian communities, doda is created by grinding dried poppy husks or poppy seeds into a fine powder and then ingesting the mix with hot water or tea. In Canada, doda is made from poppy plants brought in from Afghanistan and Arizona under the guise of legal purposes such as <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements,</b> but is sold illegally from some meat markets.|$|E

25|$|Yale {{received}} {{one of the}} most impressive gangland funerals in American history, at which thousands of Brooklynites lined the streets to watch the procession. He was buried wearing evening clothes, holding grey suede gloves and a gold rosary. Thirty-eight cars were required to bear all the <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements</b> while 250 Cadillac limousines carried the mourners. Yale's $15,000 silver casket rested on an open hearse with a podium. At Holy Cross Cemetery, there was additional drama when two different women claimed to be Yale's wife. As the casket was lowered, 112 mourners simultaneously tossed roses into the grave. Yale's funeral set a standard of opulence for American gangsters that has been seldom matched over the years.|$|E
25|$|Banmi Shofu Ryu, {{like all}} schools, {{originated}} {{from the first}} school of Ikebana. Bessie Yoneko Banmi Fooks, 1st Generation Headmaster and creator of Banmi Shofu Ryu, received her title in 1962 through the effortless and natural forms her Ikebana creations when she resided in Japan. Frequent visits to Kaohsiung Taiwan allowed Fooks to continue her studies and eventually earn her professor’s certificate and authorization {{for the establishment of}} Banmi Shofu Ryu. Fooks began her teachings in Tainan, Taiwan and continued to exhibit and demonstrate her works in several countries around the world for over 50 years. Fooks characteristically used driftwood to connect her <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements</b> with their living spirit. In Banmi Shofu Ryu, driftwood is the essence of the Ikebana creations.|$|E
500|$|Persoonia linearis {{is useful}} as a hedging plant and {{responds}} well to pruning. Its foliage {{has been used in}} <b>floral</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and its colourful bark is a horticultural feature. It is a fairly easy plant to grow in gardens, but is rarely seen due to difficulties in propagation. Germination from seed is low, and can take many months. Once established it can tolerate extended dry periods and is hardy to frosts. Optimum growing conditions are part shade and a well-drained acid soil, though P.linearis grows readily in full sun. Persoonias in general are sensitive to excessive phosphorus, and grow without fertiliser or with low-phosphorus slow-release formulations. They can also become deficient in iron and manganese. First cultivated in England in 1794 from seed, it was also reportedly propagated from cuttings; Andrews described it as a [...] "handsome greenhouse plant, continuing to flower through the autumnal months and producing good seeds." [...] Joseph Knight reported that cuttings would be successful as long as material was [...] "judiciously chosen", and that plants had set seed on occasion.|$|E
