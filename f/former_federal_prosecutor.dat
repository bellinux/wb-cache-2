25|$|The {{tradition}} of partisan balance {{can influence the}} governor's selection of a Chief Justice, a fact most recently demonstrated in 2006 when Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, a Republican, reached the mandatory retirement age. To avoid appointing a Republican to the highest judicial position in the state, then-governor, Democrat Jon Corzine instead elevated Associate Justice James R. Zazzali, a Democrat, to the chief justice position and appointed a Republican to fill the seat Zazzali had occupied. When Zazzali {{reached the age of}} 70 less than a year later, Corzine was able to nominate a Democrat, then-Attorney General and <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutor</b> Stuart Rabner, to serve as Chief Justice. The state Senate confirmed Rabner on June 21, 2007, and he was sworn in as Chief Justice eight days later.|$|E

40|$|Is it {{justified}} {{for states}} to appropriate private property rights?

For a half-century, racial minority Democrats {{were more likely to}} strike down government appropriations while Republican <b>former</b> <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> were more likely to uphold them. We find that pro-government physical takings precedent stimulated subsequent takings, expropriation of larger parcels, highway construction, and growth in construction, transportation, and government sectors as well as agriculture, retail, and financial sectors, overall economic growth, and property values. However, racial minorities were increasingly displaced, unemployed, and living in public housing, and the service sector declined.
