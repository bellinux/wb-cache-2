5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in <b>excavation</b> efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With <b>excavation</b> and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the <b>excavation</b> of Long House and Mug House.|$|E
50|$|Initial finds at Samrong Sen were by villagers' <b>excavations</b> while extracting for {{hydrated}} lime from shell <b>excavations</b> at this site; these initial finds were handed {{over by the}} villagers to the missionaries. After the first <b>excavations</b> of 1876 in the flood plains of Tonlé Sap, additional <b>excavations</b> were carried out by archaeologists at different locations within this site. Many of the large size collections made from the site during several <b>excavations</b> could have been from casual surface <b>excavations</b> and hence no specific methodology could be explained.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological <b>excavations</b> have {{revealed}} that {{the site of the}} castle has been inhabited since Neolithic times.

5|$|<b>Excavation</b> for the {{powerhouse}} {{was carried}} out simultaneously with the <b>excavation</b> for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its <b>excavation</b> was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before {{the last of the}} concrete was poured that May. The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted {{at the time of the}} formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500men remained to finish it and other structures. To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about , topped with layers of sand and tar.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>excavation,</b> several {{stones were}} placed in the {{original}} sockets {{in order to create a}} reconstruction of the original circle. A fence was then erected around the circle to discourage further interference.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological <b>excavation</b> was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, in addition to the foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures.

5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an <b>excavation</b> at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been {{discovered}} in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory <b>excavation.</b> Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full <b>excavation</b> of the site.|$|E
