[...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press called [...] "Dammit" [...] the [...] "perfect punk song, <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> and it's probably being covered in someone's basement right now." [...] Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of Blink-182's best songs, ranked [...] "Dammit" [...] at number one, commenting, [...] "The best songwriters don't capture what you're going through individually in your life – they capture the things that are common to all humanity, and there's something about [...] "Dammit"'s chorus, something about its opening C, D, E riff that sounds universal." [...] Complex in 2012 examined the song through the lens of its inclusion in Can't Hardly Wait (1998), calling it, [...] "one of the most iconic songs of the 90s – those three, unmistakable guitar chords, the two voices trading in verse (one sneering punk, the other, a throaty few octaves lower), and a soaring punk chorus." [...] At Billboard, it is described as a [...] "jump-around pop punk song".|$|E

Think about it: we are all sick of the thing, but in some primordial way it is still number one. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it...</b> Even our dislike and mockery is ritualistic.

'And how {{can anyone}} say that Lucy {{is not one of}} the noblest, most self-devoted creatures upon earth?' exclaimed Helen, with tears in her eyes; 'there she is, bearing all that terrible scolding, rather than say it was Harriet's fault, as <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> was.

Everyone knows about Lottie's goings-on, and you can see how people treat them--her and her mother. When Mrs Gray passes them in the street she always goes on the other side. No, I've always held my head high, and I'm always going to.

5000|$|Reynolds was on {{friendly}} {{terms with}} Eddie Mabo, and, {{in his book}} Why Weren't We Told?, describes the talks they had regarding Mabo's people's rights to their lands, on Murray Island, in the Torres Strait. Reynolds writes:Eddie ... would often talk about his village and about his own land, which he assured us would always be there when he returned because <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> belonged to his family. His face shone when he talked of his village and his land.So intense and so obvious was his attachment to his land that I began to worry about whether he had any idea at all about his legal circumstances. ... I said something like: [...] "You know how you've been telling us about your land and how <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it's</b> Mabo land? Don't you realise that nobody actually owns land on Murray Island? It's all crown land."He was stunned. ...

50|$|It's {{funny because}} no one understands the irony, because {{the whole point of}} me {{choosing}} that name was because it such a silly name...Obviously <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> as the name of the street.

50|$|While Grandpa is {{generally}} considered the wisest member of the family, {{he also has a}} decidedly stubborn streak. If he feels he isn't getting his due respect, he will let <b>everyone</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> and often sulk or go to extreme lengths to demonstrate his offense at a perceived slight. While generally a successful mad scientist and magician, he shows a somewhat sloppy approach to his craft, often proceeding with unwise experiments, without taking sensible precautions.|$|R
60|$|We {{may take}} as another {{illustration}} Malthus's doctrine of population. This illustration {{is all the}} better {{for the fact that}} his actual doctrine is now known to be largely erroneous. It is not his conclusions that are valuable, but the temper and method of his inquiry. As <b>everyone</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>it</b> was to him that Darwin owed an essential part of his theory of natural selection, and this was only possible because Malthus's outlook was truly scientific. His great merit lies in considering man not as the object of praise or blame, but as a part of nature, a thing with a certain characteristic behaviour from which certain consequences must follow. If the behaviour is not quite what Malthus supposed, if the consequences are not quite what he inferred, that may falsify his conclusions, but does not impair the value of his method. The objections which were made when his doctrine was new--that it was horrible and depressing, that people ought not to act as he said they did, and so on--were all such as implied an unscientific attitude of mind; as against all of them, his calm determination to treat man as a natural phenomenon marks an important advance over the reformers of the eighteenth century and the Revolution.|$|E

50|$|Episodes {{were mostly}} filmed {{in front of}} a live studio {{audience}} at Teddington Studios in London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on Wednesday evenings. Sue Vertue says that the live audience reinvigorated the company because no one had laughed at the material for a few days as <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> so well. A warm-up comedian updated the studio audiences about any important plot detail, introduced them to the performers, and provided entertainment while cameras and sets were being repositioned. Rob Rouse fulfilled this role for the fourth series.|$|R

Dohrn spoke again about Third World Struggles and anti-imperialism, things of which PL had no concern. She ended her speech with the proclamation that SDS “was becoming a revolutionary movement; and as such, it could not allow a group such as PL in its ranks”. Chanting began again, with PL fighting for their beliefs; however, it was basically over. “Although they controlled a third of the delegates at the final SDS convention,” the reality was that PL “had a presence in only a handful of the locations where SDS was active, and <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> It was over.”.|$|R

5000|$|Contrasting {{the focus}} of the two franchises, {{contributor}} J. C. Herzthe of The New York Times argued, [...] "Trek fandom revolves around technology because the Star Trek universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and Gong Show-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in Star Wars is nonsense, and <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> But no one cares because Star Wars isnt about science. Its epic drama. Its about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People dont get into debates about how the second Death Star works.
