25|$|In late 2011 {{and early}} 2012, Wyden {{attracted}} attention {{for working with}} GOP <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee Chair Paul Ryan to develop a Medicare reform plan {{that would result in}} the semi-privatization of the system, provoking a negative response from Wyden's Democratic allies, including President Obama. The proposal would keep traditional Medicare as an option, though it would also introduce private health insurance companies into an exchange in which they would offer competing plans to be paid for with government vouchers.|$|E
25|$|In May 2012, House Republicans {{put forward}} five {{separate}} budget proposals {{for a vote}} in the Senate. The Republican proposals included the House-approved proposal by <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Chairman Paul Ryan and one that was very close in content to the budget proposal submitted earlier in 2012 by President Barack Obama. The other three proposals each called for greatly reduced government spending. The budget put forward by Senator Mike Lee would halve the government over the next 25 years. Senator Rand Paul's budget included proposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security benefits and the closure of four Cabinet departments. The budget plan from Senator Patrick Toomey aimed to balance the budget within eight years. All five of the proposed plans were rejected in the Senate.|$|E

50|$|The {{variables}} are rk (rent in area k) and vi an unrestricted subsidy variable specific to each household group. Common sense {{says that a}} policy will be better for some than others, and that is reasoning behind the subsidy variable. The subsidy variable is also a policy variable because society may choose to subsidize <b>housing</b> <b>budgets</b> for some groups. The constraint equations may force such policy actions.|$|R

During the Iran–Iraq war of the 1980s, Frenzel was a proponent of economic ties to the regime of Saddam Hussein, and opposed congressional efforts to condemn Iraqi war crimes such as the infamous Halabja chemical attack, the deadliest chemical-weapons attack in history, on the grounds that they would disrupt future trade with Iraq. He also served as vice chairman of the Committee on House Administration, and vice chairman of the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards. He did not run for re-election to the House in 1990.|$|E
500|$|In {{his sixth}} term in 2008, Ryan began {{introducing}} budget proposals {{as a member}} of the House, distinct from his contributions to budget proposals in his capacity as a member and later ranking member and chair of the <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee.

500|$|Ryan was {{chairman}} of the <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> committee during the 2013 budget sequestration, debt-ceiling crisis, and federal government shutdown. He suggested using discussions about raising the federal debt ceiling as [...] "leverage" [...] to reduce federal spending. In January 2013, he said that sequestration would likely occur because the Democrats offered no alternative. Ryan voted against the Senate compromise continuing resolution that ended the shutdown, which included raising the debt ceiling and funding for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.|$|E

500|$|A {{competing}} plan, called The Path to Prosperity, {{was announced}} by House Republicans, led by <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee chairman Paul Ryan, on April 5, 2011. This plan would cut $5.8 trillion in spending over ten years, {{but would also}} reduce tax income by $4.2 trillion below current projections. The plan would make no further reduction in defense spending beyond the Obama administration's plan, but would make major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which was expected to pass more {{of the cost of}} these programs onto individuals. [...] It would also cut energy research and other applied research and development. This plan was criticized by Democrats for disproportionately cutting programs which benefit the disadvantaged and stifling innovation, while not cutting defense spending further and containing deep tax cuts. The House Republican plan was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 40–57 votes on May 25, 2011, the same day that the Obama budget was also defeated.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a {{newcomer}} to the House, Ferraro made a vivid impression upon arrival and quickly found prominence. She became a protégé of House Speaker Tip O'Neil, established a rapport with other House Democratic leaders, and rose rapidly in the party hierarchy. She was elected to be the Secretary of the House Democratic Caucus for 1981–1983 and again for 1983–1985; this entitled her to {{a seat on the}} influential Steering and Policy Committee. In 1983, she was named to the powerful <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee. She also served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee and the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, both of which allowed Ferraro to push through projects to benefit her district. In particular, she assisted the successful effort of the Ridgewood and Glendale neighborhoods to get their ZIP codes changed from Brooklyn to their native Queens. [...] Male colleagues viewed her with respect as someone who was tough and ambitious and in turn she was, as The New York Times later wrote, [...] "comfortable with the boys".|$|E
500|$|Beshear {{clashed with}} the state Council on Postsecondary Education over its hiring of Brad Cowgill as its president. Beshear said state law {{required}} that the Council conduct a national search for its president and that they hire someone with experience and an established reputation in higher education; he claimed that Cowgill, a Lexington lawyer and state budget director for former Governor Fletcher, was not qualified for the position and that the council hired him without a national search. Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway issued a non-binding opinion that the hiring was illegal under state law, and Cowgill resigned rather than wage a legal battle with Beshear. Beshear, who had considered asking all of the council members to resign or abolishing the council altogether {{in favor of a}} new one, praised Cowgill's decision. Democratic <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee Chairman Harry Moberly said Cowgill [...] "had the council headed in the right direction" [...] and added [...] "I would have been satisfied if Brad had the permanent position, but I do not criticize the governor for the role he had played [...]" [...] Senate President David Williams called Beshear's interference in the matter [...] "unfortunate".|$|E

50|$|In 2001 Freedom House had {{income of}} around $11m, {{increasing}} to over $26m in 2006. Much of the increase was due to an increase between 2004 and 2005 in US government federal funding, from $12m to $20m. Federal funding fell to around $10m in 2007, but still represented around 80% of Freedom <b>House's</b> <b>budget.</b> As of 2010, grants awarded from the US government accounted for most of Freedom House's funding; the grants were not earmarked by the government but allocated through a competitive process.|$|R

500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White <b>House</b> <b>Budget</b> Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

[...] Gingrich tapped Scarborough to head a Republican task force on education, and Scarborough declared, [...] "Our goal is to get as much money, power and authority out of Washington and get as much money, power and authority into the classroom as possible."
