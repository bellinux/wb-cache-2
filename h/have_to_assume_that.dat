60|$|The {{theory of}} warning colours is an {{excellent}} one, {{but it has been}} pushed too far. We have seen {{that one of the most}} common fireflies is diurnal in habits, or, at any rate, that it performs all the important business of its life by day, when it has neither bright colour nor light to warn its bird enemies; and out of every hundred species of insect-eating birds at least ninety-nine are diurnal. Raptorial insects, as I have said, feed freely on fireflies, so that the supposed warning is not for them, and it would be hard to believe that the magnificent display made by luminous insects is useful only in preventing accidental injuries to them from a few crepuscular bats and goatsuckers. And to believe even this we should first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> bats and goatsuckers are differently constituted from all other creatures; for in other animals--insects, birds, and mammalians--the appearance of fire by night seems to confuse and frighten, but it certainly cannot be said to warn, in the sense in which that word is used when we speak of the brilliant colours of some butterflies, or even of the gestures of some venomous snakes, and of the sounds they emit.|$|E
6000|$|This is not {{a proper}} {{occasion}} for saying anything about the adequateness of the catholic, or any other special manner of fostering and solacing the religious impulses of men. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the instructed class believe the catholic dogmas to be untrue, and yet wishes the uninstructed {{to be handed over}} to a system that reposes on the theory that these dogmas are superlatively true. What then is to be said of the tenableness of such a position? To the plain man it looks like a deliberate connivance at a plan for the propagation of error--assuming, as I say, for the moment, that these articles of belief are erroneous and contrary to fact and evidence. Ah, but, we are told, the people make no explicit affirmation of dogma; that does nothing for them; they are indifferent to it. A great variety of things might be said to this statement. We might ask, for instance, whether the people ever made an explicit affirmation of dogma in the past, or whether it was always the hazy indifferent matter which {{it is supposed to be}} now. If so, whether we shall not have to re-cast our most fundamental notions of the way in which Christian civilisation has been evolved. If not, and if people did once explicitly affirm dogma, when exactly was it that they ceased to do so? ...|$|E

60|$|Dr. Sharpe remarks (63. 'Man a Special Creation,' 1873, p. 119.), that a {{tropical}} sun, which burns and blisters a white skin, does not injure a black one at all; and, as he adds, {{this is not}} due to habit in the individual, for children only six or eight months old are often carried about naked, and are not affected. I have been assured by a medical man, that some years ago during each summer, but not during the winter, his hands became marked with light brown patches, like, although larger than freckles, and that these patches were never affected by sun-burning, whilst the white parts of his skin have on several occasions been much inflamed and blistered. With the lower animals there is, also, a constitutional difference in liability to {{the action of the}} sun between those parts of the skin clothed with white hair and other parts. (64. 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,' vol. ii. pp. 336, 337.) Whether the saving of the skin from being thus burnt is of sufficient importance to account for a dark tint having been gradually acquired by man through natural selection, I am unable to judge. If it be so, we should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the natives of tropical America have lived there for a much shorter time than the Negroes in Africa, or the Papuans in the southern parts of the Malay archipelago, just as the lighter-coloured Hindoos have resided in India for a shorter time than the darker aborigines of the central and southern parts of the peninsula.|$|E
