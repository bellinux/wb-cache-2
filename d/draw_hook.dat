60|$|In my disposure of employments of the brain, I {{have thought}} fit to make {{invention}} the master, {{and to give}} method and reason the office of its lackeys. The cause of this distribution was from observing it my peculiar case to be often under a temptation of being witty upon occasion where I could be neither wise nor sound, nor anything to the matter in hand. And I am too much a servant of the modern way to neglect any such opportunities, whatever pains or improprieties I may be at to introduce them. For I have observed that from a laborious collection of seven hundred and thirty-eight flowers and shining hints of the best modern authors, digested with great reading into my book of common places, I {{have not been able}} after five years to <b>draw,</b> <b>hook,</b> or force into common conversation any more than a dozen. Of which dozen the one moiety failed of success by being dropped among unsuitable company, and the other cost me so many strains, and traps, and ambages to introduce, that I at length resolved to give it over. Now this disappointment (to discover a secret), I must own, gave me the first hint of setting up for an author, and I have since found among some particular friends that it is become a very general complaint, and has produced the same effects upon many others. For I have remarked many a towardly word to be wholly neglected or despised in discourse, which hath passed very smoothly with some consideration and esteem after its preferment and sanction in print. But now, since, by the liberty and encouragement of the press, I am grown absolute master of the occasions and opportunities to expose the talents I have acquired, I already discover that the issues of my observanda begin to grow too large for the receipts. Therefore I shall here pause awhile, till I find, by feeling the world's pulse and my own, that it will be of absolute necessity for us both to resume my pen.|$|E

The method comprises 4 consecutive steps: 1) a superficial T-shaped incision of Glisson’s capsule {{at the site of}} HP projection on the liver’s inferior surface, 2) introduction of the surgeon’s forefinger into the liver parenchyma, controlled by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament, the fingertip finding a tubular structure well distinguished by its smooth elastic surface from the friable parenchyma and bending the finger to hook the pedicle, 3) <b>drawing</b> the <b>hooked</b> pedicle downwards through the slit in the capsule and temporarily clamping it, while releasing the hepatoduodenal ligament so as to restore blood supply to the retained parts of the liver, 4) checking for correct ligature position on the HP before its final ligation by matching the actual ischemic area with the intended line of resection and moving the clamp proximally or distally along the exposed pedicle for the release or clamping of lateral branches as necessary. Whereupon resection can be performed by any of the known methods.

5000|$|The gill plate trade effects other {{marine species}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first is the impact that the fishing has on these other species which inhabit the rays {{ecosystem}} is when rays are caught intentionally they are typically caught by longline fishing. Longline fishing involves thousands of baited hooks on one very long fishing line close to the ocean's surface. These <b>hooks</b> <b>draw</b> many species including birds, marine mammals, fish, sharks, and rays. The second impact of stingray fishing and population decline is an ecological effect. The stingrays are keystone predators in coral reef environments, when these species are declined the other reef species are effected through trophic factors, for instance predator populations decrease therefore prey populations increase, and risk effects. Risk effects are the behavioral mannerisms that prey learn to avoid predators, such as where or when to feed without becoming a meal for a predator. Without predators such as stingrays, the behavior of prey species is altered.|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of {{institutionalized}} homophobia afflicting public schools, the nation faces {{a unique opportunity to}} acknowledge and transform the assumption that all people are or should be heterosexual and gender-conforming. In this article, the author examines how people, as a nation, can reform schools to be more inclusive of diverse student identities, such as queer, by transforming educational policy to include the voices of marginalized youth. She begins by first describing federal legislation that excludes the protection of queer youth, subjecting millions of children to exploitation, humiliation, and condemnation within classrooms across the nation. Then, <b>drawing</b> from bell <b>hooks</b> (2000), and the theoretical framework offered by Gerstl-Pepin (2005), she examines the possibility of extending influence and power to queer youth and allies. She makes the case that the survival of nearly one-third of the student population (youth that are queer, questioning, or have family and/or friends who identity as such) depends upon an ongoing public awareness that queer identity and culture are vital and necessary parts of the whole. She offers a clear set of recommendations to bodies of government that influence schools, which transcend politics-as-usual in order to move the nation beyond the dominant forces of heterosexism and to empower queer youth within the educational system...|$|R
5000|$|Kevin Conneff {{was born}} in Donore, a village near Drogheda, in County Louth, Ireland {{and raised in the}} Liberties, in the heart of Dublin. Music was an {{important}} part of his home life but, as he later related, [...] "I didn't hear traditional music from the womb," [...] as did other members of the Chieftains. It wasn't until he began work as a photographic assistant for a printing machine company, at age 18, that he was introduced to Irish traditional music. A group of his work mates would hire a car every week to drive to one of the many fleadhs (traditional Irish music festivals) within reasonable driving distance. Kevin was <b>drawn</b> in and <b>hooked</b> by what he saw, musicians poorly dressed, having incredible talent but only playing the music for leisure, a music with a long long tradition. That image has remained with Kevin ever since. Kevin began going to a session every weekend, picking up the odd song here and there and joining the musicians. He was heavily influenced by the traditional style of singing from the Donegal/Fermanagh region in Ireland, particularly the singing of Paddy Tunney. At just about that time he picked up his first bodhrán for three pounds in Newcastle West, County Limerick. He'd heard the bodhrán on the radio, including the playing of Sean O Riada with Ceoltóirí Chualann, and was amazed at the power of the simple goatskin Irish frame drum.|$|R
60|$|There was one unhappy citizen {{within my}} {{knowledge}} {{who had been}} visited in a dreadful manner, so that his wife and all his children were dead, and himself and two servants only left, with an elderly woman, a near relation, who had nursed those that were dead {{as well as she}} could. This disconsolate man goes to a village near the town, though not within the bills of mortality, and finding an empty house there, inquires out the owner, and took the house. After a few days he got a cart and loaded it with goods, and carries them down to the house; the people of the village opposed his driving the cart along; but with some arguings and some force, the men that drove the cart along got through the street up {{to the door of the}} house. There the constable resisted them again, and would not let them be brought in. The man caused the goods to be unloaden and laid at the door, and sent the cart away; upon which they carried the man before a justice of peace; that is to say, they commanded him to go, which he did. The justice ordered him to cause the cart to fetch away the goods again, which he refused to do; upon which the justice ordered the constable to pursue the carters and fetch them back, and make them reload the goods and carry them away, or to set them in the stocks till they came for further orders; and if they could not find them, nor the man would not consent to take them away, they should cause them to be <b>drawn</b> with <b>hooks</b> from the house-door and burned in the street. The poor distressed man upon this fetched the goods again, but with grievous cries and lamentations at the hardship of his case. But there was no remedy; self-preservation obliged the people to those severities which they would not otherwise have been concerned in. Whether this poor man lived or died I cannot tell, but it was reported that he had the plague upon him at that time; and perhaps the people might report that to justify their usage of him; but it was not unlikely that either he or his goods, or both, were dangerous, when his whole family had been dead of the distempers so little a while before.|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} the {{classroom}} as an interactive learning space is most often used to describe that blend of online and physical learning tools such as discussion boards, chat rooms and streamed deliveries. However, postmodern conceptions of space challenge us to think of space as an imagined geography and a form of freedom (de Certeau, 1998) shaped by more abstract concepts such as identity, experience, and subjectivity. Viewed through this lens, the learning spaces of the classroom become empowered not through technological advances and their various blends, but by the desires and aspirations of the student and teacher. This paper uses the methodology of autoethnography, in which the self and individual narrative is examined as data (Chang, 2008), to map these different kinds of learning spaces through three case studies. The first, {{a case study in}} Education, draws on the porous boundaries of the primary school classroom {{as an example of a}} physically flexible, subjective, and interactive learning space. This learning space shifts with little resistance from indoors to outdoors, from homeroom to library floor, from chair to grassy oval, music to the dancer and art to the artist. Physical objects became learning tools long before pedagogy embraced the terms 'realia', 'digital natives' and 'eLearning'. This idea of the interactive classroom forms the basis of particular approaches in online education and can be used to develop resources for pre-service teachers preparing for education practicums and the design of flexible and inspiring learning spaces (MCYEETA 2008) and teaching the aesthetic (Sinclair 2009). The second, a case study in undergraduate Media Studies, <b>draws</b> on <b>hooks</b> (1994) and Gauntlett (2007) to argue that while the theoretical spaces of online learning can offer an effective entry point into learning, they work more effectively when enriched with practical, tactile experiences and performative applications. These are drawn from the material world and include face-to-face teamwork activities, the handling of media materials, puppetry and interview. As such, learning spaces are demarcated between theoretical (virtual) spaces (for broad conceptual thinking and critical reflection) and practical (physical) spaces (for practical application and media production). The final case study, in Writing, draws on Anderson (1983) and Andrew's (2011) concept of community as an imagined space to suggest that online PhD students in creative arts expand the space of their classroom by creating learning and sharing communities of fellow students. This recreates what they imagine to be the typical interactive space inhabited by the writer or arts practitioner rather than through the mediated space of the chat room or discussion board. In this way we argue that an understanding of learning spaces and of how to use each of these spaces to its maximum potential, has a profound effect on student learning, on creating a learner-led teaching environment and on student culture more generally. In this way we hope to offer both a new perspective on blended learning and a new understanding of what truly flexible, connected learning can be...|$|R
40|$|Originally {{entitled}} ‘Patronage, Artisan, Media and Audience: A {{model for}} Twenty-first Century Craftsmanship' this project {{set out to}} create of {{a body of work}} that exhibits crafts excellence and enables a clear understanding of the skills and investment that makes the creation of such work possible. Commercial garment patterns were abstracted and reassembled using techniques employed by the tailor, the butcher and the mortician. The composite forms create abstract figurative structures more akin to the carcasses of animals than the fashion identities from which the forms are generated. Volumes and extended surfaces of unprecedented scales were created from laminated leather hide rather than conventional fabric. Lamination was achieved by exploring the scale to which thickness of hide could be layered using the adhesive methods of the shoe and accessory industries. Tiny margins and tolerances in the thicknesses and structural properties determined the degree of flexibility and complexity of the forms that could be achieved, while techniques developed from research into the medical procedure of closing wounds was complemented with a degree of completion that masked the processes of assembly. Links between historical and contemporary identities are expressed through the development of original techniques for inlay, resulting from two years of research into sixteenth-century marquetry. Judith Clark's exhibition design focused on the pieces' resemblance to meat: large <b>hooks</b> <b>drew</b> attention to the many allusions the work makes to the fashion trade/meat market. In Mexico the exhibition added a butchers table as ‘alterpiece’ adding to the effect of 'Memento Mori'. Importance was placed on the catalogue as a dialogue between Clark as fashion curator, Jennifer Higgie as art critic and George L Legendre as architect, to provide new descriptions for the work: its “exhibitability”, its decorative richness and its mis-constructions. The essays were translated into Spanish for use within Mexican art institutions. The final body of work consists of an installation and performance for the gallery environment using mixed media props, including autopsy tables and commissioned metal structures more akin to a butchers window or abattoir...|$|R
