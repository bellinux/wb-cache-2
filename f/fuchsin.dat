50|$|Initially, Carbol <b>Fuchsin</b> stains every cell. When {{they are}} destained with acid-alcohol, only non-acid-fast {{bacteria}} get destained {{since they do}} not have a thick, waxy lipid layer like acid-fast bacteria. When counter stain is applied, non-acid-fast bacteria pick it up and become blue when viewed under the microscope. Acid-fast bacteria retain Carbol <b>Fuchsin</b> so they appear red.|$|E

5000|$|A {{protocol}} {{in which}} a detergent is substituted for the highly toxic phenol in the <b>fuchsin</b> staining solution.|$|E
50|$|Carbol <b>fuchsin</b> {{is applied}} to a heat-fixed slide. The slide is then heated over a bunsen burner, or {{suspended}} over a hot water bath, covered with a paper towel, and steamed for 3 minutes. The slide is rinsed with acidified ethanol, and counter-stained with Methylene blue. An improved method involves {{the addition of the}} surfactant Tergitol 7 to the carbol <b>fuchsin</b> stain, and the omission of the steaming step.|$|E
5000|$|The stains {{used are}} the red {{coloured}} Carbol <b>fuchsin</b> that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as Methylene blue ...|$|E
50|$|Acid <b>fuchsin</b> or {{fuchsine}} acid is an acidic magenta dye {{with chemical}} formula C20H17N3Na2O9S3. It has wide use in histology. It {{is one of}} the dyes used in Masson's trichrome stain. This method is commonly used to stain cytoplasm and nuclei of tissue sections in the histology laboratory in order to distinguish muscle from collagen. The muscle stains red with the acid <b>fuchsin,</b> and the collagen is stained green or blue with light green SF yellowish or methyl blue.|$|E
5000|$|The Schiff test is {{an early}} organic {{chemistry}} name reaction developed by Hugo Schiff, and is a relatively general chemical test for detection of many organic aldehydes that has also found use in the staining of biological tissues. The Schiff reagent is the reaction product of a dye formulation such as <b>fuchsin</b> and sodium bisulfite; pararosaniline (which lacks an aromatic methyl group) and new <b>fuchsin</b> (which is uniformly mono-methylated ortho to the dye's amine functionalities) are not dye alternatives with comparable detection chemistry.|$|E
50|$|Counterstaining with safranin. Carbol <b>fuchsin</b> is {{sometimes}} substituted for safranin since it more intensely stains anaerobic bacteria, {{but it is}} less commonly used as a counterstain.|$|E
5000|$|A typical AFB stain {{procedure}} involves {{dropping the}} cells in suspension onto a slide, then air drying the liquid and heat fixing the cells. The slide is flooded with Carbol <b>Fuchsin,</b> which is then heated to dry and rinsed off in tap water. The slide is then flooded with a 1% solution of hydrochloric acid in isopropyl alcohol (or methanol) to remove the carbol <b>fuchsin,</b> thus removing the stain from cells that are unprotected by a waxy lipid layer. Thereafter, the cells are stained in methylene blue and viewed on a microscope under oil immersion.|$|E
5000|$|Solution A, {{also called}} plasma stain, {{contains}} acid <b>fuchsin,</b> Xylidine Ponceau, glacial acetic acid, and distilled water. Other red acid dyes can be used, e.g. the Biebrich scarlet in Lillie's trichrome.|$|E
50|$|Fuchsine (sometimes spelled <b>fuchsin)</b> or rosaniline {{hydrochloride}} is a magenta dye {{with chemical}} formula C20H19N3·HCl. There are other similar chemical formulations {{of products sold}} as fuchsine, and several dozen other synonyms of this molecule.|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>fuchsin</b> stain in aqueous {{solution}} with phenol and ethanol colours many bacteria (both gram positive and Gram negative) red, magenta, or pink. A malachite green counterstain gives a blue-green background cast to the surrounding tissue.|$|E
50|$|Franz Ziehl {{introduced}} the carbol <b>fuchsin</b> stain for the tubercle bacillus in 1882. With pathologist Friedrich Neelsen (1854-1898), {{he developed the}} Ziehl-Neelsen stain, {{also known as the}} acid-fast stain, which is used to identify acid-fast bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Van Gieson's stain is {{a mixture}} of picric acid and acid <b>fuchsin.</b> It is the {{simplest}} method of differential staining of collagen and other connective tissue. It was introduced to histology by American neuropsychiatrist and pathologist Ira Van Gieson.|$|E
50|$|Deutsch {{was the son}} of Prague-based German {{merchant}} Ludwig Kraus and his wife, Louise. He married {{childhood friend}} Anuschka <b>Fuchsin</b> (daughter of Prague industrialist Arthur Fuchs) in 1922. Anuschka's cousin, Herbert Fuchs of Robettin, was the brother-in-law of author Franz Werfel.|$|E
50|$|One {{commonly}} recognizable use {{of differential}} staining is the Gram stain. Gram staining uses two dyes: Crystal violet and <b>Fuchsin</b> or Safranin (the counterstain) {{to differentiate between}} Gram-positive bacteria (large Peptidoglycan layer on outer surface of cell) and Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|For color {{blind people}} (or in {{backgrounds}} where detecting red bacteria is difficult) Victoria Blue {{can be substituted}} for carbol <b>fuchsin</b> and Picric acid {{can be used as}} the counter stain instead of methylene blue, and rest of Kinyoun technique can be used.|$|E
50|$|Moeller {{staining}} {{involves the}} use of a steamed dye reagent in order to increase the stainability of endospores; carbol <b>fuchsin</b> is the primary stain used in this method. Endospores are stained red, while the counterstain methylene blue stains the vegetative bacteria blue.|$|E
50|$|Endo agar {{contains}} peptone, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, agar, sodium sulfite, basic <b>fuchsin</b> and {{was originally}} {{developed for the}} isolation of Salmonella typhi, but is now commonly used in water analysis. As in MacConkey agar, coliform organisms ferment the lactose, and the colonies become red. Non-lactose-fermenting organisms produce clear, colourless colonies against the faint pink background of the medium.|$|E
50|$|In {{solution}} with phenol (also called carbolic acid) as an accentuator it {{is called}} carbol <b>fuchsin</b> and {{is used for the}} Ziehl-Neelsen and other similar acid-fast staining of the mycobacteria which cause tuberculosis, leprosy etc. Basic fuchsine is widely used in biology to stain the nucleus, and is also a component of Lactofuchsin, used for Lactofuchsin mounting.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 Schelmish {{fulfilled}} their fans' {{wish for}} a live album and released a CD called Schelmish - Live. It contains the full live recording from the 29 January 2005 {{show at the}} Kulturfabrik Krefeld. Die Rote <b>Füchsin</b> (Red Vixen) of Filia Irata appears as guest musician while Amsel von Nydeggen is no longer part of the band.|$|E
50|$|Mallory's trichrome stain is a stain {{utilized}} in histology {{to aid in}} revealing different macromolecules {{that make up the}} cell. It uses the three stains: aniline blue, acid <b>fuchsin,</b> and orange G. As a result this staining technique can reveal collagen, ordinary cytoplasm, and red blood cells. It is helpful, therefore, in examining the collagen of connective tissue.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fuchsin</b> {{solutions}} appear colored due to {{the visible}} wavelength absorbance of its central quinoid structure—see also for example viologen —but are [...] "decolorized" [...] upon sulfonation of the dye at its central carbon atom by sulfurous acid or its conjugate base, bisulfite. This reaction disrupts the otherwise favored delocalized extended pi-electron system and resonance in the parent molecule.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{component}} of Ziehl-Neelsen stain.Carbol <b>fuchsin</b> {{is used as a}} dye to detect acid fast bacteria because it is more soluble in the cells wall lipids than in the acid alcohol. If the bacteria is acid fast the bacteria will retain the initial red color of the dye because they are able to resist the destaining by acid alcohol.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} {{histology}} for staining collagen; {{for that}} purpose it is a standard dye in North America. In Masson's trichrome it {{is used as a}} counterstain to acid <b>fuchsin.</b> It is a critical component of Papanicolaou stains together with eosin Y and bismarck brown Y. It usually comes as a disodium salt. Its maximum absorption is at 630 (422) nm.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{cellular}} anatomy of teeth, oxytalan fibres are {{a component of}} the extracellular matrix. They were first described by Fullmer & Lillie (1958) in periodontal membranes. On light microscope examination, these fibres may be distinguished from mature elastic fibers by their failure to stain with aldehyde <b>fuchsin</b> solutions, unless they have been oxidized by potassium permanganate, performic acid or peracetic acid.|$|E
50|$|Gram {{staining}} is used {{to determine}} gram status to classify bacteria broadly. It {{is based on the}} composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine as a mordant, and a <b>fuchsin</b> or safranin counterstain to mark all bacteria. Gram status is important in medicine; {{the presence or absence of}} a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some antibiotics.|$|E
5000|$|When {{producing}} {{gas from}} coal big amounts of tar were left as by-product. In 1856 William Perkin discovered that tar {{could be used}} to make synthetic dyes from aniline. Engelhorn recognised quickly the opportunities Perkin`s discovery could have for his own business and founded a small aniline and dyestuff factory, which was located not far away from the Mannheim gasworks. In 1861 he started producing <b>fuchsin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Castellani was President of the International Society of Dermatology from 1960-1964, {{which he}} had founded in 1959. He was also {{professor}} of tropical medicine at the State University of Louisiana and also at the Royal University of Rome. He followed the Queen of Italy Marie José into exile in Portugal and ended his life as Professor at Lisbon's Institute of Tropical Medicine. Castellani died in 1971. Castellani's paint (Carbol <b>fuchsin</b> solution) is still occasionally used to treat fungal skin infections.|$|E
50|$|Mycobacterium leprae, {{also known}} as Hansen’s {{bacillus}} spirilly, mostly found in warm tropical countries, is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes leprosy (Hansen's disease). It is an intracellular, pleomorphic, acid-fast, pathogenic bacterium. M. leprae is an aerobic bacillus (rod-shaped) surrounded by the characteristic waxy coating unique to mycobacteria. In size and shape, it closely resembles Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Due to its thick waxy coating, M. leprae stains with a carbol <b>fuchsin</b> rather than with the traditional Gram stain. The culture takes several weeks to mature.|$|E
50|$|The Kinyoun method, or Kinyoun stain, is an {{acid-fast}} procedure used {{to stain}} any {{species of the}} genus Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Cryptosporidium species. It involves {{the application of a}} primary stain (carbol <b>fuchsin),</b> a decolorizer (acid-alcohol), and a counterstain (methylene blue). Unlike the Ziehl-Neelsen stain (Z-N stain), the Kinyoun method of staining does not require heating. In the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, heat acts as a physical mordant while phenol (carbol of carbol fuschin) acts as the chemical mordant. Since the Kinyoun stain is a cold method (no heat applied), the concentration of carbol fuschin used is increased.|$|E
