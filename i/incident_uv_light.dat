40|$|Abstract Recently, {{products}} that a have 3 -dimensional(3 D) micro structure {{have been in}} wide use. To fabricate these 3 D micro structures, several methods, such as stereo lithography, reflow process, and diffuser lithography, have been used. However, these methods are either very complicated, have limitations in terms of patterns dimensions or need expensive components. To overcome these limitations, we fabricated various 3 D micro structures in one step using a pair of diffusers that diffract the <b>incident</b> beam of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> at wide angles. In the experiment, we used positive photoresist to coat the Si substrate. A pair of diffusers(ground glass diffuser, opal glass diffuser) with Gaussian and Lambertian scattering was placed above the photomask in the passage of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> in the photolithography equipment. The <b>incident</b> rays of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> diffracted twice at wider angles while passing through the diffusers. After exposure, the photoresist was developed fabricating the desired 3 D micro structure. These micro structures were analyzed using FE-SEM and 3 D-profiler data. As a result, this dual diffuser lithography(DDL) technique enabled us to fabricate various microstructures with different dimensions by just changing the combination of diffusers, making this technology an efficient alternative to other complex techniques...|$|R

Also, the photo-inhibition effect increased with the period of illumination; the maximum effect being observed following a 5 -h illumination period.

First, we synthesized ZnO NPs having a uniform size distribution (ca. 4 nm); here, the concentration of ZnO NPs was highly dependent {{on the amount of}} added NaOH. These ZnO NPs then served as seeds for the hydrothermal growth of ZnO NW arrays on paper substrates. When we used our solution containing the highest concentration of ZnO NPs, we obtained dense and uniform ZnO NW arrays that had grown conformally on the paper substrate. TEM analysis of these ZnO NWs not only revealed their single-crystalline nature but also confirmed the polarity of ZnO to be Zn-polarized (through ABF STEM analysis). From measurements of the photocatalytic activity toward MB of the ZnO NW arrays on paper substrates at incident angles of 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 75 °, we calculated rate constants of 0.415, 0.244, 0.195, and 0.08 s- 1, respectively, revealing a dependence on the cosine of the <b>incident</b> angle of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> Such angle-dependent photocatalytic activity for biocompatible ZnO NWs on paper substrates suggests that such systems may have promising applications in the design of sterilization systems and light-harvesting devices.|$|R

Measurements were conducted based on cyclic polarization technique, complemented with SEM examinations. Addition of HG induced localized attack, rather than anodizing, via the formation of Al–gluconate soluble complex species. Complexation with gluconate (G−) anion was elucidated using elemental analysis, IR-spectroscopy and UV–vis spectra. The infrared spectral data is in agreement with coordination through carboxylate-to-metal, with G− acting as a monodentate ligand. A little ennoblement in the pitting potential (Epit) was observed for the illuminated electrode (little influence on pit nucleation). On the other hand, the anodic currents at potentials exceeding the pitting potential are greatly reduced upon illumination (significant influence on pit growth and propagation). These findings indicated that the incident photons of the UV light enhanced {{the resistance of the}} passive film towards localized attack. These explained in terms of a photo-induced modification of the passive film formed on the anode surface, which render it more resistant to the onset of attack.

These catalysts showed strong absorption of visible light and high activities for degradation of 2 -propanol in aqueous solution and partial oxidation of adamantane under irradiation at wavelengths longer than 440 nm. The oxidation states of the S and N atoms incorporated into the TiO 2 particles were determined to be mainly S 4 + and N 3 − from XPS spectra, respectively.

The surface dimension, phase formation, and lattice parameters of TNTs were determined by the field-emission-scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometer, respectively. The induced photocurrent intensity of TNTs was measured by a potentiostat/galvanostat. The well-defined and highly ordered TNTs were formed in glycerol electrolyte with a water content of 20 %. The inner diameter of the TNTs was mainly determined by the anodization voltage, while the length of the TNTs was affected by both anodization voltage and anodization time. The length of the nanotube was continually increased with anodization time until the rates of the electrochemical oxidization of Ti foil and the chemical dissolution of the TiO 2 film reached a dynamic equilibrium. The TNTs annealed at 600 °C demonstrated the highest induced photocurrent because of the crystallization of anatase and rutile phases. The increase in the tube length and the decrease in the inner diameter induced higher photocurrents under specific conditions of UV illumination because of a higher illuminated area.

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{absorption of}} sunlight by chromophoric {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) controls the degradation and export of DOM from Imnavait Creek, a beaded stream in the Alaskan Arctic. We measured concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as concentrations and characteristics of CDOM and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), during ice-free periods of 2011 – 2012 in the pools of Imnavait Creek and in soil waters draining to the creek. Spatial and temporal patterns in CDOM and FDOM in Imnavait Creek were analyzed in conjunction with measures of DOM degradation by sunlight and bacteria and assessments of hydrologic residence times and in situ UV exposure. CDOM was the dominant light attenuating constituent in the UV and visible portion of the solar spectrum, with high attenuation coefficients ranging from 86 ± 12 m − 1 at 305 nm to 3 ± 1 m − 1 in the photosynthetically active region (PAR). High rates of light absorption and thus light attenuation by CDOM contributed to thermal stratification {{in the majority of}} pools in Imnavait Creek under low-flow conditions. In turn, thermal stratification increased the residence time of water and DOM, and resulted in a separation of water masses distinguished by contrasting UV exposure (i. e., UV attenuation by CDOM with depth resulted in bottom waters receiving less UV than surface waters). When the pools in Imnavait Creek were stratified, DOM in the pool bottom water closely resembled soil water DOM in character, while the concentration and character of DOM in surface water was reproduced by experimental photo-degradation of bottom water. These results, in combination with water column rates of DOM degradation by sunlight and bacteria, suggest that photo-degradation is the dominant process controlling DOM fate and export in Imnavait Creek. A conceptual model is presented showing how CDOM amount and lability interact with <b>incident</b> <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> and water residence time to determine whether photo-degradation is "light-limited" or "substrate-limited". We suggest that degradation of DOM in CDOM-rich streams or ponds similar to Imnavait is typically light-limited under most flow conditions. Thus, export of DOM from this stream will be less under conditions that increase the light available for DOM photo-degradation (i. e., low flows, sunny days) ...|$|E
40|$|Footwear {{impression}} {{evidence in}} dust {{is often difficult}} to locate in ambient light and is a fragile medium that both collection and enhancement techniques can destroy or distort. The collection of footwear impression evidence always begins with non-destructive photographic techniques; however, current methods are limited to oblique lighting of the impression followed by an attempt to photograph in situ 12, 15, 17. For the vast majority of footwear impressions, an interactive collection method, and thus a potentially destructive procedure, is subsequently carried out to gather the evidence 18. Therefore, alternative non-destructive means for the preservation and enhancement of footwear impressions in dust merits further attention. Previous research performed with reflected ultraviolet (UV) photography and reflected ultraviolet imaging systems (RUVIS) has shown that there are additional non-destructive methodologies that {{can be applied to the}} search for and documentation of footwear impressions in dust 34, 36, 37. Unfortunately, these prior studies did not include robust comparisons to traditional oblique white light, instead choosing to focus on different UV wavelengths. This study, however, seeks to evaluate the use of a RUVIS device paired with a 254 nanometer (nm) UV light source to locate 2 -D footwear impressions in dust on multiple substrates against standard oblique white light techniques and assess the visibility of the impression and amount of background interference present. The optimal angle of <b>incident</b> <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> for each substrate was also investigated. Finally, this study applied an image enhancement technique in order to evaluate its usefulness when looking at the visibility of a footwear impression and the amount of background interference present for enhanced white light and RUVIS pictures of footwear impressions in dust. 	A collection of eight different substrate types was gathered for investigation, including vinyl composition tile (VCT), ceramic tile, marble tile, magazine paper, steel sheet metal, vinyl flooring, wood flooring, and carpet. Heel impressions were applied to the various substrates utilizing vacuum collected dust and normal walking pressure. Each substrate was then explored and photographed in ambient fluorescent light, oblique white light at 0, 15, 30, and 0 with the light source below the surface plane of the substrate, and 254 nm UV light at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 0 with the light source below the surface plane of the substrate. All pictures were evaluated for clarity and visible detail of the footwear impression and the amount of background interference present, selecting for the best images within a lighting condition group. Additional intra- and intergroup comparisons were carried out to explore differences created by the various lighting conditions. Enhanced images were then created with the best scored pictures and evaluated for additional modifications in impression visibility and background interference. 	Photographs of footwear impressions in dust illuminated with ambient fluorescent light proved to be the most difficult conditions under which a footwear impression could be visualized. However, both oblique white light and 254 nm UV light lighting conditions showed improvements in either visualization or background dropout, or both, over ambient light conditions. An assessment of the white light and 254 nm UV light RUVIS images also demonstrated that the best angles for the light source for all substrates were oblique 0 and oblique 0 below the surface plane of the substrate lighting. It was found that white light photographs generally provided higher visibility ratings, while RUVIS 254 nm UV light photographs provided better grades for reducing background interference. Enhanced images of white light conditions provided generally poorer quality and quantity of details, while enhanced RUVIS images seemed to improve upon these areas. 	 The use of a RUVIS to capture photographs of footwear impression evidence in dust was found to be a successful secondary non-destructive technique that can be paired with traditional oblique white light procedures. Additionally, the use of below the surface plane of the substrate lighting techniques were found to improve either visibility or background dropout, or both, over standard 0 oblique lighting, depending on the light source, and should be employed, when applicable. Finally, further investigation into digital photo-editing enhancement techniques for footwear impression evidence in dust is needed...|$|E

40|$|Murine {{epidermis}} {{contains two}} types of bone marrow-derived cells of the immune system, Langerhans' cells (LC), which are dendritic antigen-presenting cells, and Thy- 1 + dendritic cells (Thy- 1 + DEC), which express the gamma/delta T-cell receptor for antigen and hence are probably T cells whose function in the epidermis is unknown. Ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>light</b> greatly reduces the density of both of these cell types, and hence this {{may be one of}} the mechanisms by which <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> induces immunosuppression. It is important to develop strategies for protecting these cells from the effects of <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> In this study we show that topical all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and an orally administered retinoid, temarotene, protect both LC and Thy- 1 + DEC from being depleted by <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> However, neither retinoid inhibited the development of immunosuppression in response to application of a contact sensitizer. We also compared two congenic mouse strains, one albino, the other lightly pigmented and capable of tanning in response to <b>UV</b> <b>light.</b> There was no difference in the ability of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> to deplete LC or Thy- 1 + DEC in these two strains or of retinoids to inhibit their depletion. These studies demonstrate that retinoids but not melanin are able to inhibit <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> from depleting LC and Thy- 1 + DEC; however, there are other immunosuppressive effects of <b>UV</b> <b>light</b> which are not protected by the retinoids...|$|R
