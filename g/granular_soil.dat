40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} but {{comprehensive}} cyclic stress-strain model that incorporates particle breakage for <b>granular</b> <b>soils</b> including ballast and rockfill has been proposed {{on the basis of}} bounding surface plasticity theory within a critical state framework. Particle breakage and its effects are captured by a critical state line that is translated in voids ratio-stress space according to the dissipated energy (plastic work), through a hyperbolic function. A comprehensive equation related to particle breakage is proposed for the stress-dilatancy relationship in order to capture the complex dilatancy of <b>granular</b> <b>soils.</b> By extending Masing 2 ̆ 7 s rule to bounding surface plasticity theory and introducing a generalised homological centre, a combined isotropic-kinematic hardening rule and a mapping rule have been established to simulate more realistically the response of gravelly soils under cyclic loading. The applicability and accuracy of this model are demonstrated by comparing its predictions with experimental results for different types of <b>granular</b> <b>soils,</b> including rockfill, under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the intermediate principal stress ratio (i. e., the b-value) on the stress-dilatancy relation of coarse <b>granular</b> <b>soils</b> was investigated {{by a series of}} true triaxial compression tests conducted under the constant-. p 2 ̆ 7 and constant-. b loading conditions. It was observed that the peak and critical state friction angles increased with decreasing confining pressure or increasing b-value. An increase in the confining pressure or b-value resulted in a decrease in the maximum dilatancy angle. In addition, the relationship between the excess friction angle (i. e., the difference between the peak and critical state angles) and maximum dilatancy angle was greatly influenced by the b-value. A linear equation incorporating the effect of the b-value was proposed for this stress-dilatancy relationship.

40|$|Flow {{liquefaction}} {{is due to}} contractive {{response of}} loose <b>granular</b> <b>soils,</b> while cyclic mobility is related to both contractive and dilative responses of <b>granular</b> <b>soils.</b> These two failure mechanisms may occur in a single soil, depending on the density and confining pressure applied. However, due mainly {{to the lack of}} a unified framework to describe the contractive and dilative response of <b>granular</b> <b>soils</b> these two failure mechanisms are considered separately in current practice. The key issue in unified treatment of these failure mechanisms is correct modeling of dilatancy. The classical stress dilatancy theory in its exact form is incapable of doing this.

Such a state dependent dilatancy in conjunction with the critical state framework can effectively model both flow liquefaction and cyclic mobility over a wide range of material and stress states, using a single set of material constants.

40|$|AbstractThe bearing {{capacity}} of footings constructed on soft clay soil is considerably governed by soil settlement. In practice, the {{bearing capacity}} of foundations on soft clay {{can be improved}} by a layer of compacted sand or gravel. In this study numerical analysis is performed using the Mohr Column model {{and some of the}} results are ensured by field plate loading observations. It is demonstrated that the ultimate bearing capacity is directly proportional to the angle of internal friction of <b>granular</b> <b>soil</b> “ϕ”, the granular layer thickness “H”, and the foundation depth “D”, {{while at the same time}} it is inversely proportional to the footing diameter “B”. The ultimate capacity of surface footings (D/B= 0 and H/B > 2) increases about 67 % if the <b>granular</b> <b>soil</b> changes from medium to very dense. A significant enhancement in bearing capacity is achieved by increasing the ratio between the <b>granular</b> <b>soil</b> thickness and the footing diameter “H/B” up to four for surface foundations (D/B= 0) and up to six for deeper foundations (D/B= 1. 0). The failure mechanism is characterized by punch shear failure in the <b>granular</b> <b>soil</b> and Prandtl 1 failure in the lower soft clay soil.

The instability during undrained shearing under saturated conditions is described using relations between the state parameter and the peak shear strength or slope of the instability line of the soil.
