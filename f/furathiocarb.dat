40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{application}} of pesticides viz. (i) application of the chemical (carbofuran or <b>furathiocarb,</b> a carbofuran precursor) on seeds; and (ii) soil application of encapsulated formulations (Ca 2 +-, Al 3 +- and Fe 3 + alginate beads) of carbofuran were evaluated for their abilities to cope with practical problems resulting from the accelerated degradation of carbofuran in adapted soils. In previously-untreated soil, the half-life of carbofuran applied as the pure compound, the commercial microgranule formulation and the encapsulated formulation, was 8 weeks or more under standardized conditions (18 - 22 degrees C; 80 % of the soil water retention capacity). The half-life of the carbofuran applied on seeds was only 2 weeks in this soil. In the previously-treated soil, the half-life of the pure active ingredient of carbofuran was 3 weeks {{with some of the}} encapsulated formulations such as alginate-Fe 3 + beads and alginate-Ca 2 + beads co-formulated with the fungicide TMTD. There was some evidence that degradation occurred only after the active ingredient had diffused out of the beads. The persistence of <b>furathiocarb</b> and carbofuran applied on seeds was < 5 days for all the seed treatments tested in the previously-untreated soil. Encapsulated chemicals in alginate beads were more promising than seed treatment in increasing their persistence in soils showing accelerated degradation. It is, however, necessary to check whether these kinds of formulations are still effective with respect to their insecticidal activity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} in the northern Negev region of Israel in a field heavily infested with both cyst (Heterodera avenae) and lesion (Pratylenchus mediterraneus) nematodes. Wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Bet Lehem) seeds were coated with either seed-dressing formulation of <b>furathiocarb</b> 10 g a. i. /kg seed or emulsifiable concentrate formulations ofcarbofuran 10 g a. i. /kg seed or oxamyl 3. 6 g a. i. /kg seed. Untreated seeds served as control. The trial was arranged in a randomized block design with six replicates. Two months after germination, the population density of H. avenae in three treatments was 10 - 20 % of that of the control and that of P. mediterraneus was 20 - 35 %. The height of the wheat plants in the treated plots was 150 % of the control. Toward ripening, ear counts in the treatments were 20 - 31 % {{higher than in the}} control. Grain yield of the treatments was 38 - 48 % higher than that of the control...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of insecticides applicationto control the corn rootworm, Diabrotica spp., on no-till corn. Field trials were conducted ateight locations in Ponta Grossa, PR, during two years. The treatments used in plots weredifferent insecticides and application methods. The experimental design was a randomizedcomplete block replicated four times. To evaluate the effect of insecticides, soil samples of 20 x 20 x 20 cm were taken around the corn plants and examined to recover rootworm larvae. Root systems were evaluated for rootworm damage using a 1 - 6 visual scale. Also, wereevaluated stand, percentage of plants with symptoms and grain yield. The insecticideschlorpyrifos 10 G, terbufos 50 G, tebupirimfos 20 G, fipronil 20 G, and chlorpyrifos 450 SCe 480 EC applied in furrow provided the best larvae control. Seed treatment with thiodicarb,fipronil, imidacloprid, <b>furathiocarb</b> and fipronil+thiodicarb showed low efficiency to larval control. Insecticides application prevented root damage and yield loss (54 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Effect of presowing {{treatment}} of seeds with insecticides on parameters related to nodulation and nitrate reduction in soybean was studied in pot trial at the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria (2003 - 2004). It {{was found that}} insecticides Gaucho 600 FS (imidacloprid), Carbodan 35 ST (carbofuran) applied for presowing {{treatment of}} seeds at the doses of 1, 2 and 3 L/ 100 kg seeds, and Promet 400 CS (<b>furathiocarb)</b> (standard) at the dose of 3 L/ 100 kg seeds, had no suppressive effect on the root length, dry root mass and specific nodulating ability of plants. When used Gaucho 600 FS at the dose of 1 L/ 100 kg seeds, root mass was most developed, {{the largest number of}} nodules was formed, and specific nodulating ability was highest. The common tendency for decrease of nitrate reductase activity in leaves and significant increase in stems was found. Nitrate reductase activity increased in leaves, stems and roots in treatment with Carbodan 35 ST applied at the dose of 3 L/ 100 kg seeds. Chlorophylls ?+b/carotenoids ratio exceeded this of the control only in treatment with Gaucho 600 FS at the dose of 1 L/ 100 kg seeds. However the analysis of the plant biomass did not include the amount of possible undegraded traces after using the insecticides tested...|$|E
