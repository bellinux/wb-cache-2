5|$|Because <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> {{are located}} so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, {{a witness}} to the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> Only the remarkable punting of Simkins kept the game from being a debacle. I recall vividly one incident of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how surprising was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. <b>Its</b> <b>feet</b> are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 season {{started with}} a sole win and a draw from the Crusaders' first five matches; this {{included}} a 6—0 loss to the Highlanders. The side found <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> later in the season, and won key away games which ultimately saw them finish in fourth place on the table – {{just ahead of the}} Waratahs. Both the Crusaders and Waratahs finished the season with 41 competition points, but the Crusaders advanced through to the semi-finals due to a greater 'points for and against' difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with <b>its</b> <b>feet,</b> and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E

5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The mountain's first {{recorded}} climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs, {{and a number}} of archeological sites, were found on the mountain and at <b>its</b> <b>feet.</b> With an archeological site at the summit region, Llullaillaco is the highest archeological site in the world. There, in 1999, the mummified remains of three children, known as the Children of Llullaillaco, were found. They are presumed to have been human sacrifices.|$|E

Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} uses <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> {{extensively in}} feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. <b>Its</b> <b>feet</b> had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E

5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> are smaller. Barbary falcons breed {{at different times of}} year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E
5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on <b>its</b> <b>feet,</b> and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran rhino is {{a mostly}} solitary animal except for {{courtship}} and offspring-rearing. It {{is the most}} vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with <b>its</b> <b>feet,</b> twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, {{in part because of}} a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in ex situ breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon to be logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck {{is short and}} thick. It swims very low in the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with <b>its</b> <b>feet</b> trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|E
