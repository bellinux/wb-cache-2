5|$|On March 18, {{two days}} before the filing deadline, Nixon <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> both the Republican and Democratic {{primaries}} under California's cross-filing system. Voorhis also <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> the two major party primaries. Under cross-filing, if the same candidate won both major party endorsements, he would be effectively elected, with only minor party candidates to stand against him. Day advanced the $200 (the current equivalent of $2,230) for Nixon's filing fees, later noting that he had great difficulty being reimbursed.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and {{libel suit}} against Skeeters (who died in January 2007) and Dr. Phil. in Los Angeles. Holloway's parents responded by filing a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> New York City by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York. The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> an inconvenient forum.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Boston Globe {{columnist}} Adrian Walker proposed renaming Yawkey Way and Yawkey station {{because their}} current namesake, Tom Yawkey, was a racist {{who made the}} Red Sox the last major league team to hire black players.

A bill to change the station's name was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{would still}} be {{vulnerable}} to civil lawsuits from passengers' families. Compensation awarded (or settlements reached out-of-court) during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court. An American court could likely award upwards of US$8–10million, while Chinese courts would likely award {{a small fraction of}} that. Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors, a move that would allow compensation claims to be made. The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> October 2014–before Flight 370 was declared an accident–on behalf of two Malaysian boys whose father was a passenger, for negligence in failing to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination. Additional lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines have been <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> China and Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|On August 11, 1992, U.S. District Judge George Lindberg {{dismissed}} the City of Chicago from the lawsuit, but ruled that Superintendent Martin {{must go to}} trial and that the three aldermen violated Nelson's civil rights. Lindberg supported the recommendations regarding that issue Magistrate Judge Elaine Bucklo's had made in March1992.

5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a retrial. A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{new round}} of {{concession}} applications were <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> 1987: Trondheim to Northern Norway, Tromsø–Longyearbyen, Oslo–Billund and Oslo–Alicante. The right-winged Willoch's Second Cabinet decided to use three principles in issuing new concessions: keeping the array of local routes, granting concessions on the terms that the airlines would continue to cross-subsidize routes, and to introduce competition on the largest routes. Braathens SAFE was given permission to fly Oslo–Bergen and Western Norway – Trondheim – Bodø – Tromsø, plus once daily Oslo–Trondheim–Bodø, as well as Tromsø–Longyearbyen. At the same time, SAS was allowed to fly freely on the routes Oslo–Trondheim and Oslo–Stavanger. In 1988, Braathens SAFE introduced automatic check-in machines in Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, Ålesund and Trondheim.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the case}} was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, three {{important}} United States Supreme Court cases were decided which determined {{the constitutionality of}} New Deal measures, one of which originated in the Eastern District of Missouri. The case, originally filed as Norman v.

The Supreme Court upheld {{the determination of the}} trial court judge, Charles Breckenridge Faris, who found that Congress had the power to prohibit parties from contracting for payment in gold.|$|E
