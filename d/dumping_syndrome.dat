25|$|Normally, the pyloric valve at {{the lower}} end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a {{physiological}} reaction called <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The body will flood the intestines with gastric content in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may feel their heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into a cold sweat, get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have an anxiety attack.

40|$|Our {{goal was}} to study the {{accuracy}} of a limited assessment relative to the traditional and obtain a more detailed approach to measure gastric emptying. Methods: We prospectively evalu ated 35 patients referred to our laboratory with suspected fast or slow gastric emptying. Transit was measured radioscintigraphi-cally after ingestion of an egg meal containing 99 mTc-Amberlite pellets. Gastric emptying was analyzed by power exponential analysis. Diagnostic accuracy of simpler indices (gastric residual at 2 and 4 hr) was determined by comparing the categorization of patients as normal or abnormal relative to previously pub lished normal data from our laboratory. Results: Gastric residual at 2 hr showed greater diagnostic accuracy for accelerated gas tric emptying with 90 % sensitivity at 90 % specificity. Gastric residual at 4 hr was less accurate for accelerated emptying, but was more accurate at detecting delayed gastric emptying with 100 % sensitivity at 70 % specificity. In contrast, sensitivity and specificity of gastric residual at 2 hr for slow emptying were low (100 % sensitivity with 20 % specificity) emphasizing the impor tance of obtaining a scan later than 2 hr for detecting delayed gastric emptying. Conclusion: Selective scans taken at 2 and 4 hr provide an excellent screening test for detecting fast or slow gastric emptying; the accuracy of 2 -hr data is optimal for accel erated emptying {{and that of the}} 4 -hr data greater for delayed emptying. This strategy provides a simple, less expensive way to evaluate gastric emptying in clinical practice with acceptable sensitivity and specificity as an initial test for patients with clini cally suspected gastric stasis or <b>dumping</b> <b>syndromes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Lesser omental transection during gastric bypass for {{morbid obesity}} may be {{associated}} with postop-erative dumping. A survey of postoperative symptoms was performed in patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with transection vs. preservation of the lesser omentum. Methods A written questionnaire on dumping symptoms was administered to patients 2 years after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with or without transection of the lesser omentum. Statistical testing was performed to deter-mine whether the rate of various symptoms was related to the transection of the lesser omentum. Results The patients without lesser omental transection had significantly less symptoms than the patients with transection for 11 out of the 17 symptoms that were queried (p< 0. 05). Ingestion of sweets was associated with dumping symptoms more frequently in the group of transected patients, and this group also had a lower frequency of sweet eating (p< 0. 05). Conclusion This study demonstrated that transection of the lesser omentum during laparoscopicâ€“gastric bypass was associated with more postoperative dumping symptoms compared to bypass with preservation of the lesser omentum. This association may be secondary to a partial vagotomy that may occur if the lesser omentum is transected during gastric bypass. Keywords Gastric bypass. Morbid obesity. Vagotomy.

50|$|Oxyhyperglycemia is most {{commonly}} caused by early <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{but it can}} rarely caused by other conditions like Graves' disease. It was first described by Lawrence et al in 1936 as often happening after gastroenterostomy. It is seen in most forms of gastrectomy, gastric bypass and gastrostomy procedures, {{all of which are}} surgical causes of <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{less likely}} due to the {{preservation}} of the pylorus (although dumping can occur any time stomach surgery takes place).|$|E
50|$|Physicians {{diagnose}} <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{primarily on}} the basis of symptoms in patients who have had gastric surgery. Tests may be needed to exclude other conditions that have similar symptoms. Two ways of determining if a patient has <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> include barium fluoroscopy and radionuclide scintigraphy. In the first procedure, a contrast of barium-labeled medium is ingested and x-ray images are taken; early dumping can be easily recognized by premature emptying of the contrast medium from the stomach.|$|E
50|$|In oxyhyperglycemia, {{both the}} {{upstroke}} (by 30 minutes) and down stroke (by 2.5 hr) happens quite fast which is unusual for {{other forms of}} prediabetes. In most cases of impaired tolerance, glucose levels usually do not come down as quickly, rather lasts for 2 hours or more. Whereas if the oxyhyperglycemia is due to an early <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> it may {{be followed by a}} late <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> which may even have a hypoglycemic state. For animal studies, occasionally oxyhyperglycemia is written as synonymous for impaired glucose tolerance but mostly in the right context of gastrectomy, thus actually implying its narrower meaning than impaired glucose tolerance.|$|E
50|$|There {{are certain}} {{patients}} who cannot tolerate the malabsorption and <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with gastric bypass. In such patients, although earlier {{considered to be}} an irreversible procedure, there are instances where gastric bypass procedure can be partially reversed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is largely}} {{manageable}} by avoiding certain {{foods that are}} likely to cause it; therefore having a balanced diet is important. Treatment includes changes in eating habits and medication. People who have gastric <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> need to eat several small meals a day that are low in carbohydrates, avoid simple sugars, and should drink liquids between meals, not with them. People who are very sensitive to choking on their foods can choose to drink small amounts of liquid with meals to prevent choking. In most cases, only small meals low in carbohydrates and simple sugars will suffice to manage this condition, as it is actually the sugar that is responsible for the dumping and not the water itself. Fiber delays gastric emptying and reduces insulin peaks and therefore also helps to reduce <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome.</b> People with severe cases may take medicine (such as octreotide and cholestyramine) or proton pump inhibitors (such as pantoprazole and omeprazole) to slow their digestion. Doctors may also recommend surgery. Surgical intervention may include conversion of a Billroth II to Billroth I or Billroth I to a Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy.|$|E
50|$|Hypoglycemia due to <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{and other}} post-surgical {{conditions}} is best {{dealt with by}} altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with a glucosidase inhibitor, which slows starch digestion.|$|E
50|$|Because the pyloric valve {{between the}} stomach and small {{intestine}} is preserved, people who have undergone the DS do not experience the <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> common with people who've undergone the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY). Much of {{the production of the}} hunger hormone, ghrelin, is removed with the greater curvature of the stomach.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{effect of the}} removal of the stomach is the loss of a storage place for food while it is being digested. Since only a small amount of food can be allowed into the small {{intestine}} at a time, the patient will have to eat small amounts of food regularly in order to prevent gastric <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|In early <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{pancreatic}} glucagon is augmented in {{the early}} postprandial period, probably through stimulation the catecholamines involved in the generalized autonomic surge induced by the osmotic load, but at 120 min, {{when most of the}} hypoglycemias are encountered, pancreatic glucagon is no longer detectable, likely through inhibition by GLP-1. Incretins including GLP1 and GIP also bring in the late dumping effects including the insulin rise and the reactive hypoglycemia.|$|E
5000|$|Complications include [...] "gas bloat syndrome", {{dysphagia}} (trouble swallowing), <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome,</b> excessive scarring, {{vagus nerve}} injury and, rarely, achalasia. The fundoplication can also come undone {{over time in}} about 5-10% of cases, leading to recurrence of symptoms. If the symptoms warrant a repeat surgery, the surgeon may use Marlex or another form of artificial mesh to strengthen the connection. Postoperative irritable bowel syndrome, which lasts for roughly 2 weeks, is possible.|$|E
50|$|The second method, {{scintigraphy}} (or radionuclide scanning), {{involves a}} similar procedure {{in which a}} labeled medium containing 99mTc (or other radionuclide) colloid or chelate is ingested. The 99mTc isotope decays in the stomach, and the gamma photons emitted are detected by a gamma camera; the radioactivity of the area of interest (the stomach) can then be plotted against time on a graph. Patients with <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> generally exhibit steep drops in their activity plots, corresponding to abnormally rapid emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum.|$|E
50|$|Oxyhyperglycemia is {{a special}} type of Impaired glucose {{tolerance}} characterized by a rapid and transient hyperglycemia (ie rise in blood glucose) spike after an oral intake of glucose, the peak of this spike being high enough to cause transient, symptom free glycosuria (i.e. detectable glucose in urine), but this hyperglycemia reverses rapidly and may even go to hypoglycemia in the later phase. This sharp downstroke overshooting towards hypoglycemia distinguishes this pathologic phenomenon from the artificial hyperglycemia inducible by an intravenous bolus dose of {{a large amount of}} glucose solution. Early <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients usually have oxyhyperglycemia associated with any meal or OGTT.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{condition}} where ingested foods pass through the stomach very rapidly and enter the small intestine largely undigested. It happens when the small intestine expands too quickly due {{to the presence of}} hyperosmolar (having increased osmolarity) contents from the stomach, especially sweet foods. This causes symptoms due to the fluid shift into the gut lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. [...] "Early" [...] dumping begins concurrently within 15 to 30 minutes from ingestion of a meal. Symptoms of early dumping include nausea, vomiting, bloating, cramping, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue. [...] "Late" [...] dumping happens one to three hours after eating. Symptoms of late dumping include weakness, sweating, and dizziness. Many people have both types. The syndrome is most often associated with gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y) surgery.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{more open}} forms of weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic {{diversion}} (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), gastric banding {{does not require}} cutting or removing {{any part of the}} digestive system. It is removable, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure to remove the band, after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded size so {{it is not unusual for}} a person to gain weight after having a band removed. However, it is not entirely reversible as adhesions and tissue scarring are inevitable. Unlike those who have procedures such as RNY, DS, or BPD, it is unusual for gastric band patients to experience any nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption of micro-nutrients. Calcium supplements and Vitamin B12 injections are not routinely required following gastric banding (as is often the case with RNY, for example). Gastric <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> issues also do not occur since intestines are not removed or re-routed.|$|E
50|$|Complications from {{weight loss}} surgery are frequent. A study of {{insurance}} claims of 2522 {{who had undergone}} bariatric surgery showed 21.9% complications during the initial hospital stay {{and a total of}} 40% risk of complications in the subsequent six months. This was more common in those over 40 and led to an increased health care expenditure. Common problems were gastric <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> in about 20% (bloating and diarrhea after eating, necessitating small meals or medication), leaks at the surgical site (12%), incisional hernia (7%), infections (6%) and pneumonia (4%) where the mortality was 0.2%. As the rate of complications appears to be reduced when the procedure is performed by an experienced surgeon, guidelines recommend that surgery be performed in dedicated or experienced units. It has been observed that the rate of leaks was greater in low volume centres whereas high volume centres showed a lesser leak rate. Leak rates have now globally decreased to a mean of 1-5%.|$|E
50|$|In severe {{duodenal}} ulcers it may {{be necessary}} to remove the lower portion of the stomach called the pylorus and the upper portion of the small intestine called the duodenum. If there is a sufficient portion of the upper duodenum remaining a Billroth I procedure is performed, where the remaining portion of the stomach is reattached to the duodenum before the bile duct and the duct of the pancreas. If the stomach cannot be reattached to the duodenum a Billroth II is performed, where the remaining portion of the duodenum is sealed off, a hole is cut into the next section of the small intestine called the jejunum and the stomach is reattached at this hole. As the pylorus is used to grind food and slowly release the food into the small intestine, removal of the pylorus can cause food to move into the small intestine faster than normal, leading to gastric <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The use of vagotomy {{to treat}} obesity {{is now being}} studied. The vagus nerve {{provides}} efferent nervous signals out from the hunger and satiety centers of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. The circuit begins with {{an area of the}} hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively. Animals with lesioned VMH will gain weight {{even in the face of}} severe restrictions imposed on their food intake, because they no longer provide the signaling needed to turn off energy storage and facilitate energy burning. In humans, the VMH is sometimes injured by ongoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or surgery or radiation to treat posterior cranial fossa tumors. With the VMH disabled and no longer responding to peripheral energy balance signals, [...] "efferent sympathetic activity drops, resulting in malaise and reduced energy expenditure, and vagal activity increases, resulting in increased insulin secretion and adipogenesis." [...] "VMH dysfunction promotes excessive caloric intake and decreased caloric expenditure, leading to continuous and unrelenting weight gain. Attempts at caloric restriction or pharmacotherapy with adrenergic or serotonergic agents have previously met with little or only brief success in treating this syndrome." [...] The vagus nerve is thought to be one key mediator of these effects, as lesions lead to chronic elevations in insulin secretion, promoting energy storage in adipocytes. Vagotomy may have an impact upon ghrelin. In an open-label, prospective study of 30 obese patients (26 women), response has been variable; the intervention has generally been safe, although adverse events have included gastric <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> (n=3), wound infection (n=2), other (n=5), and diarrhea (n=6).|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Dumping</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{a common}} {{complication}} of esophageal, gastric or bariatric surgery, includes {{early and late}} dumping symptoms. Early dumping occurs within 1 h after eating, when rapid emptying of food into the small intestine triggers rapid fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen and release of gastrointestinal hormones, resulting in gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms. Late dumping occurs 1 - 3 h after carbohydrate ingestion, caused by an incretin-driven hyperinsulinemic response resulting in hypoglycemia.

Its prevalence in partial gastrectomy can reach up to 50 %, thus it can be a significant complication arising from some types of bariatric surgeries. Objective: Critical analysis on <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome,</b> its pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Methods: A literature review was performed using the key words: 'dumping syndrome', 'bariatric surgery' and 'rapid dumping syndrome'. Inclusion criteria were: books, original works, case reports and meta-analyzes, and the exclusion criterion was literature review. Concerning the publication time, articles were screened between 1960 and May 2015. Results: The <b>dumping</b> <b>syndrome</b> is complication arising from obesity surgeries, but also can be a result of vagus nerve damage. Diagnosis is done primarily through the use of questionnaires based on scores.
