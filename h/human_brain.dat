5|$|This article {{compares the}} {{properties}} of brains across {{the entire range of}} animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> insofar as it shares {{the properties of}} other brains. The ways in which the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> differs from other brains are covered in the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> article.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{alternative}} methods include {{positron emission tomography}} (PET), which allows scanning of the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> in vivo, and comparative epidemiological studies of disease risk factors among human populations.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to}} the brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> and other primates.|$|E

5|$|As a primate brain, the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> has a {{much larger}} {{cerebral}} cortex, in proportion to body size, than most mammals, and a highly developed visual system.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the <b>Human</b> <b>Brain</b> Project is {{trying to build a}} realistic, detailed computational model of the entire <b>human</b> <b>brain.</b> The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists {{on both sides of the}} argument.|$|E

5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> is {{primarily}} composed of neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels. Types of neuron include interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons), and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells {{are the largest}} cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system. The adult <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these neurons, 16 billion (19%) {{are located in the}} cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} not fully understood, and {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> works. The boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience, neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.|$|E

5|$|The {{human body}} {{contains}} about 12mg of manganese, {{mostly in the}} bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the <b>human</b> <b>brain,</b> the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatics is a {{field of}} study that {{includes}} the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, {{that can be used}} in studies of the <b>human</b> <b>brain,</b> particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression. Bioinformatics and studies in genomics, and functional genomics, generated the need for DNA annotation, a transcriptome technology, identifying genes, and their and location and function. GeneCards is a major database.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual {{mass of the}} <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> {{is about}} 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E

5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, in the <b>human</b> <b>brain,</b> glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Hydroxyproline, {{a major component}} of the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E
5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> is {{almost twice as}} large as that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E

5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> {{has many}} {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> is {{provided}} with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals additional senses are present, such as the infrared heat-sense of snakes, the magnetic field sense of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>human</b> <b>brain</b> {{represents}} only 2% {{of the body}} weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
