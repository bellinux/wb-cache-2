5000|$|An [...] "effects chain" [...] or [...] "signal chain" [...] {{is formed}} by {{connecting}} {{two or more}} stompboxes. Effect chains are typically created between the guitar and the amp or between the preamplifier ("preamp") and the power amp. When a pedal is off or inactive, the <b>electric</b> <b>audio</b> <b>signal</b> coming into the pedal diverts onto a bypass, an unaltered [...] "dry" [...] signal that continues on to other effects down the chain. In this way, a musician can combine effects within a chain {{in a variety of}} ways without having to reconnect boxes during a performance. A [...] "controller" [...] or [...] "effects management system" [...] lets the musician create multiple effect chains, so they can select one or several chains by tapping a single switch. The switches are usually organized in a row or a simple grid.To preserve the clarity of the tone, it is most common to put compression, wah and overdrive pedals at the start of the chain; modulation (chorus, flanger, phase shifter) in the middle; and time-based units (delay/echo, reverb) at the end. When using many effects, unwanted noise and hum can be introduced into the sound. Some performers use a noise gate pedal at the end of a chain to reduce unwanted noise and hum introduced by overdrive units or vintage gear.|$|E
