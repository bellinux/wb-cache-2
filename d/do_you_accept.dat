500|$|Once the {{election}} concludes, the Cardinal Dean summons the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations into the hall. The Cardinal Dean then asks the pope-elect if he assents to {{the election}}, saying in Latin: [...] "Acceptasne electionem de te canonice factam in Summum Pontificem? (<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?)" [...] There is no {{requirement that the}} pope-elect do so and he is free to respond [...] "Non accepto" [...] (I do not accept).|$|E
6000|$|Having {{faith in}} your patriotism and ability, the President has been pleased to appoint you a brigadier-general of volunteers. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|VENABLES [liking him for {{the first}} time]. Good. But you are wrong. There are no conditions, and we want you to make your speech. Now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept?</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{year before}} the Los Largartos issue you went to Videla's house and had lunch with him. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> that invitation? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you love}} him?" [...] For {{a moment or}} two Bessy {{remained}} silent, striving to arrange her words so that they should contain no falsehood, and yet betray no truth. [...] "Ah, I see you do," [...] continued Miss Holmes. [...] "But of course <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Why else <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> would <b>accept</b> your cousin's offer. What right {{have you}} to refuse him? I {{believe it is}} all because of that young man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, friend Adrian, and I {{have not}} told {{you all the}} truth. For instance--but, no, {{this is not the}} time to speak. The {{question}} is, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> my terms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{argue the}} point with you, Heigham; {{such as they}} are, they are my terms, founded on what I {{consider}} I owe to my daughter. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{take that}} as a compliment," [...] she said quietly, [...] "for it shows at least that I am never sulky. Well, Don Harry, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> me as a fellow watcher?" ...|$|E
50|$|Third, {{even if you}} are {{not left}} in doubt by the {{evidence}} of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, {{on the basis of the}} evidence which <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>accept,</b> <b>you</b> are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he can! Hearken now to this blasphemer, and <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> Seti, <b>accept</b> her {{challenge}} as hereditary high-priest {{of the god}} Amon? Let her life pay forfeit for her sacrilege." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "One question, Geoffrey, before I {{say what}} I want to say. Lady Lundie has invited {{you to stay}} at Windygates. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> her invitation? or do {{you go back to}} your brother's in the evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The duke {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "I will put you to the proof," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Dressed as the king, you shall, yourself, attend mass in his {{carriage}} at midnight. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> the test?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{can read}} it that will do," [...] Robespierre said. [...] "There are English papers sent over, and I should like to hear for myself what this perfidious people say of us, and there are few here who can {{translate}} the language. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> my proposal?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The High Constable then {{addressed}} the widow, who, in her deep weeds, and having her children still beside her, occupied a chair within the lists: [...] "Woman, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> willingly <b>accept</b> of this man, Henry the Smith, {{to do battle}} as your champion in this cause?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} bandy accusations with me, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> me when I {{told you that}} I could not love you? But, indeed, indeed, I would not {{say a word to}} displease you, if you would only spare me. We were both wrong; but the wrong must now be put right. You would not wish to take me for your wife when I tell you that my heart is full of affection for another man. Then, when I yielded, I was {{struggling}} to cure that as a great evil. Now I welcome it as the sweetest blessing of my life. If I were your sister, what would you have me do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord Marquis, {{you have}} brought very grave {{charges against the}} lady who claims to be your wife, and the Englishman whose affianced bride you admit you {{snatched}} away by fraud and force. This gentleman, {{on his own behalf}} and on behalf of these ladies, has challenged you to a combat to the death in a fashion that none can mistake. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> his challenge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, friend, {{things are}} thus. You ask us, at great danger to ourselves, to kill {{one of the}} gods of your country, the highest of them, {{in order to save}} your life. Well, in payment we ask you to make a present of the {{remaining}} gods of your country, and to see us and them safe across the lake. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> or refuse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> it, if it isn't you?" [...] I demanded. [...] "One doesn't refuse Czesky's canvases," [...] she replied. [...] "And what {{difference}} does it make? It amused him, and he was fairly subtle about it. Only those who are looking for romance, like you, are able to guess what he meant, and they would think they saw it anyway, even if he had painted me--extinct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does your}} silence mean?" [...] she said. [...] "Do {{you ask me}} to help <b>you,</b> and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> refuse to <b>accept</b> the first {{suggestion}} I offer?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{exercise}} {{of your right}} to self-determination, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> approve and <b>accept</b> the proposed new Constitution for Gibraltar? The possible answers were [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "No".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{remember}} when you told me coming to her was an experiment, and you {{thought it might be}} better for the old friendship if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>accept</b> the situation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like? Oh! {{like the}} lady who sits yonder. Yes, quite the same, {{or so it seemed}} to us. But who knows? We have seen no other white women, and we were not very near. Let the lady come and stand {{side by side with the}} Spirit, so that we can examine them both, and we shall be able to answer better. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> the offer of the Molimo?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is my intention," [...] said Chauvelin very quietly, [...] "but remember, if {{you have}} deceived me, I shall tell off two of my most stalwart {{soldiers}} to give you such a beating, that your breath will perhaps leave your ugly body for ever. But if we find my friend the tall Englishman, {{either on the road}} or at the Pere Blanchard's hut, there will be ten more gold pieces for you. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> the bargain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "King and nobles, be not mistaken. These knights are my prisoners, as you are, {{and none}} have shown {{themselves}} braver to-day, or done me and mine more damage. Indeed, {{had it not}} been for my guards, within the hour I should have fallen beneath the sword of Sir Godwin. But as they know Arabic, I have asked them to render my words into your tongue. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> them as interpreters? If not, others must be found." ...|$|E
6000|$|At her reply Somerset {{stretched}} out his hand for the swan's-down, and put it carefully in his pocket-book; whereupon Paula, moulding her cherry-red lower lip beneath her upper one in arch self-consciousness at his act, turned away to the window, and after a pause said softly as she looked out, 'Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>accept</b> our invitation to dinner?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Your {{anonymous}} {{call rejection}} service is now on. Callers who block their number {{will get a}} recording saying <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept</b> blocked calls." ...|$|R
5000|$|Related to {{the issue}} of what must be {{included}} or not, the debate also looks at conversion using language which refers to concepts on [...] "accepting Christ as ...." [...] This is how the term Lordship became associated with the debate, by discussions of various ways to accept Christ; sometimes [...] "accepting Christ as Savior" [...] or [...] "accepting Christ as Lord" [...] were distinguished, and a debate ensued. This is reflected in various modern translations, taking a cue from Colossians 2:6 in the Good News Bible, which has [...] "accept" [...] for {{what is to be done}} about Christ. In the New International Version of the same verse, the word [...] "receive" [...] is used. Thus, a common question was [...] "do (or <b>did)</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> (or receive) Christ as Lord?" [...] The controversy became defined by the question of whether or not this part is included.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why {{on earth}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept,</b> Mallett? I took good care not to get into it. What can a man want better than this? A well-cooked dinner, eaten with a chum, and then a quiet rubber; and perhaps once a {{fortnight}} or so I go out to a dinner party, which I like well enough as a change. I always get plenty of shooting in winter, and am generally away for three months, but I am always heartily glad to get back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mr Baldwin, we won't beat {{any longer}} about the bush. We have not {{succeeded in getting}} a cook, being in the {{meantime}} obliged to content ourselves with a temporary loan of the green-grocer's wife, and of Miss Pritty's small domestic; therefore I want to engage your wife, who is at present, I believe, open to an engagement. We are also unprovided with a man to tend our garden, look after our pony, and help me in the missionary work, in which I hope immediately {{to be engaged in}} this town. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept</b> that situation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because of {{that fight}} and that leap," [...] Ayesha went on, [...] "as for other deeds {{that you have}} done and will do, my Spirit tells me that your name will live in story for many generations. Yet of what use is fame to the dead? Therefore I make you an offer. Bide here with me and you shall rule these Amahagger, and with them the remnant of the People of Rezu. Your cattle shall be countless and your wives the fairest in the land, and your {{children}} many, for I will lift a certain curse from off you so that no more shall you be childless. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>accept,</b> O Holder of the Axe?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept</b> this, {{it will be}} regretted {{not having}} made the {{installation}} of the formal dialog in the time established by the Peace Talks Law".|$|R
5000|$|Narendra did {{not accept}} or worship Kali, the goddess Ramakrishna used to worship. Ramakrishna asked him— [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come here, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept</b> Kali, my Mother?" [...] Narendra replied [...] "Simply because I come to see you. I come to you because I love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never said}} it <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> never <b>accepted.</b> <b>You</b> thought there was {{something}} outside, to justify you: God, or a creed, or a prescription. But remember, your soul inside you is your only Godhead. It develops your actions within you as a tree develops its own new cells. And the cells push on into buds and boughs and flowers. And these are your passion and your acts and your thoughts and expressions, your developing consciousness. You don't know beforehand, and you can't. You can only stick to your own soul through thick and thin.|$|R
