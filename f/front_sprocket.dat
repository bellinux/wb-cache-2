25|$|The army's first {{lineage of}} tanks had {{evolved from the}} M1 Combat Car and progressed to the M2 Light Tank, M2 Medium Tank, M3 Lee, and finally the M4 Sherman; these tanks all shared the common traits of using {{rear-mounted}} Continental air-cooled radial aircraft engines and a <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> drive. The rear engine-front sprocket drive layout required a driveshaft to pass underneath the turret, which increased the overall height of the tank, a characteristic shared with German tanks of World War II that also used this layout. In addition, the large diameter of the radial engines in the M4 line of tanks added further to the hull height. These mechanical features accounted for the high silhouette and large side sponsons that were characteristic of the M4 lineage.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E
500|$|In April 1941, {{production}} of the Panzer IV Ausf.F started. It featured [...] single-plate armor on the turret and hull, {{as opposed to the}} appliqué armor added to the Ausf.E, and a further increase in side armor to [...] The main engine exhaust muffler was shortened and a compact auxiliary generator muffler was mounted to its left. The weight of the vehicle was now , which required a corresponding modification of track width from [...] to reduce ground pressure. The wider tracks also facilitated the fitting of track shoe [...] "ice sprags", and the rear idler wheel and <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> were modified. The designation Ausf.F was changed in the meantime to Ausf.F1, after the distinct new model, the Ausf.F2, appeared. A total of 471 Ausf.F (later temporarily called F1) tanks were produced from April 1941 to March 1942.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{drove the}} <b>front</b> <b>sprockets</b> through a {{drivetrain}} connecting to a transmission {{in the front}} portion of the lower hull; the <b>front</b> <b>sprockets</b> had to be mounted relatively low as a result. The Krupp-designed 11-tonne turret had a hydraulic motor whose pump was powered by mechanical drive from the engine. A full rotation took about a minute.|$|R
5000|$|Now, {{consider}} {{the small and}} large <b>front</b> <b>sprockets</b> which have 28 and 52 teeth respectively, and {{consider the}} small and large rear sprockets which have 16 and 32 teeth each. Using these numbers we can compute the following speed ratios between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>sprockets</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Many Suzuki {{motorcycles}} {{have the}} engine size cast into {{side of the}} cylinder block; 1200 Bandits (1,157 cc) do not have this but, apparently, some early production 1995 models do have 1,156 cc cast into the block. The 1200 Bandits have 15 tooth <b>front</b> <b>sprockets</b> and 45 tooth rear sprockets connected by 530V, 110 link rear chains.|$|R
500|$|The next version, the Ausf.H, began {{production}} in June 1943 {{and received the}} designation Sd.Kfz.161/2. The integrity of the glacis armor was improved by manufacturing it as a single [...] plate. A reinforced final drive with higher gear ratios was introduced. To prevent adhesion of magnetic anti-tank mines, which the Germans feared would be used in large numbers by the Allies, Zimmerit paste was added to all the vertical surfaces of the tank's armor. The turret roof was reinforced from [...] to [...] and [...] segments. The vehicle's side and turret were further protected {{by the addition of}} [...] hull skirts and [...] turret skirts. This resulted in the elimination of the vision ports located on the hull side, as the skirts obstructed their view. During the Ausf.H's production run, its rubber-tired return rollers were replaced with cast steel, a lighter cast <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> and rear idler wheel gradually replaced the previous components, the hull was fitted with triangular supports for the easily damaged side skirts, the Nebelwurfgeraet was discontinued, and a mount in the turret roof, designed for the Nahverteidigungswaffe, was plugged by a circular armored plate due to initial production shortages of this weapon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> of the NSR50 is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} more common Honda XR50 dirt bike.|$|E
5000|$|Race - racing style BMX bikes {{feature a}} larger <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> than other BMX bikes {{in order to}} create a high gear ratio, {{enabling}} the rider to pedal at high speeds. Racing BMX bikes are required to have brakes.|$|E
50|$|The Type 95 So-Ki was {{an armored}} {{railroad}} {{car of the}} Imperial Japanese Army used for patrolling and guarding railway lines in both Manchuria and Burma. The chassis {{was based on the}} Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank. The Type 95 So-Ki had light armor and no weapons armament. It had a simple suspension system with bogie wheels suspended on bell cranks {{on each side of the}} chassis. The tracks were driven through the <b>front</b> <b>sprockets.</b> There were three small return wheels.|$|R

50|$|The Whike {{features}} a three piece aluminium mast {{that can be}} stowed away on board when not needed. It is also equipped with 18 gears and the <b>front</b> <b>sprockets</b> are custom made for the Whike. To maintain safe and responsive stopping the trike is fitted with disk brakes on all wheels. The cycle also has a handbrake function to prevent it sailing away while without rider. The frame is available in black or white chromium molybdenum alloy steel, other colours are possible for an additional cost. The Whike weighs 23 kg including the sail and can carry a maximum weight of 115 kg including luggage. The sail also {{has the advantage of}} aiding visibility of the cycle on the roads.|$|R
50|$|The naked GSF600 N Bandit was {{released}} in February. It {{was based on the}} styling of the pre-existing GSF400 Bandit, with a retuned engine from the GSX600. The 600 Bandits came with a 15 tooth <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> and 48 tooth rear sprocket connected by a 530V 110 link chain.|$|E
50|$|Inter 4 - Nexus Inter 4 hubs {{had four}} speeds, {{but the same}} 186% range as the Inter 3. It only geared up, so a {{relatively}} large rear sprocket was necessary to give a reasonable development when combined with a normal <b>front</b> <b>sprocket.</b> It has been discontinued and spare parts have become hard to source.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} is 3-speed constant mesh, with a 3-up shift pattern, {{it uses a}} wet multi-plate centrifugal clutch, with the following gear ratios: 1st 3.272, 2nd 1.823, and 3rd 1.190. It has a primary reduction ratio of: 4.058, and a secondary reduction ratio of 2.6 via the chain drive (15 tooth <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> and 39 tooth rear sprocket).1 ...|$|E
50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium. The camshafts were held in the {{cylinder head}} with bearing caps and driven by a chain off the <b>front</b> crankshaft <b>sprocket.</b> Motion from the camshafts was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.|$|R
50|$|Power {{was around}} 16 bhp, {{which gave the}} CM200T {{a top speed of}} around 71 mph, {{although}} a popular modification was to change the <b>front</b> gearbox <b>sprocket</b> from 15 to 16 teeth which increased top speed to around 75 mph given good conditions, and could comfortably cruise at 60 mph.|$|R
50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the Type 95 tank was its simple suspension system. Two bogie wheels were suspended on a single bell crank with two bell cranks per side. The tracks were driven through the <b>front</b> <b>sprockets.</b> There were two return wheels. The suspension had troubles early on, with a tendency to pitch so badly on rough ground that the crew sometimes {{found it impossible to}} drive at any speed, and so it was modified with a brace to connect the pairs of bogies. Despite this, the tank continued to give its users a rough ride across any uneven ground. It was provided with an interior layer of asbestos padding separated from the hull with an air gap, to isolate the crew from the sun-heated armor plates, and to protect the crew from injury when the tank moved across rough terrain.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of micro drive {{is that it}} means a smaller <b>front</b> <b>sprocket,</b> or chainring, can be used without affecting the gear ratio, providing better ground clearance. For example, a bike using a 32t chainring with a 16t rear sprocket can change to a 18t chainring and a 9t sprocket, keeping the 2:1 ratio. Another advantage is the reduction in weight with the reduction in size of all the parts.|$|E
5000|$|Tilman {{brothers}} building. Before {{the communist}} period, it was located on [...] street, No. 54, {{at the intersection}} of [...] and [...] Nowadays it is {{at the intersection of}} [...] and , near [...] (United Nations Plaza), then called [...] (Senate Plaza). The apartment house was probably built between 1923 and 1925. The construction has lost a piece of his upper <b>front</b> <b>sprocket,</b> thereby losing its poise and beauty. Presumably, the earthquake of 1940 or 1977 brought down the superstructure or severely damaged it.|$|E
50|$|The safety bicycle {{was a big}} {{improvement}} on the previous penny-farthing design which it replaced. The chain drive, coupling a large <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> (the chainring) to a small rear sprocket (the sprocket) to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, allowed for much smaller wheels, and replaced {{the need for the}} large, directly pedaled front wheel of the penny-farthing. The smaller wheel gave a harsher ride; once pneumatic tires were developed and replaced the previously used solid ones, this disadvantage was no longer an issue.|$|E
5000|$|Track cogs are {{generally}} {{available in a}} range of sizes from 12T to 23T (number of teeth) and two different widths - 3/32" [...] and 1/8" [...] (thickness of teeth). The 3/32" [...] size is made to accommodate narrower 3/32" [...] chains, but is also compatible with 1/8" [...] and wider bmx/single speed chains. The thicker 1/8" [...] cogs are ONLY compatible with 1/8" [...] or wider single speed chains. There may be larger (number of teeth) sizes available as well, either custom manufactured or adapted from chainwheels or <b>front</b> <b>sprockets</b> using a number of methods or devices. There are some heavy duty 3/16" [...] chains designed for BMX use which are compatible with most cogs. However, because these chains usually have taller thicker side plates, they may not work properly with some cogs smaller than 11T or freewheels smaller than 16T.|$|R
50|$|The SOHC (LK0/L24) {{cylinder}} head had 8 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminum. The camshaft was located {{in the center of}} the {{cylinder head}} and driven by a chain off the <b>front</b> crankshaft <b>sprocket.</b> Motion from the camshaft was transmitted to the eight valves by the hydraulic lifters and rocker arms.|$|R
5000|$|Chassis is same as M110 203 mm {{self-propelled}} howitzer {{with five}} large road wheels on each side, a drive <b>sprocket</b> <b>front</b> wheel {{and has no}} track-return rollers.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|E
50|$|The FZS600 {{was first}} {{unveiled}} at the Paris Auto Show in 1997, and shares parts from other Yamaha models, notably the engine from the YZF600R Thundercat, detuned {{to give more}} mid-range power, and the front discs and blue-dot calipers from the YZF-R1. Revisions for the 2002 model saw a newer more modern styled fairing similar to the FZS1000 Fazer. This used a newer and better headlight design, an often mentioned criticism of the launch bike. The Fazer is a well reviewed motorcycle that is generally considered reliable although many owners have reported problems caused by a weak <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> nut. Yamaha has since issued a redesigned thicker nut (12 mm vs 9 mm) to counteract the issue.|$|E

5000|$|The M56 was a fully {{tracked vehicle}} with rubber-tired run-flat road wheels and <b>front</b> drive <b>sprocket</b> wheels. It was {{powered by a}} Continental A01-403-5 {{gasoline}} engine developing [...] at 3,000 rpm, allowing a maximum road speed of 28 mph and a maximum range of 140 mi. Twenty-nine rounds of main gun ammunition were carried, and only the blast shield was armored.|$|R
50|$|It has a boxy, open {{watertight}} hull, {{with six}} road wheels per side, <b>front</b> drive <b>sprocket,</b> rear idler sprocket, and no return rollers. Like the BAV 485, {{and unlike the}} DUKW, it has a rear loading ramp. The crew is seated at the front, leaving {{the rear of the}} vehicle open for a vehicle, which can be driven (or backed) in, rather than lifted over the side. To aid in facilitating this, the engine is under the floor.|$|R
50|$|The tractor's most {{distinctive}} feature was its running gear. Four full height roadwheels acted as roadwheels, rear drive <b>sprocket,</b> <b>front</b> idler and track return rollers. This {{was the same}} layout as the Tetrarch light tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs had developed in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{flatland}} bicycle {{is similar}} to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited {{to the needs of}} flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front brake cable, and a rear brake cable detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> (18-28 teeth).|$|E
5000|$|In April 1941, {{production}} of the Panzer IV Ausf. F started. It featured 50 mm single-plate armor on the turret and hull, {{as opposed to the}} appliqué armor added to the Ausf. E, and a further increase in side armor to 30 mm. The main engine exhaust muffler was shortened and a compact auxiliary generator muffler was mounted to its left. The weight of the vehicle was now 22.3 t, which required a corresponding modification of track width from 380 to 400 mm to reduce ground pressure. The wider tracks also facilitated the fitting of track shoe [...] "ice sprags", and the rear idler wheel and <b>front</b> <b>sprocket</b> were modified. The designation Ausf. F was changed in the meantime to Ausf. F1, after the distinct new model, the Ausf. F2, appeared. A total of 471 Ausf. F (later temporarily called F1) tanks were produced from April 1941 to March 1942.|$|E

50|$|Uncommon for tanks at the time, Porsche {{selected}} a Gasoline-electric drive train. The <b>front</b> drive <b>sprockets</b> for the tracks were driven by two electric motors mounted {{forward in the}} hull. Two, air-cooled, V-10 gasoline engines, mounted toward {{the rear of the}} vehicle, were each connected to a generator to produce electricity. The generated electricity was then used to power the motors. Each engine produced 210 PS at 2500 RPM; a total of 420 PS was therefore available to drive the generators.|$|R
50|$|Bikes may be {{customized}} freely {{provided the}} above conditions are met. For example, many participants place the handlebars {{in the upper}} position for better control, change the <b>front</b> and/or rear <b>sprockets</b> to improve acceleration, change the exhaust system, and eliminate fairings to reduce weight.|$|R
50|$|The WZ-111 {{featured}} a 750 hp supercharged diesel engine and torsion bar suspension system. The idler wheels were in <b>front</b> with drive <b>sprockets</b> in the rear. Many of the suspension components {{were the same}} type used in Soviet heavy tank designs such as the IS-2.|$|R
