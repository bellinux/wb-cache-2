Although there is not a landfill crisis at this point in time, it is commonly believed that measures should to be taken in order to lower the negative impacts of landfills, for many <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> are produced and spread because of this enclosure of trash. Most recycled paper is priced higher than freshly made paper, and this tends to plays a deciding factor for the consumer. Because most of the recycled pulp is purchased in an open market, virgin paper is produced cheaper with the pulp that was made by the specific paper mill. Virgin paper contains no recycled content and is made directly from the pulp of trees or cotton. Materials recovered after the initial paper manufacturing process are considered recycled paper. Because that original standard was so vague, some “recycled papers” contained only mill scraps that would have been included in virgin paper anyway. [...] Standards have recently been set to prevent companies from making it seem like they were selling recycled paper. The collection and recycling industries have fixated on the scraps of paper that is thrown away by customers daily in order to increase the amount of recycled paper. [...] Different paper mills are structured for different types of paper, and most “recovered office paper can be sent to a deinking mill”. A deinking mill serves as a step in the recycling paper process. This type of mill detaches the ink from the paper fibers, along with any other excess materials which are also removed from the remaining paper. In the deinking mill, after all of the unwanted coatings of paper are stripped, the refurbished paper is sent to the paper machine. The old scraps are now constructed into new paper at the paper machine. Many papers mills have recycled business papers by transforming the old business papers into beneficial letters and envelopes. The production process for recycled paper is more costly than the well-developed paper mills that create paper with the use of trees. This process in making recycled paper is also much more time-consuming. However, recycling paper has a multitude of benefits from an environmental perspective. [...] “For all the state-of-the-art technology now incorporated into modern paper mills, the industry's underlying structure is still based upon a worldview that was transformative in the 19th-century but is out-of-date as the 21st century approaches”.|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} {{process for}} hazardous element extraction from {{municipal solid waste}} incinerator fly ash was developed. The key trait of the process was to extract most of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> out of the ash but leave Ca and Si inside the residue. In the extraction process, the ash was firstly pre-washed with water, then subjected to subcritical water (SC water) treatment and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) extraction. SEM images indicated that SC water {{is strong enough to}} destroy the ash particles, thus greatly improving <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> extraction efficiency in the subsequent NTA extraction process. The extraction percentages for Cr, As, Se, Cd and Ph under SC water+NTA treatment were around 2 - 6 times higher than those treated by NTA at room conditions. The preferable SC treatment temperature was 573 K and the treatment time was 3 h. The optimum NTA concentration, vibration time and liquid/solid ratio were 0. 8 M, 5 h and 10 : 1 (ml/g), respectively. Furthermore, it was found that introduction of a suitable amount of sulfuric acid into the extraction solution could extract more than 90 % of most of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> out of the ash.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the potential capability of removing volatile <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> from coal before its further utilization by decoupled conversion of coal. The so called decoupled conversion isolates the combustion/gasification into two consecutive stages: pyrolysis followed by char combustion/gasification. Previous studies indicated that pyrolysis could transfer a part of the volatile <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> of coal into gas form. The concentrated pollutants in the pyrolysis gas could be removed easier than those diluted ones in the gas product of direct combustion/gasification. However, the experiments were carried out in very small reactors, mostly in fixed beds, with batch feeding. The operating conditions, especially the reaction atmosphere and residence time, were quite different from the industry production process. Therefore, a 50 kg/h pilot scale facility combining a fluidized bed coal pyrolyzer and a fluidized bed char gasifier has been installed. A bituminous coal, a lignite or the binary mixture were continuously pyrolyzed together with circulating silica sands at different temperatures in the fluidized bed pyrolyzer and then gasified in the fluidized bed char gasifier. The volatilities of selected five hazardous volatile elements (mercury, arsenic, selenium, chlorine and sulfur) have been determined by analyzing each element concentration in the pyrolysis products. Pyrolysis in the large scaled fluidized bed has been proved to be a potential efficient method to remove volatile <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> from coal before gasification. 600 degrees C is an optimal temperature for removing volatile <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> from the two selected coals by flash pyrolysis, which also has been verified as a suitable temperature to get a satisfied tar yield.

40|$|Hydrothermally altered rock {{excavated}} in {{a tunnel}} project produces acidic leachate containing <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> that include arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). To mitigate this problem, this paper evaluated a combined neutralization-adsorption system that used readily available and cheap reagents like calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and partly-weathered volcanic ash. Batch neutralization experiments showed that CaCO 3 {{was effective in}} raising the pH of the leachate around neutral while the batch adsorption experiments illustrated that the volcanic ash sample collected near the tunnel project area was highly capable of adsorbing arsenate (As[V]), Pb, Cu and Zn. Under column conditions, the amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> released from the rock increased by several folds and their breakthrough curves had flushing-out trends. The mechanisms of As and heavy metals release probably include the dissolution of soluble phases and pyrite oxidation. Addition of CaCO 3 in the column experiments based on estimates from the batch results underestimated the amount of neutralizer needed to adjust the effluent pH to around 8, resulting only in slight increase of the pH. Nevertheless, the presence of CaCO 3 drastically reduced the amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> released from the altered rock especially during {{the initial stages of}} the column experiments. Combining neutralization and adsorption effectively reduced the amount of As and heavy metals in the effluent throughout the duration of the column experiments, which is attributed to the slight neutralizing effect of volcanic ash that raised the pH around circumneutral as well as its rich Al and Fe oxyhydroxide/oxide contents. The combined system immobilized the <b>hazardous</b> <b>elements</b> through a combination of co-precipitation and adsorption reactions and showed potential as an alternative method for the disposal of altered rocks producing acidic leachate...|$|E

In an effort to evaluate the potential risks to potable water quality, reactive transport simulations were conducted to evaluate to what extent and mechanisms through which lead and arsenic might be mobilized by intrusion of CO{sub 2 }. An earlier geochemical evaluation of more than 38, 000 groundwater quality analyses from aquifers throughout the United States and an associated literature review provided the basis for setting up a reactive transport model and examining its sensitivity to model variation. The evaluation included identification of potential mineral hosts containing <b>hazardous</b> trace <b>elements,</b> characterization of the modal bulk mineralogy for an arenaceous aquifer, and augmentation of the required thermodynamic data. The reactive transport simulations suggest that CO{sub 2 } ingress into a shallow aquifer can mobilize significant lead and arsenic, contaminating the groundwater near the location of intrusion and further downstream.

Comparisons {{made to the}} Clarke values show that Mukah coal is depleted in Ag, Ba, Be, Cd, Co. Mn, Ni, Se, U, and V. On the other hand, it is enriched in As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb, Th, and Zn. Among the trace elements studied, V and Ba are associated predominantly with the clay minerals. Manganese, Cr, Cu, Th, and Ni are mostly bound within the aluminosilicate, sulphide and/or carbonate minerals in varying proportions, though a portion of these elements are also organically bound. Arsenic, Pb and Sb are mostly organically bound, though some of these elements are also associated with the sulphide minerals. Zinc is associated with both the organic and inorganic contents of the coal. Among the potentially <b>hazardous</b> trace <b>elements,</b> Be, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, Se, and U may be of little or no health and environmental concerns, whereas As, Cr, Pb, Sb and Th require further examination for their potential health and environmental concerns.

Precipitation of trivalent arsenic sulphide in sulphate-reducing conditions at low pH {{has been studied}} {{with the aim of}} removing this <b>hazardous</b> <b>element</b> in a waste product with high As content. To achieve this, a 400 mL fixed-film column bioreactor was fed continuously with a synthetic solution containing 100 mg. L- 1 As(V), glycerol and/or hydrogen, at pH values between 2. 7 and 5. The highest global As removal rate obtained during these experiments was close to 2. 5 mg. L- 1. h- 1. A switch from glycerol to hydrogen when the biofilm was mature induced an abrupt increase in the sulphate-reducing activity, resulting in a dramatic mobilisation of arsenic due to the formation of soluble thioarsenic complexes. A new analytical method, based on ionic chromatography, was used to evaluate the proportion of As present as thioarsenic complexes in the bioreactor. Profiles of pH, total As and sulphate concentrations suggest that As removal efficiency was linked to solubility of orpiment (As 2 S 3) depending on pH conditions. Molecular fingerprints revealed fairly homogeneous bacterial colonisation throughout the reactor. The bacterial community was diverse and included fermenting bacteria and Desulfosporosinus-like sulphate-reducing bacteria. arrA genes, involved in dissimilatory reduction of As(V), were found and the retrieved sequences suggested that As(V) was reduced by a Desulfosporosinus-like organism.
