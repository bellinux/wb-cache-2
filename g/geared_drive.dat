25|$|One of the {{perceived}} main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully <b>geared</b> <b>drive</b> train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.|$|E
500|$|The naval constructors {{examined}} diesel <b>geared</b> <b>drive,</b> steam drive, and {{turbo-electric drive}} engines; the last system was the preferred choice, {{as it had}} been extremely successful in the two American s and the French passenger ship [...] The design staff were also required to provide sufficient range to the new battleships; they would have to make long voyages from German ports to reach the Atlantic, and Germany had no overseas bases where the ships could refuel. Due to the numerical inferiority of the German fleet and the assumption that naval battles would take place at relatively close range in the North Sea, the design placed great emphasis on stability and armour protection. Very thick vertical belt armour was adopted, along with heavy upper-citadel armour plating and extensive splinter protection in the bow and stern of the ships.|$|E

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> These contributions would improve engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Strength {{research}} is always {{one of the}} study focuses of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> However, a strength calculation solution, in which bending stresses, contact stresses, and bulk temperatures are included, combined with gear design standards for face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> is still not constructed due to complex face gear teeth. Thus, in this study, an equivalent face gear tooth is proposed by assessment of geometric characteristics of face gear teeth and tooth contact analysis, and a strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> {{which is based on}} ISO 6336 standard associated with the proposed equivalent face gear teeth, is constructed. The fidelity of the proposed strength calculation solution of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is verified by comparing its results with the benchmark of results by finite element methods. Furthermore, the impact of geometric parameters on the strength of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is investigated, and some design suggestions are extracted.

50|$|Lowe also propagates {{the view}} that this {{locomotive}} dates from 1822 and the Lyons he describes is a later locomotive, presumably 1850s, with a vertical boiler and <b>geared</b> <b>drive,</b> similar to those built locally by Head Wrightson.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s {{there was another}} revival of railmotors with the {{introduction}} of new designs from Clayton and Sentinel with high-speed motors and <b>geared</b> <b>drive.</b> The London and North Eastern Railway bought over 80 of them but, again, they were short-lived.

50|$|The {{mechanical}} {{arrangement of}} Catch Me Who Can was simpler {{than the previous}} locomotives. The horizontal cylinder, flywheel, and <b>geared</b> <b>drive</b> were replaced by a vertical cylinder, still encased within the boiler.

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, design solutions of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> without <b>gear</b> tooth modifications {{are not to}} be constructed. Thus, in this study, a design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with micro-punch webs is proposed. A calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs is constructed, an example case of a micro-punch web for a low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> is calculated, which is based on the proposed calculation procession, and the noise elimination effect of the example case is predicted. Meanwhile, the impacts of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs on sound resonant frequencies are discussed. Furthermore, an experiment of the example case is conducted to check the effect of micro-punch webs on noise reductions and the proposed calculation procession and design solution. The experimental results indicate that the noise reductions of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accomplished by micro-punch webs under the almost same dynamic response conditions, and the fidelity of the proposed calculation procession of geometric parameters of micro-punch webs and design solution of low-noise face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be accepted.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} capacity of the <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> {{can be achieved by}} changing the tooth thickness of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R
50|$|The Coffman starter was an {{explosive}} cartridge operated device, the burning gases either operating {{directly in the}} cylinders to rotate the engine or operating through a <b>geared</b> <b>drive.</b> First introduced on the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engine in 1936 the Coffman starter was not widely used by civil operators due to {{the expense of the}} cartridges.|$|E
50|$|The drive {{between the}} {{crankshafts}} was unusual. Rather {{than the typical}} <b>geared</b> <b>drive,</b> as used by the Jumo, there was a triangular coupling rod frame, driven by an overhung crank {{on the end of}} each crankshaft. This frame in turn drove the flywheel and output shaft. The frame also drove the fuel injection pump, mounted in the top vee between the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Eight {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} {{for the new}} line, delivered between 1900 and 1904, numbered E1 to E8, with electrical equipment from GE, and mechanical equipment and structural parts manufactured by Blanc-Misseron. The line was electrified by 600V DC, supplied by a third rail, with overhead collection via a mini-pantograph in the Orsay tunnel. Unlike the B&O locomotives the PO units used <b>geared</b> <b>drive,</b> rather than the co-axial gearless motor drive of the 1896 B&O machines.|$|E

50|$|In a {{conventional}} steam locomotive, the 'gear ratio' is {{set by the}} size of the driving wheels. As a steam motor uses a <b>geared</b> <b>drive,</b> the wheel size can be reduced. This makes for a lighter and more compact chassis, particularly by reducing the unsprung weight of large wheels. Small wheels also allow the motor to be mounted on a bogie within a passenger coach to form a railcar, rather than the large wheels being the size of a locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The Simplex engines came {{either as}} direct drive or <b>geared</b> <b>drive.</b> The direct drive engines had a wind wheel {{diameter}} of 14 ft, 16 ft, 18 ft, 20 ft and 25 ft. A 25 ft high tower was supplied as standard, {{but could be}} made to any height a customer desired at extra cost. The blades of the wind wheel were similar in design and operation to the shutters on a Spring or Patent sail. Some of the larger direct engines were turned to wind by a fantail. A single or double fantail could be had, per the customer's wishes.|$|E

It is expected that these machines {{will be able to}} attain more power than other wind turbine generators. If the offshore market follows the trend of larger unit machines, offshore could be the most suitable niche for HTSGs.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the railway}} began with pony haulage, {{a pair of}} steam {{locomotives}} were delivered from Stephen Lewin of Poole in 1877. Ant and Bee were 0-4-0 tank locomotives made unusually narrow, in order to fit within the adit. They were 4 ft 9in high and only 3 ft wide. Their two 4×6in inside cylinders had Bagnall-Price valve gear and a <b>geared</b> <b>drive</b> to the rear axle, but coupling rods between the axles. The arrangement of the water tanks was particularly unusual, being a front tank ahead of the smokebox, {{in order to reduce}} width. The boilers were launch-type, as were commonly used for small locomotives with insufficient space between the frames for a conventional firebox.|$|E
50|$|Development issues delayed {{production}} of the engine, with the first <b>geared</b> <b>drive</b> engine delivered to Nieuport-Delage in October 1929, {{a month after the}} 1929 Schneider Trophy race. Despite the effort put into its development the 18R proved to be unreliable and unable to achieve the expected power output. The poor performance of the 18R prompted the development of the 18S, a de-rated version intended for commercial use. Reducing the compression ratio to 6.2:1 at a maximum rpm of 2,000 and replacing the Elektron with aluminium alloy, the 18S was available with or without the Farman reduction gear, but was not a success, only powering the Ford 14A in the pylon mounted central nacelle.|$|E
