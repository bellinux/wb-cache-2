40|$|The {{administrative}} {{relations of}} individuals towards the authority are {{the framework for}} balancing public and private legal interests in contemporary societies. Especially {{when there is a}} dispute, the system promotes the effective adjudication of contradictory legal interests in order to prove that the authority functions as a good administration. Namely, effective adjudication through <b>administrative</b> <b>appeals</b> can be the primary tool for resolving conflicts as quickly as possible but with full respect {{for the rule of law}} and the division of power as key principles of central European legal systems. The article addresses theoretical, normative, and empirical issues of Slovene public administration and administrative justice in order to establish the scope of effective conflict resolution by <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> that is mandatory before court action can be taken. By using several research methods, it can be concluded that Slovenia has developed appeal procedures as a sufficient form of adjudication. Nevertheless, appeals could be further improved to ensure good governance in practice. </p...|$|R

The paper is part of a wider analysis regarding the effectiveness of <b>administrative</b> <b>appeals</b> in the framework of administrative justice on European level, put forward at the EGPA Conference in Toulouse in 2010.

50|$|The <b>Administrative</b> <b>Appeal</b> Act {{may also}} be used to appeal a {{wrongful}} government act. <b>Administrative</b> <b>appeals</b> are made directly to the government body whose act is being appealed.

However, there are certain special cases (such as tax-related claims) where an <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> process must be completed before a court may hear the case.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} preceded by another {{work on the}} <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> in Serbian law, as {{prescribed}} by General Administrative Proceeding Act. It builds upon that by describing and analyzing the most often modifications made to the general regime of the <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> in various policy areas. It furthermore depicts special administrative control mechanisms, different from the <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal,</b> {{that exist in the}} fields of public procurement, education and broadcasting. These two articles should conclude the normative analysis of the system of <b>administrative</b> <b>appeal</b> and its counterpart administrative recourses. Normative analysis should further allow empirical research of the efficiency thereof and enable drawing of conclusions on respective features of the appellate proceeding that provide the best results in protection of the legality and private and public interests. </p...|$|R

40|$|For years, {{administrative}} {{law has been}} identified as the external review of agency action, primarily by courts. Following in the footsteps of pioneering {{administrative law}} scholars, a growing body of recent scholarship has begun to attend to the role of internal norms and structures in controlling agency action. This Article offers a conceptual and historical account of these internal forces as <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law. <b>Internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law consists of the internal directives, guidance, and organizational forms through which agencies structure the discretion of their employees and presidents control the workings of the executive branch. It is the critical means for shaping the discretion of officials and ensuring accountability within agencies. <b>Internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law’s binding status in structuring agency decision marks it as a form of law. This Article’s project is one of recovery more than invention. The decade-long debate culminating in enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) reflected consistent recognition of internal controls’ contributions to agency accountability. Despite this history, judicial enforcement of the APA undermined <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law and constrained its content by treating the agency’s articulation of internal norms that bind agency actors as triggering external judicial enforcement. At the same time, expanded White House control has made <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law more centralized. Given the importance of <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law to agency accountability and administrative legitimacy, {{the time has come for}} more sustained engagement with the idea of <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law and measures to foster its development...|$|R
