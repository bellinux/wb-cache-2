5000|$|Due to {{a number}} of factors the [...]41 Magnum {{unfortunately}} never became the [...] "next great police loading" [...] that its developers and supporters envisioned.First, the majority of departments and rank and file officers were perfectly content with their traditional [...]38 Special revolvers, and if more stopping power was needed, cartridges such as the popular [...]357 Magnum were available. In addition, when senior police officials could be convinced to evaluate the [...]41 Magnum, many complained that even the lighter [...]41 magnum [...] "Police load" [...] was unpleasant to fire, while the [...]357 Magnum offered adequate performance without the bruising recoil and muzzle blast associated with the [...]41. Also, the marketing decision by S&W and Remington to dub the cartridge a [...] "Magnum" [...] ended up working against them in their desire to address the law enforcement market. Police organizations found the connotation of a hi-powered [...] "Magnum" [...] hunting-type weapon to be unpalatable in an era when they were struggling with political correctness and pursued positive public relations to offset any possible public perception of police brutality. Although the [...]41 Magnum was adopted as a police <b>departmental</b> <b>standard</b> by a few cities such as Amarillo and San Antonio TX, and San Francisco CA most chose to pass. In addition, introduced in the shadow of its limelight-grabbing 'big brother' the [...]44 Magnum Model 29, the Model 57 struggled from its onset to garner much market share. This gap widened further when Clint Eastwood used a [...] "Most powerful hangun in the world" [...] Model 29 in the popular film Dirty Harry. In the aftermath of the film's release, many contemporaries of the [...]44 Magnum, including the [...]41, somewhat fell out of favor with the general public and American firearms market. Finally, a series of hugely popular and successful lighter and smaller-framed revolvers crafted from stainless steel emerged in the mid 1980s. These police-issue oriented firearms, exemplified by models such as the S&W Model 66, accelerated the Model 57's demise. Overall, the Model 57 and its variants failed to generate the interest (or sales) which had been hoped for.|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom skid {{resistance}} policy {{was published in}} December 1987 as <b>Departmental</b> <b>Standard</b> HD 15 / 87 and was applicable to all Trunk Roads and Motorways. The policy required {{the whole of the}} network to be monitored using a Sideway-force Coefficient Routine Investigation Machine, SCRIM. The standard was innovative and introduced concepts of:-• Investigatory rather than intervention levels; • At any location on the network where the skidding resistance became equal to or fell below the investigatory level, an investigation was required to determine if treatment to improve its skidding resistance was justified; • The recognition that the level of skidding resistance required to provide an equal risk of a wet road skid occurring would need to vary along a road depending on the geometry of the road and other factors.

40|$|International audienceAim: To {{retrospectively}} {{describe the}} performance of ultrasound guided thoracic epidural anaesthesia under sedation for anaesthesia management of open pyloromyotomy. Background: Anaesthesia management for hypertrophic pylorus stenosis is usually performed under general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation. Only a few publications describe avoidance of tracheal intubation in infants by using spinal or caudal anaesthesia. The present retrospective analysis describes {{the performance of}} ultrasound guided thoracic epidural anaesthesia under sedation for anaesthetic management of open pyloromyotomy. Methods: Twenty consecutive infants scheduled for pyloromyotomy according to the Weber-Ramstedt technique were retrospectively analysed. After sedation with nalbuphine and propofol, an ultrasound guided single shot thoracic epidural anaesthesia was performed with 0. 75 ml. kg- 1 ropivacaine 0. 475 %. Insufficient blockade was defined as increase of HR > 15 % from initial value and / or any movements at skin incision. In those cases we were prepared for rapid sequence intubation according to the <b>departmental</b> <b>standard.</b> Results: All pyloromyotomies could be performed under single shot thoracic epidural anaesthesia and sedation. One case of moderate oxygen desaturation was treated with intermittent ventilation via face mask. Conclusions: Thoracic epidural anaesthesia under sedation for pyloromyotomy has been a useful technique in this retrospective series of infants suffering from hypertrophic pylorus stenosis. In 1 / 20 infants short term assisted ventilation via face mask was required. Undisturbed surgery was possible in all cases...|$|E

40|$|Background: Apart from {{inhibitor}} {{development in}} patients with hemophilia (PWH) the old problems of blood borne viral infections and red cell alloimmunization still persist in PWH from developing countries. This study was planned to detect the presence of inhibitors in our PWH and to determine the presence of transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) markers and clinically significant red cell alloantibodies in these patients. Materials and Methods: One hundred fourteen PWH were screened for various laboratory tests. Screening for inhibitors was done by mixing study. Blood grouping, TTI testing and red cell alloantibody detection were done as per the <b>departmental</b> <b>standard</b> operating procedures. Results: Out of 114 patients evaluated 98 (86 %) had hemophilia A and remaining 16 (14 %) had hemophilia B. Five (5. 1 %) patients of hemophilia A were positive on inhibitor screening. On Bethesda assay, one patient was high responder (14. 4 BU/ml) and rest 4 were low responders (< 5 BU/ml). Overall, 19 PWH were positive for TTI markers and two had clinically significant red cell alloantibody (anti-E and anti-Jk b). Conclusion: This is probably first comprehensive study from our state on laboratory testing in PWH. The specialty of Transfusion Medicine can be a core part of hemophilia care. The overall prevalence of inhibitors in our hemophilia A patients was 5. 1 %, which is less as compared to majority of published studies...|$|E

An accuracy of &# 177; 10 &#x 0025; {{in the activities of}} administered radio-pharmaceuticals is being recommended, for expected outcome in diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures. It is recommended that the long-term stability of isotope calibrators used in nuclear medicine is to be checked periodically for their performance using a long-lived check source, such as Cs- 137, of suitable activity. In view of the un-availability of such a radioactive source, we tried to develop methods to maintain traceability of these instruments, for certifying measured activities for human use. Two re-entrant chambers [(HDR 1000 and Selectron Source Dosimetry System (SSDS) ] with I- 125 and Ir- 192 calibration factors in the Department of Radiotherapy were used to measure Iodine- 131 (I- 131) therapy capsules to establish traceability to Mark V isotope calibrator of the Department of Nuclear Medicine. Special nylon jigs were fabricated to keep I- 131 capsule holder in position. Measured activities in all the chambers showed good agreement.

A new supraclavicular approach using the brachiocephalic vein (BCV) for US-guided CVC placement in very small children has been recently described. In 2012, we changed our <b>departmental</b> <b>standard</b> and used the left BCV as preferred puncture site during CVC placement. In our retrospective analysis, we compared US-guided cannulation of the BCV with other puncture sites (control). Design/Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all CVC cannulations from October 2012 to October 2013 in our department. For cannulation of the BCV, the in-plane technique was used to guide the needle into the target vein. Results: We performed CVC cannulations in 106 children (age 1 -day to 18 years). In 29 patients, the weight was < 4. 5 kg. CVC placement was successful in all patients. The left BCV {{could be used in}} 81. 1 % of all cases. In a Poisson regression model of punctures regressed by age, weight or group (left BCV vs. control), age, weight or the cannulation site did not influence the number of punctures. In a logistic regression model of complications (yes vs. no) regressed by the group (left brachiocephalic vs. control) an odds ratio of 0. 15 was observed (95 % confidence interval 0. 03 - 0. 72, P likelihood ratio test = 0. 007).

40|$|The {{estimation}} of dynamic behavior of aircraft gas temperature sensors (GTS) {{has to be}} done only in certified air installations and be based on recorded experimental transient response in accordance with the <b>departmental</b> <b>standard.</b> Experimental transient response has hindrances of different nature and can influence the accuracy of identification of dynamic behaviour of GTS. We suggested a new method to increase the accuracy of identification of dynamic behavior of GTS. The method is based on the use of amplitude spectrum of signal composed of experimental transient response. Shaped signal is an impulse decaying signal satisfying a Dirichlet condition and Fourier transform can apply to it to get amplitude spectrum. We worked out the relation between amplitude spectrum of shaped signals and time constant of dynamic behaviour for three mathematical models of GTS. The research showed that the information about dynamic behaviour of standard aircraft GTS is located in LF part of amplitude spectrum in the range of 0 to 1 rad/s and to 3 rad/s. The study revealed that hindrance in the transient response at frequency higher than 3 rad/s did not influence the accuracy of results if to use LF part of amplitude spectrum for the identification of dynamic behaviour of GTS. The amplitude spectrum of shaped signal can be estimated by measuring equipment like LF spectrum analyzer or calculated by software package with the function of fast Fourier transform. The value of time constant of certain mathematical model of GTS can be realized with the help of regression analysis or the use of embedded resources of different data processing systems. Thus, the method gives an opportunity to increase the accuracy of identification of dynamic behavior of GTS.  </p...|$|E

Aortic arch and great vessel procedures depend on its function for safe practice, unless adjuncts like shunts are used. This paper assesses the contribution of cerebrovascular anatomy against physiology in determining requisite hemispheric perfusion during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Materials and methods: A review of shunting requirements for CEAs under locoregional anesthesia (LA) at the John Radcliffe Hospital during 1999 – 2013 was performed. A PubMed search for “Circle of Willis” was screened for all original articles defining cerebrovascular anatomy by postmortem or angiography. Results: Over 14 years, 1137 CEAs were performed under cervical plexus block; during this period, the <b>departmental</b> <b>standard</b> of practice evolved from exclusively general anesthesia to predominantly LA. CEAs performed under LA during the early phase (1999 – 2003) had a shunt rate of 15. 1 %, compared to 20 % as predicted by stump pressures alone. However, shunting decreased as higher perioperative systolic pressures were routinely practiced; shunt rates were 8. 0 % during the intermediate (2004 – 2007) and 6. 4 % during the later (2008 – 2013) phase. By comparison, 25 articles characterizing 6414 brains report an intact circle of Willis in 33 – 35 % of people, with a complete hemi-circle anteriorly (77 %) seen more commonly than posteriorly (42 %), and 11 – 16 % deficient in both hemi-circles with no cross-flow. Conclusion: Cerebral cross-perfusion is fundamental for safe CEA. Anatomy of the circle of Willis alone does not itself determine adequacy. Physiological mechanisms are important in overriding apparent deficiencies, and these can be manipulated perioperatively. Consequently, only 1 out of 15 patients requires shunting during CEA.

This study will also help in understanding the problems faced by blood banks/Transfusion Medicine departments in implementing an effective hemovigilance program. Materials and Methods: All the adverse reactions related to transfusion of whole blood and its components in various clinical specialties were studied {{for a period of}} 1 year. Any transfusion-related adverse event was worked up in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and <b>departmental</b> <b>standard</b> operating procedures. Results: During the study period from November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012, 45812 components were issued [30939 WB/PRBC; 12704 fresh frozen plasma (FFP); 2169 platelets]. Risk estimation per 1000 units of red cells (WB/PRBC) transfused was estimated to be: 0. 8 for febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), 0. 7 for allergic reaction, 0. 19 for acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AcHTR), 0. 002 for anaphylactoid reactions, 0. 1 for bacterial sepsis, and 0. 06 for hypervolemia and hypocalcemia. 0. 09 is the risk for delayed transfusion reaction and 0. 03 is the risk for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Risk estimate per 1, 000 units of platelets transfused was estimated to be 1. 38 for FNHTR, 1. 18 for allergic reaction, and 1 in case of bacterial sepsis. Risk estimation per 1, 000 units of FFP was estimated to be 0. 15 for FNHTR and 0. 2 for allergic reactions. Conclusions: Factors such as clerical checks at various levels, improvement in blood storage conditions outside blood banks, leukodepletion, better inventory management, careful donor screening, bedside monitoring of transfusion, and documentation of adverse events may decrease transfusion-related adverse events. Better coordination between transfusion specialists and various clinical specialties is the need of the hour and it will help in making the whole transfusion chain safe and effective. There is a need for a hemovigilance program at the national level so that true incidence and the spectrum of adverse events due to transfusion are known and policies formulated to minimize the risks associated with it...|$|E

The aims of this paper were to analyse patient demographics in a centre that caters to congenital cardiac surgery, compare <b>departmental</b> <b>standards</b> to international centres, and investigate the relationship between patient volume and clinical outcome. Methods : A total of 163 patients who presented to the Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery Depar tment of the National University Hospital, Singapore between 2002 and 2006 were identified and studied retrospectively. Patient demographics were analysed. The mortality rates and patient volume were compared with those observed at international centres. Results: The mean annual patient volume was 32. 6 cases. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 15. 7 years, with the oldest patient being 73 years old. 57. 1 percent of the patients were Chinese, 23. 3 percent were Malay and 19. 6 percent were Indian and other races. Foreigners made up nearly half of the patient cohort (45. 4 percent). Atrial septal defect was found to be the most common diagnosis (n is 64), with the secundum being most commonly involved (76. 9 percent). The commonest postoperative morbidities encountered were arrhythmias and pleural effusions. Patient volume was not found to be a significant factor affecting clinical outcomes. Conclusion: With a growing population of adults with congenital heart disease and a significant number of foreign patients, improvements to our resources and infrastructure need to be considered in order to cope with the increasing demands. Despite having a low patient volume, the centre is still able to provide congenital heart surgery with good clinical outcomes that are comparable to those of international centres with similar or higher patient volumes.

In prosthetic dentistry, labor inputs are determined based on the average standard working time for professionals that not always correspond to the actual time expenditures which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate units of labor input.   The objective of the research was to determine the units of labor input of orthopediststo manufacture implant-supported fixed restorations. Materials and methods.  The object of the research involved clinical processes of manufacturing implant-supported fixed restorations. The units of labor input were determined based on the average time standards obtained in the result of timing measurements of clinical processes of providing appropriate care. The conversion of the obtained time standards (TS) to the units of labor input (ULI) was performed according to the formula: ULI = Tts / T 1 uli Results and discussion.  Clinical processes of manufacturing 69 single implant-supported restorations by 15 orthopedists were studied. There were manufactured 13 crowns with screw-retained solid abutments, 21 crowns with screw-retained abutments, 17 single abutments, 18 screw-retained crowns with burn-out plastic abutments or abutments with a platform for attaching and pressing. In addition, the work of 18 orthopedists who manufactured 30 implant-supported bridges including 8 prosthetic dentures with screw-retained solid abutments, 10 prosthetic dentures with screw-retained abutments, 12 screw-retained dentures with burn-out plastic abutments or abutments with a platform for attaching and pressing was investigated and timed. The results of the research showed that the initial values of the labor input indicators when manufacturing single implant-supported fixed restorations were within the range of 1. 5 - 1. 5 ULI (the average values) and 3. 3 - 3. 5 ULI (the actual values) depending on the prosthetic construction. When manufacturing implant-supported bridges, the indicators were as follows: the average values – 2. 1 - 2. 3 ULI, the actual values – 3. 6 - 3. 9 ULI depending on the prosthetic construction as well.   Conclusions.  The results obtained due to timing measurements of clinical processes of manufacturing implant-supported fixed restorations, their analysis as well as the calculations of the standard time showed that the units of labor input of orthopedists determined {{on the basis of the}} average time standards did not coincide with the units of labor input of manufacturing these prostheses determined on the basis of the actual time standards...|$|R

In this study, all patients consented {{to have two}} non-contrast CT scans of the urinary tract performed instead of a single study; both CT scans covered an identical anatomic area extending from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.

This {{was known as the}} conventional dose CT scan (CD-CT) and served as the reference standard in this investigation. This CD-CT scan was followed immediately by a second low-dose non-contrast CT scan of the urinary tract (LD-CT) with a protocol designed to impart a radiation exposure of 10 - 20  % of the conventional CT scan. Using this strategy, the image quality and diagnostic yield of the LD-CT could be compared to that of the CD-CT scan and no patient would suffer additional radiation exposure (when exposure from the LD-CT and CD-CT were combined) as a result of recruitment into the study. The CD-CT protocol used a tube voltage of 120  kV, collimation of 0.625  mm, rotation time of 0.8  s and z-axis automated tube current modulation with minimum and maximum tube current thresholds set at 50 and 150  mA and a noise index of 52.0. The <b>standard</b> <b>departmental</b> protocol utilises the same collimation, rotation time and tube voltage, but has a tube current range of 60 - 170  mA and noise index of 45. The LD-CT protocol employed a tube voltage of 100  kV, collimation of 0.625  mm, rotation time of 0.5  s and fixed tube-time-current product of 35 - 40  mAs. The fixed tube-time-current product technique was preferred over the use of z-axis automated tube current modulation (ATCM) to ensure that radiation exposure remained below that of plain radiography regardless of body habitus; the use of ATCM would result in higher radiation exposures with increasing body mass index and thus the final radiation exposure would be less predicatable. Single medio-lateral and antero-posterior scout views were obtained prior to both helical acquisitions. The CD-CT images were reported in routine clinical fashion and LD-CT images were used for research purposes alone, i.e. they were not used to guide clinical decision-making at the time of scanning.|$|R
40|$|Background Inhalational {{induction}} {{in children}} is easiest to perform with the Ayres t-piece and bag (Mapleson F). Drawover anesthesia systems {{may be used}} but have not been studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the quality of induction of anesthesia in children comparing a continuous flow system using the Farman entrainer and the pediatric t-piece, to a pediatric drawover system. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial in accordance with <b>departmental</b> and institutional <b>standards</b> with 60 subjects who received inhalational induction using either apparatus. Results There was no evidence of a difference in the median Sp 02 between the two methods (P =  0. 626) neither was there a difference between the method of induction regarding abdominal distension (P =  0. 348) or restraint (P =  0. 186). Induction time using the pediatric drawover apparatus 240 (range 115 – 605) seconds was significantly greater than the Farman entrainer/t-piece 146 (range 65 – 535) seconds (P &# 60;  0. 05). Conclusions We consider that this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant in many cases; however, the increased speed using the entrainer and t-piece may sometimes confer an advantage. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE), {{like other}} Federal agencies, is under {{increasing}} pressure to use information technology to improve efficiency in mission accomplishment {{as well as}} delivery of services to the public. Because users and systems have become interdependent, DOE has enterprise wide needs for common application architectures, communication networks, databases, security, and management capabilities. Users need open systems that provide interoperability of products and portability of people, data, and applications that are distributed throughout heterogeneous computing environments. The level of interoperability necessary requires the adoption of DOE wide standards, protocols, and best practices. The Department has developed an information architecture and a related standards adoption and retirement process to assist users in developing strategies and plans for acquiring information technology products and services based upon open systems standards that support application software interoperability, portability, and scalability. This set of <b>Departmental</b> Information Architecture <b>standards</b> represents guidance for achieving higher degrees of interoperability within the greater DOE community, business partners, and stakeholders. While these standards are not mandatory, particular and due consideration of their applications in contractual matters and use in technology implementations Department wide are goals of the Chief Information Officer...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the technical success, safety, and outcome of endovascular embolization procedure in management of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms. Materials and Methods. 46 patients were treated for 53 visceral pseudoaneurysms at our institution. Preliminary diagnostic workup {{in all cases}} was performed by contrast enhanced abdominal CT scan and/or duplex ultrasound. In all patients, embolization was performed as per the <b>standard</b> <b>departmental</b> protocol. For data collection, medical records and radiology reports of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. Technical success, safety, and outcome of the procedure were analyzed. Results. Out of 46 patients, 13 were females and 33 were males. Mean patient age was 44. 79 ± 13. 9 years and mean pseudoaneurysm size was 35 ± 19. 5 [*]mm. Technical success rate for endovascular visceral pseudoaneurysm coiling was 93. 47 % (n= 43). Complication rate was 6. 52 % (n= 3). Followup was done for a mean duration of 21 ± 1. 6 months (0. 5 – 69 months). Complete resolution of symptoms or improvement in clinical condition was seen in 36 patients (80 %) out of those 45 in whom procedure was technically successful. Conclusion. Results of embolization of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms with coils at our center showed high success rate and good short term outcome...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{sought to}} assess the {{accuracy}} of hand-carried ultrasound (HCU) in the prediction of a normal study, and its cost-effectiveness in {{reducing the number of}} <b>standard</b> <b>departmental</b> echocardiograms (SDE) performed on hospital inpatients. Objectives: The setting was a district general hospital. Participants were 157 consecutive inpatients, mean age 68 (range: 18 - 97) years, 95 men (61 %), referred for SDE. HCU was performed at the bedside as part of the clinical assessment. SDE was performed routinely. Main outcome measures were: (1) assessment of the accuracy of HCU in detection of a normal or abnormal study as determined by SDE; and (2) a cost-effectiveness analysis. Results: Indications for echocardiography were: left ventricular (LV) function assessment, n = 101 (64. 3 %); valvular abnormalities, n = 11 (7 %); arrhythmia, n = 4 (2. 6 %); miscellaneous, n = 10 (6. 4 %); and no reason stated, 31 (19. 7 %). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of HCU predicting a completely normal scan were 74 %, 96 %, 94 %, and 81 %, respectively, and of predicting normal LV function in requests specific for LV function assessment were 81 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 77 %, respectively. If either all inpatients or those with requests for LV function assessment underwent HCU initially, and only those with abnormal scans underwent further SDE, there would be a 29 % and 22 % reduction in departmental workload and a cost saving of £ 23, 000 and £ 30, 000, respectively. Conclusion: HCU is an accurate method of identifying patients with normal hearts as determined by SDE. Its routine use is cost-effective and can significantly reduce the number of SDE that need be performed. Copyright © 2005 by the American Society of Echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ontwikkeling en Bestuur) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The Batho-Pele {{programme}} is {{a prescribed}} national government initiative {{which must be}} implemented by all government departments. The objective of this prescribed programme is across the board improved service delivery. It is {{the objective of this}} research to describe and analyse the progress made by the North West Department of Social Services, Arts, Culture and Sport in the implementation of the Batho-Pele programme since 1998. The basis assumption is that the Department has thus far been unsuccessful in terms of effectively establishing this programme within its functional activities. This severely hampered the Department's ability to render effective services to the public and identified beneficiaries. The inefficiencies in the departmental implementation process can be narrowed down to the following aspects: A lack of integrated planning The absence of effective communication links The failure {{to improve the quality of}} live of beneficiaries A lack of <b>standard</b> <b>departmental</b> implementation procedures Inefficient evaluation and monitoring mechanisms Research will be structured by measuring the departmental implementation procedure against the prescribed national government implementation steps to realise the objectives of the Batho-Pele programme. In this regard the departmental Service Delivery Improvement Plan, as introduced in 1998, will be analysed. Such an approach will firstly enable the researcher to establish what the shortcomings within the implementation procedure are. However this approach will secondly also highlight the positive aspects of the programme. In other words a balanced perspective of the implementation procedure will be provided. Through identifying the shortcomings and linking it to the positive outcomes of the programme it would be possible to come to specific conclusions regarding the shortcomings of the programme. On the basis of these conclusions it would be possible to make specific recommendations on how to refine and improve the service delivery process to the benefit of the public. Master...|$|R
