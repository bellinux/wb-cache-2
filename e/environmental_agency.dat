Reviewing a wide number of sociological, economical and administrative theoretical studies, {{the aim of this}} paper is to outline the distinctive features of the network organisation model. The network model is then applied to Italian <b>environmental</b> <b>agencies.</b> As the system of <b>environmental</b> <b>agencies</b> has been thought since its origin as a network, it certainly represents a unique case in the realm of Italian public administration. The authors aim at showing that Italian <b>environmental</b> <b>agencies</b> not only fit the network model, but they can also be qualified as a network of networks. In order to pick out the causes that may have fostered the emergence of a network-like administration, the characteristics of <b>environmental</b> <b>agencies</b> are thus assessed...|$|R

The main public entities in charge of water resources management in Bogotá are the district government, the regional <b>environmental</b> <b>agency</b> Corporación Autónoma Regional (CAR) of the department of Cundinamarca, and the water and sanitation utility Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogotá (EAAB). A court mandated that these entities cooperate to improve the river's quality, a ruling that translated into an agreement signed in 2007 that defined the responsibilities of each entity and forced them to approach the {{water management}} challenges in an integrated way. The agreement prepared the ground for the expansion of the Salitre wastewater treatment plant, construction of a new one, widening and protecting of riparian zones, restoring the natural meander of the river, and hydraulically connecting the river to its flood plains.

Entire communities were nearly destroyed, with some remaining flooded {{for a week}} after the hurricane.

The passage of the hurricane resulted in damage to houses, bridges, and electrical and water supply. About [...] fell in the city in a three-hour span, resulting in rivers overflowing its banks. About 1,100 vessels were stranded at port, and 35 ships sunk. Damage to the coffee industry was $80 million (1997 USD). One <b>environmental</b> <b>agency</b> remarked that it will take 15 years for coffee crops to recover. [...] According to one preliminary estimate, 123people died in Guerrero, primarily in Acapulco. Over 200were missing by four days after the hurricane due to being washed out to sea or buried in mudslides. A total of 50,000people were left homeless across the state. Striking the week after Tropical Storm Olaf, previously wet grounds combined with heavy rainfall from Pauline resulted in severe mudslides and flash flooding in shanty towns around Acapulco Bay. There, around 5,000homes were destroyed with another 25,000damaged, with 10,000people left homeless in and around the city. The luxury resort hotels near the beach were largely unaffected by the hurricane, though residents in the shanty towns lost what little they had. Much of the city was covered in mud, and 70percent of Acapulco was without water {{as a result of the}} hurricane. Most of the city's one million residents were left without power or telephone service. [...] Overall, total damage was nearly $300 million pesos.|$|E
