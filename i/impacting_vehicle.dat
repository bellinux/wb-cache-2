50|$|An {{anti-intrusion}} bar or beam is {{a passive}} safety device, installed in most {{cars and other}} ground vehicles, which must protect passengers from side impacts.Side impacts are particularly dangerous for two reasons: a) the location of impact {{is very close to}} the passenger, who can be immediately reached by the impacting vehicle; b) in many side-impact accidents, the <b>impacting</b> <b>vehicle</b> may be larger, taller, heavier, or structurally stiffer than the struck vehicle. The role of an anti-intrusion bar is to absorb the kinetic energy of the colliding vehicles that is partially converted into internal work of the members involved in the crash.|$|E
50|$|The {{reports that}} the cars were more prone to fires during a rear {{collision}} were a simple combination of three things. First, most law enforcement agencies rely heavily on the Crown Victoria as their primary vehicle, meaning that any police-related auto accident is very likely to involve a Crown Victoria. Second, the accidents occurred {{as the result of}} the officers intentionally parking their vehicles close to active traffic to shield a stopped motorist—something most civilians would never do. Third, the <b>impacting</b> <b>vehicle</b> was often traveling at, or above, the posted legal limit (65 to 75 mph in most jurisdictions).|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} {{guardrail}} {{would not be}} able to withstand the impact of a vehicle just by the strength of the individual posts in the area hit by the vehicle. Guardrail functions as a system with the guardrail, posts, connection of rail to the posts and to each other, and the end anchors (or terminals) all playing an integral role in how the guardrail will function upon impact. Soil conditions, height of rail, presence of curb or dike, weight of <b>impacting</b> <b>vehicle,</b> distance from back of post to hinge point and depth of post within soil can all determine how well the system will function upon impact. Guardrail is effectively one strong band that transfers the force of the vehicle to the rail elements, posts, and end terminals or anchors A run of guardrail must be anchored at each terminating end either by transitioning the rail into a fixed anchor such as a bridge rail or with an end terminal or end anchor placed in the ground or within an embankment. Newer concrete barriers, while usually strong enough to withstand direct hits by cars, still work on a similar principle in deflecting heavier vehicles such as trucks.|$|E

The case of parcel delivery in of Torino, (Italy, is considered). Particular aAttention is paidgiven to the influence on the choice of low <b>impact</b> <b>vehicles</b> of not only the influence ofpublic strategies but also the operational aspects characterising the urban freight distribution systems on the choice of low <b>impact</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Design/Methodology/Approach: A System Dynamics model based on Bass diffusion theory computes {{the number of the}} adopters of low emission vehicles together with the quantity of vans required and the associated economic savings and the quantity number of vehicles required. The model includes variables about freight demand, delivery frequency, van carrying capacity, routes, stops, distances travelled, and vehicle charging stations. A sensitivity analysis has been completed to identify the main diffusion levers. The focus is on advertising and other diffusion drivers such as public contributions, taxes traditional polluting vehicles are subjected to as well as routing optimization strategies, regulatory pressure, and route redesign actions. Findings: Advertising programs, green image, and word of mouth drive market saturation although in a long time period. In fact, low <b>impact</b> <b>vehicles</b> do not offer any economic advantage over traditional ones vans requiring higher greater investment and operating costs. In order to shorten the adoption time pPublic incentives to purchase both green vehicles and charging stations, together with and carbon taxes and a congestion charge affecting polluting vehicles, are able to shorten the adoption time advisable. In particular, public intervention reveals to be effective only when it unfolds through a number of measures that both facilitate the use of environmentally friendly vehicles and discourage the adoption of traditional commercial vans. The use of low <b>impact</b> <b>vehicles</b> associated with rRoute optimization also hastens the complete market saturation.

40|$|Walk-up flats are {{typically}} supported by slender columns {{on the ground}} floor forming a soft storey. The column slenderness ratio can be in the order of 6 - 9.

The energy-absorption capacity is calculated from the force-displacement curve of the column as determined from a nonlinear static (push-over) analysis. The ultimate displacement of the column is defined at the point when the column fails to continue carrying the full gravitational loading. Results obtained from the nonlinear static analysis have been evaluated by computer simulations of the dynamic behavior of the column following the impact.

40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} aspects of a {{proposed}} deceleration-limiting design for crash walls {{at the sides of}} racetracks and highways. The proposal is intended to overcome the disadvantages of both rigid barriers and kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design. Rigid barriers can keep high-speed crashing motor vehicles from leaving roadways and thereby prevent injury to nearby persons and objects, but they can also subject the occupants of the vehicles to deceleration levels high enough to cause injury or death. Kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design reduce deceleration levels somewhat, but are not designed to soften impacts optimally; moreover, some of them allow debris to bounce back onto roadways or onto roadside areas, and, in cases of glancingly incident vehicles, some of them can trap the vehicles in such a manner as to cause more injury than would occur if the vehicles were allowed to skid along the rigid barriers. The proposed crash walls would (1) allow tangentially <b>impacting</b> <b>vehicles</b> to continue sliding along the racetrack without catching them, (2) catch directly <b>impacting</b> <b>vehicles</b> to prevent them from injuring nearby persons and objects, and (3) absorb kinetic energy in a more nearly optimum way to limit decelerations to levels that human occupants could survive...|$|R

Consequently, the objective of this research was to contrast the injury patterns and severity observed from lateral impact to the different sides of the body.

A new energy absorbing cartridge, named the "Z-tube" was developed for use in a new conceptualized highway safety appurtenance. The Z-tube was developed to provide a low cost method of dissipating the kinetic energy of errant motor vehicles. The Z-tube when impacted collapses in a controlled manner such that the reactive force is constant throughout approximately 70 percent of the tube's overall length. Vehicular energy is dissipated by locally buckling the walls of a series of contiguous metal tubes separated by polyethylene.
