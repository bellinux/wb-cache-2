[...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to {{have trained}} service {{and how to}} make your hotels distinctive. They're good hotels, as hotels go, and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences, as you promise, but your hotels are not distinctive. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to make them so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{much trouble}} I got poor little Sonny Bunny into, through {{trying to help}} Cheeko Squirrel after he had so needlessly poked his nose into danger. I couldn't help saying just a word about that miserable weasel, {{because of all the}} fright my wife had on his account, and now for the story I began so long ago: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is the truth. What I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I'd as soon {{say in the}} {{presence}} of the lady as here." ...|$|R
60|$|Admiral Harrington here is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{all that}} I have left untold. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all that I know, {{and then he}} will follow up with such rags and {{remnants}} as he can find, and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what he knows.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by talking about a story? I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a story; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a {{statement}}. A statement is a matter of fact, therefore the exact opposite of a story, which is a matter of fiction. What I am now <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> really happened <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how.</b> It {{will depend}} on you, and it could depend on no better man. This new {{denunciation}} will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until {{two or three days}} afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nope," [...] he said lightly, [...] "this {{man from}} the bad, wicked world ain't {{going to tell you}} nothing of the kind. He's going to tell you of the good things in that world. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> he loved hosses when he was a shaver, and about the first hoss he straddled, and the first hoss he owned. Hosses ain't like men. They're better. They're clean--clean all the way through and back again. And, little fairy, I want to tell you one thing--there sure ain't nothing in the world like when you're settin' a tired hoss {{at the end of a}} long day, and when you just speak, and that tired animal lifts under you willing and hustles along. Hosses! They're my long suit. I sure dote on hosses. Yep. I used to be a cowboy once." ...|$|E

5000|$|It's not dramatherapy, {{though it}} has a {{therapeutic}} quality to it, {{in as much as}} they are free to get things wrong and are free to explore crazy situations, usually comic. I feel that laughter in itself is a therapy. ... There are no rules and regulations. I encourage them to improvise, try things out, and enjoy it. ... I realised more and more how important the element of fun is - it's a sort of playground of creative ideas - they can play and they are allowed to play ... They ask me how do I do this and I say well I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> you do this, try it, and if you get it hopelessly wrong then I'll help you but I am not going to prescribe. I am {{not going to tell you}} this is how you act. It's got to come from you.|$|E
