5000|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} {{for the formation of}} desert pavements. [...] A common theory suggests they form through the gradual removal of sand, dust and other fine-grained material by the wind and intermittent rain, leaving the larger fragments behind. The larger fragments are shaken into place through the forces of rain, running water, wind, gravity, creep, thermal expansion and contraction, wetting and drying, frost heaving, animal traffic, and the <b>Earth's</b> <b>constant</b> microseismic vibrations. The removal of small particles by wind does not continue indefinitely, because once the pavement forms, it acts as a barrier to resist further erosion. The small particles collect underneath the pavement surface, forming a vesicular A soil horizon (designated [...] "Av").|$|R

50|$|The {{documentary}} {{proposes a}} thought experiment {{in which a}} neutron star approaches <b>Earth.</b> <b>Constant</b> meteor storms are the first warning sign, and dramatic sequences depict widespread destruction and the deaths of thousands of people. Given seventy-five years to prepare, human society radically shifts toward the evacuation of Earth. The propulsion system for the spacecraft is the first problem to be addressed. In a dramatic sequence, the world's leading experts debate the benefits and drawbacks of various methods. Conventional rockets are too slow, and antimatter engines are too unstable; they eventually settle on nuclear pulse propulsion, as originally suggested by Project Orion. The world's engineers, scientists, and manufacturing workers begun work at a new site dubbed Starship City. Interviewed experts propose that fatalism may drive some people either to suicide or radicalism and attempts to sabotage the project. In one dramatic sequence, terrorists strike the facility, though they are destroyed by a hidden minefield. Brush fire conflicts also escalate, as security forces are focused on either maintaining order or protecting the interstellar project's facilities and personnel.|$|R

50|$|The Pepsi Globe {{originated}} in the 1940s as a logo and icon for Pepsi. The colors of the Pepsi Globe are red, white and blue. This {{is one of the}} most recognizable logos not only in the United States, but also around the world. The Pepsi Globe has undergone several changes throughout its inception in the 1940s with the most recent pivot taking place in 2009. This change was the most intense in terms of the amount of money and time that went into the branding, marketing, and visual culture involved in the underlying message for the logo. The packaging has also changed a number of times throughout the years in order to better represent the current Pepsi Globe logo at the time. The geometry involved with the shape of the logo and the shape of the packaging for the bottle are crucial for the marketing aspect of the Pepsi Globe. The subliminal advertising involved with the Pepsi Globe logo is also extensive. The different logos and packaging designs have been intended to represent the human body, rediscovery of the Vitruvian principles and their publication, Chinese art of placement and spatial arrangement and many other representations that may not seem clear or obvious from just a glance at a Pepsi Bottle. The most famous visual representation is the Pepsi Globe logo’s representation of The Earth. The swirling horizontal stripe running through the center of the globe provides a visual representation of the <b>earth’s</b> <b>constant</b> movement around its own axis and around the sun. The stripe also represents a naturally occurring electric generator in fluid motion generating and sustaining the magnetic field of the Earth.
