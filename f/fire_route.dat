5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Assembly Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, which oversees the MTA, {{transportation}} has been principle policy issue for Goldfeder. One of his major initiatives is the reactivation of the Rockaway Beach Rail Line. The Rockaway Beach Rail Line was operated by the Long Island Rail Road until a track <b>fire,</b> <b>route</b> truncation, and decreasing ridership lead to its shuttering in 1962. To show his support for this initiative, Goldfeder gathered more than 2,500 signatures in favor of reactivation and submitted them to the MTA, and Governor Andrew Cuomo. [...] When the MTA convened a Transportation Reinvention Commission in 2014, Goldfeder testified before the MTA commission advocating for the reactivation of the Rockaway Beach Rail Line during a public hearing. When the commission’s report was released, it highlighted the need to use existing rights of way, including the Rockaway Beach Rail Line, to expand subway and light rail service across the New York City metropolitan area. Most recently, at Goldfeder’s request, Queens College’s Department of Urban Studies initiated a study in November 2013 to poll the opinions of local residents on the best use of the abandoned rail line. When the survey was completed, it showed residents’ preference for expanded transportation over a proposed plan to convert the elevated train trestle into a park similar to the High Line. It also showed that the proposed transportation link would serve up to 500,000 trips per day.|$|E

40|$|It {{often happens}} that we don't realize the {{importance}} of <b>fire</b> escape <b>routes</b> until something happens, because we find the possibilities for a real accident too trivial. The purpose of this diploma thesis was to establish the actual condition of the <b>fire</b> escape <b>route</b> at the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering in Ljubljana. The diploma describes prerequisites for a fire, its development, as well as the characteristics of an escape route and evacuation time. Thanks to computer development, we now have access to different fire simulation software which provides us with extremely realistic data without anyone getting hurt in the process. I used Fire Dynamics Simulator software to simulate the fire and Pathfinder for the simulation of an escape route. For best results when planning <b>fire</b> escape <b>routes,</b> we must presume the worst-case scenarios. This diploma describes 5 variants, differing in the location of fire initiation and potential improvements, which are based on TSG- 1 - 001 : 2010 Fire Safety in Buildings technical guidelines. I noted evacuation times, fire temperatures, levels of CO and CO 2, smoke movements, and how the escape route is transient. As a result, my diploma shows that this building doesn’t comply with technical guidelines, which could cause harm to users in the event of fire...|$|R

40|$|The project {{involved}} {{the formation of}} alumina-spinel composites from combinations of different raw material sources, at two different compositions, varied over a range of temperatures succeeding a single stage <b>firing</b> <b>route.</b> The starting materials used were viz. A 16 SG, CL 370, CT 9 FG for alumina sources and fused magnesia and sintered magnesia for magnesia sources. Alumina and magnesia sources were combined at compositions of 80 : 20 and 90 : 10 weight ratio, pressed and reaction sintered at temperatures 1200 ºC, 1300 ºC, 1400 ºC, 1500 ºC and 1600 ºC. Increase in the spinel content formed, was observed in samples fired at higher temperatures. Batches with finer raw material sources offered better densification an increasing trend with temperature was observed for the same. The XRD analysis plots of 80 : 20 batches showed trace amounts of corundum phase peaks at 1600 ºC while the 90 : 10 batches indicated small but clear peaks of the same at the highest temperature {{and that can be}} attributed to the higher residual alumina in the latter batches...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{transformation}} of asbestos into non-hazardous crystalline phases and their recycling is a promising {{solution for the}} “asbestosproblem”. The most common asbestos-containing industrial material produced worldwide is cement-asbestos. Knowledge of the kinetics ofthermal {{transformation of}} asbestos fibers in cement-asbestos {{is of paramount importance}} for the optimization of the firing process at industrialscale. Here, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was used {{for the first time to}} follow in situ the thermal transformation ofchrysotile fibers present in cement-asbestos. It was found that the reaction kinetics of thermal transformation of chrysotile was highly slowed downin the presence of water vapor in the experimental chamber with respect to He. This was explained by chemisorbed water on the surface of thefibers which affected the dehydroxylation reaction and consequently the recrystallization into Mg-silicates. In the attempt to investigate alternativeand faster <b>firing</b> <b>routes</b> for the decomposition of asbestos, a low melting glass was mixed with cement-asbestos and studied in situ to assess towhich extent the decomposition of asbestos is favored. It was found that the addition of a low melting glass to cement-asbestos greatly improvedthe decomposition reaction and decreased the transformation temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due to the {{inherent}} fire risk in occupancies, it necessary {{that they are}} provided with suitable and sufficient escape route in case of fire emergency. This will ensure that occupants can get {{to a place of}} relative safety within the shortest period of time without travelling excessive distances or encountering hindrances. This paper is resultant of a study conducted on fourteen commercial highrise buildings in Nairobi CBD. It assesses essential <b>fire</b> escape <b>route</b> elements {{in the light of the}} requirements of the national regulations, laws and standards. Inspections, questionnaire survey, document review and interviews were used in the research. One hundred and nine (109) occupants responded to the questions poised to capture their perception, attitude and opinion on the escape route/s at their workstations. In the assessment 85. 71 % of the surveyed escape routes exhibited insufficient or unsuitable fire elements while only 7. 14 % of the buildings had sufficient and/or suitable and 7. 14 % had no escape stairs at all. Further, the results of the study show that, although <b>fire</b> escape <b>routes</b> are required as an integral part of the fire safety strategy, there still exist deficiencies in their provision. Unclear or no exit signage, obstruction and locking; poor escape route planning, lack of alternative escape route and the condition of fire doors are some of the challenges found with escape routes in the buildings. In view of the results, escape routes should be adequate, easily accessible, properly marked, well lit and have in place requisite facilities to enable easy movement and safety of the people. The escape route should also be routinely inspected to ensure no inhibitions are found to prevent people from using the route effectively. Lastly, the responsible authorities and persons should make sure that inspections are done and records made on remedial actions undertaken to correct present hazardous situation/s.

40|$|Wildfires are {{important}} elements of ecosystems that can have significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The spatio-temporal dynamics of single events are very complex and have been studied mostly {{through the application of}} models and by reconstruction using multiple data sources. Both are time consuming approaches with high associated uncertainties and laborious applicability to other case studies. In this study we propose to reconstruct the fire events and extract relevant parameters using solely remote sensing data for a large time span and spatial region. We combined a burnt areas dataset with MODIS active-fire detections to reconstruct the fire events. The structure of fire spread was described using graphs which were used to calculate the main <b>fire</b> <b>routes.</b> Using the circular statistics each <b>routes</b> mean <b>fire</b> spread direction was calculated. The approach showed promising results providing a valuable reconstruction of the fire events and retrieval of important parameters related to the propagation of single fire events. The methodology can be easily applied to other regions of the globe since it depends on a very limited amount of input data and is based on the morphological spread structure of each fire event. The more conventional approaches, such as fire spread modeling, would greatly benefit of the integration of information extract from remote sensing data. Pages: 2725 - 273...|$|R
