50|$|Ram or {{link arm}} units are usually simpler {{to install and}} maintain, they are visible to {{otherwise}} ignorant abuse and as they fix down along each <b>gate</b> <b>leaf,</b> they also have an obvious and sometimes major, mechanical advantage over Jacks. Therefore, Rams are far more suitable on Multi-user & commercial systems. Also the manual release is always above ground, making it often more user friendly in operation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} gate machinery {{consisted of}} a huge drive wheel, powered by an electric motor, to which was attached a connecting rod, which in turn attached {{to the middle of}} the gate. These mechanisms were replaced with hydraulic struts beginning in January 1998, after 84 years of service. The gates are hollow and buoyant, much like the hull of a ship, and are so well balanced that two [...] motors are enough to move each <b>gate</b> <b>leaf.</b> If one motor fails, the other can still operate the gate at reduced speed.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{hierarchical}} timing analysis technique for combinational circuits under the tightest known sensitization criterion, the XBD 0 delay model. Given a hierarchical combinational circuit, a generalized delay model of each leaf module is characterized first. Since this timing characterization step {{takes into account}} false paths in each module, the delay model is more accurate than the one obtained by topological analysis. Then topological delay analysis is performed on the circuit composed of generalized <b>gates</b> replacing the <b>leaf</b> modules, where the "gate" delay model is the derived one. As far as the authors know, {{this is the first}} result that shows that hierarchical analysis is possible under state-of-the-art tight sensitization criteria. We demonstrate by experimental results that loss of accuracy in using the hierarchical approach is very minimal in practice.

40|$|Ho Chi Minh City has to {{deal with}} severe {{flooding}} in the rainy season. To prevent the city from this flooding, MARD set up plan 1547. The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. The navigation lock provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a lifting gate and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50 %. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for the navigation lock focuses only on the lock head. Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre <b>gates,</b> single <b>leaf</b> <b>gates,</b> lifting gates and rolling or sliding gates. One of the most important criteria for the navigation lock are cost (35 %). Also the usability (35 %) is considered to be important, in particular the locking cycle and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate. A conceptual design for the lock is created. The inner dimensions of the lock chamber are determined, the structural elements are designed and an structural calculation of the single leave gate is made.

30|$|Compared {{with its}} apo-form, the ZIKV helicase {{undergoes}} obvious conformational changes, {{largely due to}} a rotation of Domain II and Domain III, once it binds to ssRNA. Domain II rotates about 9 ° away from Domain I in a rigid-body rotation mode along axis II in the direction as noted in Fig.  3 B and 3 D. However, Domain III rotates about 9 ° away from Domain I {{in the opposite direction}} along axis III, which is approximately parallel to axis II (Fig.  3 B and 3 D). This rotor domain rotation caused two α-helices (residues 365 – 379, and residues 390 – 400) in Domain II and two α-helices (residues 525 – 537, and residues 602 – 615) in Domain III {{to move away from the}} RNA binding groove in an opposite direction, enlarging the groove to accommodate the ssRNA. This natural design functions like a double-leaf swing <b>gate</b> with each <b>leaf</b> opening in a reverse direction to the other (Fig.  3 B and 3 D). Interestingly, the motor domain rotation mode in the ZIKV helicase is distinct from that in the DENV 4 helicase structure (Luo et al., 2008). In the DENV 4 helicase, the rotation axis for Domain II, however, is almost vertical to that for Domain III, but the rotation directions are identical (Fig.  3 C and 3 D).|$|R
50|$|Prior to mechanisation, {{the locks}} were {{operated}} by capstans, each with four poles, {{which had to}} make seven full revolutions to open or close a gate. Each <b>gate</b> <b>leaf</b> had two capstans, one to open it and another to close it. There were 36 capstans on the flight, and 126 revolutions were required for a boat to travel up or down the complete flight. With the advent of hydraulic rams and push-button control, transit times through the flight have been reduced from just over half a day to 90 minutes. The base plinths of the original capstans can still be seen, although the capstans themselves have been removed.|$|E
50|$|Under-gate Jack {{operators}} usually {{control the}} gate by directly moving the pivot point of each <b>gate</b> <b>leaf.</b> This makes the unit ideal cosmetically and {{also allows for}} up to 180 degrees of leaf swing as required. However controlling the pivot point of the gate, is like opening a door by twisting the hinge, and as so is very difficult due to the loads needed at that point. This is highlighted with snap, as the gate has to change direct, {{as soon as it}} can. For this reason they are recommend as only suitable for ‘Domestic’ systems in a low risk of abuse environment. Another major consideration with the use of under-gate units is that of water immersion/ingress and warranty voidance. If the water table is high or the drainage of the unit’s foundation box inadequate throughout the systems life, then water ingress and unit failure is increased.|$|E

The Automatic outflow regulating gate is water pressure operated gate. The main objective in the “Analysis & Optimization of <b>gate</b> <b>leaf</b> of Automatic outflow regulating gate ” is to achieve suitable design for <b>Gate</b> <b>leaf</b> proper. Finite element analysis of <b>Gate</b> <b>leaf</b> proper is taken for the study. Structural assembly of <b>Gate</b> <b>leaf</b> proper can be analyzed using Finite Element techniques.

Proof: We will think of the random circuits we are going to construct as built exclusively of Maj 3 gates, that is, gates with fan-in three and unbounded fan-out, which compute the majority function on their three inputs. Because each of these gates can be constructed from four binary AND, OR gates (exercise!), this simplification does not affect the asymptotic size and depth of the circuit. The circuit we construct consists of a full ternary tree of depth D = k log n, the nodes of which are all Maj 3 gates, for some constant k that will be specified later. Each leaf of the tree is connected to three inputs. The randomness appears in the way inputs and leaves are connected: each <b>leaf</b> <b>gate</b> independently picks three inputs independently and u. a. r. (with replacement) from among all n inputs to the circuit. This completes the description of our random circuit C (see Figure 6. 1). Notice that C always has size poly(n) and depth O(log n) ...|$|R
