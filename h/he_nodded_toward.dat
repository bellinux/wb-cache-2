6000|$|... "Erickson?" [...] Thacher smiled. [...] "You {{look like}} a {{commercial}} man, to me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the sample case on the floor. [...] "Am I right?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rochester {{had entered}} the library {{and closed the door}} behind him. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the man who rose slowly to greet him, but ignored his outstretched hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} it was a fool move to let that money lay around loose," [...] was Andy Jimson's comment, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the piles of bank bills.|$|E
6000|$|Higley had {{the grace}} to stop that. [...] "Let {{up on the}} cuss-words, Sam; there are ladies present," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> Lee. Then <b>he</b> opened upon Cavanagh. [...] "Well, sir, what's all this row? What's your charge against these men?" ...|$|R
60|$|Milton smiled, {{but did not}} reply. <b>He</b> only <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the exhorter, a {{man with}} a puffy jumble of {{features}} and the form of a gladiator, who was uttering wild and explosive phrases.|$|R
6000|$|He {{regarded}} her darkly. [...] "Well, I trust you. You won't give me away. I'm {{not so sure}} of her." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> his head <b>toward</b> the open door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had I my way," [...] {{answered}} the Fool-Killer, [...] "my blade would always drip. It is my master, yonder, who thwarts my duty." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> King Terribus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, I've seen him, {{and had a}} plain {{talk with}} him. Nay, I'm {{not going to tell}} thee now what I said; but it bit, and he didn't like it. Ralph, lad,"--and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> me with a chuckle--"his daughter's worth the winning. My own girl says so; and thou shalt have her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I have kissed her," [...] {{answered}} Ralph, [...] "it is {{with her}} consent, and because she will be my wife; but you worked upon her pity to put her to shame and now you shall pay the price of it. Do you see that whip?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the sjambock that {{was lying on the}} grass. [...] "Let him who proves the best man use it upon the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> {{his head}} <b>toward</b> the frosty panes, and wraps {{a sheet of}} {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|R
60|$|He was a kindly, easy-going man; but, {{after the}} way of a large {{percentage}} of the Western stock, he was undemonstrative. <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> turned <b>toward</b> the door to obey, and paused irresolutely. The look he gave back to Saxon was almost dog-like in gratitude and all-brotherly in love. She felt it, and in spirit leapt toward it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You boys {{sure did}} have a day of sport," [...] said Sid Todd, after he had {{inspected}} the fish, the grouse, and the wildcat. [...] "And you've proved that you can shoot," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> the slain beast. [...] "I've known many a putty good hunter to get the shakes when he see a bobcat a-glarin' at him from a tree. It ain't no tender sight, is it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] {{answered}} the knight, [...] "since to your gentleness we owe our lives. But with your leave I will add {{that we were}} overcome not by men, but by a devil"--and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> Grey Dick--"since no one who is only man can have such hellish skill in archery as we saw yesterday, and now again this morning. Moreover," [...] he went on, contemplating Dick's ashen hair and cold eyes set wide apart in the rocky face, like to those of a Suffolk horse, [...] "the man's air shows {{that he is in}} league with Satan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayhap, master. But {{for my part}} I am {{content with}} that of Murgh, which he gave us, you may remember, or so I {{understood}} him. Moreover, did he not teach that he and all are but ministers of Him above? Therefore I {{go straight to the}} head of the stair," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the sky. [...] "I am content to skip all those steps which are called priests and altars and popes and saints and such-like folk, living or dead. If Murgh's wisdom be true, as I think, these are but garnishings to the dish which can well be spared by the hungry soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must hide our canoes," [...] {{explained}} Ja, [...] "for the Mezops of Luana {{are always}} {{at war with}} us and would steal them if they found them," [...] <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> an island farther out at sea, and at so great a distance that it seemed but a blur hanging in the distant sky. The upward curve of the surface of Pellucidar was constantly revealing the impossible to the surprised eyes of the outer-earthly. To see land and water curving upward in the distance until it seemed to stand on edge where it melted into the distant sky, and to feel that seas and mountains hung suspended directly above one's head required such a complete reversal of the perceptive and reasoning faculties as almost to stupefy one.|$|E
6000|$|... "As for me," [...] quoth King Louis, hastily {{interposing}} in this feminine {{passage of}} arms, [...] "I drink to our gallant Chevalier de St. George, His Majesty King Charles Edward Stuart of England, Scotland, Wales, {{and of the}} whole of that fog-ridden kingdom. Success to your cause, Chevalier," [...] he added, settling his fat body complacently in the cushions of his chair; and raising his glass, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> benignly <b>toward</b> the young Pretender.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're yellow," [...] Grimshaw went on, [...] "yellow clean through." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>toward</b> the Ancient Mariner. [...] "Now there's {{the real thing}} as a man. No yellow in him. He never batted an eye, and I reckon he knew more about the danger than you did. If I was to choose being wrecked on a desert island with him or you, I'd take him a {{thousand}} times first. If--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>toward</b> {{one end of}} the island opposite, and, looking {{steadily}} in the same direction, the other guest could see the dome of a bald head and the top of a fishing rod, both equally motionless, rising out of the tall undergrowth against the background of the stream beyond. The fisherman seemed to be seated against the stump of a tree and facing toward the other bank, so that his face could not be seen, but the shape of his head was unmistakable.|$|R
40|$|Dr. Edward Wax {{carefully}} {{inserted the}} cassette in the player as {{he glanced at}} the other four sitting around the conference table. 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m glad you could find the time to listen to my problem, 2 ̆ 2 he began. 2 ̆ 2 I realize that the Psychiatric Institute is ordinarily concerned with research into phobias or psychological aberrations that have resisted treatment by the foremost psychiatrists, not the routine neuroses encountered by a GP like myself. Were it not for my neighbor, Mr. Pfund of your Institute, I suppose I should never have been given this hearing. 2 ̆ 2 <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the short cherubic man sitting across from him...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] he whispered. The girl bent {{her head}} closer to catch the faint message. [...] "I have wronged you--and him," [...] <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> weakly <b>toward</b> the ape-man. [...] "I loved you so--it is a poor excuse to offer for {{injuring}} you; but I {{could not bear to}} think of giving you up. I do not ask your forgiveness. I only wish to do now the thing I should have done over a year ago." [...] He fumbled in the pocket of the ulster beneath him for something that he had discovered there while he lay between the paroxysms of fever. Presently he found it--a crumpled bit of yellow paper. He handed it to the girl, and as she took it his arm fell limply across his chest, his head dropped back, and with a little gasp he stiffened and was still. Then Tarzan of the Apes drew a fold of the ulster across the upturned face.|$|R
50|$|After {{examining}} the videos, police located the dentist, who alerted his receptionist, who {{gave them the}} name and address of the suspect who had come in to pay his bill that day. After midnight on Tuesday, police also managed to identify the car in the surveillance video as a 1990 gold Honda Accord. Forty-five minutes later, two Flatbush volunteers searching for the missing boy in Kensington spotted the car and sent in the license-plate number, which matched Aron's details. Police went to the suspect's apartment in Kensington around 2 a.m. Wednesday morning. They arrived to an open door, and when they asked Aron where the boy was, <b>he</b> allegedly <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the kitchen, where the police found blood-soaked carving knives and bloody towels in bags. The boy's severed feet were found in the freezer. The suspect told police where to find the rest of the remains: in a red suitcase thrown in a dumpster on 20th Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Aron was taken into police custody at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} for you that I left him," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> the tents they had just left. [...] "I {{knew that he could}} hold them longer than I and {{give you a chance to}} escape that I might not be able to have given you. It was I though who should have remained. I heard you call him Korak and so I know now who he is. He befriended you. I would have wronged you. No--don't interrupt. I'm going to tell you the truth now and let you know just what a beast I have been. I planned to take you to London, as you know; but I did not plan to marry you. Yes, shrink from me--I deserve it. I deserve your {{contempt}} and loathing; but I didn't know then what love was. Since I have learned that I have learned something else--what a cad and what a coward I have been all my life. I looked down upon those whom I considered my social inferiors. I did not think you good enough to bear my name. Since Hanson tricked me and took you for himself I have been through hell; but it has made a man of me, though too late. Now I can come to you with an offer of honest love, which will realize the honor of having such as you share my name with me." ...|$|R
60|$|ALICE HEMINGWAY. [To LORETTA, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> table.] Three {{letters for}} you.|$|R
60|$|Hester <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> {{the trail}} that wormed {{its way across}} the prairie. A girl was riding toward them.|$|R
60|$|Kenwyne laughed, and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> {{the open}} window, {{through which they}} {{heard the sound of}} cheerful {{whistling}} approaching them along the trail.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the Jason Jones picture," [...] said an attendant, {{answering}} {{her question}} and <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> the admiring group; [...] "that's the prizewinner--over there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Abed {{notes that}} Holloway's {{character}} is handsome enough for network television - a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> Holloway's performance on ABC's Lost as James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford.|$|R
60|$|She smiled {{permission}} and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> {{the smoking}} lanai, {{where they found}} him talking sugar politics with the oldsters when the dance began to break up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shirts for Boo, sir. Four, {{and this}} is the last," [...] she answered, with pardonable pride, as she held it up and <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> the pile in her basket.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Brooke {{read the}} letter, and then, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> Dorothea, said, [...] "Casaubon, my dear: {{he will be}} here to dinner; he didn't wait to write more--didn't wait, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish you'd step in there," [...] the Squire said, <b>nodding</b> <b>toward</b> {{the room}} {{opposite}} the kitchen, [...] "and bring {{me out the}} Laws of Ohio. You know where it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{made myself}} known," [...] {{answered}} Stanley, {{and then he}} introduced the others. [...] "They bunk next door to us," [...] he added with a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> Dick and Sam.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4½ stars, with the review by Scott Yanow stating: [...] "Overall {{the music is}} {{advanced}} bop with a strong <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> African music. Well worth searching for".|$|R
6000|$|Alec <b>nodded</b> <b>toward</b> {{the skin}} {{which was to}} be Spud Ely's. [...] "It's the same one," [...] said he. [...] "I've kept part of him {{ripening}} out in the storehouse against this day," [...] he explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's eyes; I saw {{you lift}} your eyebrows, and <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> the carriage, and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again," [...] cried Nat, who was quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time.|$|R
50|$|Years ago, as {{continuity}} strips {{gave way}} to humor strips, typeset episode subtitles vanished from strips. In a <b>nod</b> <b>toward</b> the classic daily strips of yesteryear, Griffith keeps the tradition alive by always centering a hand-lettered subtitle above each Zippy strip.|$|R
