5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E

All worked as he had planned, until Charles arrived, albeit more swiftly than the Moors believed he could call up his entire army. Unfortunately for Rahman's son, however, he had overestimated the time it would take Charles to develop heavy cavalry equal to that of the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|In 1977 {{that was}} also changed by Prabhupada, and even the {{function}} of the second initiation was delegated to a few selected disciples. In the middle of May 1977, while in Hrishikesh, his health had turned for the worse and Prabhupada called all his GBC members to Vrindavana for instruction. The discussion of May 28 was recorded. There was a backlog of candidates and on 9 July a letter by his secretary, Tamal Krishna Goswami, was sent out, and that named eleven senior disciples who would now be responsible for giving initiations to the new candidates. At this point the new candidates need no longer write to him and the recommendations don’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him for confirmation.|$|E

UFC President Dana White stated, [...] "The first annual International Fight Week will be awesome, the fans {{are going to have a}} fight week experience better than anything they've ever had before, and each year we are going to build this thing to the point where every fan on the planet knows they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Vegas for this July fight week at least once in their lives."

500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years."

500|$|Describing the {{patterns}} of his relationships throughout the series, Davis and Needham draw the conclusion that [...] "while Captain Jack desires both men and women, his long-term love affairs and onscreen kisses are mostly with men {{in the past and}} present." [...] Davies himself laments that this one of the pitfalls of writing a bisexual character, commenting [...] "The trap you fall into with bisexual men is only having them sleep with men." [...] Commenting on the show's postmodern attitude towards bisexuality, or in what Russell T Davies calls [...] "omnisexuality", they continue to remark that [...] "His character brushes against definitions of queer sexuality in that he resists any sort of classification based on sexual orientation." [...] They also comment on the subtexts of particular episodes, such as gay time-travel romance episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness", and within that the relevance of time-travelling Jack Harkness to tackle the question of forbidden gay attraction in what is post-Brokeback television. In Understanding TV Texts by Phil Wickham, Wickham opines that Captain Jack explicitly [...] "brings to the fore" [...] with his [...] "brazen bisexuality", [...] "something we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect [...] as viewers of his work". Fans expressed fear that an Americanized fourth series of the show would mean the show would no longer portray Jack's bisexuality, but Davies assured interviewers that Jack's interests in both men and women would be honoured.|$|E
500|$|The first parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Cavity Search", a parody of U2's hit [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me". The song, which recounts the horror of {{having to go to}} the dentist, features the sound of an actual dental drill. To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording to create a genuine sound effect. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC's hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] called [...] "Phony Calls", about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from The Simpsons second season episode [...] "Blood Feud" [...] is played on top of the music. Because the sound clip was from a preexisting episode, Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a pretty sweet deal for the Simpsons' voice actors – they each got a nice pile of money, and they didn't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the studio!" [...] The next parody {{recorded for}} the album was [...] "Gump", a parody of [...] "Lump" [...] by The Presidents of the United States of America. The song recounts the basic plot to the 1994 film Forrest Gump about a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States. [...] "Gump" [...] was released as the second single from the album, and received a video.|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine were {{scheduled}} to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London {{for the month of}} February 1989, and intended to use the time to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded [...] "in five days". According to Shields [...] "when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they [...] freaked." [...] After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he (Robbins) [...] "was just there to press the buttons." [...] Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song [...] "Soon" [...] at Trident 2 studio in Victoria (the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless). Shields said of Moulder, [...] "As soon as we worked with him we realized we'd love to some more!" [...] When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told [...] "We're so on top of this you don't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> work." [...] Shields has since stated that [...] "these engineers—with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt—were all just the people who came with the studio...everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them", although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, [...] "even if all they did was fix tea", according to Shields.|$|E

2500|$|The 2002 {{season was}} the first in which Coulthard was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team.

But that said, it's important for me not to get bogged down in the history of what happened in the past. We just have to go forward." [...] He endured a torrid start: Coulthard's car suffered from gearbox issues and retired after 35 laps; and in the following race in Malaysia, both cars retired from engine failure after 24 laps. Two weeks later in the Brazilian Grand Prix, Coulthard secured his first podium of the season with a third-place finish. The start managed to get better as Coulthard took four consecutive finishes inside of the points; this included his only victory of the season in Monaco.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{involved}} in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. U.S President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, [...] "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide." [...] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, [...] "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered." [...] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of [...] "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, [...] "they're going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> grips with what Mr. Milošević ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..." [...] In the same press conference, Clinton also claimed [...] "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." [...] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, [...] "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." [...] President Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. The New York Times reported, [...] "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević." [...] The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians.
