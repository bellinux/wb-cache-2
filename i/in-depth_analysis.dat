5|$|The book {{presents}} an <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> and refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E

25|$|Douglas brought First Nations delegates {{together}} in 1946 {{to form a}} single organization to represent Indian interests. Three existing organizations merged into the Union of Saskatchewan Indians, which later became the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN). Douglas's EAPB prepared an <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of the demographic, social, and economic challenges facing the First Nation population. In the 21st century the FSIN is a strong policy-making and program-delivery organization, arguably {{one of the most}} effective of its kind in Canada.|$|E
25|$|New {{kinds of}} technology, {{including}} social media have {{also played a}} role. Increasingly information is conveyed in brief 'sound bites' so that it becomes something between information and entertainment. This makes 'the news' more susceptible to simplistic and populist explanations {{at the expense of}} more <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> and the seemingly indigestible opinions of academics and experts. Pratt argues that as a result, the influence of academics, senior civil servants, penal reform groups and judges who collectively make up the 'criminal justice establishment' has steadily declined.|$|E

25|$|In July 2014, the QualityWatch {{research}} programme published <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> which tracked 41 million A attendances from 2010 to 2013. This {{showed that the}} number of patients in a department at any one time was closely linked to waiting times, and that crowding in A had increased {{as a result of a}} growing and ageing population, compounded by the freezing or reduction of A capacity. Between 2010/11 and 2012/13 crowding increased by 8%, despite a rise of just 3% in A visits, and this trend looks set to continue. Other influential factors identified by the report included temperature (with both hotter and colder weather pushing up A visits), staffing and inpatient bed numbers.|$|E
25|$|But other {{observers}} made a more <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> that showed Chilean {{political and military}} advantages. Chile had a stable political system since 1833 and had developed and strengthened its institutions. Among them, {{the army and the}} navy had educated officers, and soldiers with professional experience in the Arauco War and uniformly modern arms: almost all Chilean fusils were Comblain and Gras of 11mm caliber for metallic brass cartridge. The Chilean navy also possessed two new ironclads, which were invincible against the older Peruvian warships. Although there were interferences between military and government regarding the right policy of war, the primacy of the government was never discussed. And the Chilean supply line from Europe through the Magellan Strait was only once threatened, in vain, by the Peruvian navy.|$|E
25|$|In {{his major}} extant astronomical work, the Mas'ud Canon, Biruni {{utilizes}} his observational data to disprove Ptolemy's immobile solar apogee. Not {{only did he}} perform research on theories, but he also wrote an <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> and explanation of an astrolabe and how it should work. He drew many different depictions of various instruments that {{are considered to be}} the precursors of more modern objects such as clocks and the astrolabe, in which other scientists were able to use to complete these inventions in the coming years. More recently, Biruni's eclipse data was used by Dunthorne in 1749 to help determine the acceleration of the moon and his observational data has entered the larger astronomical historical record and is still used today in geophysics and astronomy.|$|E

25|$|Many other {{subsequent}} {{efforts were}} less sophisticated, using a mere polar view of sentiment, from positive to negative, such as work by Turney, and Pang who applied different methods for {{detecting the polarity}} of product reviews and movie reviews respectively. This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang and Snyder among others: Pang and Lee expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder performed an <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for {{various aspects of the}} given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale).|$|E
25|$|Experimental and {{statistical}} criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model {{focused on his}} experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental {{and statistical}} calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that the since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty (2007) conducted the first <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of the data in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found many sampling biases, mathematical errors, and even statistical misinterpretations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} to follow, various {{national}} and regional initiatives and projects were formed. These include LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming) in the UK, FNL (Fördergemeinschaft Nachhaltige Landwirtschaft e.V.) in Germany, FARRE (Forum des Agriculteurs Responsables Respectueux de l'Environnement) in France, FILL (Fördergemeinschaft Integrierte Landbewirtschaftung Luxemburg) or OiB (Odling i Balans) in Sweden. However, there are few if any figures on the uptake of Integrated Farming in the major crops throughout Europe for example, leading to a recommendation by the European Economic and Social Committee in February 2014, that the EU should carry out an <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of integrated production in Europe {{in order to obtain}} insights into the current situation and potential developments. There is evidence, however, that between 60 and 80% of pome, stone and soft fruits were grown, controlled and marketed according to “Integrated Production Guidelines” in 1999 already in Germany for example. In the UK, 22% of fresh fruit and vegetables are grown to Integrated Farm Management standards as recognised by the LEAF Marque.|$|E
