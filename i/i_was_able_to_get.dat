25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Smith {{amassed a}} [...]276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals {{as a team}} won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the now best-of-seven NLCS, a split of the first four games {{set the stage for}} Game 5 at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda called upon closer Tom Niedenfuer to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his {{previous}} 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a walk-off home run, ending Game 5 in a 3–2 Cardinals victory. Smith said, [...] "I was trying to get an extra-base hit and get into scoring position. Fortunately, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball up." [...] The home run not only prompted broadcaster Jack Buck's [...] "Go crazy folks" [...] play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.|$|E

2500|$|Others {{argue that}} such {{considerations}} played little or no role, the US being instead concerned with the defeat of Japan, and in fact that the US desired and appreciated the Soviet entry into the Pacific war, as it hastened the surrender of Japan. In his memoirs Truman wrote: [...] "There were many reasons for my going to Potsdam, but the most urgent, to my mind, was to get from Stalin a personal reaffirmation of Russia's entry into the war against Japan, a matter which our military chiefs were most anxious to clinch.
