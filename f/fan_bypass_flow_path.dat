The cold helium <b>flows</b> may be <b>bypassed</b> and not completely heated, therefore, the accurate prediction of <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> is a key problem related to the reactor safety. The flow network method was employed to represent interconnected <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> and calculate the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> rates. <b>Bypass</b> <b>paths</b> in irregular shapes were simulated by CFD to get local and friction resistances. Typical <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>paths,</b> included <b>flow</b> through sealing ring to the pebble discharge tube, flow through small holes to the control rod channels and flow through vertical gaps to the hot plenum, were modeled to calculate corresponding <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> rates. Large gaps, where might induce high flow rates at two ends of the bypass paths, should receive more concerns...|$|R

40|$|An {{area that}} has been {{identified}} as significantly important {{in the development of a}} high temperature reactor (HTR) is the prediction of leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows.</b> It is therefore essential to understand the influence of leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> on the thermal performance of an HTR. A methodology was developed to conduct an integral thermal analysis of a reactor using a CFD approach. One of the main objectives was to include leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> in order to provide a capability for simulating these very detailed flows. This paper investigates leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> through the PBMR reactor unit. It was found that, although these flows are dependent on the pressure drop through the pebble bed, a change in pebble bed pressure drop does not result in a similar change in the predicted leakages flows. It is also shown that the ability to account for leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> in an integral manner can help designers to focus their efforts on the specific regions that need to be targeted for the improvement of the life expectancy of the graphite blocks. Furthermore, leakage and <b>bypass</b> <b>flows</b> were found to reduce the pressure drop across the reactor unit while increasing the peak fuel temperatures. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{riparian}} {{buffer strips}} {{is a possible}} strategy for controlling diffuse nitrate pollution of surface water in agricultural catchments. Data collected from paired buffered and unbuffered headwater catchments at three sites with conditions representative {{of much of the}} agricultural land in England and Wales, showed that grassed buffers did not substantially reduce nitrate–nitrogen concentrations entering the streams. Median nitrate–nitrogen levels observed in buffered catchments ranged from 7. 6 to 18. 8 mgN l− 1, but peaked at up to 46. 1 mgN l− 1. The existence of preferential <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> during the winter flow events limited the effectiveness of nitrate removing processes within the strips. The findings suggest that grassed riparian buffer strips may not be effective in controlling diffuse nitrate pollution unless the hydrology of the strip allows a suitable environment for denitrification and/or plant uptake. Grassed buffer strips should be carefully targeted or, alternatively, engineered to ensure adequate residence time of solutes within the strip...|$|R

The Universal Propulsion Simulator fan was designed and manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines, and included an active core, as well as <b>bypass,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>paths.</b> The <b>fan</b> was tested with several rotors featuring unswept, forward-swept and aft-swept designs of both metal and composite construction. Sideline acoustic data were taken with both hard and acoustically treated walls in the flow passages. The fan was tested within an airflow at a Mach number of 0. 20, which is representative of aircraft takeoff/approach conditions. All rotors showed similar aerodynamic performance. However, the composite rotors typically showed higher noise levels than did corresponding metal rotors. Aft and forward rotor sweep showed at most modest reductions of transonic multiple pure tone levels. However, rotor sweep often introduced increased rotor-stator interaction tone levels. Broadband noise was typically higher for the composite rotors and also for the aft-swept metal rotor. Transonic MPT generation was reduced with increasing fan axis angle of attack (AOA); however, higher downstream noise levels did increase with AOA resulting in higher overall Effective Perceived Noise Level...|$|R

The UPS fan was tested within an airflow at a Mach number of 0. 20 (limited flow data were also acquired at a Mach number of 0. 25) which is representative of aircraft takeoff and approach conditions.

Sideline data were acquired on an 89 -in. (nominal 4 fan diameters) sideline using the same microphone assembly and holder in the 9 x 15 LSWT and DNW facilities. These data showed good agreement for similar UPS operating conditions and configurations. Distortion of fan spectra tonal content through a free jet shear layer was documented, suggesting that in-flow acoustic measurements are required for comprehensive fan noise diagnostics.

Evaluation of moderate corrosion observed on aluminum parts exposed to the ML- 1 shield solution indicated no loss of performance capability.

The plant conceptual design was completed in 2001 and the preliminary design is currently underway. The pre-application licensing process with NRC was activated in October, 2002 and IRIS {{is one of the}} few designs considered by US utilities as part of the ESP (Early Site Permit) process. The novel features of the IRIS design, either from a safety performance and advance design point of view, provide a great opportunity for a more massive usage of Computational Fluid Dynamics in the process design for IRIS. A CFD-Group of international scientists, affiliate to the different IRIS parters has been formed and given the mission of investigating the many application opportunities for CFD with the goal also of verifing the gain in term of time, costs, resources saving over traditional design approaches. A first activity has been focused on identifying areas where CFD can be effectively used to support the design and analysis of the plant. For example, the following phenomena have been identified and selected for further considerations with CFD analyses: mixing phenomena (flow, temperature and boric acid) in the downcomer and lower plenum, boron and mixing phenomena in the pressurizer region, heat lossed and parasitic flow rates at some key locations in the pressurizer and reactor coolant system interface, and evaluations of the effectiveness of the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> and the natural circulation <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> in the riser-steam generator regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the CFD design support program that has been defined for IRIS and discusses in some detail the main areas of investigation. Also, an overview of CFD competences as they are distributed within the different organizations is provided and the international cooperation program that will support this activity is presented. Beside supporting the IRIS design in some key areas, the main porpouse of this program is also testing the opportunity for CFD to be used as a design support “tool” for advanced nuclear plants operating within a set of well-defined and accepted standard procedure able to identify any strenght, limits and future possible impementation of computational analysis...|$|R

Fertilizer type and the rate of application, as well as the amount, frequency, and intensity of rainfall, can influence the amount of fertilizer nitrogen (N) loss in leaching or <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> The effect of fertilizer N form and rate of application on N recovery in <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in a Kenyan Vertisol was determined. Calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, used to supply nitrate (NO 3 -) -N and ammonium (NH 4 +) -N, respectively, were surface-broadcast to 40 -cm-long undisturbed soil columns at equivalent rates of 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha(- 1). Using a rainfall simulator, two rainfall events (30 mm of water applied in 1 h) were applied to the soil columns, one before and the other after fertilizer application. Total N, NO 3 [...] N, and NH 4 +-N concentrations in the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> were determined after the second rainfall event. The application of NH 4 +-N, regardless of the rate, had no effect on N recovery in the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> When nitrate N was applied, the amount of fertilizer N recovered in the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> significantly increased with the rate of NO 3 [...] N application.

In this study, we report our test of the hypothesis that an apoplastic pathway (the so-called <b>bypass</b> <b>flow)</b> causes a difference in salt resistance between rice genotypes {{and can be used}} in screening for salinity resistance. Fourteen-day-old seedlings of low- and high-Na+-transporting recombinant inbred lines (10 of each) of rice IR 55178 were treated with 50 mm NaCl and 0. 2 mm trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), a <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> tracer, for short (4 d) and long (90 d) periods of time. The results showed that the average shoot Na+ concentration and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> for high-Na+-transporting lines were 1. 4 and 2. 4 times higher than those of low-Na+-transporting lines, respectively. There was a positive linear correlation between the percentage of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and Na+ concentrations in the shoots, suggesting that the difference in Na+ transport in rice is a consequence of different degrees of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> Moreover, a high correlation was found between <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and seedling survival after prolonged salt stress: the lower the magnitude of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> the greater the seedling survival.

Although <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> has been studied extensively, the current status of research on thermal/hydraulic core flow of VHTR is far from completion. Present study is the starting of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> characteristic investigation using small-scale model that will fulfill understandings of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in the prismatic core of VHTR. <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> experiments are conducted by using three small-scale models of prismatic blocks. They are stacked in a test section to form bypass gaps of single-layer blocks as exist in prismatic core of VHTR. Three bypass gap widths set in air and water flow experiments are 6. 1, 4. 4 and 2. 7 mm. Experimental data shows that <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> fraction depends on bypass gap width and downstream condition of prismatic blocks, while pressure drop of <b>flow</b> through <b>bypass</b> gaps depends on bypass gap width only. <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> simulations are performed by using STAR-CCM+ software after meshing parameters were determined from simulation exercises and grid independent study.

40|$|Core <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> {{has been}} one of key issues in the very high {{temperature}} reactor (VHTR) design for securing core thermal margins and achieving target temperatures at the core exit. The <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in a prismatic VHTR core occurs through the control element holes and the radial and axial gaps between the graphite blocks for manufacturing and refueling tolerances. These gaps vary with the core life cycles because of the irradiation swelling/shrinkage characteristic of the graphite blocks such as fuel and reflector blocks, which are main components of a core's structure. Thus, the core <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> occurs in a complicated multidimensional way.

The primary aim of this thesis was to identify the point of entry for <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> into rice roots subjected to salinity. Investigations using lateral rootless mutants (lrt 1, lrt 2), a crown rootless mutant (crl 1), their wild types (Oochikara, Nipponbare and Taichung 65, respectively) and seedlings of rice cv. IR 36 showed that the entry point, quantified using trisodium- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS), {{was not at the}} sites of lateral root emergence. However, PTS was identified in the vascular tissue of lateral roots using both epifluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy of sections stained with berberine-aniline blue and Fluorol Yellow 088 revealed that an exodermis was absent in the lateral roots, suggesting that the lack of the exodermis allowed PTS to pass through the cortical layers, enter the stele and be transported to the shoot via the transpiration stream.

The results of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> experiments performed on undisturbed soil cores showed that leaching of solutes occurred in concomitance with bypass fluxes when a low salinity solution was alternated with a high salinity solution. Exchange of solutes between the incoming solution and the soil matrix occurred during the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> events at the contact surfaces (cracks walls) between the solution and the soil matrix and where cracks terminated in the soil samples.

40|$|Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs) offer {{lightweight}} and frequently low cost alternatives to other materials in many applications. High temperature PMCs are currently used in limited propulsion applications replacing metals. Yet in most cases, PMC propulsion applications {{are not in}} the direct engine <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> since particulate erosion degrades PMC component performance and therefore restricts their use in gas turbine engines. This paper compares two erosion resistant coatings (SANRES and SANPRES) on PMCs that are useful for both low and high temperature propulsion applications. Collaborating over a multi-year period, researchers at NASA Glenn Research Center, Allison Advanced Developed Company, and Rolls-Royce Corporation have optimized these coatings in terms of adhesion, surface roughness, and erosion resistance. Results are described for vigorous hot gas/particulate erosion rig and engine testing of uncoated and coated PMC <b>fan</b> <b>bypass</b> vanes from the AE 3007 regional jet gas turbine engine. Moreover, the structural durability of these coatings is described in long-term high cycle fatigue tests. Overall, both coatings performed well in all tests and will be considered for applications in both commercial and defense propulsion applications...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{algorithms}} {{are presented}} {{to estimate the}} length, width and slope of rectangular planes representing irregularly shaped overland contributing areas defined on raster Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The strength of the procedure lies in that each <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> on the raster overland area is considered in {{the determination of the}} representative value for the entire rectangular plane as opposed to relying on a lumped, single <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> approach. The <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> parameters required by the algorithms are derived from raster maps of elevation (DEM), flow direction and upstream area. Qualitative cause-effect relations between <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> and runoff characteristics are used to emphasize those <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> that are important to runoff formation and propagation. Based upon these considerations, the plane length and slope are computed as a weighted mean <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> length and slope over all <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> of the overland area. Several alternative weighting factors are proposed. Based on area conservation, the plane width is computed as the overland area divided by the plane length...|$|R

Methods: Data were prospectively collected from 34 patients undergoing neonatal aortic arch reconstruction with regional low-flow perfusion. Cerebral oxygen saturation and blood flow velocity were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, respectively, throughout cardiopulmonary bypass. After cooling to 17 °C to 22 °C, baseline values of cerebral oxygen saturation and blood flow velocity were recorded during full-flow bypass. Regional low-flow perfusion was instituted for aortic arch reconstruction, and <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> rate was adjusted to maintain cerebral oxygen saturations and blood flow velocities within 10 % of baseline recorded during cold full-flow bypass. Cerebral oxygen saturations and blood flow velocities were recorded again after repair during full-flow hypothermic <b>bypass.</b> <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> during regional low-flow perfusion was recorded, as were arterial pressure and blood gas data. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine differences in values during regional low-flow perfusion relative to baseline and after perfusion. Results: A mean <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> of 63 mL/(kg × min) was required to maintain cerebral oxygen saturations and blood flow velocities within 10 % of baseline. Mean arterial pressure had a poor correlation with the required <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> rate (r 2 = 0. 006 by linear regression analysis). Fourteen of 34 patients had a cerebral oxygen saturation of 95 % during regional low-flow perfusion, placing them at risk for cerebral hyperperfusion if the cerebral oxygen saturation had been used alone to guide <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> Pressure was detected in the umbilical or femoral artery catheter (mean 12 mm Hg) in all patients during regional low-flow perfusion. Conclusions: Cerebral blood flow velocity, as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, adds valuable information to cerebral oxygen saturation data in guiding <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> during regional low-flow perfusion. Its most important use may be prevention of cerebral hyperperfusion during periods with high near-infrared spectroscopic saturation values. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2003; 125 : 491 -...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of soil water <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> to {{the transport of}} nutrients and contaminants has long been recognized. However, effective means of detecting concentrated subsurface <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> in a large landscape are still lacking. The flow direction and accumulation algorithm based on single-direction flow algorithm (D 8) in GIS hydrologic modeling is a cost-effective way to simulate potential concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> over a large area once relevant data are collected. This study tested the D 8 algorithm for simulating concentrated lateral <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> at three interfaces in soil profiles in a 19. 5 -ha agricultural landscape in central Pennsylvania, USA. These interfaces were (1) the interface between surface plowed layers of Ap 1 and Ap 2 horizons, (2) the interface with subsoil water-restricting clay layer where clay content increased to over 40 %, and (3) the soil-bedrock interface. The simulated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> were validated through soil hydrologic monitoring, geophysical surveys, and observable soil morphological features. The results confirmed that concentrated subsurface lateral flow occurred at the interfaces with the clay layer and the underlying bedrock. At these two interfaces, the soils on the simulated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> were closer to saturation and showed more temporally unstable moisture dynamics than those off the simulated <b>flow</b> <b>paths.</b> Apparent electrical conductivity in the soil on the simulated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> was elevated and temporally unstable as compared to those outside the simulated paths. The soil cores collected from the simulated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> showed significantly higher Mn content at these interfaces than those away from the simulated paths. These results suggest that (1) the D 8 algorithm is useful in simulating possible concentrated subsurface lateral <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> if used with appropriate threshold value of contributing area and sufficiently detailed digital elevation model (DEM); (2) repeated electromagnetic surveys can reflect the temporal change of soil water storage and thus is a useful indicator of possible subsurface <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> over a large area; and (3) observable Mn distribution in soil profiles {{can be used as}} a simple indicator of water <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> in soils and over the landscape; however, it does require sufficient soil sampling (by excavation or augering) to possibly infer landscape-scale subsurface <b>flow</b> <b>paths.</b> In areas where subsurface interface topography varies similarly with surface topography, surface DEM can be used to simulate potential subsurface lateral <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> reasonably so the cost associated with obtaining depth to subsurface water-restricting layer can be minimized...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHeat {{exchangers}} are {{an essential}} component of any energy production system. Obtaining a detailed characterization of them is a must for the design and operation of an energy plant. This article presents a characterization process of a finned tube heat exchanger with an unusual configuration. Throughout the article, the proceedings to study the influence of two unusual features that make unsuitable the use of reference models for heat exchangers are explained. One is the inclination of the tubes in the direction transverse to the flow velocity, which causes variable spacing between finned tubes. The other feature that prevents the application of the reference models is the importance of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow,</b> not negligible due to the small distance between walls compared with the width of the <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> near to the walls. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) steady-state analysis has been completed in order to study this problem. The results show that although the inclination of the tubes does not affect considerably the overall performance of the exchanger, the influence of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> close to the wall causes a significant reduction in pressure drop and a substantially lower heat transfer capacity than calculated with analytical models. This study was conducted within the Seventh Framework Programmes FP 7, for the HYSOL project. HYSOL plant has been proposed as an alternative to deliver dispatchable and firm energy regardless the climate conditions throughout the whole year while it uses 100 % renewable energy sources for electricity production through is innovative hybrid system...|$|R
40|$|Very High Temperature Rector (VHTR) {{had been}} {{designated}} {{as one of}} those promising reactors for the Next Generation (IV) Nuclear Plant (NGNP). For a prismatic core VHTR, one of the most crucial design considerations is the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and crossflow effect. The <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> occurs when the coolant flow into gaps between fuel blocks. These gaps are formed as a result of carbon expansion and shrinkage induced by radiations and manufacturing and installation errors. Hot spots may appear in the core if the large portion of the coolant <b>flows</b> into <b>bypass</b> gaps instead of coolant channels in which the cooling efficiency is much higher. A preliminary three dimensional steady-state CFD analysis was performed with commercial code STARCCM+ 6. 04 to investigate the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> and crossflow phenomenon in the prismatic VHTR core. The k-? turbulence model was selected because of its robustness and low computational cost with respect to a decent accuracy for varied flow patterns. The wall treatment used in the present work is two-layer all y+ wall treatment to blend the wall laws to estimate the shear stress. Uniform mass flow rate was chose as the inlet condition and the outlet condition was zero gauge pressure outlet. Grid independence study was performed and the results indicated that the discrepancy of the solution due to the mesh density was within 2 % of the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> fraction. The computational results showed that the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> fraction was around 12 %. Furthermore, the presence of the crossflow gap resulted in a up to 28 % reduction of the coolant in the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> gap while mass flow rate of coolant in coolant channels increased by around 5 %. The pressure drop at the inlet due to the sudden contraction in area could be around 1 kpa while the value was about 180 Pa around the crossflow gap region. The error analysis was also performed to evaluate the accumulated errors from the process of discretization and iteration. It was found that the total error was around 4 % and the variation for the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> fraction was within 1 %...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> in a {{prismatic}} {{high temperature}} gas reactor (HTGR) occurs between graphite blocks as they sit {{side by side}} in the core. <b>Bypass</b> <b>flow</b> is not intentionally designed to occur in the reactor, but is present because of tolerances in manufacture, imperfect installation and expansion and shrinkage of the blocks from heating and irradiation. It is desired to increase the knowledge of the effects of such flow, which has been estimated to be as much as 20 % of the total helium coolant flow. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations can provide estimates of the scale and impacts of <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> Previous CFD calculations have examined the effects of bypass gap width, level and distribution of heat generation and effects of shrinkage. The present contribution examines the effects of graphite surface roughness on the <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> for different relative roughness factors on three gap widths. Such calculations should be validated using specific <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements. While such experiments are currently underway for the specific reference prismatic HTGR design for the next generation nuclear plant (NGNP) program of the U. S. Dept. of Energy, the data are not yet available. To enhance confidence in the present calculations, wall shear stress and heat transfer results for several turbulence models and their associated wall treatments are first compared for flow in a single tube that is representative of a coolant channel in the prismatic HTGR core. The results are compared to published correlations for wall shear stress and Nusselt number in turbulent pipe flow. Turbulence models that perform well are then used to make <b>bypass</b> <b>flow</b> calculations in a symmetric onetwelfth sector of a prismatic block that includes <b>bypass</b> <b>flow.</b> The comparison of shear stress and Nusselt number results with published correlations constitutes a partial validation of the CFD model. Calculations are also compared to ones made previously using a different CFD code. Results indicate that increasing surface roughness increases the maximum fuel and helium temperatures as do increases in gap width. However, maximum coolant temperature variation due to increased gap width is not changed by surface roughness...|$|R
