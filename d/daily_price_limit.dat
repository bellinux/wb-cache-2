40|$|All {{buyers and}} sellers of futures {{contracts}} have to post margin money through their brokers {{to act as a}} performance bond. This margin money financially secures their position and protects the party {{on the opposite side of}} the transaction from default. Generally, the margin requirement for a futures contract is established at a level close to the maximum amount that any short or long trader could lose in any one-day trading period because each day the account is “marked-to-the-market” and the daily gain or loss is reflected in the account balance at the end of the day. The maximum amount of loss is determined by the <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit.</b> For example, the <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit</b> on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Live Cattle futures contract is $ 3. 00 /cwt. So, for the 400 cwt. contract, the largest increase in contract value in a one-day period would be $ 1, 200 (which would be a loss for the short trader), and the largest daily decrease in contract would be $ 1, 200 (which would be a loss for the long trader). The margin requirement is also established according to the volatility of the futures contract price. The more volatile prices are, the more likely the <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit</b> will be reached, and thus the margin requirement increases...|$|E

It differs from <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> in that trade prices are not restricted once the limit is hit. Intraday price ranges are smaller and adjusted to the recent volatility, so that limit hits are more frequent. We contribute to the debate about circuit breakers by enlarging the span of these mechanisms studied.

40|$|Current Draft: June 2005 We {{examine the}} {{existence}} and the forms of the magnet effect using transaction files and limit order book of the Korea Stock Exchange. A significant magnet effect exists in all five market microstructure variables (the rate of return, trading volume, volatility, order flow, and order type) when the limit hit becomes imminent. Specifically, investors place increasingly more orders, choose proportionally more market orders, and frequently reposition existing orders to advance transactions. We also find that: (i) a narrower price limit exhibits higher acceleration rates in all five variables compared to a wider price limit; and (ii) the upper limit hits draw heavier volumes of transactions, order submissions and market orders than the lower limit hits.

40|$|In the Chinese stock markets, {{there are}} A-shares and B-shares. Both share-types have {{identical}} cash flow rights but different ownership structures (i. e., A-shares {{are owned by}} local Chinese citizens and B-shares are owned primarily by foreigners), causing B-shares to be less liquid relative to A-shares. However, even though B-shares have much wider bid-ask spreads than A-shares, both share-types {{are subject to the}} same 10 % <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit</b> regulation. As such, B-shares, simply due to their wider spreads, may be more inclined than A-shares to hit price limits. Our empirical results support this contention. The findings have policy implications. First, given wide spreads for illiquid stocks, exchanges may consider using midpoint prices (between bid and ask prices) to establish price limit ranges for illiquid stocks. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, exchanges may consider using wider price limits for less liquid classes of stocks. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} much {{discussion}} among government regulators, academics and investors to control the increasing volatility by adopting the price limit mechanism in financial markets. Price limit are actively employed by stock markets as well as futures market worldwide.

This paper is to investigate whether price limit would moderate stock market volatility without affecting market liquidity and attempt to reveal the characteristics of those stocks that hit their price limit more frequently. We find that results from the SSE are consistent with conventional wisdom that stock market volatility is reduced {{as a result of the}} use of price limit. Secondly, trading volume increased significantly when stocks hit the <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limit,</b> and such behaviour will continue in the subsequent days.

40|$|Several {{financial}} markets impose <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> on individual securities.

We develop a Bayesian forecasting model in the presence of return limits, assuming that security returns are governed by identically and independently shifted-exponential random variables with an unknown parameter. The unique features of our Bayesian model are the derivations of the posterior and predictive densities. Several numerical predictions are generated and depicted graphically.

50|$|In France, {{the main}} French stock index {{is called the}} CAC 40. <b>Daily</b> <b>price</b> <b>limits</b> are {{implemented}} in cash and derivative markets. Securities traded on the markets are divided into three categories according to the number and volume of <b>daily</b> transactions. <b>Price</b> <b>limits</b> for each security vary by category. For instance, for the more liquid category, when the price movement of a security from the previous day's closing price exceeds 10%, the quotation is suspended for 15 minutes, and transactions are then resumed. If the price then goes up or down by more than 5%, transactions are again suspended for 15 minutes. The 5% threshold may apply once more before transactions are halted {{for the rest of}} the day. When such a suspension occurs, transactions on options based on the underlying security are also suspended. Further, when more than 35% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index cannot be quoted, the calculation of the CAC40 Index is suspended and the index is replaced by a trend indicator.

Given the evidence that daily returns are non-normal for most financial assets {{and the fact that}} the GMM estimator is much simpler than the ML estimator to implement, it is recommended that the GMM estimator be used in real applications.

This thesis studies both corn and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade during a twelve year period from July l, 1982, to November 30, 2004, and conducts tests to see if the futures price volatility is reduced during the day or days after limit hits in futures markets.

The empirical results show that macro corporate governance and legal environments have significant impacts on abnormal returns to rivals at acquisition announcements.

Accurate and complete signal processing methods are applied to the complete series and to their sub-periods. The evidence of lack of stationarity and ergodicity can be ascribed to two causes: (1) the initial interventions in these stock markets by the Chinese government by imposing various <b>daily</b> <b>price</b> change <b>limits,</b> and (2) the changing trading styles {{in the course of the}} development of these emerging stock markets, after the Chinese government left these equity markets to develop by themselves. By computing the markets' monofractal Hurst exponents (and its accuracy range with a new statistic), using wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA), we identify the markets' subsequent degrees of persistence. The empirical evidence shows that SHI, SZI, and SZBI are moderately persistent with Hurst exponents slightly greater than the Fickian 0. 5 of the Geometric Brownian Motion. It also shows that these stock markets were considerably more persistent before the deregulations, but that they now move much more like geometric Brownian motions, i. e., efficiently. Our results also show that the Chinese stock markets are gradually and properly integrating into one Chinese stock market.

Throughout the first half of 2008, oil regularly reached record high prices. Prices on June 27, 2008, touched $141.71/barrel, for August delivery in the New York Mercantile Exchange, amid Libya's threat to cut output, and OPEC's president predicted prices may reach $170 by the Northern summer. The highest recorded price per barrel maximum of $147.02 was reached on July 11, 2008. After falling below $100 in the late summer of 2008, prices rose again in late September.
