40|$|BACKGROUND: Uterine contractions {{during the}} first hour {{following}} intracervical application of dinoprostone would show the myometrial sensitivity to prostaglandins E 2 (PGE 2) and {{could be a good}} practical marker of the real prospects of success of an attempt to induce labor according to the above mentioned modalities. The verification of such an hypothesis is the principal aim of this work. METHODS: The study was carried out on a group of 90 cardiotocograms recorded soon after a sample of pregnant women at term underwent labor induction by intracervical application of a gel containing 0. 5 mg of PGE 2 (dinoprostone). Special attention was paid to some characteristics of the cardiotocograms obtained {{during the first}} hour following administration of the gel: regularity of uterine contractions, total number of contractions, number of contractions having an intensity equal or superior to 50 mmHg, mean number of contractions during a period of 10 minutes, mean number of "effective" contractions during a period of 10 minutes, presence or absence of "excessive uterine activity" (tachysystole and/or <b>hypersystole).</b> RESULTS: Some cardiotocographic patterns were associated with a higher percentage of successful inductions, but the observed differences, not statistically significant, {{do not seem to be}} clinically interesting. CONCLUSIONS: However, it's not possible to exclude that a longer period of uterine contractions monitoring, perhaps lasting 2 hours instead of only 60 minutes, could lead to more useful information for the management choices...|$|E
