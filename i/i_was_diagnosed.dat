40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{highlight}} the role of follow up CT angiography examination in detection and classification of endoleaks and therefore deciding management plans after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Patients and Methods: During one year duration 37 patients who have been operated were examined 1 and 6  months after EVAR as routine follow up. The images obtained were interpreted and reconstructed using dedicated software and work stations. Results: Out of 37 cases, 14 cases (37. 8 %) had positive endoleaks and 23 cases (62. 2 %) <b>were</b> free. Type <b>I</b> endoleak <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 4 cases (10. 8 %) and type II endoleaks <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 10 cases (27 %) as 7 cases (18. 9 %) showed leak through lumbar arteries and 3 cases (8. 1 %) showed leak through the inferior mesenteric arteries. Conclusion: CT angiography can accurately detect and classify endoleaks and thus determine line of treatment. Endoleaks are often asymptomatic and may become evident intra operatively or many years after the operation, therefore lifelong imaging supervision is necessary.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our study {{aimed at}} (1) {{evaluating}} neonatal treatment and outcome of neonates {{with either a}} prenatal or a postnatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia (EA) and (2) analyzing the impact of prenatal diagnosis on outcome based {{on the type of}} EA. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a population-based study using data from the French National Register for infants with EA born from 2008 - 2010. We compared prenatal, maternal, and neonatal characteristics among children with prenatal vs postnatal diagnosis and EA types I and III. We defined a composite variable of morbidity (anastomotic esophageal leaks, recurrent fistula, stenosis) and death at 1 year. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-nine live births with EA were recorded with a prenatal diagnosis rate of 24. 3 %; 82. 2 % of EA type <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> prenatally compared with 17. 9 % of EA type III (P <. 001). Transfer after birth was lower in case of prenatal diagnosis (25. 6 % vs 82. 5 %; P <. 001). The delay between birth and first intervention did not differ significantly among groups. The defect size was longer among the prenatal diagnosis group (2. 61 vs 1. 48 cm; P <. 001). The composite variables were higher in prenatal diagnosis subset (44 % vs 27. 6 %; P =. 003) and in EA type I than in type III (58. 1 % vs 28. 3 %; P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Despite the excellent survival rate of EA, cases with antenatal detection have a higher morbidity rate related to the EA type (type I and/or long gap). Even though it does not modify neonatal treatment and the 1 -year outcome, prenatal diagnosis allows antenatal parental counselling and avoids postnatal transfers...|$|R
