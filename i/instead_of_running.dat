5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland {{by the middle of}} 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on the state line. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Rashad Carmichael intercepted a pass by Jonathan Crompton {{leading to a}} Williams third-down run from the 1 to give the Hokies a 7-0 lead. Williams scored again, this time from the 3, to push the lead to 14-0 in the second quarter. Tennessee then took the momentum. Montario Hardesty ran through 301-pound {{defensive}} tackle Cordarrow Thompson’s tackle for a 4-yard run to cap an 80-yard drive. Janzen Jackson’s interception set up Crompton’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Moore with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> out the clock, Taylor threw from his 33 to Jarrett Boykin, who was stopped inside the Volunteers’ 5 as the clock apparently expired. Tennessee players left the field but were summoned back and reluctantly returned as a video review showed that Boykin’s knee hit the ground with 2 seconds remaining. Matt Waldron kicked a 21-yard field goal as the first half ran out to give Virginia Tech a 17-14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E

This makes Edward {{believe that it is}} not bad luck that follows her around, but that she has no sense of self-preservation. Bella isn't very rational nor sensible as she lacks common sense and street intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of so much}} ice upon the continents {{had a profound effect}} upon almost every aspect of Earth's hydrologic system. The most obvious effects are the spectacular mountain scenery and other continental landscapes fashioned both by glacial erosion and deposition <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> water. Entirely new landscapes covering millions of square kilometers were formed in {{a relatively short period of}} geologic time. In addition, the vast bodies of glacial ice affected Earth well beyond the glacier margins. Directly or indirectly, the effects of glaciation were felt in every part of the world.|$|E

25|$|However the Tay Bridge {{disaster}} of December 1879 fatally undermined confidence in Bouch's work, and the proprietors {{of the new}} Company decided to have the engineering design of the line reviewed, and this was done by George Trimble. A revised Bill was submitted to the 1882 session of Parliament and this gained the Royal Assent on 24 July 1882. Capital was £225,000. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> independently to Portobello, the line was now to adopt the old Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway route, and double the track, from near Duddingston to Niddrie, continuing to Portobello, and also provide additional spurs towards Dalkeith.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{improvisation}} {{of the film}} occurs when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000, money Cal earned by speculating in beans before the US became involved in World War I. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and {{in a gesture of}} extreme emotion, lunged forward and grabbed him in a full embrace, crying. Kazan kept this and Massey's shocked reaction in the film. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in Rebel Without A Cause. Both characters are angst-ridden protagonists and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving approval from their fathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} {{regarding}} a rail transit {{system to the}} redeveloped Fornebu was published in April 2001, published by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration. It investigated both bus, people mover, mainline railway and a tramway. The mainline railway alternative {{was based on the}} Asker Line being routed via Fornebu <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> directly to Lysaker from Sandvika Station. By 2001 construction of the Asker Line was under way and soon this alternative was ruled out. The Ministry of Transport and Communications determined in August that building a line would be the responsibility of Akershus County Municipality, Bærum Municipality and, if applicable, Oslo Municipality. The following month a state grant of 600 million kroner was issued.|$|E

25|$|The 138 mile (222km) section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness, via Perth, was {{substantially}} rebuilt {{during the}} 1970s and 80s, but it follows {{essentially the same}} route except where it bypasses towns and villages <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> through their centres. Between Perth and Inverness, the road has been dubbed Killer A9, because of accidents and fatalities where dual-carriageway sections merge into single-carriageway - the principal cause being motorists driving at excessive speeds to overtake lines of slower-moving vehicles before the dual carriageway ends. Dangerous overtaking manoeuvres on the long single-carriageway stretches of the road are also common causes of accidents, as are the non-grade separated junctions along the northern sections, where drivers make a right turn across the opposing traffic flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarity}} of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests {{that one could}} have inspired the other, as {{there is some evidence}} of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the {{similarity of}} the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.|$|E
25|$|Originally the Lambertseter Line was {{proposed}} {{as an extension}} of the now closed Simensbråten Line. Planning of a metro started in 1946 and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> via Ekeberg the Lambertseter Line was to run via Etterstad. Construction was tied with large-scale construction of housing along the route. As the Lambertseter Line could be completed much earlier than the metro's Common Tunnel, the Lambertseter Line was first built as part of the Oslo Tramway. Plans were approved in 1954 and the line opened on 28 April 1957. Until 17 May 1966 it was operated by Oslo Sporveier's SM53 trams and connected to the city center via the Vålerenga Line. From 22 May it became the first part of the Oslo Metro. The metro's main depot, Ryen Depot, is situated along the line. The Lambertseter Line received a major overhaul between 2010 and 2013.|$|E

25|$|From 1983 to 1992, the 91st Assembly {{district}} included {{parts of}} Westchester, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam Counties. However, in 1992, Assembly Democrats substantially redrew the district boundaries, placing the newly renamed 90th Assembly district entirely within Westchester County. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> {{in the newly}} redrawn district, Pataki decided to challenge seven-term incumbent Republican State Senator Mary B. Goodhue in the Republican primary by criticizing her for taking her grandchildren to Disney World and missing a vote in Albany. Pataki won the primary by a 52% to 48% margin. However, Goodhue was still going {{to appear on the}} November ballot on a minor party line. In November 1992, George Pataki won election to the New York State Senate in a 4-way race. Pataki served in the Senate of the 190th New York State Legislature, and ran for governor at the next election.|$|E
25|$|Modern historians {{tend to take}} {{a kinder}} view of Churchill’s actions at Antwerp. He had asked for the brigades minus recruits, {{and it had been}} Kitchener who insisted on {{retaining}} territorials in the UK to defend the East Coast against possible German invasion. Only 57 men were actually killed. In “The World Crisis” Churchill claimed he had prolonged Belgian surrender by a few days and occupied five German divisions. In fact it had been a week and enabled Calais and Dunkirk to be secured. Rhodes James believes that Antwerp was “substantially to Churchill’s credit”. However, at the time he had thought that holding Antwerp would help the Allied advance north; the claim that it helped hold Calais and Dunkirk when the German advance resumed is hindsight. The more damaging attack, made inside and outside the Cabinet, was that Churchill was seeking publicity <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> his department.|$|E
25|$|The race of {{attrition}} saw Christian Danner score a surprise 4th {{place in his}} Rial. The race ran for the full 2 hours and was flagged after 75 of the scheduled 81 laps. Alain Prost scored his only ever win in the USA, while Cheever's 3rd place was his final podium in Formula One. Before the race with the heat and practice times proving some 10–15 seconds per lap slower than predicted, a petition was circulated among the teams requesting the race be reduced to 70 laps. All team managers signed the petition {{with the exception of}} Ken Tyrrell which meant the race was not officially shortened. Ironically, this would work against his team when Jonathan Palmer lost a certain 4th place after his Tyrrell-Ford ran out of fuel on lap 69. Had the race been flagged after 70 laps, Palmer would have finished 4th having already been lapped by Prost <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> out of fuel and being classified as 9th and last.|$|E

25|$|Halas's {{replacement}} was Jim Dooley. In Dooley's {{first season}} {{at the helm of}} the team, the Bears finished with a 7–7 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back Brian Piccolo did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> away with his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers got back into the lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the fact that they have the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers have the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Carpenter {{provided}} a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons {{were made with}} the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once {{it became clear that}} the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's lumping of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus. He considered Stegosaurus stenops, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and {{provided a}} new differential diagnosis of Hesperosaurus compared to S. stenops. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.|$|E
