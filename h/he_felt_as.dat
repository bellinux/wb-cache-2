5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if his own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 2001, After Forever {{appeared}} as rising stars on the dynamic scene of Dutch metal, which included bands like The Gathering, Within Temptation, Gorefest and Ayreon. Their second album Decipher (2001) had received very positive reviews and their name was {{well known in the}} underground scene of the Netherlands. Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen’s vocals, both in studio and in live performances. In contrast with these premises for a bright future, the relationships within the band were not so idyllic. Soon after the release of Decipher, After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen {{and the rest of the}} band. Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever’s first two albums, Prison of Desire (2000) and Decipher. Moreover, his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs, often collected under a common title (e.g. The Embrace That Smothers and My Pledge of Allegiance). In the next album, Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments, choruses in Latin and death metal elements, while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music, retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable, but expanding it in new and different directions. These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band, in what <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> an actual dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein's {{influence}} has been felt {{in nearly every}} field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright: He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.|$|E
25|$|Although {{already an}} {{accomplished}} practitioner, in interview Okabayashi Shōgen stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> {{if he had}} come to a technical road block in his training through which he could not pass. He could perform the techniques effectively but not at a speed necessary for them to be employed under the demands of real fighting. His teacher Hisa had become elderly and had suffered a dehabilitating stroke and so was moving to Tokyo to be cared for by his family. Okabayashi decided that he would give up the practise of Daitō-ryū. Hearing of this Hisa encouraged him rather to go study with Sōkaku's son, the current headmaster of the art, Tokimune Takeda, and gave him a letter of recommendation.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final pay grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Primus {{was free}} to leave under the Bosman ruling and {{received}} an offer from Luton Town which he accepted. Lennie Lawrence, the manager who bidded for Primus was sacked soon afterwards, however, and the deal was cancelled to the dismay of Primus who said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if [...] " [...] whole world had collapsed". In the aftermath, Pardew put him in contact with Portsmouth manager Tony Pulis and a trial was agreed.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman [...] was put {{in charge}} of the group {{responsible}} for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. He said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching?, was mostly {{positive}} towards the episode, praising the crew's decision {{to focus on}} the mysteries of the week, stating that [...] "if the last couple of episodes are an indication, maybe done-in-one is in the right direction." [...] He found that he was invested in the case-of-the-week, while <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the Dean O'Dell plotline was not advancing quickly enough. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV was critical of nearly all aspects of the episode, stating that he was missing the longer story arcs and that once the mystery of Dean O'Dell's murder ended, the show would be relatively aimless. In addition, he decried Mac, Wallace, Piz, and Parker's absences, saying, [...] "I miss the 'gang'." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B-".|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage {{were in the}} style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be {{disappointed}} if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called Heritage the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as [...] "drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs".|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E

500|$|After he {{completed}} the demo, he pre-viewed the song's instrumental on a French radio station, {{but did not}} confirm which artist would contribute vocals. Guetta played the song to Rihanna whilst backstage at one of her Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11) concerts, to which Rihanna said [...] "Yeah, I like it." [...] Guetta confessed that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the singer did not like it on first impressions and doubted it, but stated that after the concert, the singer told Guetta {{that she could not}} stop thinking about the song's beat whilst she performed, and asked to record it. The final cut of the song was included on One More Love (2010) and Rihanna appeared as a featured artist. Guetta concluded the interview by saying that he felt [...] "honored" [...] to have worked with Rihanna. Prior to the release of Loud, Rihanna clarified via Twitter that [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] was not linked to Loud and that it would not appear on the album.|$|E
500|$|Chrisye {{began work}} on a {{rearrangement}} of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 {{at the request of}} Musica Studios– although he felt that the original album was fine– and once again teamed up with Gutawa. The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra. After its release, the album sold well, breaking even within three months and selling 350,000 copies. The album led to Chrisye's second sold-out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre, known as the Badai concert, and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country. He later told Kompas that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if he had reached a dead end, having tried all genres available. He continued performing, singing [...] "Indonesia Perkasa" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games on 19 June 2000 in Sidoarjo, East Java.|$|E
500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial {{of trying to get}} her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that. They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} Goddess Shree Mariyamma {{can be traced}} back to nearly about 800 years. As per ancient {{folklore}} and the sayings of ancestors, a person from the 'chulli Gurikara' family, living in the Mogaveeras village of ancient Karnataka, had gone to the ghat area on business visit. While returning home, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that some divine power is following him and <b>he</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if his body started to shake and shiver as if in a trance known as 'Avesha' meaning Goddess entering a human body and speaking through him. <b>He</b> later <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if God said to him to take her along him to the place where he resides. He then reached Urwa and decided to build a temple to this Goddess.|$|R

500|$|Allison Stewart for The Washington Post {{thought that}} [...] "Jump" [...] stood out {{as one of}} the {{highlights}} of Unapologetic, describing it as a [...] "monster in the making". Along with [...] "Stay", Stewart listed [...] "Jump" [...] as her top two songs on the album. Alike Stewart, Melissa Maerz for Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jump" [...] was one of her top recommendations to listen to along with [...] "Diamonds". Stacey-Ann Ellis for Vibe thought that [...] "Jump" [...] could be [...] "mosh-inducing" [...] if played in a nightclub. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush also agreed that [...] "Jump" [...] is one of Unapologetics best songs, writing that [...] "It's an unofficial rule in pop music that any song titled 'Jump' is going to be great (see Pointer Sisters, Van Halen, Kriss Kross, etc.). Rihanna's is no exception". Chris Younie for 4Music echoed Gallucci's sentiments, writing that it is one of the best songs on the album. He further wrote that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the album peaked after the second track, [...] "Diamonds", had finished, but stated that [...] "Jump" [...] filled void between that and the former.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Had a Dream Come True" [...] {{had marked}} a more mature {{direction}} for the group whilst still retaining their pop sensibilities, a direction which continued into their third studio album, Sunshine. The album contained {{what was to become}} one of S Club's most popular tracks, [...] "Don't Stop Movin'". The song was released in April 2001, marked a high point for the group as the single went straight to number-one, went Platinum and became the seventh best selling single of 2001. McIntosh, who takes lead vocals with O'Meara in the track, said he was [...] "nervous" [...] about taking lead vocals and was worried how people would react. However, after the song went in at number-one, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though he was [...] "supported by the fans" [...] and his fears were alleviated. McIntosh also remarked that the single had broken new ground for the group, and Cattermole thought it to be their [...] "best song by miles". The group won the Record of the Year award for the song, and in February 2002, the single won the group their second BRIT Award for best British single. The song has since been covered by The Beautiful South for their 2004 album Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs, as well as by Starsailor who recorded it for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.|$|E
500|$|Frank Cifaldi of Gamasutra {{covered a}} speech by Jaffe on the {{development}} of God of War at the 2006 D.I.C.E. Summit in Las Vegas. Cifaldi said [...] "God of War was a rare opportunity for a game designer" [...] because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget. He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game [...] "out of passion, not fear, {{and that it would be}} a game that [...] himself, as a game player, would want to play". Jaffe said the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark also inspired the development of God of War; he wanted to make players feel like <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a child watching that film, but did not want to put the player in the role of an adventurer, referencing The Legend of Zelda games. He elaborated that God of War was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving, but the game [...] "is not innovative or unique, and that's intentional". Jaffe said that their system was shallow and [...] "it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next". He said he understood modular game design—the need to have great looking, high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environment—but [...] " [...] was going to get bored" [...] if they did not step outside of those boundaries.|$|E
