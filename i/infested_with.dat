5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> larvae, though {{not nearly as}} often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} of the {{invasion}} of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately susceptible to the pathogen.

5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death.

This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the trapping effectiveness of two types of pheromones, the Austrian (Acuwit ®) and the Spanish one, {{in order to improve}} monitoring techniques and integrated control of Ips acuminatus Gyll., a bark beetle which since 2004 has caused serious damage to pine forests in the Cadore valley. Other aims of this study are: to compare the number of beetles and non-target species caught by traps, in four types of stand (healthy open areas, healthy woody areas, <b>infested</b> areas <b>with</b> standing trees and <b>infested</b> areas <b>with</b> felled and not removed trees); to describe the voltinism of Ips acuminatus and to identify the relationship between the number of caught beetles and damage level in 2008 and 2009. The Spanish pheromone was more attractive for Ips acuminatus and non-target species, whereas other bark beetle species were, more attracted by the Austrian lure. Ips acuminatus occurrence was different between the stand type and years. In healthy open areas traps caught more beetles than in <b>infested</b> ones, <b>with</b> the highest values in 2009, whereas in infested areas the number of caught beetles and the damage where lower in 2009.

5|$|Common {{starlings}} are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. A survey of three hundred common starlings from six US states found that all had at least one type of parasite; 99% had external fleas, mites or ticks, and 95% carried internal parasites, mostly various types of worm. Blood-sucking species leave their host when it dies, but other external parasites stay on the corpse. A bird with a deformed bill was heavily <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> Mallophaga lice, presumably due to its inability to remove vermin.|$|E

5|$|Wolves {{are often}} <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> {{a variety of}} {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|E

5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often <b>infested</b> <b>with</b> maggots.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBased {{on their}} effect on prey populations, predators can {{interact}} synergistically, additively, or antagonistically. Predator attraction by semiochemicals in response to herbivory is well documented; however, the possibility of semiochemicals mediating synergistic interactions has not been explored. Eriopis connexa (Germar) and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) interact synergistically with carabid species in Central Chile, a phenomenon in which semiochemicals may be involved. Moreover, olfactory behaviour in these coccinellids is unknown. Olfactometries contrasting non-infested vs. <b>infested</b> plants <b>with</b> Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were performed to study olfactory prey-searching in E. connexa, H. variegata, and Trirammatus striatula (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Carabidae). To evaluate whether semiochemicals can mediate synergistic predatory interactions, four experiments were established: olfactometries contrasting (1) <b>infested</b> plants <b>with</b> and without a predator, (2) uninfested plants with and without a predator; (3) predator vs. air, and (4) plants with previous physical activity of a predator vs. clean plants (nine combinations of predator species, according to whether they corresponded to the stimulus or focal individual). Hippodamia variegata and T. striatula were attracted to infested plants when contrasted <b>with</b> noninfested plants. <b>Infested</b> plants <b>with</b> a conspecific and H. variegata elicited attraction in E. connexa, whereas T. striatula preferred <b>infested</b> plants <b>with</b> E. connexa or H. variegata. Treatments with only predators (with or without the plant) did not elicit responses, except in E. connexa which was repelled by conspecifics and H. variegata, perhaps indicating an antagonistic interaction between them; plants with previous physical activity of predators did not elicit responses. These results corroborated the importance of semiochemicals produced by herbivory in the prey-searching behaviour of aphidophagous predators. In addition, presence of predators on the foliage may favour emission of aphid alarm pheromones, which could attract E. connexa and T. striatula. Volatiles can intervene in synergistic interactions between carabids and coccinellids; this should be replicable in other systems where predator-facilitation between aphidophagous predators is observed.
