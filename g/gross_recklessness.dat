5000|$|To varying extents in the United States, the {{requisite}} intention {{can also be}} found where the perpetrator acts with <b>gross</b> <b>recklessness</b> showing lack of care for human life, commonly referred to as [...] "depraved-heart murder", or during the commission of or while in flight from any felony or attempted felony (termed felony murder). In England, such mens rea would result only in a verdict of reckless or constructive manslaughter.|$|E
50|$|The {{common law}} punishes unintentional {{homicide}} as murder if the defendant commits {{an act of}} <b>gross</b> <b>recklessness.</b> A classic example of depraved-heart murder under the common law is in the case Commonwealth v. Malone, a Pennsylvania {{case in which the}} court affirmed the second-degree murder conviction of a teenager for a death arising from a game of modified Russian roulette in which each player pointed and fired the gun at the other, eventually resulting in the death of one of them.|$|E
5000|$|Defalcation is {{misappropriation}} {{of funds}} by a person trusted with its charge; also, the act of misappropriation, or an instance thereof. The term is more specifically used by the United States Bankruptcy Code to describe a category of acts that taint a particular debt such that it cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. The United States Supreme Court addressed the issue in 2013, holding that [...] "defalcation" [...] {{in the context of}} the U.S. Bankruptcy Code [...] requires proof of [...] "a culpable state of mindâ€¦ involving knowledge of, or <b>gross</b> <b>recklessness</b> in respect to, the improper nature of the relevant fiduciary behavior." ...|$|E
50|$|A guest {{statute is}} a term used in the law of torts to {{describe}} a statute that {{makes it more difficult}} for a passenger in an automobile to recover damages from the driver for injuries received in an accident resulting from ordinary negligence {{on the part of the}} driver. Instead, passengers are limited to suits based on <b>gross</b> negligence, <b>recklessness,</b> or intentional misconduct. The statute may also place a cap on the damages to be awarded, or limit damages to compensation for actual physical injuries.|$|R
25|$|According to the Iranian government, the {{shooting}} down of IR 655 by Vincennes was an intentionally performed and unlawful act. Even {{if there was}} a mistaken identification, which Iran has not accepted, it argues that this constituted <b>gross</b> negligence and <b>recklessness</b> amounting to an international crime, not an accident.|$|R

The lawsuit charged Merkin with <b>recklessness,</b> <b>gross</b> negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.|$|R
5000|$|Commonwealth v. Malone, 47 A.2d 445 (1946), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that affirmed the {{conviction}} of a teenager for second degree murder. The teenagers had played {{a modified version of}} Russian roulette called Russian Poker, in which they took turns aiming and pulling the trigger of a revolver at each other, rather than at their own heads. Therefore without an intent to kill or harm, Malone had pointed the gun at his friend's head and pulled the trigger, killing him. However, the court ruled that [...] "When an individual commits an act of <b>gross</b> <b>recklessness</b> without regard to the probability that death to another is likely to result, that individual exhibits the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of manslaughter even if the individual did not intend for death to ensue." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1946 U.S. legal case, Commonwealth v. Malone, 47 A.2d 445 (1946), a Pennsylvania teenager's {{conviction}} for {{murder in the}} second degree {{as a result of}} shooting a friend, was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In this case the teenagers involved played a modified version of Russian roulette, called Russian poker, in which they took turns aiming and pulling the trigger of the revolver at each other, rather than at their own heads. The court ruled that [...] "When an individual commits an act of <b>gross</b> <b>recklessness</b> without regard to the probability that death to another is likely to result, that individual exhibits the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of manslaughter even if the individual did not intend for death to ensue." [...] However, it has not yet been established whether simply participating in a game of Russian roulette in which another participant kills himself by his own hand would constitute manslaughter or some lesser form of conspiracy or homicide.|$|E
40|$|Drug {{industry}} lobbyists conspired {{with the}} White House and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) {{last year to}} craft a sweeping liability provision that shields the industry from lawsuits over products used to treat pandemic illnesses, even in cases of gross negligence or <b>gross</b> <b>recklessness.</b> This report relies on internal documents and e-mails of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) to illustrate {{the degree to which}} Frist's office deferred to drug industry demands and describes Frist's sleight of hand in securing passage of the provision. It underscores the enormous power of the drug industry and its lobbyists to steer a highly controversial provision into law. Frist inserted the shield provision into an already-completed conference report for the defense appropriations bill in the dead of night, with the aid of House Majority Leader Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). Many {{of the members of the}} conference committee had never seen the language, let alone approved it. Committee leaders explicitly assured Democrats, made wary by rumors circulating in the preceding days, that no attempt would be made to insert the liability measure into the spending bill. The shield is unnecessary because the government now can [...] and does [...] indemnify drug companies in contracts, using provisions saying that the government will cover costs in excess of the companies' insurance. The pharmaceutical industry used legions of influence-peddlers to push for the measure. The industry deployed at least 158 lobbyists to influence policies relating to vaccines and pandemic preparedness in 2004 and 2005, including 84 who were previously employed by the federal government. Of those, seven were former members of Congress, two were former top health care aides to Frist and another was the son of the speaker of the House...|$|E

5000|$|This {{was widely}} seen as a further move by SA Rugby to strong arm the smaller {{shareholder}} unions to sideline McKeever, who has been tenacious in his stance in ensuring that SA Rugby not breach its 8 June 2005 agreement with the franchise. The alleged [...] "suspension" [...] by the Spears Board has been declared as unlawful and McKeever's attorneys pointed out the <b>gross</b> irregularity and <b>recklessness</b> by the Spears board and McKeever's suspension was [...] "lifted" [...] barely a week of it being imposed.|$|R
5000|$|On July 3, 1988, {{near the}} end of the Iran-Iraq War, the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes shot down Iranian Airbus A300B2, which was on a {{scheduled}} commercial flight in Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The attack killed 290 civilians from six nations, including 66 children. USS Vincennes was in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will. The United States initially contended that flight 655 was a warplane and then said that it was outside the civilian air corridor and did not respond to radio calls. Both statements were untrue, and the radio calls were made on military frequencies to which the airliner did not have access. According to the Iranian government, the attack was an intentional and unlawful act. Iran refused to accept the idea of mistaken identification, arguing that this constituted <b>gross</b> negligence and <b>recklessness</b> amounting to an international crime, because the aircraft was not on a trajectory that threatened the Vincennes and had not aimed radar at it. The United States has expressed regret for the loss of innocent life but has not apologized to the Iranian government.The men of the Vincennes were all awarded Combat Action Ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone. Lustig, the air-warfare coordinator, received the Navy Commendation Medal, often given for acts of heroism or meritorious service, but a not-uncommon end-of-tour medal for a second tour division officer. According to the History Channel, the medal citation noted his ability to [...] "quickly and precisely complete the firing procedure." [...] However, in 1990, The Washington Post listed Lustig's awards as one being for his entire tour from 1984 to 1988 and the other for his actions relating to the surface engagement with Iranian gunboats. In 1990, Rogerswas awarded the Legion of Merit [...] "for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer ... from April 1987 to May 1989." [...] The award was given for his service as the Commanding Officer of the Vincennes, and the citation made no mention of the downing of Iran Air 655.|$|R
