40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, {{there have been}} strong demands for {{establishing}} the North and South Green Network and its <b>eco-corridors</b> to resolve problems of urbanization in Seoul. Following this, from 1994, the Seoul City Government began building ecological paths to re-establish ecological networks. 25 ecocorridors were created between 1994 and 2013 in Seoul, however, the designed <b>eco-corridors</b> presented some problems with biased functions, losing a major objective of <b>eco-corridors</b> which are required to perform as both a citizens’ moving route as well as wildlife passage. In addition, <b>eco-corridors</b> in Seoul, a heavily populated city, {{are not likely to}} serve the originally intended functions as well as those in natural areas. Accordingly, to appropriately perform its own function as a moving route for humans and wildlife, ecocorridors in urban areas are required to be comprehensively analysed with consideration of both ecological and pedestrian aspects. Study sites have been selected from the green zone of the Gangnam area. Specifically, it includes Seodal-ro, Sadang-ro, Solbat-ro, and Nambusoonhwan-ro, which form a linking footpath between Seodal mountain neighborhood park, Gachi mountain and Gwanak mountain. This study is to examine some issues of the selected urban <b>eco-corridors,</b> which are supposed to act as moving routes for both humans and animals through analysis of the current situation and usebehavior survey of eco-bridges in Seoul, and to interpret the meaning of ecocorridors in urban areas. Through the results of user behavior analysis of four eco-bridges, on one hand, it is found that the appearance frequency of wild animals is very low and species diversity is quite limited. On the other hand, the frequency of human utilization is very high and the purposes of utilization are varied. As known from these results, eco-bridges in Seoul could have more functions and meanings, not only concentrating on the function as a wildlife passage. This study offers the insight that eco-bridges in Seoul could be considered in a broader sense, focusing on human use rather than focusing on their ecological function in a narrow sense...|$|R

Based on {{the theory}} of unban carbon sink, search it {{according}} to actual situation {{of the study area}} and related research results, select the most important carbon sink factor which influenced ecological environment and other influences, take them as the effects the constraint conditions of urban ecological space, calculate kinds of carbon sink data. Endow different weight value according to their importance. The factors would be the mutual superposition based on the spatial analysis of GIS, form the ecological support spatial pattern with natural elements. The whole ecological network is constructed of source region, <b>eco-corridors</b> and ecological node with the space connectivity. At the end, optimize the urban ecological spatial pattern in the level of urban carbon sink distribution, help urban to become more perfect on planning and development...|$|R
40|$|The Bakumivka River’s catchment, Ukraine {{serves as}} a case study to the {{application}} of FREEWAT to the ground and surface water management. The main objective of the study is to find out the optimal spatial distribution of the water supplied to the farms by modifying the land cover pattern of the catchment. An integrated numerical model was developed to provide quantitative estimates of the water budget components. The model includes four model layers, representing the main hydrostratigraphic units, different types of boundary conditions assigned along the area’s boundaries, major components of the water balance introduced through source and sink layers. It was implemented through the FREEWAT software. Three water management scenarios were developed in order to compare different spatial patterns of land cover and distribution of water within the Bakumivka River’s basin. The scenarios represent continuum from market oriented pattern to environmentally sounding pattern of land cover. The objective of the modeling exercise is to obtain mass balances and maps representing three scenarios of water management. Each map shows distribution of the areas where the water balance is optimal, insufficient (dry) or excessive (wet) for vegetation (land cover) of particular type. The simulation shows that changing spatial land cover pattern is an effective measure to reduce water supply to the farms, however it does not prevent water logging in the areas adjacent to the flood plains and drying on summer stress periods in lands of sandyloam soils. Irrigation should be excluded in the areas with sandy and sandyloam soils. The flood plain with peat bogs despite the high water head in spring and late summer stress periods should be irrigated to prevent peat fires. The intrusion of <b>eco-corridors</b> to the land cover pattern in the catchment is positive from ecological perspective, but could prevent drainage causing water logging in the arable lands...|$|R
