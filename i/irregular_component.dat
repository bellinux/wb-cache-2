5000|$|The Earth's axis of {{rotation}} - and hence {{the position of the}} North Pole - was commonly believed to be fixed (relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician Leonhard Euler predicted that the axis might [...] "wobble" [...] slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent [...] "variation of latitude," [...] as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an <b>irregular</b> <b>component.</b> The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the Chandler wobble after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the [...] "instantaneous pole", but because of the [...] "wobble" [...] this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.|$|E

40|$|For an area {{preserving}} map, each chaotic orbit appears numerically to densely cover {{a region}} (an <b>irregular</b> <b>component)</b> of nonzero area. Surprisingly, the measure approximated {{by a long}} segment of such an orbit deviates significantly from a constant on the <b>irregular</b> <b>component.</b> Most prominently, there are spikes in the density near {{the boundaries of the}} <b>irregular</b> <b>component</b> resulting from the stickiness of its bounding invariant circles. We show that this phenomena is transient, and therefore numerical ergodicity on the <b>irregular</b> <b>component</b> eventually obtains, though the times involved are extremely long- 101 ° iterates. A Markov model of the transport shows that the density spikes cannot be explained by the stickiness of a bounding circle of a single class- for example, a rotational circle. However, the density spikes do occur in a Markov tree model that includes the effects of islands-around-islands. 1. Ergodicity and invariant measures As is well known [1], typical area preserving maps are neither integrable nor ergodic; instead, phase space is divided into a complicated mix-ture of regular and irregular components. ...|$|E
30|$|Our {{purpose was}} to explain the text output of SEATS on a simple example. The example {{is based on a}} non-seasonal series of U.S. {{interest}} rates on certificates of deposit. The model-based decomposition in two components is simple and does not involve a seasonal model. Thanks to that, it is possible to check the computations rather easily using Microsoft Excel. In particular, we have verified the different admissible decompositions; the selection of the canonical decomposition using the criterion of a minimal variance for the <b>irregular</b> <b>component</b> and using a pseudo-spectrum criterion; the derivation of the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter for the two components; and the difference between theoretical components, their estimators and their estimates. We could obtain the latter estimates but with a limited accuracy for the <b>irregular</b> <b>component.</b> We have also checked the autocorrelations of the estimates, with only two significant digits for some correlations involving the <b>irregular</b> <b>component.</b> On the contrary all the results relative to the estimators could be confirmed.|$|E
