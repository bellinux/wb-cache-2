5|$|Drawloom: The {{earliest}} confirmed drawloom fabrics {{come from}} the State of Chu and date c. 400 BC. Most scholars attribute {{the invention of the}} drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient Syria since drawloom fabrics found in Dura-Europas are thought to date before 256 AD. Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis of texts and textiles from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) proves that the <b>figured</b> <b>fabrics</b> of that era were also crafted {{with the use of a}} drawloom. The drawloom was certainly known in Persia by the 6th century AD. Eric Broudy asserts there is virtually no evidence of its use in Europe until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval Italian silk industry.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the consumption, collection, and display of one body of material culture prominent in late nineteenth-century British interiors, namely Japanese textiles, including plain, <b>figured</b> and embroidered <b>fabrics,</b> embroidered fans and screens, and kimonos. During this period, these objects featured in heated debates {{on issues of}} taste. A growing middle class sought to find and exert its place in society, and as Dianne Sachko Macleod had argued, their progress was related to material abundance visible in consumption and display (Macleod, 1996, 277). While the rare European and non-European antiques that formed the heart of so many aristocratic collections continued to be unaffordable to many, {{the combination of a}} disposable income and the availability of inexpensive imports or imitation handmade or mass-produced items, such as Japanese or Anglo-Japanese textiles, carried the desired connotations of luxury and exoticism...|$|R
5000|$|The cyclol {{hypothesis}} {{is the first}} structural model of a folded, globular protein. [...] It was developed by Dorothy Wrinch in the late 1930s, and was based on three assumptions. Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol <b>fabrics</b> (<b>Figure</b> 3). These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges.

50|$|In 2013 Mattel {{finished}} {{its relationship}} with Mainframe, (now known as Rainmaker Animation), and decided to reboot the TV series after 13 years. As part of this decision, Playground Productions, Nerd Corps Entertainment and FremantleMedia Kids & Entertainment created a completely different origin story, and Mattel produced new toys based on the new designs, notoriously different from the original ones. The most notable change was the drop of toy's clothes and wearable accessories. While the original action <b>figures</b> came with <b>fabric</b> made vest and pants and detachable or snap-on accessories, -thus allowing to undress or dress up the figures with additional gear-, the new ones had no clothes at all, and all their features were directly molded onto the figures surface. This also allowed Mattel to cut down the cost of production of the action figures. The new figures also lacked of spring, sound or light features, which were not included until 2015, but in limited figures only.|$|R

50|$|Before his {{departure}} a solo exhibition {{of his work}} in Madrid in 1916 received the accolade of {{a visit from the}} Spanish King; Alfonso XIII’s support and a personal introduction by the Spanish Dowager Queen, Maria Christina of Austria to the Spanish Ambassador, gave Beltrán immediate access to Parisian society. He leased a splendid residence near the Porte de Passy in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, where he established his studio. Here, the coarse Catalan peasants of his youthful canvases gave way to dark eyed gitanas and recumbent majas, wearing costumes that emphasised their feminine and seductive qualities. His paintings of women earned him comparisons with the poetry of Baudelaire and, indeed, he later provided the images for an illustrated edition of Les Fleurs du Mal. The contemporary viewer was struck by his use of colour and the mysterious, nocturnal world in which he set so many of his subjects, while sharply illuminating principal figures. He often painted in a darkened room, using artificial light to emphasize the contrast between bodies and their setting. He places <b>figures</b> against rich <b>fabrics</b> or, following his sojourn in Venice in 1920, in imaginary Venetian settings.|$|R
60|$|Then she sat still, looking {{straight}} {{in front of}} her, a very attractive picture, {{as some of the}} hurrying men who turned to glance at her seemed to find, in her long light dress. Her face, which showed a delicate oval under the big white hat, was a trifle paler than is usual with most Englishwomen of her age, and the <b>figure</b> the thin <b>fabric</b> clung about less decided in outline. Still, the faint warmth in her cheeks emphasized the clear pallor of her skin, and there was a depth of brightness in the dark eyes that would have atoned for a good deal more than there was in her case necessity for. Her supple slenderness also became Hetty Torrance well, and there was a suggestion of nervous energy in her very pose. In addition to all this, she was a rich man's daughter, who had been well taught in the cities, and had since enjoyed all that wealth and refinement could offer her. It had also been a cause of mild astonishment to the friends she had spent the past year with, that with these advantages, she had remained Miss Torrance. They had been somewhat proud of their guest, and opportunities had not been wanting had she desired to change her status.|$|R
40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in representational figure painting {{that occurred in the}} 1960 s and 1970 s caused artists, art historians, and critics to consider whether or not this contemporary work belonged to the abstract, modernist direction painting had taken in the 20 th century. This paper considered the problem as it was reflected in the careers of contemporary figure painters Philip Pearlstein, Jack Beal, and Alfred Leslie. The opinions of critics and historians and the views of the artists themselves were researched. The critics reached the consensus that all three artists' works were a logical extension of the modernist tradition in painting. Pearlstein concurred. He felt strongly that subject matter was irrelevant if the artist's attitude toward it was modernist in sensibility. Beal and Leslie found that abstract modern art was of little interest to them and concerned themselves with figure painting as a narrative genre allowing personal expression. The author also used this issue as a framework for the evaluation of her own series of three representational oil paintings of human <b>figures</b> wrapped in <b>fabric.</b> After describing the paintings, she concluded that they did reveal aspects of the artists' and critics' criteria of modernism (i. e. evenness of detail, large scale, and aggressive imagery) that should be pushed further in future work.

40|$|The Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union {{provides}} that {{an abundance of}} material and cultural benefits will be created {{for the whole of}} the Soviet people and that the world's highest level of consumption will be achieved. Our country has already made considerable progress in improving the well-being of the working people. The output of many consumer items is already approaching that of the United States, and insofar as certain goods are concerned, it has surpassed the U. S. level. For example, in 1961 the USSR's output of granulated sugar (from local raw material) surpassed that of the United States by 64 %, and of woolen fabrics by 36 %. As to leather footwear, the USSR's output is 73 % of the USA's. The <b>figure</b> for cotton <b>fabrics</b> (unbleached) is 59 %. The USSR's volume of output with respect to other consumer items is likewise approaching U. S. indices. It {{should be pointed out that}} the consumption level of the working masses of the USSR is catching up with that of the U. S. at a much higher rate than the level of production. This is due to the fact that the socialist economy is free of exploiting classes and the tremendous losses of social product inherent in capitalism. The USSR's successes in the sphere of living standards, which are enabling us to set the realistic task of creating an abundance of products by the end of the 1970 - 1980 decade, will, beyond doubt, increase the attraction exerted by the ideas of communism. With the fulfillment of the Program of the CPSU, the peoples of the whole world will become more and more convinced of the soundness of Marxist-Leninist theory. The apologists of capitalism cannot fail to see this. The successes of communist construction and the new CPSU Program have given them grounds for strengthening the anti-communist campaign. The bourgeois sycophants are making every effort to diminish the influence of communist ideas. To do so they resort to brazen lies and slander. ...|$|R
40|$|To fully {{appreciate}} the role and application of composite materials to structures, correct understanding of mechanical behaviors required for selection of optimum material. Fabric reinforced composites are composed of a matrix that is reinforced with pliable fabric, glass fabric is most popular reinforcement for different application specially in aircraft structure, although other fabric material are also used. At this study new fabric material called basalt with epoxy resin introduced and mechanical behaviors of this material investigated from view point of testing. For this study two type of fabric with different thickness used. Comparison between this composite reinforcement with popular reinforcement as carbon, glass, kevlar performed. To determine mechanical properties of epoxy based basalt fabric following test procedure performed : 1). Tensile testing according to ASTM D 3039 in 0 ° and 90 ° direction to find ultimate strength in tension and shear, modulus of elasticity, elangation and ultimate strain. 2). Compression testing according to EN 2850 ultimate compression strength and maximum deformation under compression loading. 3). Shear testing according to ASTM D 3518 - 94 to find in plane shear response of polymer matrix composites materials. 4). Predict flexural properties of sandwich construction which manufactured from basalt facing with PVC foam core according to ASTM C 393 - 94. Material strength properties {{must be based on}} enough tests of material to meet the test procedure specifications [1]. For this reason six specimens were manufactured for testing and the tests were performed on them using an INSTRON machine model 5582. In the study, the effect of percent of resin in basalt reinforced composite was investigated. Also the weights of the ballast based composites with different percent of resin were measured with conventional composites. As the weight is an important parameter in aerospace industry when the designer wants to replace one material with another, the effect of weight must be considered. Weight measurement showed that the replacement of glass fabric reinforcement with basalt fabric has little effect on weight. Investigation also shows that mechanical behavior of basalt fabric is higher than glass fabric. This is due to the excellent mechanical properties of the ballast fabric such as Young modulus and strength in compare with the glass <b>fabric.</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 shows the samples which used for tensile testing in warp direction...|$|R
