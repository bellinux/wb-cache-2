Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases {{are needed to}} examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions.

5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>studies</b> of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|While the {{long-term}} potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>studies.</b> For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E

5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>studies</b> {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in vivo, and in silico. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>studies</b> of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E

25|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>studies</b> demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, although the results were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>studies</b> clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.|$|E
