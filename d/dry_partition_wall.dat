Studies on water saving strategies in building construction and what procedures should be adopted for its efficient use can respond to part of these problems, {{taking into account the}} relevance of construction activities, responsible for almost 40 % of the overall environmental impact in Europe. Buildings rehabilitation assumes {{an important role in the}} construction activities of many European countries. The aim of this paper is to compare the water demand between dry and wet construction systems used in interior <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> technologies existing in south European climates, specifically on Portuguese territory. This paper focus on the advantages of the <b>dry</b> and lightweight <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> and it is expected that it may contribute for the reduction of water use in the construction industry. The evolution of interior <b>partition</b> <b>walls,</b> namely by its weight and embodied water analysis, is presented and discussed. Apart from the conclusion that dry construction systems, used in the rehabilitation of existing buildings, can contribute to a significant reduction of water demand, this analysis intends to also reveal on how much these systems can reduce other environmental impact indicators in relation to the wet conventional solutions. Dry construction strategies allows saving material and energetic resources, increasing flexibility and reducing wastes, what constitutes a relevant response to the growing concerns over environmental issues and incertitude on economic development...|$|R

However, data on the fire behaviour of local partition materials are insufficient. A survey on <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> commonly used locally was carried out recently. It is found that partitions are labelled as ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ types by the local building industry.

Basically, only the ‘dry’ partitions are of fire concern and there are seven types of them.

40|$|The String Wall is the {{emergent}} {{product of a}} study on technological applications in architecture. Our team attempted to test {{the limits of the}} common <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> construction, challenging the standard notion of the <b>partition</b> screen <b>wall</b> that recedes behind the structures, spaces and objects as a background condition. Such vibrant a partition as the SW becomes the center to the formation of the space it defines. The story of the SW could be described as the organic combination of the bow and the twist. The latent materiality and geometry of the bow and the twist as composite systems that are mined for their structural, tectonic and programmatic potential are tested prior to final construction by 3 D printed scaled models. The SW is composed of successive frames that consist of vertical twisted strips of plywood attached to wooden beams. These frames emulate the stud elements of the conventional <b>dry</b> <b>wall</b> <b>partition</b> systems and are manufactured entirely manually. On the other hand, the use of CNC milling machine is employed for the production of the bowed plywood strips that fill in the frame. Three fluctuated curvatures produce strips that are combined rhythmically to produce the striated effect of the SW. The material is manipulated in order to expose its hidden side, the sequence of the multiple layers of the different infilling conditions. The oblique perspective of the SW is achieved through a novel geometric transparency, thus offering constantly changing views to a moving observer. The manipulation of the position of the component bowed and twisted strips explore the application of a see-through condition that escapes the norm and reveals the back to the front in a unique whole. The void of the screen wall becomes ultimately programmatic through the use of light. A sequence of halogen lights situated at {{the top and bottom of}} the in-between the wooden strips void create the dumbfounded effect of the SW experience...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} the most vital aspects of {{construction}} industry which {{needs to be taken}} into account is sustainability development. This issue has been categorized into different subdivisions such as thermal properties, sound insulation, environmental impacts and flexibility. One critical element of the buildings playing a pivotal factor in order to meet the resident’s needs on the interior space is <b>partition</b> <b>wall.</b> Although some research has been carried out on the subject of sustainability in different aspects of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> such as embodied energy or thermal properties, there has not been any research carried out exploiting BIM (building information modeling) as a tool in order to simulate work process, calculate time and take-off quantities pertaining to this crucial element on the interior space of the buildings. Gaining innumerable benefits regarding the usage of BIM have been overlooked over the past researches conducted on the field of <b>partition</b> <b>walls.</b> As a result, this research has presented a new framework of exploiting BIM software in doing so. The main goal of this research is to propose a new type of <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> and its fasteners with the aim of shortening the installation process, materials needed and enhancing the functionality on the interior space of the buildings.

40|$|The growing {{necessity}} to save material and energy resources, {{together with a}} growing concern over the environmental issues, are impelling to solutions that present a minimal expression of the materials and products used. This is particularly relevant to the interior <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> that have a high contribution to {{the environmental impact of}} buildings, although these elements are easily reducible. Another aspect is that a great portion of housing designs are not flexible in use and therefore they are not suitably adjustable to the permanent updating of life-styles and variations on the composition of the households. Although there are some lightweight building technologies, in most cases the construction practice in Portugal makes use of heavyweight and static <b>partition</b> <b>walls.</b> This problem reveals to be of particularly importance in the refurbishment phase of existing buildings, but also when it is necessary the rethink of the interior spaces in the operation phase. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the environmental, functional and economical performances of a conceptual lightweight sandwich membrane <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> and to compare it with two technologies: i) the heavyweight conventional <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> (hollow brick wall); and ii) the lightweight reference gypsum panels wall (plasterboard wall). This paper will be focused in the advantages of the lightweight <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> and may contribute for the development of new <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> technologies. The comparative evaluation of these solutions will be based on a standard Life-cycle Assessment method. A lightweight interior <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> is certainly a wiser option in many situations as it can be more flexible and even portable, in some cases, as well as having a lower environmental impact in a Life-cycle Assessment (LCA), as it will be demonstrated in this paper. The lower quantity of materials used in lightweight solutions allow a lower specific embodied energy and other more favourable environmental impact indicators. The reduction of material inputs to the minimum is a way to achieve higher eco-efficiency in a building and thus open the road to more efficient interior partition systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{characterization}} of gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers has been performed {{in terms of}} pressure drop behavior and heat transfer performance. The gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers differ by <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> material, <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and flow arrangement. The pressure drop behavior has been analyzed due to the pressure losses in different sections of the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers. Increased pressure losses in front of and behind the micro channels have been detected due to modified geometries in the inlet and outlet distribution chambers. The heat transfer performance has been determined in terms of thermal effectiveness. The comparison among different <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> materials and <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thicknesses showed no significant criteria {{of the influence of}} thermal conductivity on the thermal effectiveness. An assessment due to an overall heat exchanger effectiveness has been performed to compare the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers.
