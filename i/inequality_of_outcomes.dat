40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} income <b>inequality</b> and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> opportunities for income acquisition in nine developed countries during the nineties. We develop a new definition of equality of opportunity and show {{how it can be}} implemented empirically. Equality of opportunity is defined as the situation where income distributions conditional on social origin cannot be ranked according to stochastic dominance criteria. Stochastic dominance is assessed using non-parametric statistical tests. We measure social origin by parental education and occupation and use national household surveys to assess <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> income and opportunities. USA and Italy show up as the most unequal countries both in terms <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> and opportunity. At the opposite extreme, income distributions conditional on social origin are very close in Scandinavian countries even before any redistributive policy. The analysis highlights that <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity can sometimes lead to different pictures. For instance, France and Germany experience a similar level <b>of</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> income but the former country is much more unequal than the latter {{from the point of view}} of equality of opportunity. Differences in rankings according to <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity underscore the importance of the policymaker's choice of the conception of equality to promote.

30|$|What we {{consider}} here however is inequality of opportunities, which {{is distinct from}} <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes.</b> This distinction becomes particularly relevant in this context because while the Hirschman/Rothschild mechanism of higher inequality signaling higher potential mobility may be plausible for outcome inequality, {{it is hard to}} imagine the same holding true for inequality of opportunities. In fact, a significant fraction of the society – particularly those belonging to the disadvantaged types – would see rising inequality of opportunity as diminishing their chances of economic mobility. By this token, it can be argued that the relationship between inequality of opportunity – unlike the case of <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> such as income or expenditure – on perceptions of life satisfaction should be negative.|$|E

40|$|Presents new {{estimates}} of intergenerational earnings elasticity for Australia. Introduction Economic inequality {{has been the}} subject of debate for centuries, with research and analyses spanning from the code of Hammurabi, to the contributions of Plato and Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, J. J. Rou sseau, J. S. Mill, and many others. Nowadays, inequality is considered as one of the most urgent social problems. The President of the United States and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde have declared that tackling raising inequality is a top priority (Atkinson, 2015). In debates on what can or should be done to address inequality, a key distinction is between equality of outcomes and equality of opportunities. Several political philosophers have discussed this distinction; including John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Amartya Sen, Ronald Dworkin, Richard Arneson, and G. A. Cohen (see Roemer and Trannoy, 2013 for a review). <b>Inequality</b> (<b>of</b> <b>outcomes)</b> has been rising in most countries for around 30 years. Public opinion surve ys suggest a lack of consensus on whether <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> is desirable (Atkinson, 2015). This is probably because economic outcomes are partly a function of effort, talent and preferences for work versus leisure and many believe that some difference s in economic rewards are justifiable (Atkinson, 2015). American citizens have traditionally been willing to tolerate a higher level of inequality than people living in other developed Western countries, because many people at the bottom of the income dist ribution believe that they, or at least their children, will be able to climb the income ladder (Benabou and Ok, 2001). On the other hand, a recent survey suggests that Australians would prefer a greater level of equality, and that the perceived level of i nequality is lower than the actual level of inequality (Doiron, 2012). Regardless of public opinion on its desirability, rising inequality has been linked to numerous instrumental concerns. In particular, there is evidence that rising inequality harms soci al cohesion, economic growth and, equality of opportunity (see OECD, 2015 and its references for a detailed discussion) ...|$|E
40|$|Economists have {{developed}} an extensive literature examining the relationships between <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> and growth, but few research papers have investigated the relationship between inequality of opportunity and growth. That extensive literature finds {{both positive and negative}} effects of inequality on growth, as theory predicts. By contrast, inequality of opportunity should be a drag on growth, as it represents less than full utilization of potential resources. Using recently released data on intergenerational mobility in commuting zones within the United States, this paper investigates the relationship between intergenerational mobility measures (as indicators of inequality of opportunity) and economic growth and finds that local areas with higher intergenerational mobility display faster economic growth over the 2000 – 2013 and 2007 – 2013 periods. This is true when intergenerational mobility is measured in both relative and, especially, absolute terms. In the reverse direction, the paper provides suggestive evidence that faster growth enhances economic opportunity...|$|E

However, we are witnessing inequality in this respect, which is manifested in various ways. What leads to inequality and that this inequality is just something that for decades occupied by economic thought. Defining the concept of inequality depends on the economic interpretation, as well as the ideological and intellectual attitudes of researchers. The differences in the ideological, intellectual and economic attitudes can cause different understandings of inequality, its significance and policies that are necessary to reduce inequality. Analysis of inequality focuses on the concept of <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> or results of economic activity. A complementary concept is reflected in the analysis of inequality of opportunity or conditions. There are strong links between these two concepts.

No strong evidence has been found that increasing income inequality is associated with such negative social outcomes as more crime, more family breakdown, less trust, and greater social immobility, at least in the relatively short term. It is has been repeatedly demonstrated across the country studies that inequality in income is strongly associated with inequalities in other dimensions, including health, and these deep-seated social gradients are in themselves highly undesirable...|$|E

Using numerical solutions we study how the endogenous variables of the model respond to two different interventions in the distribution of opportunities: a mean-preserving spread and a change in the support of the distribution of endowments. The results from the simulation of the model suggest that a higher degree of inequality of opportunities is associated with lower average human capital in the population, a lower fraction of individuals investing in human capital, higher inequality in the distribution of human capital, and higher wage inequality. In other words, the model (based on standard assumptions) does not predict a trade-off between efficiency and equality of opportunity in human capital formation...|$|E

40|$|This paper defends a {{regularly}} paid {{basic income}} as being {{better equipped to}} tackle unfair <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcome.</b> It is argued that the timing of "option-luck" failures in particular, whether they occur early in a lifetime of calculated gambles, and whether they are clustered together {{may lead to a}} form of "brute bad luck," referred to as "cumulative misfortune. " A basic income that is paid on a regular basis provides a way to prevent the emergence of cumulative misfortune, because the basic income at least partially replenishes the individual's ability to take the next calculated gamble. The upshot of this is a nonpaternalistic justification for an unconditional basic income that is paid regularly and is nonmortgageable. This has an important bearing on the debate between those who advocate a one-off endowment at the start of adult life and those who advocate a basic income paid regularly throughout one's life. The paper contends that a regular basic income represents a superior social policy because it prevents the emergence of cumulative misfortune, rather than belatedly attempting to compensate for its effects during our senior years. ...|$|R

40|$|Cell lineage tracing is a {{powerful}} tool for understanding how proliferation and differentiation of individual cells contribute to population behaviour. In the developing enteric nervous system (ENS), enteric neural crest (ENC) cells move and undergo massive population expansion by cell division within self-growing mesenchymal tissue. We show that single ENC cells labelled to follow clonality in the intestine reveal extraordinary and unpredictable variation in number and position of descendant cells, even though ENS development is highly predictable at the population level. We use an agent-based model to simulate ENC colonization and obtain agent lineage tracing data, which we analyse using econometric data analysis tools. In all realizations, a small proportion of identical initial agents accounts for a substantial proportion of the total final agent population. We term these individuals superstars. Their existence is consistent across individual realizations and is robust to changes in model parameters. This <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> is amplified at elevated proliferation rate. The experiments and model suggest that stochastic competition for resources is an important concept when understanding biological processes which feature high levels of cell proliferation.

30|$|The paper {{provides}} a multi-disciplinary {{overview of}} normative and empirical issues concerning labor markets and inequalities in contemporary capitalist democracies. It begins with a discussion of philosophical controversies {{in relation to}} issues of distributive justice. This is followed by a review of peoples' attitudes and opinions, as revealed in surveys and experiments, concerning inequality and fairness. In regard to contributions from economics, the question is discussed whether the relationship between equality/equity and efficiency {{should be seen as}} a trade-off. Finally, the thesis is advanced that most of the inequalities (for example in relation to income, job quality, job and income security) are reflected in but not caused by labor markets; instead, the institutional framework in which the labor market is embedded (labor law, education, training, wage determination, social security etc.) is responsible for the (<b>in)equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes,</b> as are managerial strategies positioning jobs and their holders in firms and other organizations. In his brief conclusion, the author refrains from advocating a normative solution to the issue of distributive fairness; instead, he highlights two axes of controversy that structure the debate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Over {{the last}} three decades, the {{financing}} and provision of care and support services for disabled adults has undergone profound and ongoing change in advanced welfare states. Despite national variations in contemporary care and support systems, common characteristics of the ‘mixed economy of care’ are its complexity, diversity and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Different policy and service delivery models for the delivery of care and support services have been developed, implemented and promoted as ways in which to enhance the governance of these services. In helping to advance research and evaluation into these varied policy and service delivery models, this paper outlines four distinct ideal type models of governance of care and support: uncoordinated; case manager coordinated; dwelling coordinated and user coordinated. In presenting each governance model, their relative strengths and weaknesses are articulated. Each governance model is further illustrated by empirical case studies drawn from research conducted in Australia with adults with an acquired disability. Such models provide a conceptual, analytical and methodological tool for critically thinking about and engaging with policy debate and research into this domain...|$|E
40|$|While making {{location}} decisions, {{the distribution}} of distances (outcomes) among the service recipients (clients) is an important issue. In order {{to comply with the}} minimization of distances as well as with an equal consideration of the clients, mean-equity approaches are commonly used. They quantify the problem in a lucid form of two criteria: the mean outcome representing the overall efficiency and a scalar measure of <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> to represent the equity (fairness) aspects. The mean-equity model is appealing to decision makers and allows a simple trade-off analysis. On the other hand, for typical dispersion indices used as inequality measures, the mean-equity approach may lead to inferior conclusions with respect to the distances minimization. Some inequality measures, however, can be combined with the mean itself into optimization criteria that remain in harmony with both inequality minimization and minimization of distances. In this paper we introduce gen-eral conditions for inequality measures sufficient to provide such an equitable consistency. We verify the conditions for the basic inequality measures thus showing how they can be used in location models not leading to inferior distributions of distances...|$|E

Thus, decentralization may increase inequality if central provision guarantees a minimal provision level, whereas some regions and social groups are disadvantaged under decentralization.
