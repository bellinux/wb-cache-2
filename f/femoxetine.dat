50|$|Structurally related drugs include dapoxetine, duloxetine, edivoxetine, <b>femoxetine,</b> paroxetine, reboxetine, and viloxazine, all {{of which}} act, similarly, as monoamine reuptake inhibitors, and most of which are, again similarly, antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|Although novel ways {{to produce}} these {{compound}} exist, background stems from arecoline chemistry. E.g. Paxil and <b>femoxetine</b> also from this arena of CNS chemicals.

50|$|Addition of the para-fluoro atom {{results in}} a {{different}} compound that is a hybrid of <b>femoxetine</b> & paroxetine named FG 7080, which has a separate patent. According to the patent tables, incorporation of the fluorine atom potentiated the 5-HT affinity considerably.|$|E
50|$|<b>Femoxetine</b> (INN) (tentative {{brand name}} Malexil; {{developmental}} code name FG-4963) {{is a drug}} related to paroxetine that was being developed as an antidepressant by Danish pharmaceutical company Ferrosan in 1975 before acquisition by Novo Nordisk. It acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Development was halted {{to focus attention on}} paroxetine instead, given femoxetine's inability to be administered as a daily pill.|$|E

Its Danish founders included <b>femoxetine</b> and paroxetine inventor Jørgen Buus Lassen and Asger Aamund (da). In 1996, NeuroSearch was listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S under the ticker symbol NEUR.CO.|$|E
40|$|The {{injection}} of fenfluramine (7. 5 mg kg- 1,i. p.) to rats housed at 27 - 28 degrees C {{was associated with}} an elevation of core body temperature which peaked at approximately 1 h post-injection. One h pretreatment with citalopram (20 mg kg- 1, i. p.), chlorimipramine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.), <b>femoxetine</b> (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and fluoxetine (20 mg kg- 1, i. p.) resulted in an attenuated response to fenfluramine. In contrast, Org 6582 (20 mg kg- 1) and zimelidine (20 mg kg- 1) were devoid of an effect on fenfluramine-induced hyperthermia. The response to fenfluramine was was also blocked by i. p. injections of metergoline (0. 2 mg kg- 1), methysergide (5 mg kg- 1) and mianserin (0. 5 mg kg- 1). Rectal temperature was unaltered by both the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) uptake inhibitors and the 5 -HT receptor antagonists. The IC 50 values (nM) for in vitro inhibition of [3 H]- 5 -HT uptake into rat hypothalamic synaptosomes were for citalopram 2. 4, chlorimipramine 8. 8, <b>femoxetine</b> 14, fluoxetine 16, Org 6582 75 and zimelidine 250. The {{injection of}} all six compounds (20 mg kg- 1, i. p.) 1 h before death was associated with an inhibition of [3 H]- 5 -HT uptake into rat hypothalamic synaptosomes which ranged from 47. 2 % for chlorimipramine to 83. 3 % for citalopram. Rat hypothalamic 5 -HT levels were decreased by approximately 50 % 3 h after the injection of fenfluramine (15 mg kg- 1, i. p.). This effect was blocked by a 1 h pretreatment with fluoxetine, Org 6582 and zimelidine (all 20 mg kg- 1, i. p.). Ki values for displacement of specifically bound [3 H]- 5 -HT (1 nM) to rat hypothalamic membranes were for metergoline 26 nM, methysergide 1. 1 microM, mianserin 3. 6 microM, chlorimipramine 9. 2 microM and fluoxetine 32. 7 microM. Values for citalopram, <b>femoxetine,</b> Org 6582 and zimelidine were in excess of 65. 4 microM. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{solution}} {{structures of}} (3 R, 4 S) - and (3 S, 4 R) - 4 -(4 -fluorophenyl) - 3 -hy-droxylmethyl- 1 -methylpiperidine, which are intermediates in {{the synthesis of}} the two pharmaceuticals paroxetine and <b>femoxetine,</b> were studied by vibrational circular di-chroism (VCD) spectroscopy. In addition, six derivatives with different substituents attached to the C 3 atom were prepared and their VCD and absorption spectra discussed {{with the aid of}} ab initio simulations. The VCD spectra were found {{to be sensitive to the}} geometry changes. In addition, a subtle variation caused by intermolecular aggregation was apparent in the spectra. The VCD technique can be applied for structural analysis of chiral pharmaceuticals in solutions. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers (Biospec...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular efflux pumps {{have been}} largely the {{research}} focus in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. However, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (DPR), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (ADPR) phenyl-piperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the DPR L-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines NNC 20 - 4962 (isomer of <b>femoxetine)</b> and NNC 20 - 7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a pos-sible general isomeric structure–activity relationship. These compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. Moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neuro-tropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. This may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and thera-peutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage {{would be in the}} lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems.

40|$|Narcolepsy is {{a chronic}} sleep {{disorder}} characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, {{with or without}} cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations, with an estimated prevalence of 0. 02 to 0. 05 % worldwide. The goal of managing narcolepsy is to keep patients as alert as possible during daytime hours and to minimise the incidence of cataplexy. A combination of nonpharmacological (lifestyle and behavioural modifications) and pharmacological treatments {{may be used to}} alleviate excessive daytime sleepiness. Stimulants such as amphetamines and methylphenidate have been the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, although a range of different agents have been used over several decades. Modafinil, a benzohydrylsulfinyl-acetamide derivative, has demonstrated good efficacy in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness, but has limited anticataplectic effects. In clinical studies modafinil 200 to 400 mg/day significantly improved subjective and objective measures of sleepiness and alertness compared with placebo. A long term study of up to 10 years' duration showed modafinil to have good to excellent efficacy in 64 % of patients. Use of modafinil {{does not appear to be}} associated with the development of tolerance or dependence, and it is considered to have limited potential for abuse. Modafinil is generally well tolerated with few adverse effects, the most common being headache, nausea, nervousness and anxiety. It may be coadministered with drugs for treating cataplexy. The efficacy and the cost effectiveness of modafinil in the treatment of narcolepsy have not been compared with other available agents. Conclusions: Modafinil provides a useful alternative to traditional stimulants for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. It is well tolerated, may be taken in combination with medications for cataplexy, and shows long term efficacy without development of tolerance.
