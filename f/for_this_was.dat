5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The All Blacks were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and had studied the All Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after the All Blacks, and hence preventing the All Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the All Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E

5|$|Around mid-September 1943, the two-man Bf 110 {{crew was}} {{augmented}} {{by a third}} member, {{sometimes referred to as}} Bordmechaniker (air mechanic) or Bordschütze (air gunner). The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that the decline of the Himmelbett procedure, the introduction of the broadcast procedure Zahme Sau, and the growing threat of RAF intruder night fighter operations, had necessitated the need for another pair of watchful eyes to the rear. Unteroffizier Wilhelm Gänsler, who had already contributed to 17 claims made by Hauptmann Ludwig Becker, was Schnaufer's new lookout. With Handtke and Gänsler as his crew, Schnaufer claimed his 26th aerial victory on 23 September 1943 over a No. 218 Squadron Stirling during a Wilde Sau intercept mission.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E
5|$|Bagramyan was {{instrumental}} in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the Battle of Moscow, and <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups: the Southern, the Southwestern and Bryansk Fronts. In March 1942, he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on April 8, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front. On 12 May 1942, armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkiv but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo Salient, a region that German forces were near closing.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.|$|E

5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
5|$|Land on the Boboli hill at {{the rear}} of the palazzo was {{acquired}} in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the support}} that Zbor {{received}} in Serbia came {{from members of the}} urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic Serbs, though some Croats and Slovenes also joined. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's authoritarianism and his lack of popularity and political power in Serbia. Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism. The limited amount of support received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that right-wing politics were associated with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (Volksdeutsche) minority in Vojvodina that had been exposed to Nazi propaganda since 1933.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Fritz Müller. When a distasteful animal comes {{to resemble a}} more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the first}} uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, to learn that the black and yellow colours mean a stinging insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of them also. But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.|$|E
5|$|On 4 December, Stabæk Fotball {{stated that}} {{they were willing to}} move their training, Norwegian Football Cup and UEFA matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a {{compromise}} to free up more available time in the arena. This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup. In mid-December, Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration of the right to lease the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt. A preliminary injunction <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> granted by Asker and Bærum District Court.|$|E

On April 22, 1946, however, before these could be enacted, Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that at the Potsdam conference it was discovered that the United States had better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of Defence. One reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part of the reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that the sound program used in Evermore was {{not up to the}} technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations.
