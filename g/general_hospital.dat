40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "There has been much debate about specialty hospitals [...] short-term acute care hospitals with physician owners or investors that primarily treat patients who have specific medical conditions or need surgical procedures [...] and the competitive effects they may have on <b>general</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Advocates of specialty hospitals contend that competition from these physician-owned facilities can prompt <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> to implement efficiency, quality, and amenity improvements, thus favorably affecting the overall health care delivery system. Critics of specialty hospitals are concerned that <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> may respond to such competition by making changes that do not necessarily increase efficiency or benefit patients or communities, for example, by adding services already available in the community. The appropriateness of physicians' financial interests in specialty hospitals has also been questioned.

40|$|Background: In many {{developing}} countries, programmes for ‘diseases of social importance’, such as tuberculosis (TB), {{have traditionally been}} organised as vertical services. In most of China, <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> are required to report and refer suspected TB cases to the TB programme for standardised diagnosis and treatment. <b>General</b> <b>hospitals</b> are the major contacts of health services for the TB patients. Despite the implementation of public public/private mix, directly observed treatment, short-course, TB reporting and referral still remain a challenge. Objective: This study aims to identify barriers to the collaboration between the TB programme and <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> in China. Design: This is a qualitative study conducted in two purposefully selected counties in China: one in Zhejiang, a more affluent eastern province, and another in Guangxi, a poorer southwest province. Sixteen in-depth interviews were conducted and triangulated with document review and field notes. An open systems perspec-tive, which views organisations as social systems, was adopted. Results: The most perceived problem appeared to be untimely reporting and referral associated with non-standardised prescriptions and hospitalisation by the <b>general</b> <b>hospitals.</b> These problems {{could be due to}} the financial incentives of the <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> poor supervision from the TB programme to <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> and lack of technical support from the TB programme to the <b>general</b> <b>hospitals.</b> However, contextual factors...|$|R
40|$|About {{one-third of}} the general {{practices}} in the Oxfordshire Health District have access to beds in community hospitals as well as district <b>general</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Hospital Activity Analysis data were {{used to calculate the}} average number of hospital beds occupied daily by patients registered with each general practice in the district. Practices with and without access to community hospitals were compared to determine whether such access was associated with a reduction in the use of beds in general medical, geriatric, and other specialties, and an increase in overall utilisation rates. The rate of use of general medical and geriatric beds in district <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> by practice populations with access to community hospitals was about half that of populations without such access. Utilisation rates overall, combining the use of beds in both district <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> and community hospitals, were a little higher in populations with access to both community <b>hospitals</b> and district <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> than in those with access to district <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> only...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} populations {{with access to}} <b>general</b> {{practitioner}} <b>hospitals</b> (GP <b>hospitals)</b> utilise <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> less than populations without such access. DESIGN: Observational study comparing the total rates of admissions and of occupied bed days in <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> between populations with and without access to GP hospitals. Comparisons were also made separately for diagnoses commonly encountered in GP <b>hospitals.</b> SETTING: Two <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> serving the population of Finnmark county in north Norway. PATIENTS: 35, 435 admissions based on five years' routine recordings from the two hospitals. MAIN RESULTS: The total rate of admission to <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> was lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central municipalities without this kind of institution, 26 % and 28 % lower {{for men and women}} respectively. The corresponding differences were 38 % and 52 %, when analysed for occupied bed days. The differences were most pronounced for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals, and for patients with stroke and fractures, who are regularly transferred from <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> to GP hospitals for longer term follow up care. CONCLUSION: GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In the Republic of Serbia the {{activity}} of <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> has not been sufficiently evaluated. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate, by analyzing the basic indicators of <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> condition and functioning, the network, utilization and efficacy of <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> for further improvement of their organization and work. Methods. The paper is a part of a retrospective-prospective analysis of hospital healthcare services which we performed in 2011. The research involved all 40 <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Serbia evaluated as a <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> system. We selected seven basic indicators of hospitals condition and functioning that we followed-up in the period 2000 - 2009. As the data source we used the Reports of the Office for Hospital Stationary Treatment of <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> and the Report of the Republican Institution for Statistics entitled Vital Events in the Republic of Serbia. Numerical data were analyzed using the methods of descriptive statistics and the program Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and SPSS for Windows. Statistical significance indicators of differences were determined by Student’s t-test. Results. In <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> during the studied years, the number of beds decreased by 16. 5 % (pt= 0. 057). The number of discharged patients was increased by 11. 8 % (pt= 0. 035). The number of hospitalization days was reduced by 11. 2 % (pt= 0. 038). The average length of treatment was reduced by 1. 9 days (pt= 0. 074). The average daily bed occupancy was increased by 4 % (pt= 0. 020). The utilization of beds was increased by 4. 5 % (pt= 0. 019). Throughput capacity of beds increased by 8. 5 patients per bed or by 27. 8 % (pt= 0. 091). Conclusion. The most significant indicators of the utilization and efficacy of <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> were improved. Nevertheless, European and domestic guidelines were achieved only in the average length of treatment...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This study {{pursued the}} way for the {{effective}} application of the differentiated charge (Nursing grading system) by the nursing manpower which is performed for the nursing service quality improvement to the in-patients in Korea and the minimum employment problem solution of nurses. Methods. For this matter, the status of the nursing grade for 1, 452 hospitals (44 high class <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> 259 <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> 265 hospitals, 59 oriental medicine hospitals and 825 recuperation hospitals) was identified which were registered in the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in March 2011 status quo. Results. In the most nursing grade by the kind of medical institutions, 70. 5 % of the nurses were third-graded in upper <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> 38. 1 % were sixth graded in <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> 62. 7 % were seventh-graded in oriental medicine hospitals and 40. 4 % were first-graded in recuperation hospitals. In the nursing grade by the scale of hospitals (in {{terms of the number of}} beds), there was a sig-nificant difference in <b>general</b> <b>hospitals,</b> but there was no significant difference between oriental medicine hospitals and recuperation hospitals. In the nursing grade by the location of hospitals and the foundation type of hospitals, there was a significant difference between <b>general</b> <b>hospitals</b> and re-cuperation hospitals. Conclusion. For the effectiveness of applying differentiated nursing fees by the number of nurses, it seems necessary to consider adjusting the present differentiated inpatient-charge system for the bet-ter so that small and medium-sized hospitals may induce more nurses...|$|R
