25|$|A second <b>engine</b> <b>shaft</b> (known as the Lucy <b>Engine</b> <b>Shaft)</b> {{was begun}} in 1871 from the Lucy Tongue Level, and in 1874 work {{began on the}} 20Fathom Level (also known as No.1Level). A {{hydraulic}} winding engine and a water pump were installed {{at the top of}} the shaft in 1875. Over time this shaft was deepened to the 40Fathom Level (or No.2Level), and in 1890 to the 60Fathom Level. This shaft was sunk in the hard footwall rock west of the vein, and proved to be very hard work. Compressed air rock drills and dynamite were used for the first time at the mine. Before this, all shot holes had been bored by hand and charged with gunpowder. The 40Fathom Level was the first to encounter the Middle Ore Shoot, where the most solid galena ever seen in the Greenside Vein was found, though at greater depths this ore shoot was variable in its quality.|$|E
25|$|The mine {{workings}} featured the large <b>Engine</b> <b>Shaft</b> with winding and pumping gear {{powered by a}} 9.8 m overshot wheel, various other shafts and adits, a spalling floor, a crushing mill powered by a second water-wheel, an inclined tramways and two precipitation tanks. There are remains of buildings including a smithy, office, two-storey accommodation block, dry store & miners' changing house and explosives store.|$|E
25|$|For two-shaft designs, an {{accessory}} drive {{will be taken}} from the high-pressure shaft, i.e. the outer and shorter of the two concentric shafts. This shaft comes up to speed more quickly when the engine is started. The drive and accessory gearboxes may also be split in two, one driven from each <b>engine</b> <b>shaft,</b> so as to distribute their loads. The engine-critical systems, including the starter drive, are arranged on the high-pressure shaft, with aircraft systems on the low-pressure shaft. The high-pressure shaft also rotates faster than the low-pressure shaft, which may influence the distribution of accessories.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the power}} station began in 1890. The narrow, winding Lucy Tongue Level was made ready for {{locomotive}} working during 1892, and {{the sinking of the}} new shaft began in the same year. The locomotive began work in 1893 and was able to haul all the mineâ€™s output, replacing six horses. Before this, much of the output had been taken up to the Low Level because of limited haulage capacity in the Lucy Level, but this now ceased and ore handling facilities {{at the entrance to the}} Low Level were no longer needed. The Low Level <b>engine</b> <b>shaft</b> was no longer needed, and the winding engine was removed.|$|E
25|$|LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055, an Ilyushin Il-62M, on 9 May 1987. According to the Polish investigatory commission, {{the cause}} of the crash was the {{disintegration}} of an <b>engine</b> <b>shaft</b> due to faulty bearings inside engine No. 2, which seized, causing extensive heat. This in turn caused the consequent damage to engine No. 1, rapid decompression of the fuselage, and a fire in the cargo hold, as well as the loss of elevator controls and progressive electrical failures. Zygmunt Pawlaczyk decided to return to Warsaw Okecie Airport using only trim tabs to control the flight of the aircraft. He lost his struggle to land about 5km from the runway in the Kabacki Forest. All 172 passengers and 11 crew members perished.|$|E

2500|$|When Captain Borlase {{arrived as}} the chief agent (mine manager) in 1889 {{it was clear that}} the <b>engine</b> <b>shaft</b> in the Lucy Level had been sunk too far to the south to work the long stretch of good ore that had been found near its {{northern}} end. Also, having been sunk into the footwall, longer and longer cross-cuts were needed to reach the vein from it. Another problem was that limited water resources would place limits on the winding and pumping capacities of the hydraulic engines as the mine deepened. Borlase proposed bold solutions to both problems. First he proposed building a hydroelectric power station further up the Glenridding valley, where water supply was abundant, but could not easily be used in the mine. Electricity could then be used for pumps and winding engines as well as for powering a locomotive. The electric winders and locomotive were to be the first ones installed in a metalliferous mine in Britain. Borlase also proposed a new <b>engine</b> <b>shaft</b> [...] north of the existing shaft, to be sunk initially in the hanging wall, from an eastern extension to Warsop's Crosscut. This (the third shaft at the mine) became known as Smith's Shaft, in honour of Robert Bradshaw Smith, one of the directors and the principal shareholder. Smith's Shaft is about [...] from the entrance to the Lucy Tongue Level.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade Smith's Shaft was sunk to the 40Fathom Level, the 60Fathom Level, and in 1899 to the 75Fathom Level. In 1896 it was fitted with cages and an {{electric}} winding engine, and the old Lucy <b>Engine</b> <b>Shaft</b> was abandoned in 1899. By 1902 all ore production from above the Lucy Level had ceased. In 1904 Smith's Shaft was extended to the 90Fathom Level which became the major working level for many years. A small patch of ore above {{the north end of}} the Lucy Tongue Level was opened up in the 1890s, known as the Alma Workings. [...] Gelignite was introduced in the 1890s, replacing both blasting gelatine and gunpowder. The first carbide lamps were introduced at Greenside from 1909 onwards; before then all work had been done by candlelight.|$|E
2500|$|There are 25 shaftheads {{visible at}} Eylesbarrow, {{most of which}} are on a single curved {{alignment}} along the line of the main lode, which is roughly followed by part of the main track that runs through the mine.

Some of them (for instance New <b>Engine</b> <b>Shaft,</b> shown here) have the original masonry collar still visible.

2500|$|The first mine shaft at Greenside was sunk in 185152 to give {{access to}} ore beneath the Low Level. This {{was known as}} the <b>Engine</b> <b>Shaft</b> (or Willie Shaft) and was sunk from a point [...] north of where the level had first reached the vein. Initially the shaft was sunk [...] and a new 36Fathom Level was driven from the bottom. Two {{hydraulic}} engines were installed {{at the top of the}} shaft, one for winding and one for pumping out water. The water power for running these engines came from a reservoir created in the High Horse Level. That level had been driven northwards in an unsuccessful search for ore, and its forehead was not far from the southern end of the Glencoyne Level, though about [...] lower. The two levels were connected, the floor of the Glencoyne Level was regraded so water would run in, not out, and a small stream diverted into the mouth of the level. A dam was built across the High Horse Level, and pipes ran down to the hydraulic engines. The shaft was extended to the 48Fathom Level in 186566, though that level had been started in 1858 from a sump, sunk on the vein from the 36Fathom Level. Eventually, in 1880, the shaft was sunk a further [...] to connect with the Lucy Level.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1850s and 1860s some ore {{was still}} being won from the old levels {{in the top of}} the mountain, but the main ore-producing stopes were above and below the High and Low Levels. By the end of the 1850s the Low Level had been driven [...] north of the <b>Engine</b> <b>Shaft.</b> Below it, the 36Fathom Level was being {{extended}} in both directions. Although ore was at first very patchy in that level, stopes had been opened above it in both headings by 1858, and also a sump had gone down to 48fathoms, where a new level was being driven. A major rock fall occurred in 1862 (or 1865), known as [...] "The Big Crush." [...] Miners had cut away two parallel strings of lead ore above the High Horse Level, leaving an unsupported pendant of rock between them. This rock, [...] in length and depth, and [...] thick, fell, crushing its way down the stope to the level below, and removing the floor of Gilgower's Level above. Fortunately this happened one Sunday, when no one was in the mine. In 1870 the new Lucy Tongue Level was connected to the south end of the 48Fathom Level, by sinking a sump from above and working a rise from below. Already the new level had discovered some rich ore at the south end of the vein, and in the following years it was steadily driven north.|$|E
