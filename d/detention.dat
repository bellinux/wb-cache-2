5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration <b>detention</b> {{is a form of}} administrative <b>detention,</b> or <b>detention</b> imposed by the executive branch of government. <b>Detention</b> generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial <b>detention,</b> such as <b>detention</b> in order to effect an arrest, or <b>detention</b> for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, <b>detention</b> of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E
5|$|An {{order for}} review of <b>detention</b> directs someone holding {{a person in}} <b>detention</b> to produce the detainee before the High Court so that the {{legality}} of the <b>detention</b> can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of <b>detention</b> may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her <b>detention</b> rendered the <b>detention</b> unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that <b>detention</b> that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the <b>detention</b> fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the <b>detention</b> is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the <b>detention,</b> not the lawfulness of the <b>detention</b> itself.|$|E

5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' <b>detention</b> was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the <b>detention</b> was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the <b>detention</b> order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their <b>detention</b> on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive <b>detention,</b> subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive <b>detention</b> were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive <b>detention,</b> the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any <b>detention</b> for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of <b>detention,</b> and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} {{to apply to the}} High Court challenging the legality of their <b>detention.</b> The application is for an order for review of <b>detention,</b> which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the <b>detention</b> is lawful.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA, the President must be satisfied that such <b>detention</b> {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the <b>detention.</b> The <b>detention</b> order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a <b>detention</b> order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and <b>detention</b> into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original <b>detention</b> order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the <b>detention</b> order itself.|$|E

40|$|In the United States alone, {{as many as}} {{six million}} {{children}} and adolescents suffer from an invisible illness called depression. This study examined the relationship between level of depression and student misbehavior for 49 students in grades 3 - 6 in a small, Midwest elementary school. Students were given a self-rated test, the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI), to test for level of depression. ii This study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of <b>detentions</b> received by elementary students who experienced a high level of depression, as indicated by the T-score on the CDI, as compared to those students who experienced a lower level of depression. An unexpected factor in these results was the low number of <b>detentions</b> received overall by the 49 students. Only 49 total <b>detentions</b> were recorded for the 49 students, with 28 of the grades 3 - 6 students receiving zero <b>detentions.</b> The remaining 21 students received <b>detentions</b> in the range from 1 to 7 over a five-month period.

5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary <b>detention.</b> Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary <b>detention.</b> Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal <b>detention,</b> “black jails”, short-term administrative <b>detention,</b> and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act.

He or she is to be served {{with a copy of}} the <b>detention</b> order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the <b>detention</b> order was made.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of <b>detention</b> is a remedy for {{establishing}} the legality of <b>detention,</b> {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the <b>detention</b> itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not {{if he or she is}} merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{order of}} the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an {{individual}} be detained {{for up to two}} years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time. The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a <b>detention</b> order, but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the <b>detention</b> order. <b>Detention</b> orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister. If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release. The requirement for regular reviews of <b>detention</b> orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens. When a <b>detention</b> order is extended, the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension.|$|E
