5|$|Samarium {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, {{from which}} he calls {{children}} to verbally abuse {{as a substitute for}} his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat.|$|E

25|$|In his {{philosophical}} work, Grayling connected {{solutions to}} the problem of scepticism in epistemology with the questions about assertibility and the problem of meaning in the philosophy of language and logic. A principal theme in his work is that considerations of metaphysics, which relate to what exists, <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> separate from the two connected questions of the relation of thought to its objects in the variety of domains over which thought ranges, and the mastery of discourses about those domains, where a justificationist approach is required.|$|E
25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a globule in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in mind that this is an optical effect, and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E
25|$|The steam turbine-driven {{generators}} have {{auxiliary systems}} {{enabling them to}} work satisfactorily and safely. The steam turbine generator, being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft {{has a number of}} bearings. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like Babbitt metal. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated.|$|E

25|$|One key {{advance in}} the Kestrel {{was the use of}} a {{pressurised}} cooling system. Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of coolant temperature and volume, the coolant <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> below boiling point and an increasing amount of fluid has to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to cool it. The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby not only preventing the decrease in cooling performance with altitude, but in fact increasing the boiling point even on the ground. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150°C.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{helps the}} uterus to {{contract}} quickly and the contractions {{to last for}} longer. It is the first line treatment for PPH when its cause is the uterus not contracting well. A combination of syntocinon and ergometrine is commonly used as part of active management of the third stage of labour. This is called syntometrine. Syntocinon alone lowers the risk of PPH. Based on limited research available {{it is unclear whether}} syntocinon or syntometrine is most effective in preventing PPH but adverse effects are worse with syntometrine making syntocinon a more attractive option. Ergometrine also <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> cool and in a dark place so that it is safe to use. It does reduce the risk of PPH by improving the tone of the uterus when compared with no treatment however it has to be used with caution due to its effect raising blood pressure and causing worse after pains.|$|E

2500|$|Some materials, notably {{high-strength}} steels, aluminium, and titanium alloys, {{are susceptible}} to hydrogen embrittlement. If the electrodes used for welding contain traces of moisture, the water decomposes {{in the heat of}} the arc and the liberated hydrogen enters the lattice of the material, causing its brittleness. Stick electrodes for such materials, with special low-hydrogen coating, are delivered in sealed moisture-proof packaging.

2500|$|Researchers {{note that}} most current mustang herds live in arid areas which cattle cannot fully utilize {{due to the}} lack of water sources. Horses are adapted by {{evolution}} to inhabit an ecological niche characterized by poor quality vegetation. They cover vast distances to find food and water. [...] they may range nine times as far from water sources as cattle, traveling as much as 50 miles a day. [...] In addition, horses are [...] "hindgut fermenters", meaning that they digest nutrients by means of the cecum rather than by a multi-chambered stomach. While this means that they extract less energy from a given amount of forage, it also means that they can digest food faster and make up the difference in efficiency by increasing their consumption rate. In practical effect, by eating greater quantities, horses can obtain adequate nutrition from poorer forage than can ruminants such as cattle, surviving in areas where cattle will starve. [...] In addition to consuming more fodder than cattle, horses' incisors allow them to graze plants much closer to the ground. For these reasons, the number of horses <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> low enough to not exceed the carrying capacity of a given area.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "nitrox" [...] was {{originally}} {{used to refer}} to the breathing gas in a seafloor habitat where the oxygen <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> to a lower fraction than in air to avoid long term oxygen toxicity problems. It was later used by Dr Morgan Wells of NOAA for mixtures with an oxygen fraction higher than air, and has become a generic term for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen with any oxygen fraction, and in the context of recreational and technical diving, now usually refers to a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with more than 21% oxygen. [...] "Enriched Air Nitrox" [...] or [...] "EAN", and [...] "Oxygen Enriched Air" [...] are used to emphasize richer than air mixtures. In [...] "EANx", the [...] "x" [...] {{was originally}} the x of nitrox, but has come to indicate the percentage of oxygen in the mix and is replaced by a number when the percentage is known; for example a 40% oxygen mix is called EAN40. The two most popular blends are EAN32 and EAN36, developed by NOAA for scientific diving, and also named Nitrox I and Nitrox II, respectively, or Nitrox68/32 and Nitrox64/36. These two mixtures were first utilized to the depth and oxygen limits for scientific diving designated by NOAA at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682), {{founded by}} Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, {{established}} the religious freedom in their colonies in direct {{opposition to the}} theocratic government which Separatist Congregationalists (Pilgrim Fathers) and Puritans had enforced in Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628). Having fled religious persecution themselves in England, the leaders of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colony restricted franchise to members of their church only, rigorously enforced [...] their own interpretation of theological law and banished [...] freethinkers such as Roger Williams, who was actually chased out of Salem., as well as banning Quakers and Anabaptists. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and Jews also had full citizenship and free exercise of their faiths. Williams, Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that democracy and freedom of conscience were the will of God. Williams gave the most profound theological reason: As faith is the free gift of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced upon a person. Therefore, strict {{separation of church and}} state <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept.</b> Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States. The inseparable connection of democracy, freedom of religion, and the other forms of freedom became the political and legal basis of the new nation.
