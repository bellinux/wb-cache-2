500|$|Throughout 2010, the {{presence}} of dubstep in the pop charts was notable, with [...] "I Need Air" [...] by Magnetic Man reaching number 10 in the UK singles chart. This presented {{a turning point in}} the popularity of mainstream dubstep amongst UK listeners as it was placed on rotation on BBC Radio 1. [...] "Katy On a Mission" [...] by Katy B (produced by Benga) followed, debuting at number 5 in the UK singles chart, and stayed in the top 10 for five more weeks. Also in 2010, American producer Skrillex achieved moderate commercial success in North America with a dubstep-influenced sound. By 2011 his EP Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites had peaked at number three on the U.S.Billboard Dance/Electronic album charts. In February 2011, Chase & Status's second album No More Idols reached No. 2 in the UK album chart. On 1 May 2011, Nero's third single [...] "Guilt" [...] from their album reached number 8 in the Official UK Singles Chart. DJ Fresh and Nero both had number one singles in 2011 with [...] "Louder" [...] and [...] "Promises". [...] Strong baselines imported from dubstep continued in popular music with the Taylor Swift song <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>You</b> Were Trouble, which made number 1 on Billboard's U.S. Mainstream Top 40 chart.|$|E
500|$|Living {{near the}} Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free {{climbing}} routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals {{was the most}} difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it [...] "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen... I had tried leading it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge." [...] It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, [...] "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." [...] That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, [...] "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably [...] "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and [...] "no man was climbing significantly better" [...] than her.|$|E

2500|$|On December 22, 2016, Seger {{performed}} [...] "Heartache Tonight" [...] as the Kennedy Center {{honored the}} Eagles. A few weeks later, on January 18, 2017, Seger gave away the single [...] "Glenn Song" [...] on his website {{as a tribute}} marking the one year death of Eagles founding member Glenn Frey, with whom Seger was close friends. Starting on August 24, 2017, Seger embarked on a 32-city Runaway Train tour that was originally scheduled to conclude on November 17, 2017 in Chicago. This tour included a show on September 22, 2017 at The Palace of Auburn Hills (Michigan), which was the last event {{to be held at}} that venue. The same day, Seger announced his new studio album, <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>You</b> When, and released [...] "Busload of Faith", a cover of the Lou Reed song from the 1989 album New York, as the first single taken from the album. <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>You</b> When is scheduled for release on November 17, 2017, which would have marked the last day of Seger's Runaway Train tour. However, due to [...] "an urgent medical issue with his vertebrae," [...] all concert dates starting September 30 had to be postponed. Of the 32 scheduled tour dates, Seger could complete 13 and had to postpone 19.|$|E
2500|$|In 216, after Cao Cao was conferred {{the title}} of a vassal king – King of Wei (魏王) – by Emperor Xian, he summoned Sima Fang to meet him in Ye (鄴; the capital of his vassal kingdom, in present-day Handan, Hebei). He joked with Sima Fang, [...] "Do you think the Cao Cao of today can still be a Commandant of the North District?" [...] Sima Fang replied, [...] "When I {{recommended}} Your Highness to assume that appointment, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> were capable of performing your duties well."

2500|$|Jeremiah 1:5 states that, [...] "Before I formed {{you in the}} womb, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you,</b> {{before you}} were born, I set you apart; I {{appointed}} you as a prophet to the nations." [...] For some, this verse, while talking specifically about Jeremiah, {{is an indication that}} God is aware of the identity of [...] "developing unborn human beings even before they enter the womb", or that for everyone, God has a plan that abortion might be seen as frustrating. Others say that this interpretation is incorrect, and that the verse is not related to personhood or abortion, as Jeremiah is asserting his prophetic status as distinct and special.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a game in}} 1982, Frank Layden, {{then head}} coach of the Utah Jazz, had seen enough of his team's poor {{performance}} and wanted an early exit. Layden verbally abused Strom so he could get ejected from the game. Strom knew {{what he was trying to}} do, and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, [...] "I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay out here and watch this shit, so do you". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, [...] "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring to the fact that the Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1.
