40|$|The {{influence}} of primary compounds (energy, protein, minerals, and vitamins) in animal nutrition and foraging behavior {{has been studied}} for years. The roles of secondary compounds (terpenes, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds) are equally important, yet they have been ignored until recently. Where secondary compounds were once considered toxic by-products of plant metabolism, we now know they are actively involved in plant and animal behavior, health, and productivity. Though often appreciated historically for their negative impacts on food intake and animal production, we are becoming increasingly aware of their beneficial roles in the health of plants, animals, and humans. When animals can ingest an array of plants that contain different kinds and amounts of secondary compounds, they can mix different foods in their diet to better use both primary and secondary compounds, enhancing their health and production, {{as well as economic}} and ecological characteristics of landscapes. Endophyte-infected tall fescue contains the alkaloids perlolidine, perloline, ergotamine, and ergovaline, which are all steroidal or protein-like in nature. Tannins and saponins have a high affinity for binding proteins and lipids in the gastro-intestinal tract of animals, and facilitating their excretion from the body. These findings suggest animals may increase their use of forages with alkaloids when they are also provided forages that contain tannins or saponins. The sequence in which forages with different secondary compounds are ingested may influence any potential interactions because different compounds have different residence times in the gastrointestinal tract. I tested the hypothesis that cattle and sheep foraging behavior is influenced by eating different combinations of forages containing secondary compounds in different sequences. In pen and pasture trials, I showed that 1) cattle grazing pastures of endophyte-infected tall fescue (TF) grazed more often on TF when first allowed to graze legumes containing either tannins or saponins, and they grazed TF much more when they first grazed legumes as opposed to the reverse sequence; 2) sheep fed basal diets high in the alkaloid <b>ergotamine</b> d <b>tartrate</b> (EDT) ate more when supplemented with food containing either tannins or saponins, but in contrast to the trials on pasture with cattle, their behavior was not dramatically influenced by sequence; 3) cattle fed fresh cut endophyte-infected tall fescue were not influenced by the addition of tannin to their drinking water, as tannins limited both water and forage intake; 4) sheep fed food containing EDT ate more when supplemented with food containing tannins or when given a choice of foods containing tannins or saponins, than sheep supplemented with food containing saponins or no additional secondary compound. Results from these studies suggest that secondary compounds interact with one another to influence foraging behavior, and that sequence of food ingestion can be influential when animals graze on pastures...|$|R

5000|$|Authorities found {{less than}} six ounces of <b>ergotamine</b> <b>tartrate</b> during the arrest. However, they claim they {{normally}} produced up to a kilogram of LSD every five weeks.

Although the DEA claims this would be worth $40 million on the street Pickard did not sell anywhere near the [...] "street" [...] or retail level. Government informant Skinner testified Petaluma Al and the largest wholesale customers of Pickard paid 29.75¢ (or a little under 30¢) per 100 µg dose, which would put the cost at around $2.97 million for a kilogram of LSD.|$|E
5000|$|The {{availability}} of LSD had been drastically {{reduced by the}} late 1970s due {{to a combination of}} governmental controls and law enforcement. The supply of constituent chemicals including lysergic acid, which was used for production of LSD in the 1960s, and <b>ergotamine</b> <b>tartrate,</b> which was used for production in the 1970s, were placed under tight surveillance and government funding for LSD research was almost completely eliminated. These efforts were augmented by a series of major busts in England and Europe. One of the most famous was [...] "Operation Julie" [...] in Britain in 1978, named after the first name of the female drug squad officer involved; it broke up one of the largest LSD manufacturing and distribution operations in the world at that time, headed by chemist Richard Kemp.

50|$|The {{intravenous}} LD50 {{of the new}} alkaloid {{was approximately}} 150mg/kg for mice and 0.75 mg/kg for rabbits/ Before death, the mice showed periodic convulsions of a clonic type, erection of the hairs and excitability. At doses of 50-100mg/kg it produced only this peculiar symptomatology: the mice stood upright and pressed on each other's noses and chattered their teeth. In rabbits, and injection into the ear vein in doses of 0.1-1mg/kg produced dilatation of the pupil, excitability or convulsions of a clinic type. The ears became pale and cold with intense vasoconstriction. The toxicity of the alkaloid to rabbits seemed to depend on its power of raising the body-temperature in this species. In rabbits the similarity between {{the effects of the}} new alkaloid and ergometrine were particularly striking, but ergometrine was less toxic to rabbits (the approximate intravenous LD50 of ergometrine was 3.5mg/kg).D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide induced, in low concentrations (minimum active concentration 0.1-1µg/ml), a contracture in the isolated uterus of the virgen guinea pig. There was a satisfactory dose/response relationship. This contracture was very similar to that produced by ergmetrine maleate, which, however, was 1-2 times more potent.On the rabbit uterus in situ both alkaloids produced a prompt contraction and increased rhythmic activity of the uterus. For ergometrine the minimum active dose by intravenous route was 0.1-0.3 mg/kg and for the new alkaloid 0.2-0.5mg/kgm. The actions of both alkaloids lasted some minutes, and owing to the favourable circumstance that the interference between the effects of the two alkaloids was negligible, it was possible to test them on the same preparation. Ergometrine was 1-2 times more potent than the new alkaloid. On the isolated seminal vesicles of the guinea pig, the new alkaloid was approximately 200 times less potent than <b>ergotamine</b> <b>tartrate</b> as an adrenergic blocking drug. Rabbits anaethetized with urethane supported doses of D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide which would have killed unanaesthetized animals. Rapid intravenous injections of small doses (0.1-0.2mg/kg) of the new alkaloid caused an evanescent decrease or a small increase of blood pressure; with higher doses (0.3/0.5mg/kg and more) the blood pressure increased moderately without showing any dose/response relationship. Ergometrine maleate seemed to be less active on bloodpressure, and there was no significant change of blood pressure with 0.3-0.5 mg/kg.The new alkaloid was without effect, when given in small doses, on the blood pressure of cats anaethetized with chloralose. Higher intravenous doses (0.1-0.3mg/kg) caused a sustained hypotension of long duration and a moderate decrease of heart-rate. The respiration of rabbits and cats was depressed by small doses of the new alkaloid; cats seemed to be less resistant than rabbits. In cats, 0.01mg/kg of the new alkaloid caused broncho-constriction and contractions of the nictitating membrane of long duration. The new alkaloid have no action on isolated rabbit auricles at doses up to 100µg/ml. In summing up, the new naturally occurring alkaloid D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide has powerful ergometrine-like oxytocic action and weak ergotamine-like adrenergic blocking actions. It must be included, on the basis of pharmacological evidence, in the ergometrine group of ergot alkaloids. Ergometrine, however, is less toxic and more active than the new alkaloid. Results suggest that it could have a lysergic acid diethylamide-like activity, but this hypothesis must be checked by experiments on humans.|$|E

Neither ADG nor concentrations of progesterone, estradiol and overall FSH differed between treatments during the estrous cycle.
