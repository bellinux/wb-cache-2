40|$|With the Framework Directive 92 / 75 /EEC on Energy Labelling of Household Appliances, the European Union {{introduced}} a labelling system {{that applies to}} major household appliances. The EU Directive requires manufacturers to pro-vide the data strip (accurate product energy consumption information) with each appliance to the retailers. Retailers are compelled to "provide all the appliances displayed in salesrooms with complete energy labels placed on top or front of the appliance in original size and colour and clearly visible" (Directive 92 / 75 /EEC). Retailers therefore {{play a crucial role}} in the implementation of the <b>European</b> <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> program. Surprisingly however, their role in the success of the program has not received any attention so far. In this paper, we first develop a theoretical framework to explain retailers' compliance with the Directive. The framework comprises instrumental motives for compliance like perceived costs and benefits of compliance as well as normative motives like internalization of regulation or social pressure to comply. These factors are moderated by retailers' ability to comply. Second, we test this framework econometrically on a sample of ca. 100, 000 appliances from close to 1, 400 retail stores in 27 European countries. Two sets of data were collected in each store: a compliance audit and a standardized survey of store managers. For the compliance audit, researchers noted for each household appliance available in the stores whether the energy label information was available, complete, and placed as required. The survey included perceptual measures of external and internal monitoring, manufacturer compliance, effort to comply, and consumer acceptance of labels. Using as dependent variable the share of completely labelled appliances per retailer - either at the aggregate level or per product category - estimation results of fractional logit models suggest that normative motives generally appear stronger than instrumental ones...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that informed consumers make better purchasing decisions. This principle is applied through the <b>European</b> <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> to promote more energy-efficient appliances. The energy label {{has been quite}} a success story, with over 80 % of consumers recognising it. Many consumers also indicate that they understand the energy label and use it for their purchase decisions. Despite the positive results, data show that the absolute energy consumption in households have increased {{in recent years and}} that despite improvements in overall product efficiency, absolute power consumption of some products has increased. Compounding this problem, studies have shown that consumers do not understand all elements of the various energy labels. Thus, better media are needed to improve communication and positively influence these important consumer choices. Digital labelling tools are one of the best solutions for overcoming these problems. This paper presents research into the consumer perceptions of a digital energy label as an add-on to the EU energy label. Besides offering more information, one major advantage of the digital concept is that it’s designed as a point of sale tool. Thus consumers would be able to access relevant information during the actual purchase decision. The paper presents the objectives, methodology and detailed findings of spontaneous consumer reactions to this digital concept at two consumer focus groups conducted in Germany and Spain with 22 participants many of whom had recently bought an appliance. The workshops included questionnaires and group discussions, as well as an outline concept of the digital tool. Outputs were transcribed and analysed using qualitative and statistical methods. Findings are then applied to develop the digital tool to better inform consumers {{in the context of a}} purchase decision as this work was conducted under the DigiLabel project, aiming at ensuring a better informed decision and more energy-efficient outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern about}} business {{impacts on the}} environment and society has resulted in growing attention toward sustainable production and consumption models. Currently a wide range of tools providing significant benchmarks for sustainability product performance as well as guidance for consumers is available. Energy labels are informative labels applied to manufactured products indicating data relative to energy performance, generally in terms of consumption, efficiency, cost, and so on. Consumers thus are provided with the necessary information for making more-informed choices. Currently, three categories of energy labels are used in most countries: endorsement, comparative, and information only. Endorsement labels essentially offer a “seal of approval” that a product meets certain prespecified criteria. They are generally based on a “yes/no” procedure and offer little additional information. One example of an endorsement label for energy efficiency is the Energy Star label that is provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Comparative labels are divided into two subcategories: one involves a categorical ranking system, and the other uses a continuous scale or bar graph to show relative energy use. The category labels use a ranking system that tells consumers how energy efficient a model is compared to others. The main emphasis is on establishing clear categories so that the consumer can easily understand, by looking at a single label, how an energy-efficient product compares relative to others in the market. The <b>European</b> <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> {{is an example of a}} category label. The other category of comparative label—continuous scale labels—provide comparative information that enables consumers to make informed choices about products; however, they do not concern specific categories. The Canadian energy guide is an example of the continuous-scale label. Information-only labels provide data on the technical performance of the labeled product and offer no simple way (such as a ranking system) to compare energy performance between products. These types of labels are generally not consumer friendly because they contain only technical information. It is important to keep a consistent label style and format across product types; this makes it easier for consumers to understand individual types of labels to evaluate different products. Selecting a label to use is not always easy and usually depends on local consumer knowledge and attitudes. The endorsement label is quite effective, at least with consumers that are attentive to environmental issues. Categorical comparison labels provide more information about energy use and, if well designed and implemented, can provide a consistent basis that buyers can focus on when evaluating energy efficiency from one purchase to another. Continuous scale labels can transmit more detailed information on relative energy use, but research has shown that this label format may be difficult for consumers to understand. Information-only labels are generally more effective for the most educated and economically and/or environmentally concerned consumers...|$|E

40|$|A {{proposal}} for <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> of refrigerated display cabinets was {{submitted to the}} European Commission in November 1995. However, as the priorities in <b>European</b> <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> schemes are focused on electric appliances for the consumer market, a directive for compulsory <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> of refrigerated cabinets has not been prepared. Stil!, an <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> scheme for refrigerated display cases is being used throughout Europe. The driving force is a subsidy on energy efficient display cases provided by Dutch energy distribution companies - together with an tax deduction possibility for investments in energy efficient refrigerated display cases in The Netherlands. "Energy efficient display cases" are defined as display cases with an "A" or "B" energy efficiency class (energy consumption of more than 45 % below market average for class A or between 25 % and 45 % below market average for class B).

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} efficiency improvements {{over the}} past decades, large electric appliances still contribute substantially to residential energy consumption. To address this problem, mandatory <b>energy</b> efficiency <b>labels</b> have been introduced in the European Union. Given that {{an increasing number of}} appliances are being sold on the internet, energy efficiency information should be critically reassessed with respect to its effectiveness and future prospects in an e-commerce setting.

40|$|The {{present study}} details the {{significant}} contribution that different international institutions {{have made to}} the field of sustainability and energy efficiency, with a focus on public buildings. This has been achieved by making use of the database Scopus, by applying bibliometric techniques and by analyzing the contents of articles published from 1976 to 2016. All the materials included in the analysis have been reported from Scopus. Several key aspects of the publications have been considered such as document type, language, subject area, journal type and keywords. Sustainable Development, Sustainability, Energy Conservation, Energy Efficiency and Buildings have been verified as the most used keywords. The obtained contributions have been classified geographically and by institution, with the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Australia and Italy being the leading research countries and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Delft University of Technology and Tsinghua University the top contributing institutions. The most active categories in those fields are engineering, social sciences and environmental issues in that order. It can be assumed that the study of sustainability and energy efficiency across all its dimensions is of great interest for the scientific community. The global environmental issue has led many countries to incorporate a wide range of Energy Efficiency (EE) strategies in order to reduce energy consumption in public buildings, a highly valued aspect by <b>European</b> Union <b>energy</b> <b>labelling...</b>|$|R
