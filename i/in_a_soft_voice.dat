2500|$|Abbott {{took the}} stand and testified for four days, testifying in a calm and poised manner. He spoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> and was steadfast in his denials of any {{knowledge}} of the crime. He said {{it was all a}} [...] "monstrous frame-up". The jury was out seven days before it returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. The judge imposed the death sentence.|$|E
2500|$|The celebrant and assistants {{follow the}} acolytes {{into the church}} wearing the biretta. Upon {{arriving}} in the sanctuary the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar step, after which they are extinguished. [...] The celebrant and assistants kneel on the lowest step and recite the Aperi Domine silently, after which they go to their places and recite the Pater noster and Ave Maria silently. A curious practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the antiphons and psalms to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him first <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms all sit. After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to {{each side of the}} lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones the Magnificat to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then incensed as at Mass while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope. [...] Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the collects. After all commemorations, the celebrant sings Dominus vobiscum, the cantor sings Benedicamus Domino, and the celebrant sings Fidelium animae.... The Marian antiphon is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament often follows Solemn Vespers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Morris," [...] she said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "I am lazy, I know. Perhaps {{that is why}} I adore {{people who}} can work.

60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the meaning fall in his voice. Miss Rose sighed gently and lowered her eyes--her lashes had often excited comment. Then, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> she asked him the sort of life he would prefer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{accept your}} kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess," [...] {{the little man}} said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> and they could all see that tear-drops were {{standing}} in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure a home like this.|$|E
6000|$|A {{gleam of}} {{intelligence}} {{shot from the}} girl's expressive eyes, and she displayed a double row of beautiful teeth as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> she said--"Azinte." ...|$|R

60|$|Lady Jarvis sighed, {{and fell}} back in disappointment; while Miss Harris, turning to the nobleman, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> desired him to ring for her carriage.

60|$|The elderly lady, {{who was a}} {{model of}} {{accurate}} dressing, and whose manner was perfect, considered {{as a piece of}} machinery, here interposed <b>a</b> remark <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low <b>soft</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
