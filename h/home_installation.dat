50|$|Other {{regulatory}} issues {{relate to}} the requirement in most countries for the operator of a network {{to be able to}} show exactly where each base-station is located, and for E911 requirements to provide the registered location of the equipment to the emergency services.

Further, a consumer might try to carry his base station with him to a country where it is not licensed. Some manufacturers are using GPS within the equipment to lock the femtocell when it is moved to a different country; this approach is disputed , as GPS is often unable to obtain position indoors because of weak signal.|$|E

50|$|The {{installation}} of the ODU employs automated tools for simplified antenna alignment and commissioning. The installation procedure is identical anywhere within the satellite service area {{and the use of}} circular polarization further simplifies the setup which permits to reduce the time and cost of the <b>home</b> <b>installation.</b> Although the installation could be done by some advanced users, it is recommended to contact a certified Tooway installer.Poor alignment of the dish system results in higher error rates and a lower broadband speed. The relatively unique transmission system of Turbo Code 8PSK used is not recognized with standard DVB-S or DVB-S2 installation meters.Horizon Global Electronics manufactures a Test and Measurement meter specifically designed to align the Tooway dish. HD-TC8 Applied Instruments also manufactures a Test and Measurement meter, the model Super Buddy 29, designed to align the Tooway dish. Super Buddy 29None of these two meters are able to do the new Viasat SurfBeam DVB-S2 signals. Also for these higher capacity signals and in addition on the higher Ka band, the accuracy of the installation becomes much more critical. Maxpeak AB (publ) manufactures a meter specifically for these new signals, SAM-plus (DVB-S2 ACM and VCM)http://www.maxpeak.tv/samplus.php?lang=eng. The current KA-SAT Surfbeam TRIA (dish receiving block) incorporates an audible tuner allowing accurate pointing of the dish without any additional external meter.|$|E
50|$|Griffon {{continued}} its strong growth from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s. Sales surpassed the $1 billion mark in 1999 and $1.5 billion mark in 2006. Clopay Plastics formed {{a joint venture}} named Finotech with German-based Corovin GmbH to manufacture specialty plastic films and laminates in Europe in 1996, taking a 60 {{percent stake in the}} new company. Finotech provided Clopay Plastics with a platform for further international expansion. Clopay purchased Bohme Verpackungsfolien GmbH & Co., a German manufacturer of plastic packaging and specialty films in 1998 and a 60 percent stake in Isofilme Ltda, a Brazilian manufacturer of plastic hygienic and specialty films, in 2002. Three years later, Clopay acquired full ownership in Finotech and Isofilme. Telephonics won its first contract for more than $100 million in 1997. It received $114 million from the British Royal Air Force to supply communications equipment to upgrade Nimrod anti-submarine airplanes. However, Telephonics reduced its overall dependence on military contracts and expanded its commercial and nondefense government business. Among others, it won a $26 million contract to supply wireless communications equipment for 1,080 New York City Subway cars in 1997. Griffon’s garage door subsidiary expanded in step with the residential housing boom in the United States. It added a <b>home</b> <b>installation</b> service for residential building products such as garage doors, manufactured fireplaces, floor coverings, and cabinetry. In 1997, Griffon purchased Holmes-Hally Industries for about $35 million. Holmes-Hally was a West Coast manufacturer and installer of residential garage doors and related hardware with $80 million in annual sales. By 2006, the installation services subsidiary served 17 percent of all new residential housing in the United States.|$|E
