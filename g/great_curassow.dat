500|$|From the Latin cera meaning [...] "wax", a waxy {{structure}} {{which covers}} {{the base of}} the [...] of some birds species from a handful of families—including raptors, owls, skuas, parrots, turkeys and curassows. The cere structure typically contains the , except in owls, where the nares are distal to the cere. Although it is sometimes feathered in parrots, the cere is typically bare and often brightly coloured. In raptors, the cere is a sexual signal which indicates the [...] "quality" [...] of a bird; the orangeness of a Montague's harrier's cere, for example, correlates to its body mass and physical condition. The colour or appearance of the cere can be used to distinguish between males and females in some species.

5000|$|The {{park has}} a Ranger Station which open for {{visitors}} from 8am to dusk, and has potable water and restrooms. There {{is also a}} Biological Station on the site operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies. A major feature of the park is the density and variety of bird species, {{a major factor in}} the creation of the reserve, due in part to its diverse ecology, with 15 different topographical zones from evergreen forests to mangrove swamps. Birds spotted regularly in the park include <b>great</b> <b>curassows,</b> scarlet macaws, white ibis, roseate spoonbills, anhingas, jabirus, and wood storks among many others.|$|R
60|$|There are strange birds, too. One, {{whom you}} may see in the Zoological Gardens, like a plover with a {{straight}} beak and bittern's plumage, from 'The Main,' whose business is to walk about the table at meals uttering sad metallic noises and catching flies. His name is Sun-bird, {93a} 'Sun-fowlo' of the Surinam Negroes, according to dear old Stedman, 'because, when it extends its wings, which it often does, there appears on the interior part of each wing a most beautiful representation of the sun. This bird,' he continues very truly, 'might be styled the perpetual motion, its body making a continual movement, and its tail keeping time like the pendulum of a clock.' {93b} A game-bird, olive, with a bare red throat, also from The Main, called a Chacaracha, {93c} who is impudently brave, and considers the house his own; and a <b>great</b> black <b>Curassow,</b> {93d} also from The Main, who patronises the turkeys and guinea-fowl; stalks in dignity before them; {{and when they do}} not obey, enforces his authority by pecking them to death. There is thus plenty of amusement here, and instruction too, for those to whom the ways of dumb animals during life are more interesting than their stuffed skins after death.|$|R

50|$|A monogamous species, the <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> is {{distributed}} in rainforest from eastern Mexico throughout Central America, to western Colombia and northwest Ecuador. In Mexico, it is absent from drier western coastal forests but does occasionally occur in dry {{areas of the}} Yucatan, Cozumel Island and Costa Rica. The <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> spends much of its time on the ground, but nests and roosts in trees. This species is gregarious, occurring in groupings of up to a dozen birds, though occasionally birds can be seen alone. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, figs and arthropods. Small vertebrates may supplement the diet on occasion, including small mammals (such as rodents). Unlike other cracids, such as guans, they feed largely on fallen fruit rather than pluck fruit directly from the trees. In Tamaulipas, it feeds largely on the fruit Spondias mombin. Elsewhere, it may prefer the red berries of Chione trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{documented}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 39 species of mammals, 377 species of birds and 126 species of reptiles and amphibians. The region is rich with birds, including the king vulture, harpy eagle, <b>great</b> <b>curassow,</b> crested guan, scarlet macaw, green macaw and military macaw.The representative species include white-headed capuchin, mantled howler and spider monkeys, brown-throated sloth, paca, kinkajou, coatimundi tayra, Central American otter, puma, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary and red brocket.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss and {{overhunting}} in some areas, the <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Colombia and Honduras. Of the smaller subspecies C. r. griscomi of Cozumel Island, {{only a few}} hundred remain. Its population seems either to have been slowly increasing since the 1980s, or to be fluctuating at a low level; it is vulnerable to hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|The forest forms a vital {{biological}} corridor between North and Central America and has very diverse zoology, lying at the conjunction between the Nearctic and Neotropic ecozones and spanning {{a range of}} montane and lowland habitats.It is home to species that include ocelot, tapir, and puma.Highly threatened species include jaguar, spider monkey, white-lipped peccary, horned guan, quetzal and harpy eagle.There {{are estimated to be}} more than 600 birds species, including <b>great</b> <b>curassow,</b> crested guan and ornate hawk-eagle.Recent herpetological studies have found many new forms, including at least eight endemic reptile and amphibian species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> is {{the most}} northernly Crax species. It {{is part of a}} clade that {{inhabited}} the north of South America since about 9 mya (Tortonian, Late Miocene). As the Colombian Andes were uplifted around 6 mya, this species' ancestors were cut off from the population to their southeast. The latter would in time evolve into the blue-billed curassow. The ancestral great curassows then spread along the Pacific side of the Andes, and into Central America during the Pliocene and Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|E
50|$|Cracids {{are large}} birds, similar in general {{appearance}} to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas {{are found in}} more open scrubby habitats. Many species are fairly long tailed, which may be an aide to navigating their largely arboreal existence. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colourful facial ornaments. The birds in this family are particularly vocal, with the chachalacas taking their name {{from the sound of}} their call. Cracids range in size from the little chachalaca (Ortalis motmot), at as little as 38 cm and 350 g, to the <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax rubra), at nearly 1 m and 4.3 kg.|$|E
50|$|At 78 - 100 cm {{in length}} and 3.1 - 4.8 kg in weight, {{this is a very}} large cracid. Females are {{somewhat}} smaller than males. It is the most massive and heavy species in the family but its length is matched by a few other cracids. Four other species of curassow (the northern helmeted, the southern helmeted, the black and the crested) are all around the same average length as the <b>great</b> <b>curassow.</b> In this species, standard measurements are as follows: the wing chord is 36 to 42.4 cm, the tail is 29 to 38 cm and the tarsus is 9.4 to 12 cm. They have the largest mean standard measurements in the family, other than tail length.|$|E
50|$|The Sanctuary has {{a diverse}} array of species {{including}} fish, mammal, reptile and bird population. There are 26 species of international concern within the Sanctuary and the 66-foot buffer vegetation {{on the edge of}} the lagoon. The water opossum, Yucatán howler monkey, Morlet's crocodile, American salt water crocodile, Baird's tapir, Neotropical river otter, cownose ray and the Cubera snapper can be found within or around the sanctuary. They are also 330 species of birds, including the yellow-headed parrot, the <b>great</b> <b>curassow,</b> and the jabiru stork can be seen. Several other species can be found just outside the protected are such as the jaguar, puma, margay, ocelot, jaguarundi and the Central American spider monkey.|$|E
50|$|The {{horned curassow}} {{is among the}} largest cracid species. It {{measures}} 85 to 95 cm in length. Body mass in large males is up to 3.7 to 3.9 kg and only the <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> is heavier amongst the cracids, although the black curassow and the closely related helmeted curassow are around the same length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.1 to 40.2 cm, the tail is 31 to 34.8 cm and the tarsus is 10 to 10.8 cm. It has a distinctive horn or casque on the forehead which projects for over 6 cm. The plumage is generally black, but lacks a blue sheen in primary feathers, and has a white belly, thigh tufts and under-tail coverts. The tail also has white tips.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax rubra) (hocofaisán, pavón norteño) is a large, pheasant-like bird {{from the}} Neotropical rainforests, its range {{extending}} from eastern Mexico, through Central America to western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. Male birds are black with curly crests and yellow beaks; females come in three colour morphs, barred, rufous and black. These birds form small groups, foraging {{mainly on the}} ground for fruits and arthropods, and the occasional small vertebrate, but they roost and nest in trees. This species is monogamous, the male usually building the rather small nest of leaves in which two eggs are laid. This species is threatened by loss of habitat and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as [...] "vulnerable".|$|E
50|$|Crax is a genus of {{curassows}} in {{the order}} Galliformes, a clade of large, heavy-bodied, ground-feeding birds. They are known from tropical South America with one species, the <b>great</b> <b>curassow,</b> ranging northwards through Central America as far as Mexico. The currasows in this genus are noted for their sexual dimorphism; males are more boldly coloured than females and have facial ornamentation such as knobs and wattles. They are also characterised by curly crests and contrastingly-coloured crissums (the area around the cloaca). Crax curassows probably originated as a distinct lineage during the Late Miocene. During the Messinian, the ancestral Crax split into two lineages separated by the Colombian Andes and the Cordillera de Mérida which uplifted at that time. The northern lineage radiated into the great, blue-billed, and yellow-knobbed curassows, while the four southern species evolved as they became separated by the uplifting of various mountain ranges.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} note is {{the presence}} of a number of species in the protected area considered endangered or vulnerable, and in need of protection within Belize. These include one of the two large game species (the <b>great</b> <b>curassow),</b> and the keel-billed motmot (Electron carinatum). The near threatened harpy eagle (Harpia harpyia) has also been recorded from Bladen (Marlin, pers. com., 2006, 2010) and in December 2010 researchers from Belize Foundation for Research and Environmental Education (BFREE) discovered a breeding pair of harpy eagles with a chick, the first ever recorded in Belize and also representing the extreme of their northerly range. The rare solitary eagle (Harpyhaliaetus solitarius) has been recorded from the adjacent Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and Doyle’s Delight, with a high probability that its range includes Bladen. Other birds highlighted as being of concern include the second large game species crested guan (P. purpurascens), the ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), and seasonally, the regionally endangered subspecies of the scarlet macaw (Ara Macao).|$|E
50|$|West Indian {{manatees}} were illegally hunted in the Port Honduras area in Belize {{at least}} {{until the end of the}} 1990s. Poachers were suspected to come from Guatemala and Honduras. Manatees were killed for meat, and their bones used for carving trinket and other souvenirs sold in local markets in the Yucatán Peninsula. In 2002, it was estimated that about 40 manatees are killed annually along the eastern Nicaraguan coast and in inland wetlands by poachers and incidental drowning in fishing nets.Other species poached in Central American countries and in the Dominican Republic for being traded alive include Geoffroy's spider monkey, margay, ocelot, great horned guan, crested guan, <b>great</b> <b>curassow,</b> ocellated turkey, great green macaw, Hispaniolan amazon, Hispaniolan parakeet, red-billed toucan, chestnut-mandible toucan, raptors, rosy boa, rattlesnake, Galápagos tortoise, beaded lizard, green iguana, poison dart frogs and freshwater turtles. Snakes, spectacled caiman, Morelet’s and American crocodiles are killed for their skins. Black iguana, mangrove cockle and queen conch are poached for consuming their meat.|$|E
5000|$|... 650 {{species of}} birds were {{identified}} in a 1993 survey, of which many are threatened.Species found in the most humid areas include the Baudo guan (Penelope ortoni), Berlepsch's tinamou (Crypturellus berlepschi), blue-whiskered tanager (Tangara johannae), brown wood rail (Aramides wolfi), crowned woodnymph (Thalurania colombica), El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi), El Oro tapaculo (Scytalopus robbinsi), indigo flowerpiercer (Diglossa indigotica), long-wattled umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger) and scarlet-breasted dacnis (Dacnis berlepschi).Species found in less humid areas include grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis), ochraceous attila (Attila torridus) and rufous-headed chachalaca (Ortalis erythroptera). Humboldt's sapphire (Hylocharis humboldtii) is found only in the mangroves to the north. Species that have almost been wiped out due to hunting and habitat fragmentation include crested guan (Penelope purpurascens), <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax rubra), great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), great tinamou (Tinamus major) and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Endangered birds include banded ground cuckoo (Neomorphus radiolosus), Baudo guan (Penelope ortoni), Esmeraldas woodstar (Chaetocercus berlepschi), great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis), grey-cheeked parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhoptera), rufous-brown solitaire (Cichlopsis leucogenys) and slaty becard (Pachyramphus spodiurus).|$|E

50|$|Bladen has {{two large}} {{resident}} game bird species, the <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax rubra) and crested guan (Penelope purpurascens). Both these species, {{along with their}} more common relative, the plain chachalaca, are representatives of the Cracidae family - the most threatened of the Neotropical bird families and common hunting targets. Cracids are important seed dispersers and are a major protein source for local communities. Within Belize, both the curassow and the guan are locally common, and outside of protected areas such as Bladen, they are legal game species for those with hunting permits. However, the increase in agricultural colonists and seasonal Central American workers adjacent to the nature reserve has led to increased illegal hunting within the protected area, resulting in reduced populations of both species. This was noted by the 1992 and 1997 expeditions to Columbia River Forest Reserve directly south of Bladen, with reports that game species were unexpectedly scarce in even the upper elevations, suggesting increasing hunting pressure, with relatively easy access from Guatemala. Whether this is impacting Bladen itself is currently unknown, but the implications are that these areas, once considered pristine, should now be considered under threat. This pronounced negative response to hunting pressure makes these two species especially valuable as indicator species in areas where hunting still occurs.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>great</b> <b>curassow</b> may {{build the}} nest and attract a female's {{attention}} to it, though {{in other cases}} both members of a pair will build the nest structure. Two eggs are typically laid in a relatively small nest (usually made largely of leaves), each egg measuring 9.1 x 6.7 cm and weighing 200 g. The young curassow weighs 123 g upon hatching; 2760 g as a half-year-old immature fledgling; and by a year of age, when fully fledged and independent of parental care, will be about three-quarters of their adult weight at 3600 g. This species has been noted for its rather aggressive temperament, which has been regularly directed at humans when the birds are held in captivity. Undoubtedly, they have this inclination in order to repel natural predators, from both themselves and their offspring. Known natural predators of this species have included ocelots and ornate hawk-eagles, though chicks and eggs likely have {{a broader range of}} predators. When a potential predator is near their offspring, curassows have been noted to engage in a distraction display, feigning injury. When attacking humans, the curassows leap in fluttering flight and scratch about the head, targeting the eyes. Their lifespan in captivity has reached at least 24 years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Subsistence {{hunting is}} a {{traditional}} practice providing food and many other goods for households in the Yucatan Peninsula, southeast Mexico. Economic, demographic, and cultural change in this region drive wildlife habitat loss and local extinctions. Improving our understanding about current practices of wildlife use may support better management strategies for conserving game species and their habitat. We aimed to evaluate if wildlife use remained relevant for the subsistence of rural residents of the Yucatan Peninsula, as well as if local hunting practices were related to environmental, geographical, and cultural factors. Methods Fieldwork was done between March 2010 and March 2011. Information was obtained through conversations, interviews, and participant observation. Record forms allowed recording animals hunted, biomass extracted, distance intervals to hunting sites, habitat types and seasonality of wildlife harvests. Data were analyzed using one-way Analysis of Variance, and Generalized Linear Models. Results Forty-six terrestrial vertebrate species were used for obtaining food, medicine, tools, adornments, pets, ritual objects, and for sale and mitigating damage. We recorded 968 animals taken in 664 successful hunting events. The <b>Great</b> <b>Curassow,</b> Ocellated Turkey, paca, white-tailed deer, and collared peccary were the top harvested species, providing 80. 7 % of biomass (10, 190 kg). The numbers of animals hunted and biomass extracted declined as hunting distances increased from villages. Average per capita consumption was 4. 65 [*]±[*] 2. 7 kg/person/year. Hunting frequencies were similar in forested and agricultural areas. Discussion Wildlife use, hunting patterns, and technologies observed in our study sites {{were similar to those}} recorded in previous studies for rural Mayan and mestizo communities in the Yucatan Peninsula and other Neotropical sites. The most heavily hunted species were those providing more products and by-products for residents. Large birds such as the <b>Great</b> <b>Curassow</b> and the Ocellated Turkey were extremely important for local hunters, representing around 40 % of total prey taken. Final considerations Our results suggest that hunting is frequent in our study areas. Low human densities allow low hunting pressure on most game species and favor conservation of the tropical forest. We suggest that co-management may help regulating hunting, prioritizing cultural practices of sustainable use and conservation for benefiting local users and animal populations. </p...|$|E
