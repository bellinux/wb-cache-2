In return for 72 hours of labor per week, Coveleski received $3.75, or about five cents an hour. [...] "There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour", he later recalled. [...] "What was strange is that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> out of there". Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule.|$|E

500|$|Twelve {{years after}} its release, Dylan said: [...] "The closest <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> to the sound I hear in my mind was on {{individual}} bands in the Blonde on Blonde album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." [...] For critics, the double album {{was seen as the}} last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The three albums of this period—Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited both released in 1965, and Blonde on Blonde from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before." [...] Mike Marqusee has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as [...] "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." [...] For Patrick Humphries, [...] "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde." ...|$|E

500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career.

Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier.

We searched the samples and find out where his inspiration came from, because he has one of the best ears in music, period. He knows how to recognize great music that's not his. He knows how to utilize great sounds and great music. So before I met him, I had the utmost respect for Kanye West.

2500|$|In 1907, Cobb reached {{first and}} then stole second, third and home. He {{accomplished}} the feat four more times during his career. He finished the 1907 season with a league-leading [...]350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 runs batted in (RBI). At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title twelve days younger than Cobb when he did it. Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told Grantland Rice, [...] "The biggest thrill <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> came {{in a game against}} the Athletics in 1907 ... The Athletics had us beaten, with Rube Waddell pitching. [...] They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score. This game went 17 innings to a tie, and a few days later, we clinched our first pennant.

Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him.

[...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them.
