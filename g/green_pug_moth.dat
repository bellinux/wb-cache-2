50|$|He was {{interested}} in natural history from an early age, contributing observations to The Zoologist. His main interest was in entomology, particularly <b>Pug</b> <b>moths</b> (Eupithecia). He was also a good botanist and a keen horticulturist (especially crocuses).|$|R
50|$|Scabious {{flowers are}} nectar rich and {{attractive}} to many insects including {{butterflies and moths}} such as the six-spot burnet. Scabiosa species are food plants for the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as the grey <b>pug</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{slightly}} more adapted herbivore to the twiggy coprosma is the ‘coprosma leaf beetle’. This species can chew {{holes in the}} young leaves. This beetle appears around Spring time on the shrub. It can jump from leaf to leaf. Other herbivorous insects include three native caterpillars. These are the Dark Coprosma Carpet moth - Austrocidaria similataCoprosma <b>pug</b> <b>moth</b> - Pasiphila sandyciasPallid Coprosma leafroller - Leucotenes coprosmaeLastly, two coprosma scale insects are herbivores of the coprosma rhamnoides.|$|R

50|$|Gorse is a {{valuable}} plant for wildlife, providing dense thorny cover ideal for protecting bird nests. In Britain, France and Ireland, it is particularly noted for supporting Dartford warblers (Sylvia undata) and European stonechats (Saxicola rubicola); the common name of the whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) attests to its close association with gorse. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the caterpillars of the double-striped <b>pug</b> <b>moth</b> (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata), while those of the case-bearer moth Coleophora albicosta feed exclusively on gorse. The dry wood of dead gorse stems provides food for the caterpillars of the concealer moth Batia lambdella.|$|R
50|$|They are {{extremely}} important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter storms, birds often {{take refuge in}} hollies, which provide shelter, protection from predators (by the spiny leaves), and food. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the double-striped <b>pug</b> <b>moth</b> (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata). Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include Bucculatrix ilecella, which feeds exclusively on hollies, and The Engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia).|$|R
