50|$|<b>Imeglimin</b> is an {{experimental}} drug being developed as an oral anti-diabetic. It is an oxidative phosphorylation blocker that acts to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, increase muscle glucose uptake, and restore normal insulin secretion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This 12 -week study {{assessed}} the efficacy and tolerability of <b>imeglimin</b> as add-on therapy to the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor sitagliptin {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with sitagliptin monotherapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, <b>imeglimin</b> (1, 500 mg b. i. d.) or placebo was added to sitagliptin (100 mg q. d.) over 12 weeks in 170 patientswith type 2 diabetes (mean age 56. 8 years; BMI 32. 2 kg/m 2) that was inadequately controlled with sitagliptin alone (A 1 C ≥ 7. 5 %) during a 12 -week run-in period. The primary ef ficacy end point was the change in A 1 C from baseline versus placebo; secondary end points included corresponding changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, strati fication by baseline A 1 C, and percentage of A 1 C responders. RESULTS: <b>Imeglimin</b> reduced A 1 C levels (least-squares mean difference) from baseline (8. 5 %) by 0. 60 % compared with an increase of 0. 12 % with placebo (between-group difference 0. 72 %, P < 0. 001). The corresponding changes in FPG were - 0. 93 mmol/L with <b>imeglimin</b> vs. - 0. 11 mmol/L with placebo (P = 0. 014). With <b>imeglimin,</b> the A 1 C level decreased by ≥ 0. 5 % in 54. 3 % of subjects vs. 21. 6 % with placebo (P < 0. 001), and 19. 8 %of subjects receiving <b>imeglimin</b> achieved a decrease in A 1 C level of ≤ 7 % compared with subjects receiving placebo (1. 1 %) (P = 0. 004). <b>Imeglimin</b> was generally well tolerated, with a safety pro file comparable to placebo and no related treatment-emergent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Imeglimin</b> demonstrated incremental efficacy benefits as add-on therapy to sitagliptin, with comparable tolerability to placebo, highlighting the potential for <b>imeglimin</b> to complement other oral antihyperglycemic therapies...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract <b>Imeglimin</b> {{is a novel}} agent currently in devel-opment to treat type 2 diabetes. Laboratory {{studies have demonstrated that}} {{it has the potential to}} impact the three main pathophysiologic components of type 2 diabetes: impaired glucose uptake by muscle tissue, excess hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased beta-cell apoptosis. Pre-liminary human studies that have been published within the last 2 years demonstrate that <b>imeglimin</b> improves hemo-globin A 1 c and fasting plasma glucose similarly when compared with metformin and with sitagliptin. There has also been a low incidence of adverse effects, especially hypoglycemia, reported in these early human studies. Currently, <b>imeglimin</b> is lacking long-term evidence to demonstrate any effects on its cardiovascular safety, and data on morbidity and mortality, though some studies are currently in progress. There is great potential for imegli-min, if FDA approved, to play a significant role in the type 2 diabetes management algorithm. Key Points <b>Imeglimin</b> has been shown to have a positive impact on skeletal muscle glucose uptake, hepatic glucose production, and beta-cell apoptosis. <b>Imeglimin</b> has demonstrated similar clinical benefit in hemoglobin A 1 c and fasting plasma glucose when compared with metformin and sitagliptin. Although <b>imeglimin</b> has not yet achieved FDA approval, it is a promising new agent that could impact the treatment of type 2 diabetes. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVEdA 12 -week study {{assessed}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} a new oral antidiabetic agent, <b>imeglimin,</b> as add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled with metformin alone. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdA total of 156 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive <b>imeglimin</b> (1, 500 mg twice a day) or placebo added to a stable dose of metformin (1, 500 – 2, 000 mg/day). Change in A 1 C from baseline was the primary efficacy outcome; secondary outcomes included fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and proinsulin/insulin ratio. RESULTSdAfter 12 weeks, the placebo-subtracted decrease in A 1 C with metformin-imeglimin was 20. 44 % (P, 0. 001). Metformin-imeglimin also significantly improved FPG and the proinsulin/insulin ratio from baseline (20. 91 mg/dL and 27. 5, respectively) compared with metformin-placebo (0. 36 mg/dL and 11. 81). Metformin-imeglimin therapy was generally well-tolerated with a comparable safety profile to metformin-placebo. CONCLUSIONSdAddition of <b>imeglimin</b> to metformin improved glycemic control and offers potential as a new treatment for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Care 36 : 565 – 568, 201...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Insulin {{secretory}} defects are a {{key feature}} in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Classical insulin-secreting agents such as sulfonlyureas stimulate insulin secretion independent of glucose and cause hypoglycemia. Despite the advantages offered by incretin-based therapies, {{there is still a}} medical need for developing new insulin secretagogues for treating T 2 D. AREA COVERED: This article discusses: the new advances in the field of incretin-based therapies, glucokinase (GK) activators, free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) or G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) agonists (GPR 40, GPR 119, GPR 120), <b>imeglimin</b> and some other insulin secretagogues with diverse mechanisms of action still in preclinical development. EXPERT OPINION: New insulin secretagogues should offer major advantages over sulfonylureas and gliptins. The challenge is to avoid uncontrolled insulin secretion and minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, to protect cells from progressive loss of mass and function for a better durability of glucose control, and to offer a good safety profile. Numerous approaches are in development. However, {{it is too early to}} decide whether one new pharmacological class will emerge as a clinically useful insulin secretagogue in the near feature.
