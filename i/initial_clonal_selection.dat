We examine existing <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms for learning from a theoretical and empirical perspective and assert that the widely accepted computational interpretation of <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> is compromised both algorithmically and biologically. We suggest a more capable abstraction of the <b>clonal</b> <b>selection</b> principle grounded in probabilistic estimation and approximation and demonstrate how it addresses some of the shortcomings in existing algorithms.
