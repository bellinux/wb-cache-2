The paper then uses the database to document the evolution of public debt ratios in advanced, emerging, and low-income economies, and relate them to contemporaneous developments in growth, commodity prices, and debt relief, respectively. Finally, the paper identifies 129 large debt increases and decreases observed in 19 advanced economies over 1880 – 2007 and decomposes them into contributions from the primary balance, the interest-growth differential, and the stock-flow adjustment term (a composite of valuation effects and “below-the-line” fiscal operations). The analysis suggests a pattern of asymmetric contributions: the primary balance {{plays a key role}} in debt reductions, except during the post-WWII period (when the <b>growth-interest</b> <b>differential</b> was extremely favorable); while debt surges were often associated with large stock-flow adjustments, likely reflecting assumption of implicit liabilities and exchange rate changes and, for the cases of debt reduction, debt default. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} {{growth of}} Egypt's public domestic debt has raised concerns regarding {{its impact on}} economic growth and fears are being express about the debt sustainability. Utilizing data for the period 1981 - 2006, the results obtained from cointegration model reveal that the public domestic debt in Egypt has a robust negative impact on growth. The sustainability of debt was examined used some algebra methods. The results suggested that the recent path of debt followed in Egypt was sustainable. For debt to remain sustained in future, substantial fiscal reforms are needed and policies should be adopting to maintain an increasing <b>growth-interest</b> rate <b>differential.</b> Public Domestic Debt; Fiscal Budget; Debt Sustainability; Economic Growth; Cointegration. ...|$|R
