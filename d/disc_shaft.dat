These components rotate at high speeds in a gas turbine engine and consequently experience both high cycle fatigue (HCF) and low cycle fatigue (LCF) due to dynamic loads and temperatures. Since residual stress affects both HCF and LCF properties, study of residual stress for varying surface conditions for this alloy assumes significance. Specimens extracted from a forging were subjected to different surface conditions such as emery polishing, shot peening to different intensities after emery polishing and thermal stress relief after shot peening. Surface residual stresses were measured by X ray Diffraction technique. Changes in the magnitude of residual stresscould be attributed to corresponding changes in surface conditions and the accompanying surface cold work...|$|R

In this case, a convergence procedure is carried out in terms of the vibration modes to obtain a representative model for the rotor system. Therefore, the proposed analysis is performed in both frequency and time domains, in which the frequency response functions, the unbalance responses, the Campbell diagram, and the orbits are numerically determined. Additionally, the instability threshold of the rotor system is obtained. This study illustrates the convenience of the composite hollow shafts for rotor dynamics applications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTraditionally, the {{influence}} coefficients method is used very frequently and {{successfully in the}} industrial context. This method is efficient and well adapted when {{the relationship between the}} unbalance and the displacements is linear. However, if some nonlinearity appears in the rotating machinery, this technique does not work properly and the results obtained regarding the correction weights and their corresponding angular positions are not satisfactory. The choice of the number and the repartition of the correction plans depends on the possible accessibility that varies for each machine. In a previous work, a model based methodology for the balancing of rotating machinery with localized non linearity was developed and validated experimentally. Based on this approach, a new method dedicated to the identification of the unbalance distribution in linear and non linear rotating machinery was realized through pseudorandom optimization methods and the system modeling was performed by using the well-known finite element method.

However, if some nonlinearity {{appears in the}} structure, these techniques do not work properly and the results obtained regarding the correction weights and their corresponding angular positions are not satisfactory.

Consequently, nonlinear behavior is not taken into account in the formulation of classical balancing techniques.

50|$|Open-die forging is {{also known}} as smith forging. In open-die forging, a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece, which is placed on a {{stationary}} anvil. Open-die forging gets its name {{from the fact that the}} dies (the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece) do not enclose the workpiece, allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies. The operator therefore needs to orient and position the workpiece to get the desired shape. The dies are usually flat in shape, but some have a specially shaped surface for specialized operations. For example, a die may have a round, concave, or convex surface or be a tool to form holes or be a cut-off tool.Open-die forgings can be worked into shapes which include <b>discs,</b> hubs, blocks, <b>shafts</b> (including step shafts or with flanges), sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes.Open-die forging lends itself to short runs and is appropriate for art smithing and custom work.

Foil bearings with their exceptional feature of negligible wear has gained a very important place {{in the field of}} turbomachinery but the nonlinearities present in the bearing call for the dynamic analysis of these bearings. In the present work, a dynamic modeling approach and parametric identification scheme of a single disc rotor mounted on foil bearings is presented.

For solving dynamic equations, Newmark method is employed using Matlab. A solid model of the rotor is prepared and then it is analyzed to obtain various critical speeds of the system and to obtain mode shapes at those speeds.

5000|$|The {{importance}} of materials {{design and the}} understanding of grain boundaries was highlighted during the operation of Hinkley point. In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point ‘A’ turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the burst <b>disc</b> and the <b>shaft</b> caused the adjacent disc to burst almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This {{is thought to be}} the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the burst discs were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper embrittled during slow furnace cooling after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the absence of cracks. A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, almost 15 years ago, {{it was not possible to}} quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material’s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions. The reason for the failure was down to transport of phosphor towards the grain boundaries which embrittled the chromium steel causing it to fail ...|$|R

Of particular interest are the internal cylindrical cavities formed by adjacent discs and the interaction of these with a central axial throughflow of cooling air. Tests were carried out {{for a range of}} non-dimensional parameters representative of gas-turbine high pressure compressor internal air system flows (ReΦ up to 5 x 106 and Rez up to 2 x 105). One configuration of the test rig was tested {{in the course of the}} reported study (Build 3) and test data from a previous rig configuration (Build 2) were processed, analysed and compared with the tested data. The most significant difference between the two builds of test rig was the size of the annular gap between the (non-rotating) <b>shaft</b> and the <b>disc</b> bores. Build 3 had a wider annular gap ratio, dh/b= 0. 164, while Build 2 featured a gap ratio of dh/b= 0. 092. Heat transfer data were obtained from thermocouples and a conduction analysis. Heat transfer results show differences between the versions of the rig, with the higher Nusselt number values in Build 3 attributed to the wider annular gap allowing more of the throughflow to penetrate into the cavity compared to Build 2. An attempt is made to correlate the average disc Nusselt numbers and this indicates the existence of different regimes. A two-component Laser Doppler Anemometry system was used on both rigs to measure cavity axial and tangential velocity components. Optical access in Build 3 also allowed for measurement of radial velocities. The axial and radial velocities inside the cavities are virtually zero. The size of the annular gap between <b>disc</b> bore and <b>shaft</b> has a significant effect on the radial distribution of tangential velocity. An analysis of the frequency spectrum obtained from the tangential velocity measurements shows evidence of periodicity in the flow consistent with the current understanding of the flow structure in a heated rotating cavity with axial throughflow...|$|R
