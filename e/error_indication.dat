Differently from all other <b>error</b> <b>indications,</b> no-harm alarms could be conveniently ignored (or tolerated) by the system, with no need to adopt any recovery strategy upon their reception, otherwise for instance leading to exclude the self checking circuit from the whole system, or to degrade system’s performance. A new property (No-Harm Alarm Robustness) is defined for checkers, allowing to discriminate “true” <b>error</b> <b>indications</b> from no-harm alarms. A possible approach to design checkers featuring such a property is proposed. The behavior of the derived checkers has been verified by means of electrical level simulations, and their costs are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The Systems Simulation Centre of the DSTO is {{currently}} considering {{the implementation of}} a commercial-off-the-shelf software package called SensorVision to fulfil the scene generation function of an infrared hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system.

It is shown that the thermal emission model employed by SensorVision has errors that can affect the level of realism associated with the generated infrared images. Unrealistic scenes can cause spurious HIL simulation results, since these infrared images are used as the primary stimuli for the system being tested.

50|$|Lateral {{navigation}} (LNAV) {{refers to}} navigating over a ground track with guidance from an electronic device {{that gives the}} pilot (or autopilot) error indications in the lateral direction only {{and not in the}} vertical direction. In aviation, lateral navigation is one of two guidance types: linear guidance and angular guidance. In linear guidance, the aircraft's deviation to the left or right of the desired ground track is given as a distance between the aircraft's current position and the desired track. In angular guidance, the <b>error</b> <b>indication</b> is given in degrees of angle from the desired line relative to a ground-based navigation device. To provide an illustration, as the aircraft approaches the ground device with a constant angular error, its distance to the desired ground line decreases. In the context of aviation instrument approaches, an LNAV approach (one that uses lateral navigation) is implied to be a GPS-based approach and to have linear lateral guidance.

30|$|The {{idea is to}} let {{programs}} produce or consume data streams {{that carry}} individual messages. Some systems like Oberon [5] use strong typing, while others such as UNIX [6] use raw, untyped, data. We take the middle way: streams sent through channels carry typed data, but application specific data types are unknown to the system. The system forwards messages (as raw data) and {{it is up to}} senders and receivers to know what they mean and how to handle them. Messages are typed but {{there are only a few}} well-known types: raw bytes, directory entries (file metadata), file addresses (with a file name and a line/rune range), and <b>error</b> <b>indications</b> (encoded as a string with the error message). By convention, messages with raw bytes are considered as the actual data flowing through the stream, which should be processed by commands through the pipeline. All commands usually handle such messages and blindly forward everything else. All other messages provide context for the flowing data. For example, a directory entry followed by raw-bytes messages can be used to send data for a given file, commands similar to grep may send messages with file addresses before sending the matched data, and so on.|$|R
