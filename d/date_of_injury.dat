The National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) set its sights on research that validated patient functional outcomes and satisfaction. Webster (1995) stated that functional outcomes studies measure the patient’s physical, mental, and social well-being, as well as the patient’s perception of function and overall satisfaction. The NATA’s outcomes assessment questionnaire was developed to measure patient functional ability and satisfaction. The instrument was modified in order to compare injured high school athlete’s functional satisfaction in schools that employ teacher/ATCs to schools that do not employ such personnel. The sample (N= 49) consisted of southwest Idaho high school (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors) fall sports participants (football, volleyball, and cross-country). The high schools that employed ATCs were Boise, Eagle, and Meridian. The high schools that did not employ ATCs were Kuna, Emmett, Caldwell, Middleton, Horseshoe Bend, and Vallivue.

40|$|Background: Post-concussive {{syndrome}} (PCS), {{which includes}} physical, neurological and cognitive complaints, frequently occurs following mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI). Research in civilian populations has demonstrated PCS symptom recovery {{over the course of}} one-year post-injury, with a majority of symptoms resolving within the first 90 days. The recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in an increased prevalence of TBI, in large part due to a preponderance of blast-related weaponry. Little is known regarding the course of PCS symptoms following combat-related TBI, and whether it differs from other concussion mechanisms seen in civilian populations (e. g., sports-related). Complicating matters is the overlap of symptoms between TBI and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: The Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database (EMED) allows for the unique assessment of symptoms following mild TBI. The EMED contains clinical records completed in-theatre, which includes exact <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> This addresses limitations of recent research of combat-related TBI, which relies on self-reported information with no knowledge of when the actual event occurred, thus making it impossible to document trends or changes in post-concussive symptoms over time. A non-head injured control group was utilized for comparison purposes. The EMED data was linked with post-deployment health assessment (PDHA) data. The PDHA is given to personnel at the conclusion of their deployment. Because a TBI event can occur at any time during a deployment, personnel can answer a PDHA anywhere from days, weeks to many months after injury. For this analysis, personnel were categorized into those responding to a PDH...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the prevalence {{and patterns of}} comorbidity in community-dwelling older people hospitalised for fall-related injury, and assesses the impact of comorbidity on inpatient service use by this population. This information is important for identifying target groups for falls prevention. The thesis is motivated {{by a desire to}} increase potential gains in avoidable inpatient service use due to falls in community-dwelling older people. Five research questions were answered using hospital discharge data from Victoria and New Zealand between 01 July 2005 and 30 June 2008, inclusive. Two of the research questions were methodological and integral to the rigour of the thesis given limitations in the Victorian data. The first methodological question addressed the accuracy of both incidence and comorbidity estimates derived from unlinked (episode-based) Victorian data, compared to those estimated from internally linked (person-based) Victorian data. The second methodological question addressed the accuracy of evidence-based criteria for identifying fall-related incident injury from internally linked data {{in the absence of the}} <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> New Zealand data containing the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> were used for this purpose. Findings from the methodological research were used to optimise case selection from Victorian data for empirical research. The empirical research examined the burden of hospitalised fall-related injury in community-dwelling older people in Victoria; and assessed the prevalence, patterns and impact of comorbidity on inpatient service use by those hospitalised. On the methodological front, the thesis concluded that methods of estimating fall-related hip fracture incidence in community-dwelling older people using unlinked hospital discharge data overestimated fall-related hip fracture incidence, underestimated the prevalence of some comorbid conditions and may alter the relative ranking of these conditions. A further conclusion was that in the absence of the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> validated evidence-based criteria may be used to reliably estimate the incidence of fall-related hip fractures in community-dwelling older people from good quality internally linked data. On the empirical front, the thesis found that the total burden of hospitalised fall-related injury in community-dwelling older people in Victoria was 284, 781 hospital bed days in 2005 – 06, rising to 310, 031 hospital bed days in 2007 – 08. This burden was considerably higher than previously estimated. Hospitalisation rates were highest in women and people aged 85 + years. The thesis further found that more than one in four patients had at least one comorbid condition and among these, one in three had multi-comorbidity. Five distinct, biologically plausible clusters of comorbidity were identified. Comorbidity was shown to be associated with significant increases in inpatient service use and the overall pattern was one of highly prevalent comorbidities having lower impact. These findings suggest that, on the basis of avoidable fall-related inpatient service use, a targeted approach in which community-dwelling older people with comorbidity are identified and provided with cost-effective falls prevention interventions may potentially be cost-saving to the health system, compared to a universal population-based approach. The targeted approach may be complementary to a more universal population-based approach offering falls prevention programs to women and those aged 85 + years...|$|E

All injuries sustained during matches and training sessions were recorded. Injury data were collected from a total of 137 matches and 148 training sessions. Information recorded included the <b>date</b> and time <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> site, nature, cause, and severity <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> Results: During the two seasons, 1694 playing injuries and 559 training injuries were sustained. The match injury incidence was 824. 7 per 1000 player-position game hours and training injury incidence was 45. 3 per 1000 training hours. Over 20 % of the total training (17. 4 per 1000) and playing (168. 0 per 1000) injuries sustained were to the thigh and calf. Muscular injuries (haematomas and strains) were the most common type <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> sustained during training (22. 0 per 1000, 48. 7 %) and matches (271. 7 per 1000, 32. 9 %). Playing injuries were most commonly sustained in tackles (382. 2 per 1000, 46. 3 %), while overexertion was the most common cause <b>of</b> training <b>injuries</b> (15. 5 per 1000, 34. 4 %). The majority <b>of</b> playing <b>injuries</b> were sustained {{in the first half of}} matches (1013. 6 per 1000, 61. 5...|$|R
