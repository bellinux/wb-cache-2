The need and importance of the study highlighted the <b>health</b> and safety <b>measures</b> which imply to improve {{the performance of the}} employees. The research was conducted with the sample of 150, on the basis of dis- proportionate stratified random sampling. The primary data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire which is filled by the respondents. The collected data were analyzed for interpretation by simple percentage analysis and Weighted Average Method. The study also focuses what are the safety equipment is necessary and how it protect the employees from the accident at the work spot.

Even though {{indigenous}} {{systems of}} medicine have existed in most civilizations since antiquity, it is modern medicine that has revolutionised healthcare for the last two and a half centuries. Modern medicine began to evolve as an objective science during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} which saw huge population migrations to cities in the wake of the <b>industrial</b> revolution. Public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> were employed for the first time in attempts to control outbreaks of diseases among migrant workers living in paltry conditions. Pasteurisation, vaccination and sanitisation came to be used as methods of disease prevention, long before microbes were identified as causative agents. 1 Use of systematic scientific enquiry as a tool for gathering medical information was heralded by the works of John Snow on cholera, for which he is known as the father of Moder...|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} studies [2, 3] involving visual display terminals (VDT) work, which produces {{a high degree}} of eye fatigue [4 – 6], we considered wood affixed around a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen for decreasing eye fatigue. For visual appeal, flat grain surface of a widespread broadleaf tree species, Japanese ash (Fraxinus mandshurica var. japonica), was chosen. We attached the wood to a rim around an LCD screen. Referring to literatures [7, 8] about relationships between eye fatigue and the near-point distance (“NPD”, hereafter) with a near-point ruler commonly used in the <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> field, we <b>measured</b> NPD to objectively clarify that there was less eye fatigue than when a plain LCD screen was utilized. We examined how display screens used for VDT tasks and the wood surrounding the screen affected test subjects. The results suggested that when the subjects only looked at the wood surface, they experienced less eye fatigue.|$|R

40|$|Background: Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) {{and psychological}} hazards are increasingly observed in industries, necessitating {{the need to}} strengthen <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems to control the same. District level data on level of functioning of <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems and services with special focus on systems available for mental health care is lacking in India. This information is vital to plan need-based interventions for system strengthening. Objective: To assess the status of functioning of <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems and services in Kolar district, India, with special focus on systems and services available for mental health care. Methods: This cross-sectional study was undertaken between October and December 2014 on a stratified random sample of 69 industries located in Kolar, which were stratified proportionately by their hazardous nature. Interview and observation checklist {{were used to assess}} and classify functioning of <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems and services including those available for mental health care. Results: Occupational safety and health (OSH) policy was present in 56 % and health insurance in 39 % of the 69 industries assessed. Pre-placement and periodical medical examination were conducted in 23 % of industries. Health systems and services in hazardous industries were functioning at less than 50 % level of functioning. Health systems and services for mental health care were non-existent. Conclusion: There is a need in Kolar district, India, to integrate the mental health components within existing <b>industrial</b> <b>health</b> systems, as per policy directives to implement setting based approaches in mental health programs...|$|R

Five generic health concepts are defined: physical health, mental health, social functioning, role functioning, and general health perceptions.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown fatigue and depression/anxiety to be highly {{associated}} with each other. The present study seeks to differentiate between fatigue and depression/anxiety and to investigate the familiality/heritability of fatigue using sib-pairs. Method: The GENESiS study is a questionnaire study based in the United Kingdom that includes a five-item fatigue scale and four mental <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> (GHQ- 12, EPQ-N, MASQ-AA, MASQ-HPA). Fatigue data from 10, 444 sibling pairs were analysed using multivariate methods and model fitting techniques to investigate the familiality/heritability of fatigue and {{its relationship with the}} other mental <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and physical <b>health</b> items. Results: Fatigue correlated highly with GHQ- 12 (r= 0. 62, p< 0. 001). A principal components analysis of the fatigue scale and the GHQ- 12 revealed one main component which correlated highly with mental health items, and a smaller second component which correlated modestly with physical health items. Fatigue showed a modest sibling correlation (0. 09, p< 0. 001), and multivariate modelling revealed evidence for familial effects on fatigue that were independent of the mental <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b> Conclusions: Fatigue showed a strong r elationship with both physical illness and mental <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b> Fatigue is modestly familial and at least part of this familial factor is not shared with mental <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b> © Steinkopff Verlag 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
