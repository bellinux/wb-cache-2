25|$|What {{is clear}} from this is that these two teams are in effect one and the same. All that has {{happened}} is that the nomenclature has changed, as <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> did in Georgian times. Furthermore, all the players named above, with the single exception of Bridger who had a short career, are recognised players and so {{there is no doubt that}} the team in question was of top-class standard. The problem as so often is what to call it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the closing}} chorale, [...] "" [...] (Amen, amen! Come, you fair crown of joy), Bach sets the Abgesang {{only of the}} final stanza of Nicolai's hymn. The musicologist Julian Mincham offers the thought: [...] "Conceivably the most convincing {{explanation}} lies, as <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> does, within the text– ... do not delay, I await You longingly. The hymn tune itself, through its very abbreviation implies {{a sense of urgency}} and the feeling of being unable to defer any longer." [...] In Bach's setting, the violin adds a jubilant fifth part to the four vocal parts. The violin has to [...] "climb three octaves to convey the extent of the soul's longing for the joys of a future life and the prospect of Jesus returning at the end of time".|$|E
2500|$|A lengthy article, part news article, part {{obituary}} {{and part}} eulogy was printed in The Times, where his cousin Bernard Darwin {{was on the}} staff. [...] His cousin, Lady Margaret Keynes, later recalled [...] "...on April 23 , Rupert Brooke had died {{on his way to}} Gallipoli with the Naval Division, and my cousin Erasmus.....had been killed the day after near Ypres. [...] Reading the appalling list of casualties in The Times had become a daily terror lest it contained the names of friends and acquaintances, as <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bradley {{describes}} the theme as [...] "youthful idealism" [...] {{and how far}} it can take someone [...] "if it's not stamped out, as <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> is." [...] Thinking {{back to his own}} childhood, he identifies with Flavia's 11-year-old zeal, remembering the [...] "feeling of being absolutely unstoppable," [...] capable of anything. He explains, [...] "when you're that age, you sometimes have a great burning enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, {{and that is something that}} has always intrigued me - that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost." [...] Reviewer Francisca Goldsmith notes this theme as well, suggesting that readers [...] "may come away with a slightly altered view of what is possible for a headstrong girl to achieve." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beatles guitarist George Harrison {{described}} {{the song in}} 1969 as [...] "one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge." [...] Lennon described it as [...] "more of Paul's granny music". In 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being [...] "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> does, as I was beginning to find out {{at that time in}} my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Wodehouse, Bolton {{wrote the}} semi-autobiographical book Bring on the Girls!, subtitled, [...] "The Improbable Story of Our Life in Musical Comedy" [...] (1954). It {{is full of}} anecdotes about the larger-than-life {{characters}} who dominated Broadway between 1915 and 1930, but the biographer Frances Donaldson writes that {{it is to be}} read as entertainment rather than reliable history: [...] "Guy, having once invented an anecdote, told <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> {{that it was impossible to}} know whether in the end he believed it or not." [...] Other collaborations between the two writers were not acknowledged on title pages or in programmes, but were plays by one turned into novels by the other, or vice versa. [...] Bolton's play, Come On, Jeeves centred on one of Wodehouse's [...] best-known characters; Wodehouse later adapted the play as the novel Ring for Jeeves. Wodehouse's novels French Leave, The Small Bachelor and others were adapted from plots by Bolton.|$|E
5000|$|David Weigel wrote that, [...] "where Rasmussen Reports really distinguishes itself, and {{the reason}} <b>it’s</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> cited by conservatives, is in its issue polling. Before the {{stimulus}} debate began, Rasmussen asked voters whether they’d favor stimulus plans that consisted entirely of tax cuts or entirely of spending. Tax cuts won every time, and Republicans began citing this when they argued for a tax-cut-only stimulus package." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Your love, dear heart," [...] he whispered, [...] "will draw me back safely home as <b>it</b> hath <b>so</b> <b>often</b> done before. You believe that, do you not?" ...|$|R
50|$|Because the {{compiler}} traverses {{the tree}} {{several times to}} determine syntactic correctness, {{it is important to}} make traversing the tree a simple operation. The compiler executes a specific set of operations, {{depending on the type of}} each node, upon reaching <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>often</b> makes sense to use the visitor pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{merit of}} this poem {{is talking about}} melancholy in a mild and subtle way with using autumn. This is one reason people love this poem and quote <b>it</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>often</b> today.|$|R
6000|$|And {{how that}} cupboard-door did creak! It surely {{could not be}} Arthur, who was opening and {{shutting}} <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> moving so restlessly about, and muttering like the soliloquy of a tragedy-queen! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear me. <b>It</b> comes <b>so</b> <b>often</b> to us {{here that}} we get tired of it. I do, at least. I'm not always up {{to this kind of}} thing. Champagne--if you please. Miss Mackenzie, you will take some champagne?" ...|$|R
50|$|This form of breach is very rare, in {{part because}} <b>it</b> is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> {{categorised}} {{under one of the}} other forms. It offers very little by way of case law, as such cases are, for the most part, easily settled.|$|R
5000|$|... "And So I Am a Comedienne", {{an article}} {{published}} in Ladies Home Journal in July 1925, gave Dorothy a chance to recall her public persona: “And so I am a comedienne, though I, too, once wanted to do heroic and tragic things. Today my objection to playing comedy is that <b>it</b> is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> misunderstood by the audiences, both in the theater and in the picture houses. <b>It</b> is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> thought to be a lesser art and something which comes to one naturally, a haphazard talent like the amateur clowning of some cut-up who is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> thought to be ‘the life of the party’. In the eyes of so many persons comedy is not only the absence of studied effect and acting, but it is not considered an art.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} test," [...] he said. [...] "If you can amuse ME {{with that}} story {{you must be}} a wonder. I've heard <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> that it has no more interest for me than the alphabet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we talk {{of doing}} good to people," [...] said the archdeacon, [...] "we often make terrible mistakes. <b>It</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> happens that we don't {{know when we}} are doing good and when we are doing harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor little key! I {{looked at}} <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> {{when you were}} so bad, and grieved to think you had missed all that pleasure. Only it was a comfort to know you had been so good about it.' ...|$|E

60|$|The thought {{entered his}} mind, as <b>it</b> had <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> {{that the world}} was full of easy marks. He wished he could meet the money-lender who had been rash enough to advance the Honorable Freddie five hundred pounds. Those philanthropists cross our path too seldom.|$|R
60|$|Dolores {{had to go}} to luncheon at Miss Vincent's, {{and then}} to deliver her lecture. It was well that she had given <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> as almost to know it by heart, for the volcano of anxiety was surging high within her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I might, mightn't I? I {{can hardly}} believe it's true. I've dreamt <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often.</b> It rather tickles me that I should have been so jolly glad that {{you asked me to}} take you out to dinner. Whom are you going to marry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} has. Why, {{you are not}} going away, Valencia? You need not be afraid of infection. Campbell, and Thurnall, too, says that's all nonsense; and they must know, having seen <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>often.</b> Here comes Bowie at last with supper!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And he said, 'I am. My age {{is falling}} from {{me like a}} garment, and I move towards the star as a child. And O, my Father, now I thank thee that <b>it</b> has <b>so</b> <b>often</b> opened, to receive those dear ones who await me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{like you}} to tell me so. I like to feel that you are not ashamed to own it. You ought to say it a few times to me, as I have said <b>it</b> <b>so</b> very <b>often</b> to you." ...|$|R
