50|$|The {{exterior}} is 4½” stone veneer quarried in Philadelphia {{and applied}} {{with a special}} mortise technique. The circular drive arrives at a matching stone portico with a tongue and groove ceiling and Spanish tile porch. The roof is tile with a <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> on the wing side and a hip roof on the rectangular side. There are half-moon windows emerging from the tiled roof that provide side lighting to the upstairs rooms.|$|E
50|$|The {{complex of}} {{corrugated}} iron roofs articulates separately {{the mass of}} buildings constructed over time. The original house has the largest roof, made up of <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> <b>valleys,</b> the rear wings are <b>hipped</b> <b>and</b> gabled and the verandahs are flat or curved skillions. Five brick chimneys stacks of varying sizes and the pointed cupola complete the roofscape.|$|R
50|$|Among {{its basic}} uses are marking common, <b>hip,</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> <b>hip,</b> or <b>valley</b> jack rafters, laying out stair s, {{determining}} and marking angles, and making square cuts on boards.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to use the}} square tool, construction calculators are also used to verify and determine roofing calculations. Some are programmed to calculate all side cuts for <b>hip,</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> jack regular rafters to be exactly 45° for all rafter pitches. The rafter table is expressed in inches, and the higher the numerical value of the pitch, the greater the difference between side cut angles within a given pitch. Only a level roof, or a 0 pitch will require a 45° angle side cut (cheek cut) for <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> jack rafters.|$|R
50|$|Roof tiles are 'hung' {{from the}} {{framework}} of a roof by fixing them with nails. The tiles are usually hung in parallel rows, with each row overlapping the row below it to exclude rainwater and to cover the nails that hold the row below. There are also roof tiles for special positions, particularly where the planes of the several pitches meet. They include ridge, <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> tiles. These can either be bedded and pointed in cement mortar or mechanically fixed.|$|E
50|$|Pulaski County Home, {{also known}} as Pleasant View Rest Home, is a {{historic}} poor farm located in Monroe Township, Pulaski County, Indiana. The original section was built in 1881, and expanded with two wings in 1897. It is a large, four-story, Italianate style red brick building. It has a low-pitched, multiple <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> roof and features multiple porches, stoops, and access points. Also on the property are the contributing Pest House (1882), post and beam barn (1929), and milk house. It is one of Indiana’s few county homes still in active service.|$|E
50|$|In the {{south-eastern}} {{corner of}} the site, visible only to visitors on the walkway, is a fibrous-cement clad building, likely {{to be one of}} the oldest structures on the site. It is octagonal in plan and has a concertinaed, <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> roof made with flat fibrous-cement sheets and barge boards individual to each roof face. Its walls are similarly clad. It has a number of aluminium-framed, sliding windows. The timber walkway area is shaded by a number of mature trees, which shelter this structure from potentially damaging hail and wind. It sits behind a high chain-wire and thatched fence.|$|E
50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of <b>hip,</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>and</b> jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side cut angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side cut angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|R

40|$|Identity and Community Versus Non-Place, is a PhD {{submission}} of sculptural and digital photographic works. I have approached this thesis as both {{an artist and}} an archivist. I focused on two suburban icons for this body of work: the <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> <b>valley</b> suburban home and the caravan. I have endeavoured to visualize the impact change is bringing to the Australian coastal landscape by creating works that comment {{on the effects of}} urban development – particularly on my local region – and by digital photography, documenting change as it occurs. Underpinning the thesis is my long-standing relationship with the Victorian Bellarine region. My personal links to the Bellarine region and my understanding of the surrounding region provided an insightful background to the processes of change which are taking place in the local environment. My research investigates the rapid transformation of coastal townships caused by regional suburban development. My work explores what it is that defines place (beyond its physical characteristics), the similarities and differences between a ‘type’ of place (in this case, coastal regions), and how established communities may retain a sense of place despite the threat posed by ubiquitous, characterless housing developments (which I term ‘non-places’). A primary aim of my research is to have provided a clear contextualisation and an understanding of the importance of location. It explores the significance of Australian coastal regions and our changing relationship with these locations as they become increasingly urbanised. On a sociological level, the differences between middle-class and working-class Australian culture are visually explored. This is particularly evident in the isolation of the traditional residents from the expensive land developments, which are attracting external residents and creating an economically segregated community. This in turn raises the issue of identity, its personal and communal importance and its potential loss as we become increasingly urbanised. This research project has been achieved through the development and subsequent culmination of a body of sculptural installations that provoke discussion, concerning interesting social polarities such as tradition/innovation, subsistence/affluence, past/present and permanence/change...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee proprioceptors to the origination of extensor spasms {{were examined in}} 11 subjects with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Ramp and hold extension <b>and</b> combined <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee oscillation movements were imposed to the right leg while the ankle was held in a static position by a custom-designed robot. Isometric joint torques of the <b>hip,</b> knee, <b>and</b> ankle and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from seven leg muscles were recorded following controlled <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee extension. A stereotypical torque response consisting of hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion was observed following <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee perturbations. Further, the hip or knee joint posture modulated the spastic reflexes triggered by the extension movement of the other joint, with larger responses observed with the <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee extended. In addition, combined <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee oscillation movements were imposed to one leg with four different phasing conditions. The phasing between the <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee modulated the reflex activity triggered by <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee oscillations. The EMG patterns of the spastic reflexes were generally consistent with muscle timing during locomotion in human SCI. This knowledge may help identify rehabilitation strategies that produce functional movements in human SCI...|$|R

40|$|Background: Alterations in <b>hip</b> {{abductor}} strength <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments during gait {{are associated}} with knee osteoarthritis. This study examines the relationship between <b>hip</b> abductor strength <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments during gait in individuals with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Ninety-nine participants underwent maximal isometric hip abductor strength testing and 3 D gait analysis. Pearson correlations examined relationships between non-normalized maximal hip abductor strength (Nm), peak external <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments (Nm) and knee adduction moment impulse (Nm∙s). Linear regressions examined these relationships while controlling for body size (height and mass) and walking speed. Findings: Positive relationships existed between non-normalized <b>hip</b> abductor strength <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments (r = 0. 28 and 0. 37, respectively, p 0. 05) but {{was a significant predictor}} of knee adduction moment impulse (B = 0. 05, p = 0. 005), explaining 6 % of the variance. Interpretation: While a significant relationship between <b>hip</b> abductor strength <b>and</b> knee adduction moment impulse was noted, hip abductor strength only explained a small amount of variance in the impulse. Our findings support previous research of healthy individuals and those with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis <b>and</b> suggests <b>hip</b> abductor strength has little influence on <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments during gait...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the limb position at which the maximum toe-grip strength could be exerted as well as measurement reproducibility. [Subjects] Twenty healthy young women were selected. [Methods] We measured toe-grip strength under three conditions: 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion while sitting, 90 ° <b>hip</b> flexion <b>and</b> knee extension while sitting, and a standing position. [Results] We found that toe-grip strength was significantly lower in the 90 ° <b>hip</b> flexion <b>and</b> knee extension sitting position than in the 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion sitting position and standing position. Moreover, the 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion sitting position produced the best intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0. 813). [Conclusion] The results suggest that 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion while sitting is the most suitable limb position for measuring toe-grip strength, as this position allows maximum strength to be exerted and allows measurements to be repeated...|$|R
40|$|T OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if females presenting with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) from no discernable cause other than overuse demonstrate <b>hip</b> weakness <b>and</b> increased <b>hip</b> internal rotation, <b>hip</b> adduction, <b>and</b> knee valgus during stair descent. T BACKGROUND: Historically, PFPS {{has been viewed}} exclusively as a knee problem. Recent findings have indicated a possible association between <b>hip</b> weakness <b>and</b> PFPS. Researchers have hypothesized that patients who demonstrate hip weakness would exhibit increased hip internal rotation, <b>hip</b> adduction, <b>and</b> knee valgus during functional activities. To date, researchers have not simultaneously examined <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee strength and kinematics in subjects with PFPS to make this determination. T METHODS AND MEASURES: Eighteen females diagnosed with PFPS and 18 matched controls participated. Strength measures were taken for the <b>hip</b> external rotators <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> abduc-tors. <b>Hip</b> <b>and</b> knee kinematics were collected as subjects completed a standardized stair-stepping task. Independent t tests {{were used to determine}} between-group differences in strength and kine-matics during stair descent. T RESULTS: Subjects with PFPS generated 24 % less hip external rotator (P =. 002) and 26 % less hip abductor (P =. 006) torque. No between-group differences (P. 05) were found for average <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee transverse and frontal plane angles dur-ing stair descent. T CONCLUSION: Subjects with PFPS had signifi-cant hip weakness but did not demonstrate altered <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee kinematics as previously theorized. Additional investigations are needed to better understand the association between <b>hip</b> weakness <b>and</b> PFPS etiology...|$|R

40|$|The huntingtin-interacting protein {{family members}} (<b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R in mammals and Sla 2 p in yeast) link clathrin-mediated {{membrane}} traffic to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Genetic data in yeast have implicated the light chain subunit of clathrin in regulating this link. To test this hypothesis, the biophysical properties of mammalian <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R <b>and</b> their interaction with clathrin light chain and actin were analyzed. The coiled-coil domains (clathrin light chain-binding) of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R {{were found to}} be stable homodimers with no propensity to heterodimerize in vitro. Homodimers were also predominant in vivo, accounting for cellular segregation of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R functions. Coiled-coil domains of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R differed in their stability and flexibility, correlating with slightly different affinities for clathrin light chain and more markedly with effects of clathrin light chain binding on Hip protein-actin interactions. Clathrin light chain binding induced a compact conformation of both <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R <b>and</b> significantly reduced actin binding by their THATCH domains. Thus, clathrin is a negative regulator of Hip-actin interactions. These observations necessarily change models proposed for Hip protein function...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis {{constitutes}} a major musculoskeletal burden {{for the aged}} Australians. <b>Hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacement surgeries are effective interventions once all conservative therapies to manage the symptoms have been exhausted. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements in Australia. To our best knowledge, the study is the first attempt {{to account for the}} dual nature of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee osteoarthritis in modelling the severities of right and left joints separately. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a discrete-event simulation model that follows up the individuals with osteoarthritis over their lifetimes. The model defines separate attributes for right and left joints and accounts for several repeat replacements. The Australian population with osteoarthritis who were 40 years of age or older in 2003 were followed up until extinct. Intervention effects were modelled by means of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Both <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements are highly cost effective (AUD 5, 000 per DALY and AUD 12, 000 per DALY respectively) under an AUD 50, 000 /DALY threshold level. The exclusion of cost offsets, and inclusion of future unrelated health care costs in extended years of life, did not change the findings that the interventions are cost-effective (AUD 17, 000 per DALY and AUD 26, 000 per DALY respectively). However, there was a substantial difference between <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements where surgeries administered for hips were more cost-effective than for knees. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements are cost-effective interventions {{to improve the quality of}} life of people with osteoarthritis. It was also shown that the dual nature of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee OA should be taken into account to provide more accurate estimation on the cost-effectiveness of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements...|$|R
