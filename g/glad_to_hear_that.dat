5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> the Shelleys {{had left}} England, hoping that their son {{would become more}} {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and {{was no longer a}} vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E

It made our hearts <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E

However the closest phrase to this in The Washington Papers is in a letter to William Pearce – [...] "I am very <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> the Gardener has saved so much of the St. foin seed, and that of the India Hemp. Make the most you can of both, by sowing them again in drills. [...] The Hemp may be sown any where." ...|$|E

Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans.
