Several trials are presented, each with a different arrangement and containing some of the previous words or images. The task for the participant is to point to a word or image they had not previously pointed to in other trials.|$|E

The Windows Server version of CHKDSK is RAID-aware and can fully recover data in bad sectors of a disk in a RAID-1 or RAID-5 array if other disks {{in the set}} are intact.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the clues}} had changes to their rules. The Detour and Roadblock retain their rules, {{although}} there is no limit on individual Roadblocks. Fast Forwards appear in the race, but they are not optional. Instead, the team that completes it fastest gets a two-hour time credit. Also featured alongside the Detour and Roadblock is the Intersection. However, the Intersection's rules are drastically different. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> that all teams complete, similar to an additional task on the real race.|$|E

25|$|When a {{hardware}} device triggers an interrupt, the operating system's kernel decides {{how to deal}} with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the operating system's kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a growing}} concern over the {{treatment}} of multilingualism in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized. Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several (native) languages. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity. Some states prefer incorporating different languages {{in order to help}} students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} context, the king remains in this {{position}} and has the final executive power of government. The high chiefs are now limited to 33 titles and called nobles (nopele), but some nobles carry more than one title. They are still estate holders, and as such have some influence, {{but they are not}} the government (although many of them are high ranking civil servants). The lower chiefs have disappeared (and the word fototehina now means 'brothers'). The matāpule have also largely disappeared except those who keep the protocol and serve as official spokesmen for the king and nobles. And also the royal undertaker, Lauaki. Tax collection <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> for the central government only. Slavery is abolished, since the emancipation of 1875, and all other people are just the 'commoners'.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
25|$|A Fast Forward <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> that, once completed, {{allows the}} team that completes it to bypass all {{remaining}} tasks in the leg and proceed directly to the Pit Stop. The Fast Forward clue is given with another task clue (usually a Roadblock or Detour) and is a separate task from the others. Only one team may complete a Fast Forward in any given leg, and a team may only complete one Fast Forward in the entire Race. The exception to this rule is in seasons wherein the Fast Forward is offered {{in conjunction with the}} Intersection, in which case a team may win the Fast Forward both as an individual team and as a team working with another as part of the Intersection instructions. Teams that win the Fast Forward are not guaranteed a first-place finish for that leg and still face elimination if they arrive at the Pit Stop last. Multiple teams may undertake Fast Forward tasks, but only the first team to complete the task gets credit. If a team fails to get the Fast Forward (either by quitting the task or being beaten to it), they must return and complete the leg as normal. This creates a risk in going for the Fast Forward and potentially losing time with the other teams for that leg.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene of}} Sniper Wolf {{wounding}} Meryl {{to set a}} trap for Snake was included among the top ten cutscenes in the Metal Gear series by Jeremy M. Loss of Joystick Division in 2010 and ranked as the seventh most shocking surprise in video games ("subverting the power fantasy") by George Reith of GamingBolt in 2012. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole noted how the [...] "brillantly manipulative" [...] Metal Gear Solid can make the player feel guilty, even as [...] "it {{makes no sense to}} wish that you hadn't killed Sniper Wolf — that is, [...] properly to regret your actions — because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>task</b> that the game demands be fulfilled before you can progress." [...] In 2012, Ryan King of PLAY included the character of Sniper Wolf among the six [...] "things you didn’t want to kill (but you did anyway)" [...] and Ian Dransfield from the same magazine included her among the top [...] "bad guys you wanted to win". In 2015, Aleksander Gilyadov from VentureBeat included Sniper Wolf's death among six most memorable Metal Gear moments opining it [...] "still remains {{as one of the most}} poignant and beautiful scenes in the entire series. It also displays just how multilayered, benign, and well-written Kojima’s characters (both heroes and villains) really are." [...] That same year, Javy Gwaltney from Paste had this scene top his list of the saddest moments in Metal Gear.|$|E

2500|$|Task {{partitioning}} {{refers to}} the division of one task into sequential actions done {{by more than one}} individual. The focus here is on the task, and its division, rather than on the individuals performing it.

[...] In this case, individual bees often focus on either uncapping or removing diseased brood. [...] Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.|$|E
