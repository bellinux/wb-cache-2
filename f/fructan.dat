40|$|AbstractFructans {{have been}} implicated in the abiotic stress {{tolerance}} of many plant species, including grasses and cereals. To elucidate the possibility that cereal <b>fructans</b> may stabilize cellular membranes during dehydration, we used liposomes as a model system and isolated <b>fructans</b> from oat (Avena sativa) and rye (Secale cereale). <b>Fructans</b> were fractionated by preparative size exclusion chromatography into five defined size classes (degree of polymerization (DP) 3 to 7) and two size classes containing high DP <b>fructans</b> (DP> 7 short and long). They were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The effects of the <b>fructans</b> on liposome stability during drying and rehydration were assessed as {{the ability of the}} sugars to prevent leakage of a soluble marker from liposomes and liposome fusion. Both species contain highly complex mixtures of <b>fructans,</b> with a DP up to 17. The two DP> 7 fractions from both species were unable to protect liposomes, while the fractions containing smaller <b>fructans</b> were protective to different degrees. Protection showed an optimum at DP 4 and the DP 3, 4, and 5 fractions from oat were more protective than all other fractions from both species. In addition, we found evidence for synergistic effects in membrane stabilization in mixtures of low DP with DP> 7 <b>fructans.</b> The data indicate that cereal <b>fructans</b> have the ability to stabilize membranes under stress conditions and that there are size and species dependent differences between the <b>fructans.</b> In addition, mixtures of <b>fructans,</b> as they occur in living cells may have protective properties that differ significantly from those of the purified fractions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fructans</b> are polyfructose {{molecules}} {{produced by}} approximately 15 % of the flowering plant species. It is possible that, {{in addition to}} being a storage carbohydrate, <b>fructans</b> have other physiological roles. Owing to their solubility they may help plants survive periods of osmotic stress induced by drought or cold. To investigate the possible functional significance of <b>fructans,</b> use was made of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants that accumulate bacterial <b>fructans</b> and hence possess an extra sink for carbohydrate. Biomass production was analyzed during drought stress with the use of lines differing only in the presence of <b>fructans.</b> Fructan-producing tobacco plants performed significantly better under polyethylene-glycol-mediated drought stress than wild-type tobacco. The growth rate of the transgenic plants was significantly higher (+ 55 %), as were fresh weight (+ 33 %) and dry weight (+ 59 %) yields. The difference in weight was observed in all organs and was particularly pronounced in roots. Under unstressed control conditions the presence of <b>fructans</b> had no significant effect on growth rate and yield. Under all conditions the total nonstructural carbohydrate content was higher in the transgenic plants. We conclude that the introduction of <b>fructans</b> in this non-fructan-producing species mediates enhanced resistance to drought stress...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} breads {{on the market}} that boast having no high {{fructose}} corn syrup. [...] In lieu of high fructose corn syrup, however, one may find the production of special breads with a high inulin content, where inulin is a replacement in the baking process for the following: high fructose corn syrup, flour and fat. [...] Because of the caloric reduction, lower fat content, dramatic fiber increase and prebiotic tendencies of the replacement inulin, these breads are considered a healthier alternative to traditionally prepared leavening breads. [...] Though the touted health benefits may exist, sufferers of fructose malabsorption will likely find no difference between these new breads and traditionally prepared breads in alleviating their symptoms because inulin is a <b>fructan,</b> and, again, consumption of fructans should be reduced dramatically in those with fructose malabsorption {{in an effort to}} appease symptoms.|$|E

40|$|The main {{water-soluble}} carbohydrates in temperate {{forage grasses}} are polymeric <b>fructans.</b> <b>Fructans</b> consist of fructose chains of various chain lengths attached to sucrose as a core molecule. In grasses, <b>fructans</b> are a complex mixture {{of a large}} number of isomeric oligomers with a degree of polymerisation ranging from 3 to > 100. Accurate monitoring and unambiguous peak identification requires chromatographic separation coupled to mass spectrometry. The mass range of ion trap mass spectrometers is limited, and we show here how monitoring selected multiply charged ions can be used for the detection and quantification of individual isomers and oligomers of high mass, particularly those of high degree of polymerization (DP[*]>[*] 20) in complex plant extracts. Previously reported methods using linear ion traps with low mass resolution have been shown to be useful for the detection of <b>fructans</b> with a DP up to 49. Here, we report a method using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap MS which greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and allows the detection of <b>fructans</b> up to DP[*]=[*] 100. High-sugar (HS) Lolium perenne cultivars with high concentrations of these <b>fructans</b> have been shown to be of benefit to the pastoral agricultural industry because they improve rumen nitrogen use efficiency and reduce nitrous oxide emissions from pastures.

The concentrations of sucrose, fructose and oligomeric <b>fructans</b> remained roughly constant over the same period. However, in early October, important changes occurred over a very short period. These changes included: (1) a significant increase in fructose concentration; (2) an increase in the concentration of <b>fructans</b> with a low DP; (3) a decrease in <b>fructans</b> with a high DP; (4) an appearance-of alternative peaks (probably representing <b>fructans</b> without terminal glucose); and (5) an increase in sucrose concentration.

40|$|Recent data {{reported}} that inulin-type <b>fructans</b> extracted from chicory roots regulate appetite and lipid/glucose metabolism, namely, by promoting glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) {{production in the}} colon.

Therefore, we decided to evaluate in parallel the effect of supplementation with 10 % agave or chicory <b>fructans</b> on glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. Male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice were fed a standard (STD) diet or diet supplemented with Raftilose P 95 (RAF), <b>fructans</b> from Agave tequilana Gto.
