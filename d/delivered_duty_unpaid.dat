40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to searching the {{potential}} ofthe maritime traffic in the Black Sea, the good application of the INCOTERMS in this region and the opportunities of maritime transport with the others seas. The research project conducted in this thesis uses qualitative methods: interviews with people that working in the maritime transport in the Black Sea that were made through e-mail to get a practical view on the topic, statistics and studies makes by me in the practice. The results indicate {{that there are no}} outstanding obstacles {{for the development of the}} commercial maritime traffic in the Black Sea and that the maritime companies of the world are very interested to start a large process to export and import in this region, ofcourse applying correct the INCOTERMS. Also, we analyze in this study the im portance of the Bosporus Strait that connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterrean Sea and offers big opportunities to the global maritime transport. The studies in this field of maritime traffic conducted us to find out what are the standards in the maritime trade in the Black Sea but also in comparison with the Mediterrean Sea, Baltic Sea and Caspian Sea. The Black Sea basin presents various challenges and offers numerous opportunities. Ps a result, its development requires special consideration by policy makers. The central question of this paper is given the difference in legal and political systems in the presence, more geo strategically considerations, building on the commercial development from existing business practices. Mercantile custom plays an important role in international commercial law, whether that is as a source of or merelyas an element of the new law merchant. Trade usages and practices tend to be linked to a specific location, trade or port in which they are used. Es pecially in the context of trade term s, differences in interpretation detract from their harmonization function. The latest edition of the ICC INCOTERMS was carried out in 2010 when the INCOTERMS. Two major innovations are the num ber of rules and their classification. Under previous INCOTERM revis ions, term s were grouped in order of increasing responsibilityon the seller, now were classified according to the mode of trans port. There are 11 rules instead of 13. INCOTERMS 2010 includes two new rules, Delivered atTerminal (DAT) and Delivered at Place (DAP), and eliminates the Delivered at Frontier (DAF), Delivered Ex-Ship (DES), Delivered Ex-Quay (DEQ) and <b>Delivered</b> <b>Duty</b> <b>Unpaid</b> (DDU) designations. DAT replaces the current DEQ, while DAP replaces DAF, DES and DDU. The option of applying one or another INCOTERM of the delivery conditions or practices known worldwide should consider a number of criteria, such as the following: the ratio of currency and foreign currency contract for payment of transportation, insurance and other charges related to delivery; market situation and the charges of air and land transport, participation in international conventions on transport, which involves preferential rates oftransport, customs outlets in markets or supplies. In the case of a saturated market, where there is a strong competition, the exporter can earn a segment of this market, providing certain favorable conditions to the importer within the meaning of risk and minimal costs that the latter must bear. Delivery condition is one of the essential terms are agreed between international contract partners, thereby regulating the transfer actually goods and the seller to the buyer risks, including legal consequences and general economic. Since the implementation ofthe each entry in the various delivery methods, costs, which can't be neglected, their enrollment contract specifications require is especially importantto establish who and what pays any omission of this view mayor cancel benefits buying or selling expected at closing. We hope that this thesis may be able to help the future importers and exporters in the global maritime traffic...|$|E

Work time control moderated the negative impact that frequent night working had upon sleep quantity and sleep disturbance. For participants who never worked long shifts, work time control was associated with fewer short sleeps, {{but this was not}} the case for those who did work long shifts. Optimizing the balance between schedule flexibility and patient needs could enhance physicians' sleep when working the night shift, thereby reducing their levels of fatigue and enhancing patient care...|$|R

The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to <b>deliver</b> <b>duty</b> as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design.

50|$|The upsurge {{that started}} in 1956 {{was not to be}} long-lasting. In 1960, the orchestra’s board found itself {{relapsing}} into financial difficulties, partly due to a high inflation which annually reduced the Icelandic króna’s purchasing power by around 10%. Attendance to concerts remained moderate and earnings were negligible. In February 1961, the board decided to seek renewed ties with RÚV and reshape the ISO as a de facto department of the radio. The board was divided on the issue and chairman Jónsson was opposed to the shift. The final result, however, was a rearrangement of the orchestra as a subdivision of RÚV. The arrangement was intended as a temporary solution but remained unchanged until 1982 when Alþingi passed a law on the ISO. Collaboration with Þjóðleikhúsið remained virtually unchanged until 1971 when a contract was made between the two institutions, loosening the ISO’s players from their former <b>duties</b> as <b>unpaid</b> participants in the theatre’s performances.|$|R

3000|$|Employees’ {{perceptions}} of HPWS do not depend exclusively on objective {{characteristics of the}} human resource system but also on social constructions of the information available to {{them at the time}} they make judgments (Griffin et al. 1987). Because managers serve as key human resource agents in organizations (Pak and Kim 2016), employees’ interpretations of the HPWS are largely affected by their managers (Den Hartog et al. 2013; Shin and Konrad 2017). When <b>delivering</b> <b>duties</b> such as selecting, appraising, developing, communicating, and involving, managers provide information about what is expected and what is appropriate behavior (Huo, Boxall and Cheung 2018). To attain the desired effects of HPWS, managers as practice deliverers must communicate adequate and unambiguous information to create a perception of the human resource system as high in distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus (Bowen and Ostroff 2004). However, different {{perceptions of}} HPWS may emerge among employees because line managers differ in how they implement human resources practices (Den Hartog et al. 2013). Managers {{may not be able to}} or be willing to send consistent messages because of their differentiated abilities, skills, and leadership styles (Khilji and Wang 2006; Wright and Nishii 2013; Zbaracki 1998). As a result, HPWS perceived or experienced may vary significantly with the information employees extract from managers’ behaviors. As Bowen and Ostroff (2004, p. 206) assert: “all human resource practices communicate messages constantly and in unintended ways, and messages can be understood idiosyncratically, whereby two employees interpret the same practices differently.” [...]...|$|R

5000|$|In 2008, Oleg Navalny made {{an offer}} to Yves Rocher Vostok, the Eastern European {{subsidiary}} of Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012, to accredit Glavpodpiska, which was created by Navalny, with <b>delivering</b> <b>duties.</b> On August 5, the parties signed a contract. To fulfill the obligations under the agreement, Glavpodpiska outsourced the task to sub-suppliers, AvtoSAGA and Multiprofile Processing Company (MPC). In November and December 2012, the Investigating Committee interrogated and questioned Yves Rocher Vostok. On December 10, Bruno Leproux, general director of Yves Rocher Vostok, filed to the Investigative Committee, asking to investigate if the Glavpodpiska subscription company had damaged Yves Rocher Vostok, and the Investigative Committee initiated a case. The prosecution claimed Glavpodpiska embezzled money by taking duties and then redistributing them to other companies for lesser amounts of money, and collecting the surplus: 26.7 million rubles ($540,000) from Yves Rocher Vostok, and 4.4 million rubles from the MPC. The funds were claimed to be subsequently legalized by transferring them on fictitious grounds from a fly-by-night company to Kobyakovskaya Fabrika Po Lozopleteniyu, a willow weaving company founded by Navalny and operated by his parents. Navalnys denied the charges. The brothers' lawyers claimed, the investigators [...] "added phrases like 'bearing criminal intentions' to a description of regular entrepreneurial activity". According to Oleg Navalny's lawyer, Glavpodpiska did not just collect money, it controlled provision of means of transport, execution of orders, collected and expedited production to the carriers, and was responsible before clients for terms and quality of executing orders.|$|R

40|$|Sovereignty in {{contemporary}} international relations {{is facing a}} number of key nomiative challenges. The anarchic precepts of the Hobbesian system are too narrow {{to meet the demands of}} the international community. The cosmopolitan approach to international relations is one which is equipped to deal with these problems and an evolution of sovereignty may be seen to be occurring. The foundation of the International Criminal Court asserts the necessity for universal individual responsibility and, as such, pierces the shell of sovereignty. The 'climate change regime' questions a state's responsibilities to other states, peoples and individuals under the guise of 'trans-border obligations', whilst the case for according rights to indigenous peoples examines the sovereign state's ability to protect and welcome diversity within its borders whilst simultaneously remaining within a cosmopolitan framework. All three case studies ask questions of the sovereign state’s ability to deliver an acceptable level of justice for each global citizen. These three challenges are met via recourse to the theories of Andrew Linklater and John Rawls, in particular. What is argued for is a consistent notion of 'thin cosmopolitanism' which is able to guarantee fundamental rights for every individual. The idea of 'spatio-temporal justice', a concept which <b>delivers</b> <b>duties</b> and rights according to previous activities and policies, is also explicated. Spatio-temporal justice is viewed as a coherent liberal approach which is nevertheless able to accord different rights to different individuals on the basis of historical, economic and culture situatedness. Despite the intransigence of an international system embedded in notions of power politics and game theoretic elements, elements of cosmopolitanism can be seen to be emerging with regard to all three case studies and, indeed, in the wider international political life...|$|R

50|$|Vimala Devi {{was born}} in 1932 {{in the village of}} Britona in the parish of Penha de França, across the Mandovi river from Panjim, the {{principal}} town of Goa. At that time, large tracts of land in Britona were owned by Devi's family, which belonged to the elite Catholic Bamon or brahmin caste bhatkar landowners. The bhatkar class owned land and the labour of the mundkar class of lower-caste inhabitants in what was essentially a feudal relationship. Although this rural aristocracy was still predominant at this time, this was the period when the decline of the land-owning class first began to set in, a theme that appears in Devi's later fiction. After Goa's incorporation into India laws were passed giving the mundkar workers rights to the lands on which they had always lived and worked and abolishing their <b>duty</b> to provide <b>unpaid</b> labour to the bhatkar landowners.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Commonly, {{public transit}} agencies, {{with a view}} toward efficiency, aim at {{minimizing}} the number of vehicles in use to meet passenger demand, and therefore at reducing crew cost. This work contributes to achieving these two objectives by proposing the use of two predom-inant characteristics of public-transit operations planning: (a) different resource requirements between peak and off-peak periods, and (b) working during irregular hours. These character-istics result in split <b>duties</b> (shifts) with <b>unpaid</b> in-between periods. The outcome of this work is an optimal solution for maximizing the unpaid shift periods with the assurance of complying with the minimum number of vehicles attained. The optimization problem utilizes a highly informative graphical technique (deficit function) for finding the least number of vehicles; this enables the construction of vehicle chains (blocks) that take into account maximum unpaid shift periods. The latter consideration is intended to help construct crew schedules at mini-mum cost. The methodology developed was implemented by two large bus companies and resulted in a significant cost reduction...|$|R

Experiments with O, Ar, Xe and mainly with Pb were performed at the new ECR injector setup (EIS) which is a copy of the HLI injection beam line. Different RF pulse lengths and repetition rates were compared to optimise the respective afterglow intensities. For Pb two different types of ovens were investigated and modifications of the extraction system were applied. Thus peak intensities in the afterglow for 208 Pb 27 + of up to 200 emA could be obtained. Stable operation for time periods of several days could be achieved at reduced intensity level.
