50|$|Gola Bazar is a mohalla in Sherghati sub {{division}} of Gaya District in Bihar. This {{is the main}} market for the villagers that come from the surrounding villages of Sherghati. It {{can be regarded as}} the backbone of sherghati's whole economy, operated by a bunch of millionaire businessmen. It is the location of the Sheo Naryan Flour and Oil Mills that used to function a <b>few</b> <b>decade</b> back in Sherghati.

40|$|Abstract: In simulation-based optimization, we {{seek the}} optimal {{parameter}} settings that minimize or maximize certain performance {{measures of the}} simulation system. In this paper, we use a two-phase approach to calibrate simulation parameters using classification tools. This classification-based method is used in Phase I to facilitate the global search process and it is followed by local optimization in Phase II. By learning knowledge from existing data the approach identifies potentially high-quality parameter settings. We present an example of its use on a Wisconsin breast cancer simulation. 1.

5|$|As a graduate, Nicholas {{is first}} found active at St Andrews in the entourage of Gamelin, Bishop of St Andrews, in 1259. He {{does not appear}} very often in any witness lists during the {{following}} <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> but does appear along with other St Andrews clerics witnessing a charter of William, Earl of Mar at Falkland on 21 January 1268.|$|E
5|$|At the settlement, Hudson {{and his men}} built a {{home and}} the township's {{population}} increased steadily over the next <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b> Hudson's wife and children eventually moved to the township, where they had two more children.

5|$|Bigg's {{techniques}} {{also revealed}} the Pacific Northwest population {{was in the}} low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1920s, American Robert Goddard was {{developing}} liquid-propellant rockets, which would in a <b>few</b> brief <b>decades</b> become {{a critical component}} in the designs of such famous rockets as the V-2 and Saturn V.|$|R
5|$|Blackstone's Ratio is a maxim of English law, {{having been}} {{established}} as such within a <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> of Blackstone's work being published. It is also cited in courts and {{law in the}} US, and is strongly emphasised to American law students.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is a {{relatively}} rare neoplasm that is classified as an adenocarcinoma (a cancer that forms glands or secretes significant amounts of mucins). It has an annual incidence rate of 1–2 cases per 100,000 in the Western world, but rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide over the past <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the canonic {{status of}} Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin is often {{characterized}} as an under-recognized {{or even as}} a forgotten author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) over the last <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> he is much less well known by the reading public than other representatives of German modernism such as Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, or Franz Kafka.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Constitution of India has {{recognized}} 22 languages as official languages of India. Among these {{most of the}} recognition research {{work has been done}} for Devanagari, Gurumukhi, Telugu, and Bangla scripts etc. OCR system development for Indian script has many application areas like preserving manuscripts and ancient literatures written in different Indian scripts and making digital libraries for the documents. Feature extraction and classification are essential steps of character recognition process affecting the overall accuracy of the recognition system. This paper gives a detailed overview of different feature extraction and classification techniques for recognition process of different Indian scripts by the researchers over the past <b>few</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R
50|$|Earthquakes of {{magnitude}} 4.5 or greater are fairly infrequent in the area, occurring {{at a rate}} of a <b>few</b> per <b>decade.</b> Some studies suggest, however, that larger earthquakes {{of magnitude}} around 7 may have occurred 4550 and 7060 years BP.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In today's {{environment}} each {{persons and}} computer are connected with network, a new entity has evolved: skilled agent software. Over the past <b>few</b> <b>decade</b> agents {{have emerged as}} a new software paradigm; they are in part distributed systems, autonomous programs and artificial life. The concept of agents is an outgrowth of years {{of research in the}} fields of AI and robotics. They represent concepts of reasoning, knowledge representation, and autonomous learning. Agents are automated programs and provide tools for integration across multiple applications and database running across open and closed networks. They are a means of retrieving, filtering, managing, monitoring, analysing and disseminating information over the Internet, intranets and other proprietary networks...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{fascination with the}} novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), and a new edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977. The last <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> have however seen a resurgence of critical interest in the novel.|$|E
5|$|First the {{machines}} {{will do a}} lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{changes taking place}} in the world and in Turkey, have led to changes in people’s employment demand. Before 2000 government jobs had been considerably less attractive in Turkey, after 2000, w hen the economic crisis occurred in Turkey public employment demands started to increase. One of the reasons for this that {{a growing number of people}} have started to face the unemployment situation that made the formerly less desired public employment more alluring. Beyond employment security there have been also reasons Turkish people choosing to work for government. The goal of this paper how employment demand of Turkish people is changing. Based on last <b>few</b> <b>decade's</b> employment data the paper, will try to shed some light on the reasons behind the related new labor market tendencies...|$|R
50|$|Whether Abu Bakr {{intended}} a full-out imperial conquest {{or not is}} hard to say; he did, however, set {{in motion}} a historical trajectory that in just a <b>few</b> short <b>decades</b> would lead to one of the largest empires in history, starting with a confrontation with the Persian Empire under the general Khalid ibn al-Walid.|$|R
5|$|The 1592 date {{remained}} the established one until the 19th century. In the 1870s, however, several publications corrected the dating {{and within a}} <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> 1535 became the generally accepted date. The painting's correct historical context was finally laid bare {{with the publication of}} the censored manuscript from the Vasa Chronicle in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{environment}} of Pushkar Lake and its precincts {{has become increasingly}} degraded in the last <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b> The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities {{as well as the}} deforestation of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of Sakurai's Object are {{quite similar to}} that of V605 Aquilae. V605, discovered in 1919, is the only other known star observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and Sakurai's Object is modeled to increase in temperature in the next <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> to match the current state of V605.|$|E
50|$|After Mir Imaduddin’s martyr, {{his family}} members {{including}} his son Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut) remained in Ranthambore for <b>few</b> more <b>decades.</b> According to Tarikh-i-Firuz_Shahi by Ziauddin Barani, {{the families that}} belonged {{in the period of}} Sultan Iltutmish and remained in the period of Ghiyas ud din Balban were also from ancestors of Syed Chajju.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, {{they began}} to amass a large fan base in Europe, {{particularly}} in Scandinavia where they recorded Swedish songs mixing English and Swedish. Meanwhile, their fame was diminishing in America, so in 1956, the group relocated to Europe and performed there for a <b>few</b> more <b>decades.</b> Billy Moore toured with them as an accompanist in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, sea trade in New York {{shifted to the}} deeper {{channels}} of the Hudson River, and the streets along the East River shore were developed with factories, and later with tenements housing various immigrant communities. The waterfront block of South Street opposite Pier 42 lingered on as an industrial area for a <b>few</b> more <b>decades.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{television}} programmes have included references to Aston Villa {{over the past}} <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b> In the sitcom Porridge, the character Lennie Godber is a Villa supporter. When filming began on Dad's Army, Villa fan Ian Lavender was allowed to choose Frank Pike's scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a claret and blue one—Aston Villa's colours. The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, astronomers {{believed}} Sakurai's Object to be a slow nova. Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova, but had instead undergone a very late thermal pulse similar to that of V605 Aquilae, causing it to vastly expand. V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> will follow a similar life cycle.|$|E

40|$|Mars is a {{compelling}} astrobiological target, and ahuman mission would {{provide an opportunity to}} collect immense amounts of scientific data. Exploration alone, however, cannot justify the increased risk. Instead, three factors drive ahuman mission: economics, education, and exploration. Ahuman mission has a unique potential to inspire the next generation of young people to enter critically needed science and engineering disciplines. A mission is economically feasible, and the research and development program put in place for ahuman mission would propel growth in related high-technology industries. The main hurdles are human physiological responses to 1 – 2 years of radiation and microgravity exposure. However, enabling technologies are sufficiently mature in these areas that they can be developed within a <b>few</b> <b>decade</b> timescale. Hence, the decision of whether or not to undertake ahuman mission to Mars is a political decision, and thus, educational and economic benefits are the crucial factors...|$|R
