40|$|Based on {{the field}} investigations, this paper {{analyzes}} systematically the achievements and problems of constructing the <b>demonstrating</b> areas of the ecological rebuilding and economic sustainable development in Hexi, Gansu Province, and then the thoughts on constructing the <b>demonstrating</b> areas are brought forward. It is considered that all kinds of ecological <b>demonstrating</b> areas should be merged in order to construct large-scale characterized <b>demonstrating</b> areas which go beyond the district. In other words, in Hexi Region, Zhangye District should be constructed as the largest ecoagriculture <b>demonstrating</b> area of high technology; Wuwei District should be constructed as the largest ecological <b>demonstrating</b> area of agricultural comprehensive exploitation; JiuJia District, which is the shortened form of Jiuquan and Jiayuguan, should be constructed as the largest ecotourism <b>demonstrating</b> area; and Jinchang City should be constructed as the largest ecoindustry <b>demonstrating</b> area. At the same time, the constructing pattern should be selected according to the actual circumstances; science and technology should be applied to construct the <b>demonstrating</b> areas and accelerate the industrialization in the big market. Additionally, {{it is important to}} smooth the constructing system and implement the flexible and efficacious running mechanism, and it is suggested that the committee should be organized to administer the ecological <b>demonstrating</b> areas in Hexi Region...|$|R
40|$|While {{electroluminescence}} {{has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> at terahertz frequencies from Si/SiGe quantum cascade emitters, to date no laser {{has been achieved}} due to poor vertical confinement of the optical mode. A method of increasing the vertical confinement of the optical mode for a Si/SiGe quantum cascade laser is <b>demonstrated</b> using silicon-on-silicide technology. Such technology is used with epitaxial growth to <b>demonstrate</b> a strain-symmetrised 600 period Si/SiGe quantum cascade interwell emission and the polarisation is used to <b>demonstrate</b> the optical confinement. Electroluminescence is <b>demonstrated</b> at ∼ 3 THz (∼ 100 μm) from an interwell quantum cascade emitter structure. Calculated model overlap and waveguide losses for ridge waveguides are comparable to values from GaAs quantum cascade lasers <b>demonstrated</b> at terahertz frequencies...|$|R
