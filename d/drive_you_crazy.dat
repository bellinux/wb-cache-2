5000|$|Analyzing a {{different}} verse, the composer says: He {{would go up}} to the very highest notes of the maqam, and he would do it with ease, enjoying himself. It is enough to <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> <b>crazy.</b> This man must have understood music very well, and must have meant what he was doing. He uses saba maqam at first to demonstrate huzn sadness, then moves to the C, or agam, and then he takes his voice high up the notes when he says al-samaa (the sky) If this were not a musician, then we the musicians know nothing, and must go home. He {{knew what he was doing}} and did it depending on his knowledge of the seven qira'at readings and his very special expressive ability.|$|E

5000|$|... "When I {{was writing}} {{some of the}} songs of the album I was {{very much aware of}} this contradiction between being an artist, being a musician, trying to be {{creative}} and write songs and, then, at the point you finish an album, the music is finished, the creative side is finished, you then {{have to go out and}} sell and market and promote. And that's like a completely different experience. It's not a very creative process. It's quite - in some ways - a cynical process going on having to sell your music. But you have to do it. I mean, if a modern musician is going to survive as a musician, you have to - in a sense - 'prostitute yourself' to try and sell your music and your art. And I was very much aware of that contradiction. If you think about that too much, it can <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> <b>crazy,</b> you know. It's an absurd thing to be doing. That kind of led me thinking about when I was a teenager, when I was just starting out and I was interested in being a musician. And I think a lot of teenage kids have this dream of being pop stars, of being a professional musician. This 'stupid dream' of being famous and 'life is a ball and everything is wonderful'. And, of course, actually the reality is that being a professional musician is a very hard work. It can be very heartbreaking, there's a lot of disappointment, there's a lot of hard work, there's a lot of travelling." ...|$|E
5000|$|Said Roth {{about his}} {{approach}} to the film: I love that book. Such a smart take on the zombie movie. I am so psyched to do it. I think you can really do almost a cross between the Dawn of the Dead remake with a Roland Emmerich approach (for {{lack of a better}} reference) where you show it happening all over the world. When the pulse hits, I wanna see it hit EVERYWHERE. In restaurants, in movie theaters, at sports events, all the places that people <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> <b>crazy</b> when theyre talking on their cell phones. I see total armageddon. People going crazy killing each other - everyone at once - all over the world. Cars smashing into each other, people getting stabbed, throats getting ripped out. The one thing I always wanted to see in zombie movies is the actual moment the plague hits, and not just in one spot, but everywhere. You usually get flashes of it happening around the world on news broadcasts, but you never actually get to experience it happening everywhere. Then as the phone crazies start to change and mutate, the story gets pared down to a story about human survival in the post-apocalyptic world ruled by phone crazies. Im so excited, I wish the script was ready right now so I could start production. But itll get written (or at least a draft will) while Im doing Hostel 2, and then I can go right into it. It should feel like an ultra-violent event movie.|$|E
40|$|According to Gaile McGregor, {{nature has}} largely been {{associated}} in Canada with a ''violent duality," that "is not accessible and [where] no mediation or reconciliation is possible. " Faced with an unexpected, unexplainable, and unimaginable wilderness, Americans, Annette Kolodny theorizes, fantasized the pastoral ideal-that nurturing feminine landscape-into daily reality, while Canadians, according to Northrop Frye, Margaret Atwood, Tom Marshall, D. G. Jones, W. H. New, Coral Ann Howells, and McGregor, erased pastoral expectations, {{and replaced them with}} stories of disaster and survival. Margaret. Atwood explores "the North," within this tradition, as a place "hostile to white men, but alluring" (19), as a place explored, experienced, and colonized almost exclusively by men. Atwood challenges us to examine women's wilderness writing in relation to masculinist texts that paint Canadian landscape as "a sort of icy and savage femme fatale who will <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> <b>crazy</b> and claim you for her own. " [...] In compliance with Kolodny's theories of "pastoral impulse," Lawrence Buell's and Terry Gifford's "post-pastoral," and Murphy's "proto/ecological literature," Michael Branch theorizes how the "topological imperative" demonstrates an American "need to have a culture develop in the greatness of the landscape" (284). Canadians, in contrast, seem to have developed a 'topological departure. ' Thus, for the Canadian scholar, ecocriticism poses many unique cultural and political complexities, and cannot be easily transplanted from Europe or America and applied to Canadian literature. Though Canadians write profusely about nature, in general, they do not reflect an eco-consciousness in a nature aesthetic that strives towards biotic community as Gary Snyder, W. S. Merwin, A. R. Ammons, and Wendell Berry have in the U. S. A. [...] I believe that an ecological consciousness {{can be found in the}} Canadian literary tradition-in both theory and literature-but that its continued love/hate relationship with nature stems from an inability to think outside of, or even aspire beyond, inherited European conventions. Focusing on, though not limited to women writers, this study explores the ways in which ecofeminist writers-as those who identify with the marginalized position of nature in society, and are likewise, identified with a mysterious and feared wilderness-environment-revisit the human-nature dynamic through an emerging Canadian (proto) ecological literary sub-genre...|$|E
