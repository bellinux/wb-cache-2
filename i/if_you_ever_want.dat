500|$|Musical {{performances}} in the episode attracted praise. Aly Semigran of MTV called Riley's rendition of [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] "goose bump-inducing", while Goldman commended: [...] "Riley absolutely killed it as Mercedes belted out that song". In contrast, Poniewozik wrote {{that it was the}} one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals [...] "amazing", and Flandez recommended: [...] "Watch it again <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>want</b> to take back three minutes of your life that you’ve wasted on something else." [...] Pardue called the group performance of [...] "You Can't Always Get What You Want" [...] "energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee", but felt it [...] "would have been nice" [...] to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred [...] "more vocal interplay between all group members". In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] one of Glee best performances, commenting: [...] "Glee has done Broadway many times, but rarely better than this." ...|$|E

Through a discussion of criticism ranging from post-structuralism to constructivism, I will argue that hypertext literature, specifically Michael Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s afternoon, a story and Shelley Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s Patchwork Girl, maps narratives like those the mind creates when forming and reading the text of one 2 ̆ 7 s reality and memory. ...|$|R

5000|$|Bigfoot was a low-budget {{production}} {{saddled with}} poor production values, including problems in casting {{as well as}} acting, but has other characteristics that mark it as a cult classic. Despite not being shown in traditional distribution, the film was reviewed by eminent film critic Roger Ebert, who said: [...] "The cast alone convinced me. Let me put it as simply as I can: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to see a movie}} starring John Carradine, Joi Lansing, Lindsay Crosby, Chris Mitchum, and Ken Maynard, then 'Big Foot' is almost certainly going to be your only chance. Not since Joan Crawford starred in 'Trog!' there been such an opportunity." [...] Ebert, however, was very much aware how hopeless Bigfoot was.|$|R
