5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest.

5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> DDL variants {{in parallel with}} Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability {{and an ability to}} operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E

5|$|British {{encroachment}} {{into areas}} of South Africa already settled by the Afrikaner Boers {{and the competition}} for resources and land that developed between them as a result, led to the Second Boer War in 1899. Pre-empting the deployment of British forces, the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic under President Paul Kruger declared war on 11 October 1899, striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony. After the outbreak of war, plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> colonial governments sent separate contingents to serve with British formations, with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria, and one each from the other colonies. The first troops arrived three weeks later, with the New South Wales Lancers—who had been training in England before the war, hurriedly diverted to South Africa. On 22 November, the Lancers came under fire {{for the first time}} near Belmont, and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them.|$|E
5|$|For a {{fortunate}} few though fortunes {{could be}} won 'with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains {{of some of}} the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru', noted one observer. Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new hot blast process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Baird's subsequently constructed numerous iron foundries in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The waste heap or 'bing' from the Baird's Gartsherrie works was said to be as large as the great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 until 1901, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> colonial governments was {{responsible}} for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s—including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units—they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China.|$|E
