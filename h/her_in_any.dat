5|$|The Fifth Circuit {{held that}} this {{interpretation}} of Section 7 was impermissible {{and refused to}} enforce the NLRB order. The Fifth Circuit followed {{the lead of the}} Seventh and Fourth circuits which had refused to enforce the NLRB's previous decisions in Mobil Oil Corp. and Quality Mfg. Co. respectively. The Fifth Circuit argued that no union presence was necessary in Collins' questioning because the company was not attempting to bargain with <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way. Additionally, the court argued that requiring a union representative any time the threat of discipline was present would extend the scope of the NLRA far too broadly. The NLRB appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E

Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E
500|$|Alfred North Whitehead {{was born}} in Ramsgate, Kent, England, in 1861. [...] His father, Alfred Whitehead, was a {{minister}} and schoolmaster of Chatham House Academy, a school for boys established by Thomas Whitehead, Alfred North's grandfather. [...] Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters, but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man. [...] Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> of his writings, and {{there is evidence that}} Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.|$|E

[...] Browne, however, thought her appearance was [...] "fun to watch". The Sunday Mail was also positive about Spears' performance, commenting that she [...] "does well, especially when you remember the dismal Crossroads." [...] Trent Vanegas of Pink is the New Blog said that doing the show was a [...] "great move" [...] for Spears. Television researcher Tim Brooks, the co-author of the 1979 book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, commented that Spears' role was a [...] "very {{good way to get}} her chops into comedy", in part because it is [...] "very out of type.

However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

The two {{were very close}} sporadically and then apart for lengthy periods when Garbo, annoyed by Mercedes' obsessive behavior, coupled with her own neuroses, ignored <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> case, they remained friends for thirty years during which time Garbo wrote de Acosta 181 letters, cards, and telegrams.

After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at [...] "the look in her eyes" [...] {{and ran to the}} front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began convulsing. He then twisted a wire coat hanger around her neck with vise-grip pliers until Schaefer's convulsions ceased. Lucinda Schaefer was denied her requests to pray before Bittaker and Norris killed her.|$|E

Defense attorney Joseph Cheshire responded to the news by saying that if the book was truthful, [...] "I think it would be fabulous, and I don't think anybody would think badly about <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way, shape or form", but that if the memoir did not acknowledge the falsity of her allegations against the players, that he would advise them to initiate civil action against her. Her book was published later that year. In it, she continued to contend that she had been raped at the party and that the dropping of the case was politically motivated.

[...] Andy Kellam for AllMusic likened the song's chorus to that of Adele [...] "Rolling in the Deep".

2500|$|In 1977, after {{extending}} {{the state of}} emergency twice, Indira Gandhi called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. Gandhi may have grossly misjudged her popularity [...] by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>any</b> case, she was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. The alliance was made up of right-wing Hindu leaning Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and Charan Singh's Bharatiya Kranti Dal representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between [...] "democracy and dictatorship." [...] The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna and Nandini Satpathy were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD (Congress for Democracy), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and Sanjay Gandhi both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the Janata Party under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan. The other leaders of the Janata Party were Charan Singh, Raj Narain, George Fernandes and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.|$|E
