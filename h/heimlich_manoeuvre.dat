5000|$|Abdominal thrusts (also {{called the}} Heimlich {{maneuver}} or <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> [...] ) {{is a first}} aid procedure used to treat upper airway obstructions (or choking) by foreign objects. The term Heimlich maneuver is named after Dr. Henry Heimlich, who first described it in 1974.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} establishing an airway by a paramedic service {{in terms of}} pre-hospital emergency care. Considering unexpected accidents and life-threatening situations, securing the airway {{is one of the}} most important performances in pre-hospital care. Proper airway securing covers both effective ventilation and oxygenation. It is not always possible to secure using usual techniques. Therefore, alternative methods of airway management are introduced in this thesis as well. The theoretical part is concerned with the airway management. The first chapter aims at the historical background and describes the development of airway securing techniques. Following parts provide with a short introduction to the anatomy and physiology of the human respiratory tract. The thesis describes the concept of pre-hospital care and competencies of a paramedic. It focuses on airway management with or without medical devices and characterizes the main techniques, such as, the oral cavity examination, head-tilt method, the triple airway <b>manoeuvre</b> and <b>Heimlich</b> and Gordon <b>manoeuvres.</b> Regarding airway devices, the thesis mentions pharyngeal airway, combitube, laryngeal tube and laryngeal mask, I-gel, endotracheal intubation and alternative airway securing including coniotomy and laryngectomy. The last chapter of the theoretical part deals with the modes of artificial ventilation. The practical part compares the options of airway management and monitors the level of theoretical knowledge of airway establishing among emergency paramedics in South Bohemia, Central Bohemia and Pilsen Region...|$|R
5000|$|Lychee Mini Fruity Gels {{have been}} implicated {{in a number of}} deaths and choking {{injuries}} in the US and Pacific Rim countries. While choking on candy and other foodstuffs is not uncommon, the gel nature means that these candies totally block the airway and the konnyaku gel is [...] "ten times stronger" [...] than gelatin. [...] Research shows that [...] "hard, round foods with high elasticity or lubricity properties, or both, pose a significant level of risk," [...] especially to children under three years old. [...] The candies can resist attempts to dislodge with the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b>|$|E
50|$|Omar has {{a change}} of heart, feeling guilt about {{manipulating}} the easily led Waj into dying for a cause he doesn't understand, and attempts to prevent the attack. Police snipers receive Omar's description and shoot {{at him as he}} attempts to blend in with the runners, but mistakenly kill a bystander in a similar costume instead. Omar eventually contacts Waj from his mobile phone but is attacked by Barry, who swallows the phone's SIM card. However, Barry begins to choke on it, provoking a passer-by to carry out the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and in the process detonate his bomb, killing them both as Omar flees.|$|E
40|$|A fatal case of gastric rupture {{following}} the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> is reported. This life-threatening complication {{has only been}} reported previously in seven patients with a high mortality rate. All patients should be assessed immediately following this manoeuvre for any potentially life-threatening complications...|$|E
40|$|Oesophageal {{perforation}} following blunt {{trauma is}} rare and accounts {{for less than}} 10 % of all oesophageal ruptures. Review of published reports revealed only two cases of isolated oesophageal perforation after minor blunt trauma, and these were {{as a direct result}} of the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> This paper describes a case of perforation of the oesophagus as an isolated injury following blunt minor trauma...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> is a {{well-known}} intervention {{for the management of}} choking due to foreign body airway occlusion, but the evidence base for guidance on this topic is limited and guidelines differ. We measured pressures during abdominal thrusts in healthy volunteers. The angle at which thrusts were performed (upthrust vs circumferential) did not affect intrathoracic pressure. Self-administered abdominal thrusts produced similar pressures to those performed by another person. Chair thrusts, where the subject pushed their upper abdomen against a chair back, produced higher pressures than other manoeuvres. Both approaches should be included in basic life support teaching...|$|E
40|$|A 78 -year-old man {{presented}} to the {{accident and emergency department}} (A&E) having choked on a bacon sandwich at lunch. A paramedic crew had attempted the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> but was unsuccessful. On admission, he was cyanosed and unresponsive with saturations of 85 % of 15 litres of oxygen. He was acidotic. Chest examination revealed left upper zone crepitations. Chest x-ray showed bilateral haziness more on the left upper lobe. He was treated with high flow oxygen and back blows were attempted. An emergency laryngoscopy showed a large piece of bacon obstructing his airway and this was removed with McGill’s forceps. He was transferred to the high dependency unit (HDU) for 24 hours and discharged home the next day with a diagnosis of post-obstructive pulmonary oedema (POPE) secondary to foreign body aspiration. BACKGROUND This case illustrates that the pathophysiology of pulmonary oedema is not always the result of a low cardiac output, fluid overload or both. The cause in this case was heralded by an obstructed airway, most frequently seen in anaesthetics as a consequence of laryngospasm(1, 2). Fluid overload and low cardiac output do not feature in POPE, instead fluid leaks into the alveoli from the capillary beds supplying blood to the lungs. Diuretics and inotropes have not been proven to be helpful in the treatment of POPE, the management being supportive(3). CASE PRESENTATION A 78 -year-old gentleman {{presented to}} A&E after choking on a piece of bacon whilst eating lunch at Morrisons. He started choking at 1400 hrs and an ambulance was called at 1410 hrs. The ambulance crew attempted the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> but this was unsuccessful. On arrival to A&E at 1440 hrs, he had stridor and was struggling to breathe. He was cyanosed with saturations of 85 % on 15 litres of oxygen. His respiratory rate was 25 and...|$|E
40|$|Choking on {{aspirated}} food or {{a foreign}} body (i. e. meat, mushroom, coin, chewing gum and a balloon) {{is a common}} cause of laryngeal obstruction, particularly in those persons who are intoxicated by alcohol or who have bulbar palsy (degeneration of motor neurons in the brain stem nuclei of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve). The rima glottis in the larynx is an important site where aspirated food or material becomes lodged, thereby causing laryngeal obstruction (choking). Because the lungs still contain air, intentional compression thrusts to the abdomen (<b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre)</b> will theoretically expel air from the lungs and dislodge the entrapped food or other material. The manoeuvre {{can also be used}} to expel aspirated water from the airways in cases of near drowning. The manoeuvre has been found to be successful as an emergency adjunct measure in removing food blocking the airway. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Drowning {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death in children. Resuscitating a child {{following}} submersion is a highpressure situation, and standard operating procedures can reduce error. Currently, the Resuscitation Council UK guidance does not include a standard operating procedure on paediatric drowning. The objective of this project was to design a standard operating procedure to improve outcomes of drowned children. Methods: A literature review on the management of paediatric drowning was conducted. Relevant publications were used to develop a standard operating procedure for management of paediatric drowning. Results: A concise standard operating procedure was developed for resuscitation following paediatric submersion. Specific recommendations include: the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> should not be used in this context; however, prolonged resuscitation and therapeutic hypothermia are recommended. Conclusions: This standard operating procedure is a potentially useful adjunct to the Resuscitation Council UK guidance and should be considered for incorporation into its next iteration...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> is a {{technique}} aimed at clearing the 				windpipe when it has become blocked by a foreign body. It is a 				lifesaving manoeuvre, such that since it was first described it 				has been considered the simplest manoeuvre (it does not require 				technical media) that most lives has saved in the world. Easy to 				learn and use, it is recommended in all the manuals on Basic 				Life Support (although {{in the most recent}} guides it is not cited 				as such) for health staff and non-health workers alike; it would 				be good to see the learning of this technique spread farther 				afield, above all to those people prone to having to use it 				(health workers and first interventionists). Several films, 				often comedies, have included it in their plots and knowledge of 				the technique is important when considering its possible use for 				education and dissemination purposes. </span...|$|E
40|$|During near {{drowning}} victims usually swallow {{large quantities}} of water and air. Their stomachs often also contain food and drink consumed just prior to entering the water. Since drowning {{is a process of}} asphyxiation, the victim is frequently profoundly hypoxic. This combination of hypoxia and a full stomach is the cause of the vomiting that is very familiar to lifeguards and is an almost inevitable accompaniment of near drowning. This has been well documented in the literature. The Medical Commission of the International Life Saving Federation has carefully considered the management of near drowning, and in particular the use of upper abdominal thrusts (<b>Heimlich</b> <b>Manoeuvre)</b> to relieve airway obstruction. Because of the risk of precipitating gastro-oesophageal regurgitation and subsequent inhalation of stomach contents into the lungs, the Commission regards near drowning as an absolute contraindication to the use of upper abdominal thrusts unless a solid foreign body (not water) is present in the upper airway and cannot be dislodged by other means.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} choking incidents among the psychiatric population of 4 inpatient facilities, classifying the incidents according to their probable etiology. Method: All incidents recorded over 18 months were retrospectively analyzed for demographic variables, psychiatric and medical diagnoses, and drug therapy {{at the time of}} incident. Where possible, patients underwent psychiatric, neurological, and medical examination. Results: Thirty-one incidents were recorded involving 18 patients at a rate of one incident every 56. 32 months’ hospitalization per person. One case proved fatal, one patient died several weeks after the incident from aspiration pneumonia, and 5 patients needed reanimation or the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> Etiological classification showed that incidents due to bradykinetic dysphagia and “fast eating ” were the most numerous, even among the fatal or grave cases. Conclusions: Various simple, effective preventive measures emerge from the study. (Can J Psychiatry 1997; 42 : 515 – 520) Key Words: psychiatric institutions, psychiatric patients, airway obstruction, psychotropic drugs, eating habits Choking while swallowing food or drinks is a cause ofdeath that has long been known and studied among the psychiatric population. Most of the literature relates to psy...|$|E
40|$|To the Editor—We {{read with}} {{interest}} the editorial by Pak and van Hasselt. 1 They correctly warn {{of the danger of}} foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) and the need for urgent intervention. This should not include abdominal thrusts in infants however. The following advice is based on current guidelines for the management of the choking child from the European Resuscitation Council 2 and American Heart Association 3 : If the FBAO is mild, encourage the child to cough and observe. If the FBAO is severe, such that the child cannot effectively cough or make a sound, then immediate intervention is necessary. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be performed if the child is unresponsive, looking in the mouth before delivering breaths. If a foreign body is identified it should be removed under direct vision; blind finger sweeps should not be performed. For a conscious child over 1 year of age, the <b>Heimlich</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> is appropriate. For infants however, abdominal thrusts are no longer recommended because of the much higher risk to upper abdominal viscera. Instead, five back blows are alternated with five chest thrusts until the object is expelled or the victim loses consciousness...|$|E
