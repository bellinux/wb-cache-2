30|$|From Fig.  7, {{the energy}} dump cost ratio is various under {{different}} MIES structures. The <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> dump cost ratio shows the lower energy {{utilization of the}} MIES, while the lower energy dump cost ratio represents a <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> utilization of the MIES. The <b>highest</b> <b>energy</b> dump cost ratio is 2.5, which shows that energy use efficiency in MIES No. 9 is rather low.

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
