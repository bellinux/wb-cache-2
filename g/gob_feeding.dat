5000|$|The {{technology}} {{involved in}} this case concerned the manufacture of glass containers—notably, the [...] "gob feeder" [...] machinery for manufacturing jars, bottles, and other glass containers. The gob feed type of machine automatically makes glass containers by dropping a gob of molten glass through a hole into molds in a forming machine, {{the size and shape of}} the glass delivered being controlled by a mechanism known as a feeder machine; the feeder and the forming machine together constitute one fully automatic unit. At the time of the suit, Hartford-Empire Company owned or controlled all of the <b>gob</b> <b>feeding</b> patents in the glass container industry, and its business was the exploitation of these patents. Another type of machine is known as the [...] "suction" [...] machine, and it automatically sucks molten glass into a mold for blowing bottles.|$|E
50|$|From 1916 to 1924, {{competition}} arose between Hartford and Owens over gob feeder technology, including patent interferences {{and extensive}} litigation. In 1924, Hartford and Owens entered into an agreement giving Hartford an exclusive license on Owens's patents relating to feeders and forming machines, and giving Owens {{the right to}} use the Hartford patents for the manufacture of glassware. Owens was not to sell or license any of its <b>gob</b> <b>feeding</b> machinery and was not to engage in the pressed and blown glass fields that had previously been reserved to Corning. Owens received one-half of Hartford's licensing income over and above $600,000 per year. It was understood that Owens would be the only company operating with suction machinery. Hartford and Owen then proceeded to buy up the other patents in the glassware industry. Hazel-Atlas resisted Hartford and Owen until 1932, when Hartford, Owens and Hazel-Atlas entered into a series of agreements settling patent infringement litigation. Hartford granted to Hazel-Atlas {{the right to use}} Hartford patents and inventions, but Hazel-Atlas was not to license or sell such patents and inventions to anyone. Hazel-Atlas granted to Hartford the right to use Hazel-Atlas patents and inventions. Hazel-Atlas agreed to pay Hartford royalties {{for the use of the}} Hartford inventions. Hazel-Atlas was excluded from the pressed and blown field, which had previously been reserved to Corning. Hazel-Atlas and Owens were each to receive one-third of Hartford's licensing income over and above $850,000 per year. At this point the remaining opposition to Hartford collapsed and substantially everyone in the industry took a license from Hartford. By December 1939 when the Government brought this antitrust suit, only four small companies engaged in the manufacture of glassware were not under license and lease from Hartford; they represented less than 4% of the total production in the industry; and Hartford was suing three of them for patent infringement.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{purposes}} of the 1924 agreement between Hartford and Owens, the court found, [...] "was the elimination of competition between the <b>gob</b> <b>feed</b> process and the suction process." [...] There was no doubt, the court said, [...] "that one of the primary purposes in entering into the agreement was to divide the industry into two branches, to wit, suction, to be controlled by Owens, and <b>gob</b> <b>feed,</b> to be controlled by Hartford. Furthermore, {{as a result of the}} elimination of competition in the <b>gob</b> <b>feed</b> process, the industry could be stabilized. It would, of course, be futile to eliminate competition in the <b>gob</b> <b>feed</b> process if competition between the suction and gob processes was to continue." [...] A Hartford internal memorandum said: [...] " [...] H-F. shall restrict the issuance of further licenses in the container field in such manner [...] [...] [...] as shall preserve the general principle of preventing over plant-investment and over-production, as well as keeping the licenses out of the hands of objectionable and irresponsible parties. In like manner, Owens shall restrict the licensing of its suction feed and all developments thereof in such a way as to maintain a similar position." [...] Another Hartford memorandum said that [...] "this arrangement will practically divide the industry, so far as our two companies are concerned, into two branches—the suction process branch controlled by Owens and the <b>gob</b> <b>feed</b> branch controlled by H-F." [...] Given these and similar documents, the court said, it was not necessary for it [...] "to resort to inferences" [...] to ascertain the defendants' monopolistic intent.|$|R
25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form a bottle and generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used forming machine arrangement is the individual section machine (or IS machine). This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the <b>gobs</b> <b>feed</b> into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the blank moulds in parallel.|$|R
