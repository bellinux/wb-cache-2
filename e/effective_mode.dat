2500|$|For a laser in a nanocavity, {{spontaneous}} emission (SE) from the gain medium {{is enhanced by}} the Purcell effect, equal to the quality factor or Q-factor of the cavity divided by the <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> field volume, F = Q/Vmode. Therefore, reducing the volume of an optical cavity can dramatically increase this factor, which can {{have the effect of}} decreasing the input power threshold for lasing. This also means that the response time of {{spontaneous emission}} from a gain medium in a nanocavity also decreases, the result being that the laser may reach lasing steady state picoseconds after it starts being pumped. A laser formed in a nanocavity therefore may be modulated via its pump source at very high speeds. Spontaneous emission rate increases of over 70 times modern semiconductor laser devices have been demonstrated, with theoretical laser modulation speeds exceeding 100GHz, an order of magnitude higher than modern semiconductor lasers, and higher than most digital oscilloscopes.

2500|$|The new {{main line}} Midland Railway {{junction}} {{was brought into}} use on 21 February 1853, increasing {{the length of the}} C by 58 chains (about ¾ mile), and Bradshaw's Railway Manual of 1870 describes the whole undertaking as now running [...] "from Peak Forest Canal to the Cromford Canal, and to a junction with the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction". However, it took another decade before horse power on the High Peak Railway was entirely replaced by steam. [...] Following this connection, and the development of the Midland Line through to Manchester, more and more traffic took this route. Tonnage rates on the canal were lowered to attract trade, but competition was fierce, not helped by the eventual selling of the Cromford Canal to the Railway Company in 1852. A second collapse of the Butterley tunnel (2966yds) in 1900 - due to mining subsidence - rang the final death knell for the canal as an <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> of transport.

Their seeds, often enveloped in chaffy glumes, would be carried long distances by storms of wind, and even if finally dropped into the sea would have so much less distance to reach the land by means of surface currents; and Mr. Darwin's experiments show that even cultivated oats germinated after 100 days' immersion in sea-water. Others have hispid awns by which they would become attached to the feathers of birds, and there is no doubt this is an <b>effective</b> <b>mode</b> of dispersal. But a still more important point is, probably, that these plants are generally, if not always, wind-fertilised, and are thus independent of any peculiar insects, which might be wanting in the new country.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} nonadiabatic quantum {{dynamics}} of macrosystems with several coupled electronic states, {{taking into account}} the possibility of multi-state conical intersections. The general situation of an arbitrary number of states and arbitrary number of nuclear degrees of freedom (modes) is considered. The macrosystem is decomposed into a system part carrying a few, strongly coupled modes, and an environment, comprising the vast number of remaining modes. By successively transforming the modes of the environment, a hierarchy of effective Hamiltonians for the environment is constructed. Each effective Hamiltonian depends on a reduced number of <b>effective</b> <b>modes,</b> which carry cumulative effects. By considering the system's Hamiltonian along with a few members of the hierarchy, it is shown mathematically by a moment analysis that the quantum dynamics of the entire macrosystem can be numerically exactly computed on a given time-scale. The time scale wanted defines the number of effective Hamiltonians to be included. The contribution of the environment to the quantum dynamics of the macrosystem translates into a sequential coupling of <b>effective</b> <b>modes.</b> The wavefunction of the macrosystem is known in the full space of modes, allowing for the evaluation of observables such as the time-dependent individual excitation along modes of interest, as well a spectra and electronic-population dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in statistics education at the college level in the United States. This study employed meta-analysis to integrate the findings from 25 primary studies which met a specific set of criteria. The primary studies were selected from journal articles, ERIC documents, and dissertations. Results of the meta-analysis produced an overall effect size estimate of 0. 43, indicating a small to medium positive effect of applying CAI in teaching college-level introductory statistics on students' achievement. Several study characteristics were examined for the association with the effect magnitude. These characteristics included the publication year, the publication source, the educational level of participants, the mode of the CAI program, the type of CAI program, the level of interactivity of the CAI program, the instructional role of the CAI program, and the sample size. The results of the analogous analysis of variance showed that different modes of CAI programs produced significantly different effects on students' achievement in learning statistics. Expert systems and drill-and-practice programs were the most <b>effective</b> <b>modes</b> and were followed by multimedia, tutorials, and simulations. Computational statistical packages and web-based programs were the least <b>effective</b> <b>modes.</b> The teacher-made CAI programs were significantly more effective than the commercially-developed CAI programs.
