40|$|Abstract We {{propose to}} solve the IMRT {{optimization}} problem through a successive linear programming approach. Taking advantage of the sensitivity information in linear programming and the re-optimization ability of simplex methods, the proposed approach provides an affordable methodology to efficiently solve problems with dose-volume constraints. Preliminary computational results indicate that, compared to the standard weighted least squares approach, the new approach leads to higher tumor dosage escalation and better conformation. 1 Introduction For many years, radiation {{has been used as}} a treatment for cancer. Bombarding a malignant tumor with high-energy particles can destroy the cancerous cells or at least slow down their growth. Since tumors grow in the presence of healthy tissue and even near critical organs, it is usually impossible to irradiate the tumor without allowing some damage to the nearby critical organs. In fact, complications can occur when neighboring critical organs receive too much of this collateral radiation. Moderate damage to critical organs may be acceptable, however, if the effect can be accurately predicted, since cancerous cells do not have the ability to repair themselves as efficiently as normal cells. Therefore, an important research activity in radiotherapy is to develop methods of <b>escalating</b> <b>dosage</b> delivered to the tumor while carefully controlling the dosage deposited in neighboring critical organs and healthy tissues...|$|E

The peak stimulatory effect on urinary volume was observed within 1 to 2 h and {{was followed by a}} gradual decline at the 3 rd or 4 th h back to or even slightly below the corresponding control values. Thus, the duration of action averaged 3 - 4 h and only moderate rebound effects were detected. This time-related diuretic activity perfectly fitted with the pharmacokinetics data since torasemide plasma levels peaked at the 1 st h after drug administration and thereafter rapidly fell to less than 10 % of the maximal plasma concentrations after the 4 th h. While 2. 5 mg torasemide showed only minor diuretic action, urinary volume and urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and calcium increased linearly with the logarithm of the dose during the first 4 h as well as during the whole 24 h period with 5, 10 and 20 mg torasemide.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepine {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{has been reported}} following attempts to withdraw even from low or therapeutic doses and {{has been compared to}} barbiturate and alcohol withdrawal. This experience is known to deter patients from future cessation attempts. Research on other psychotropic substances shows that the reasons and motivations for withdrawal attempts - as well as the experiences surrounding those attempts - at least partially predict future efforts at discontinuation as well as relapse. We therefore aimed to qualitatively explore what motivates patients to discontinue this medication as well as to examine their experiences surrounding previous and current withdrawal attempts and treatment interventions in order to positively influence future help-seeking behavior and compliance. METHODS: To understand these patients better, we conducted a series of 41 unstructured, narrative, in-depth interviews among adult Swiss patients with a long-term dependent use of benzodiazepines in doses equivalent to more than 40  mg diazepam per day and/or otherwise problematic use (mixing benzodiazepines, <b>escalating</b> <b>dosage,</b> recreational use or illegal purchase). Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate findings. RESULTS: These high-dose benzodiazepine-dependent patients decision to change consumption patterns were affected by health concerns, the feeling of being addicted and social factors. Discontinuation attempts were frequent and not very successful with fast relapse. Withdrawal was perceived to be a difficult, complicated, and highly unpredictable process. The first attempt at withdrawal occurred at home and typically felt better than at the clinic. Inpatient treatment was believed to be more effective with long term treatment (approaches) than short term. Patients preferred gradual reduction of usage to abrupt cessation (and had experienced both). While no clear preferences for withdrawal were found for benzodiazepines with specific pharmacokinetic properties, participants frequently based their decision to participate in treatment on the availability of their preferred brand name and furthermore discarding equivalent dosage rationales. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide greater understanding of the factors that motivate high-dose benzodiazepine-dependent individuals to stop taking these medications, and how they experience withdrawal and treatment strategies.

Purified LPS from Salmonella abortus equi was administered to 11 patients with advanced solid tumors on a weekly schedule with intraindividually <b>escalating</b> <b>dosage</b> as determined by patient response. Biological response was monitored by complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and cytokine measurements at different time points after LPS injection.

Dose-limiting toxicities including chills and fever (WHO grade III) were reached at 1. 0 ng/kg of body weight (maximal tolerated dose- 1, MTD- 1). Pretreatment with ibuprofen (1, 600 mg) abrogated these side effects, allowing further escalation of LPS doses up to 10 ng/kg of body weight. At dose levels greater than 8. 0 ng/kg of body weight (MTD- 2), the aforementioned side effects occurred again and, additionally, hepatic toxicity (WHO grade III) was observed. Hematological changes included neutropenia followed by a pronounced neutrophilia contributed to by up to 30 % bands, marked monocytopenia for 3 h, and retarded lymphopenia. By 24 h, all hematological parameters returned to pretreatment values. TNF serum levels increased from 10 pg/ml before treatment to 7, 000 pg/ml as a function of dosage.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn {{this century}} most major medical {{advances}} {{have resulted in}} part from research on animals and non-human primates such as the African green monkey and therefore often serve as a critical link between basic research and human clinical application. Due to its close evolutionary relationship to humans, the African green monkey {{is known to be}} an excellent and most sought after models for studies of human cardiovascular disease (CVD). While the human genome project and some others related to model organisms are very well advanced or even complete, little sequence information has been acquired for the African green monkey. Given the importance of this species in biomedical research generally and CVD specifically, and the fundamental significance of sequence data, it is critical that this paucity of genome information concerning this specific animal model be addressed in order to better define the molecular basis and to further understand the mechanism of cholesterol metabolism in this species which will also contribute immensely to primatology. There is a growing interest in the role of genetic polymorphisms in predicting susceptibility to disease and responsiveness to drug interventions. Since plasma lipid abnormalities are risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis, determination of these plasma lipid concentrations, especially for genes involved in lipid transport and metabolism may be influenced by genetic variations. In this study, the African green monkey was used as a model to evaluate the effect of niacin on plasma lipids and reverse cholesterol transport by examine gene expression and the influence of several polymorphisms found in genes that are involved in cholesterol metabolism in humans. A survey of genetic variation spanning ten prioritised “candidate” genes was conducted, all of which are known to produce proteins that play key roles in the reverse cholesterol pathway (RCT), and in the homeostatic regulation of blood lipid profiles related to cardiovascular health and disease. everse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate mRNA expression of those “candidate” genes. Twenty two coincident singlenucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs), reported to {{play a vital role in}} RCT, were genotyped within these genes. This study’s findings implicate a subset of six of the twenty two genetic variants, spanning five “candidate” genes. To assess possible involvement of these prioritised “candidate” genes and their polymorphisms, biochemical analyses of known risk factors of coronary artery disease such as HDL-C and LDL-C were conducted. Eight healthy African green monkeys were entered in this study of which four were treated with niacin at an <b>escalating</b> <b>dosage.</b> Their mean lipid-lowering response following drug therapy was analysed, compared to those with the same genotype in a control group. Niacin treatment was associated with a considerable reduction in LDL-Cholesterol, up-regulation of HDL synthesis, and increase of apo A- 1 levels. Gene expression had minimal effect on niacin treatment, except CYP 7 A 1 which was down-regulated at the same time when considerable change in HDL-C, LDL-C and apoA- 1 levels was observed. The presence of CYP 7 A 1 :Asn 233 Ser polymorphism may have played a critical role in metabolising niacin and influencing the up-regulation of HDL-C synthesis in the African green monkey. Although cholesterol lowering alone may explain the anti-atherosclerotic effect of niacin on HDL-C, in this study, gene expression data also shed some light in supporting the hypothesis that genetic variants may influence the expression of genes involved in RCT, which may also have played a role in the anti-atherosclerotic effect of the drug...|$|E

Although some studies have suggested that intermittent therapy with ICS is not detrimental to asthma control, {{in the absence of any}} studies investigating the long term clinical, functional and pathophysiological differences between regular and intermittent therapy, the former continues to be recommended in guidelines. In patients well controlled on low/moderate dosages of ICS there is little benefit of adding any other medication and no rationale for commencing combination therapy routinely as first line controller therapy. There is no evidence that ICS or any other medication prevents the occurrence of asthma, and scanty evidence that the decline in lung function associated with asthma is arrested to any significant degree by ICS therapy. ICS has variable effects on features of airways remodelling but the long term physiological consequences of these effects, if any, are as yet unknown...|$|R

We studied {{the activity of}} PLD- 118 in <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> against experimental oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis (OPEC) caused by fluconazole (FLC) -resistant Candida albicans in immunocompromised rabbits. Infection was established by fluconazole-resistant (MIC > 64 μg/ml) clinical isolates from patients with refractory esophageal candidiasis. Antifungal therapy was administered for 7 days. Study groups consisted of untreated controls; animals receiving PLD- 118 at 4, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg of body weight/day via intravenous (i. v.) twice daily (BID) injections; animals receiving FLC at 2 mg/kg/day via i. v. BID injections; and animals receiving desoxycholate amphotericin B (DAMB) i. v. at 0. 5 mg/kg/day. PLD- 118 - and DAMB-treated animals showed a significant dosage-dependent clearance of C. albicans from the tongue, oropharynx, and esophagus in comparison to untreated controls (P ≤ 0. 05, P ≤ 0. 01, P ≤ 0. 001, respectively), while FLC had no significant activity. PLD- 118 demonstrated nonlinear plasma pharmacokinetics across the investigated dosage range, as was evident from a dose-dependent increase in plasma clearance and a dose-dependent decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.

40|$|The HOVON {{cooperative}} study group performed a feasibility study of escalated imatinib and intravenous cytarabine in 165 patients with early chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Patients received 2 cycles of intravenous cytara- bine (200 mg/m 2 or 1000 mg/m 2 days 1 - 7) {{in conjunction with}} imatinib (200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg), according to predefined, successive dose levels. All dose levels proved feasible. Seven dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 302 cycles of chemotherapy, which werecaused bystreptococcal bacteremia in 5 cases. Intermediate-dose cytarabine (1000 mg/m 2) prolonged time to neutro- phil recovery and platelet recovery compared with a standard dose (200 mg/m 2). High-dose imatinib (600 mg or 800 mg) extended the time to platelet recovery compared with a standard dose (400 mg). More infectious complications common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4 were observed after intermediate-dose cytara- bine compared with a standard-dose of cytarabine. Early response data after combination therapy included a complete cy-togenetic response in 48 % and a major molecular response in 30 % of patients, which increased to 46 % major molecular responses at 1 year, including 13 % complete molecular responses.

50|$|Tolerance {{occurs to}} the muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon {{cessation}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs. This {{can lead to}} benzodiazepines being taken for longer than originally intended, as people continue to take the drugs {{over a long period}} of time to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a lot of time to doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV for substance abuse and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia <b>escalate</b> their <b>dosage,</b> sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed dose levels. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients <b>escalated</b> their <b>dosage.</b> Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that the drugs are acting to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects.

We studied the antifungal efficacy, the concentrations in saliva and tissue, {{and the safety}} of VER- 002 at <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> against experimental oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis caused by fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans in immunocompromised rabbits. Study groups consisted of untreated controls, animals treated with VER- 002 at 1, 2. 5, and 5 mg/kg of body weight/day intravenously (i. v.), animals treated with fluconazole at 2 mg/kg/day i. v., or animals treated with amphotericin B at 0. 3 mg/kg/day. VER- 002 -treated animals showed a significant dosage-dependent clearance of C. albicans from the tongue, oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum in comparison to that for untreated controls. VER- 002 also was superior to amphotericin B and fluconazole in clearing the organism from all sites studied. These in vivo findings are consistent with the results of in vitro time-kill assays, which demonstrated that VER- 002 has concentration-dependent fungicidal activity. Esophageal tissue VER- 002 concentrations were dosage proportional and exceeded the MIC at all dosages. Echinocandin concentrations in saliva were {{greater than or equal to}} the MICs at all dosages. There was no elevation of serum hepatic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, potassium, or creatinine levels in VER- 002 -treated rabbits.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of caspofungin for invasive aspergillosis (IA). The safety and pharmacokinetics of <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> of caspofungin were investigated in IA. Eight patients each received caspofungin 70, 100, 150, or 200 mg once a day (QD). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) {{was defined as the}} same non-hematological treatment-related adverse event of grade ≥ 4 in 2 of 8 patients or ≥ 3 in 4 of 8 patients in a cohort. A total of 46 patients (median age, 61 years; 21 female; 89 % with hematological malignancies) received caspofungin (9, 8, 9, and 20 patients in the 70 -, 100 -, 150 -, and 200 -mg cohorts) for a median of 24. 5 days. Plasma pharmacokinetics were linear across the investigated dosages and followed a two-compartment model, with weight as the covariate on clearance and sex as the covariate on central volume of distribution. Simulated peak plasma concentrations at steady state ranged from 14. 2 to 40. 6 mg/liter (28 %), trough concentrations from 4. 1 to 11. 8 mg/liter (58 %), and area under the concentration-time curve from 175 to 500 mg/liter/h (32 %) (geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation). Treatment was well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity. The rate of complete or partial responses was 54. 3 %, and the overall mortality at 12 -week follow-up was 28. 3 %. In first-line treatment of invasive aspergillosis, daily doses of up to 200 mg caspofungin were well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Pharmacokinetics was linear.

Levels of icofungipen in plasma were derivatized by phthaldialdehyde and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Rabbits treated with ICO- 10 (P < 0. 01) and ICO- 25 (P < 0. 001) showed significant dosage-dependent tissue clearance of C. albicans from the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, vitreous, vena cava, and lung in comparison to untreated controls. ICO- 25 cleared C. albicans from all tissues and had activity comparable to that of amphotericin B versus untreated controls (P < 0. 001). Pharmacokinetics of icofungipen in plasma approximated a dose-dependent relationship of the maximum concentration of drug in serum and the area under the concentration-time curve. There was no significant elevation of the levels of hepatic transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, urea nitrogen, or creatinine in icofungipen-treated rabbits.

40|$|AIM: Using the antiCEA {{antibody}} MN 14, a LS 174 T mouse tumor {{model has}} been successfully targeted with (⁹⁹m) Tc for imaging and ¹⁸⁸Re for radiotherapy by phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (MORF) /complementary MORF (cMORF) pretargeting strategy. This investigation evaluated the antiTAG- 72 antibody CC 49 {{as an alternative to}} MN 14 for this application. METHODS: Both CC 49 and MN 14 were labeled with ¹¹¹In via SCN-benzyl-DTPA and their biodistributions were compared to that of MN 14 labeled via DTPA anhydride. Since the accessibility of the antibody to the effector is required for optimization of pretargeting, the internalization of both MORF-CC 49 and MORF-MN 14 antibodies in LS 174 T cells were evaluated in culture. In addition, the accessible concentration of MORF-CC 49 antibody in tumor was determined in a series of pretargeting studies with <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> of the [(⁹⁹m) Tc]cMORF effector. Finally, using these results and our semi-empirical model, an imaging study was performed under optimal pretargeting conditions. RESULTS: The biodistribution of ¹¹¹In to trace the MN 14 antibody depended significantly on the labeling method. Furthermore, both MORF-CC 49 and MORF-MN 14 antibodies showed rapid internalization in culture. Fortunately, the accessibility in tumor was found to be less seriously reduced in vivo. In a pretargeting study under optimal conditions, both by imaging and by necropsy, the [(⁹⁹m) Tc]cMORF effector accumulated predominantly in the tumor of pretargeted mice. Normal tissue accumulations were minimal except in kidneys, liver, and a segment of intestines. CONCLUSION: MORF pretargeting with CC 49 was equally successful in the LS 174 T tumor model to the MORF pretargeting with MN 14. The MORF-CC 49 antibody may therefore be considered for future investigations toward early clinical trials...|$|R

We studied the antifungal efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ravuconazole lysine phosphoester in <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> {{for the treatment of}} invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus in persistently neutropenic rabbits. Treatment groups consisted of rabbits treated with ravuconazole at 2. 5 (RVC 2. 5), 5 (RVC 5), and 10 (RVC 10) mg/kg of body weight/day, rabbits treated with amphotericin B (AMB) at 1 mg/kg/day, or untreated controls. There was a dose-dependent reduction of pulmonary residual fungal burden (CFU per gram) in RVC 5 -, RVC 10 -, and AMB-treated rabbits in comparison to untreated controls (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 001, and P < 0. 01, respectively). These findings correlated with progressive galactomannan antigenemia in untreated controls and the RVC 2. 5 -treated rabbits, a lower galactomannan index (GMI) in RVC 5 - and RVC 10 -treated rabbits, and a similarly low GMI in AMB-treated rabbits (P < 0. 01). Rabbits treated with RVC 5, RVC 10, and AMB also showed a reduction of organism-mediated pulmonary injury, as measured by infarct scores and lung weights, in comparison to untreated controls (P < 0. 001). These results were supported by decreased pulmonary infiltrates detected by computed tomography in RVC 5 - and RVC 10 -treated rabbits in comparison to untreated controls (P < 0. 05). Survival throughout the entire study was achieved in 95 % of RVC 5 -treated rabbits (P < 0. 001), 85 % of RVC 10 -treated rabbits (P < 0. 001), and 50 % of AMB-treated rabbits (P < 0. 05) in comparison to none of the untreated controls. Ravuconazole showed linear plasma pharmacokinetics and a large volume of distribution while maintaining concentrations in plasma above the MIC throughout the dosing interval. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity among ravuconazole-treated animals. Intravenously administered ravuconazole lysine phosphoester showed dose-dependent efficacy and an excellent safety profile for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits...|$|R

Patients and Methods Adult patients were treated with <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> of BGJ 398 5 to 150 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily continuously in 28 -day cycles. During expansion at the MTD, patients with FGFR 1 -amplified squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC; arm 1) or other solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations (mutations/amplifications/fusions) received BGJ 398 daily on a continuous schedule (arm 2), or on a 3 -weeks-on/ 1 -week-off schedule (arm 3). Results Data in 132 patients from the escalation and expansion arms are reported (May 15, 2015, cutoff). The MTD, 125 mg daily, was determined {{on the basis of}} dose-limiting toxicities in four patients (100 mg, grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]; 125 mg, hyperphosphatemia [n = 1]; 150 mg, grade 1 corneal toxicity [n = 1] and grade 3 aminotransferase elevations [n = 1]). Common adverse events in patients treated at the MTD (n = 57) included hyperphosphatemia (82. 5 %), constipation (50. 9 %), decreased appetite (45. 6 %), and stomatitis (45. 6 %). A similar safety profile was observed using the 3 -weeks-on/ 1 -week-off schedule (RP 2 D). However, adverse event-related dose adjustments/interruptions were less frequent with the 3 -weeks-on/ 1 -week-off (50. 0 %) versus the continuous (73. 7 %) schedule. Antitumor activity (seven partial responses [six confirmed]) was demonstrated with BGJ 398 doses ≥ 100 mg in patients with FGFR 1 -amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR 3 -mutant bladder/urothelial cancer. Conclusion BGJ 398 at the MTD/RP 2 D had a tolerable and manageable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in several tumor types, including FGFR 1 -amplified sqNSCLC and FGFR 3 -mutant bladder/urothelial cancers...|$|R

CTI 52010 is a formulation of nanoparticulate paclitaxel consisting of drug and normal saline. Our objectives were to determine the maximally tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of CTI 52010 administered intravenously to normal dogs. Methods: Three normal adult hound dogs were evaluated by physical examination, complete blood count, chemistry profile, and urinalysis. Dogs were treated with staggered <b>escalating</b> <b>dosages</b> of CTI 52010 with a 28 -day washout. All dogs were treated with a starting dosage of 40 mg/m 2, and subsequent <b>dosages</b> were <b>escalated</b> at 50 % (dog 1), 100 % (dog 2), or 200 % (dog 3) with each cycle, to a maximum of 240 mg/m 2. Dogs were monitored by daily physical assessment and weekly laboratory evaluation. Standard criteria were used to grade adverse events. Plasma was collected at regular intervals to determine pharmacokinetics. Dogs were euthanized humanely, and necropsy was performed one week after the last treatment. Results: The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 4 neutropenia and the maximum tolerated dosage was 120 mg/m 2. Grade 1 &ndash; 2 gastrointestinal toxicity was noted at higher dosages. Upon post mortem evaluation, no evidence of organ (liver, kidney, spleen) toxicity was noted. Conclusion: CTI 52010 was well tolerated when administered intravenously to normal dogs.
