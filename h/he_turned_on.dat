It marked Doink's final match as a heel, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Jerry Lawler shortly after the match. In addition, Matt Osborne, who had portrayed Doink since the character's creation, was fired that fall because of drug problems.|$|E
5|$|Bam Bam Bigelow {{challenged}} Lawrence Taylor to a match, which Taylor accepted after initially refusing. Diesel trained Taylor, {{who beat}} Bigelow at WrestleMania XI. Embarrassed, Bigelow challenged Diesel to {{a match for}} the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Tatanka was at ringside for the match; <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Bigelow and caused him to lose. Bigelow attacked Tatanka after the match, which led to Sid, a new addition to the Corporation, to come to Tatanka's defense. This led to a tag team match at King of the Ring 1995, where Diesel and Bigelow defeated Tatanka and Sid.|$|E

On 10 March—following improved weather—rescue teams resumed searching for the three missing fishermen. During the second rescue attempt, one of the fishermen was found alive but alone in a large swell about 259km (161mi) northeast of Yeppoon, Queensland. The rescuers {{were able to find}} him when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, which he originally thought was a stick. This beacon allowed the rescuers to pinpoint his location, though the other two fishermen reportedly did not have these beacons. On 16 March, a memorial service was held for the two fishermen who were lost at sea. About 200 people who knew the two men attended the service; many of whom signed a book honoring the fishermen.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the rest}} of the year, Brother Runt {{continued}} to feud with Abyss and several other heavyweight wrestlers while having a short-lived alliance with Raven (Raven saved Brother Runt from being smashed through two stacked tables covered in thumbtack-covered boards from Abyss, before throwing Abyss in himself), before <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> Raven on September 15, 2006. In September and October 2006 Hyson had formed a new look, very similar to Travis Bickle in the hit 1976 movie Taxi Driver complete with Bickle's trademark green army jacket and mohawk. At No Surrender (2006), Brother Runt competed in a No Disqualification 3-Way Dance which was won by Abyss, At Bound for Glory (2006), Brother Runt competed in a fatal four way Monster's Ball match which was won by Samoa Joe.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2006, Chris Hero, a representative from Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), invaded ROH and targeted Danielson; the two exchanged words over the Internet before having a match together, with nearly the entire roster of both companies embarking on an interpromotional feud. Danielson became personally invested in this feud, and invaded CZW himself, which led to him having physical altercations {{with a number of}} CZW wrestlers. Hero intensified the rivalry, leading to the two wrestling at ROH's Hell Freezes Over event, where Danielson successfully defended the ROH World Championship. He soon filled the vacant slot on ROH's five-man team which participated in one of CZW's more popular attractions, a steel cage match called the Cage of Death, a ten-man tag team match in which a man from each team starts in the cage, and a random wrestler enters periodically thereafter. During the match, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> his team by assaulting his rival Samoa Joe, before leaving the match and effectively abandoning his involvement in the animosity between the two promotions. As the interpromotional hostility with CZW heightened, Danielson also defended against challengers from the rival company, who had signed an open contract for any CZW wrestler willing to challenge for the ROH World Championship. Former champion Samoa Joe also challenged Danielson at Fight of the Century on August 5, but their match ended in a 60-minute draw.|$|E

On May 25 Kenta and Yoshinobu Kanemaru defeated Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki of the ANMU stable to win the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. After months of trying to persuade his mentor Yoshihiro Takayama to join No Mercy, on June 26 Takayama turned on his partner Takuma Sano during a tag match against Kenta and Kanemaru and became the fourth member of the group.

25|$|The galley from Napoli, which {{sailed to}} his left, was again {{showing signs of}} disorder, so he ordered it moved to the right, away from the {{approaching}} Turks. Loredan had his ships withdraw a while, in order to draw the Turks further from Gallipoli and have the sun in the Venetians' back. Once ready, Loredan led his own flagship to attack the leading Ottoman galley. Its crew offered determined resistance, and the other Ottoman galleys came astern of Loredan's ship to his left, and launched volleys of arrows against him and his men. Loredan himself was wounded by an arrow below the eye and the nose, and by another that passed through his left hand, {{as well as other}} arrows that struck him with lesser effect. Nevertheless, the galley was captured after most of its crew was killed, and Loredan, after leaving a few men of his crew to guard it, turned against a galleot, which he captured as well. Again leaving a few of his men and his flag on it, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> the other Ottoman ships. The fight lasted from morning to the second hour of the night. The Venetians defeated the Ottoman fleet, killing its commander and many of the captains and crews (tutti andarono pel fil di spada) and capturing six great galleys and nine galleots, according to Loredan's account, but 27 vessels in total according to Doukas. Loredan gives a detailed breakdown of the ships captured by his men: his own ship captured a galley and a galleot of 20 banks of oars; the Contarini galley captured a galley; the galley of Giorgio Loredan captured two galleots of 22 banks and two galleots of 20 banks; the Grimani galley of Negroponte captured a galley; the galley of Jiacopo Barbarini captured a galleot of 23 banks and another of 19 banks; the same for the Capello galley; the galley of Girolamo Minotto from Napoli captured the Ottoman flagship galley, which had been defeated and pursued before by the Capello galley; the Venieri and Barbarigo galleys of Candia took a galley. Venetian casualties were light, twelve killed—mostly by drowning—and 340 wounded, most of them lightly.|$|E

500|$|The other Los Gringos Locos-related storyline {{started when}} Konnan joined sides with Barr and Guerrero, {{switching}} {{from being a}} tecnico that was highly favored by the crowd to being a hated rudo, as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> his long-time partner Perro Aguayo in a match against Los Gringos Locos in August 1994. The storyline played off the fact that years previously, Perro Aguayo had forced Konnan to unmask when he pinned Konnan in a Luchas de Apuestas match in CMLL. Konnan and Aguayo would face off several times over the following months, often as the captains in six-man tag team matches, most of which ended with inconclusive outcomes and both wrestlers hitting each other with chairs and other objects. On August 6, 1994, on a show called Night of Champions in the Los Angeles Sports Arena, Konnan teamed up with Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts to defeat the team of Aguayo and Vampiro Canadiense in two straight falls.
