We show that a fast HRAM system can be implemented with a compact architecture by incorporating conjugate readout, a smart-pixel array, and a linear array of laser diodes. It provides faster random access time than hard disk (100 microseconds or less) and similar bandwidth as silicon storage with lower cost. Preliminary experimental results support the feasibility of this architecture. Our analysis shows {{that in order for}} the HRAM to become competitive, the principal tasks will be to reduce spatial light modulator (SLM) and detector pixel sizes to 1 µm, increase the output power of compact visible-wavelength lasers to several hundred milliwatts, and develop ways to raise the sensitivity of holographic media to the order of 1 cm/J. 1...|$|E

In the human brain, physical structure and functionality jointly provide diverse memory modalities at multiple time scales. How could we engineer artificial memories with similar faculties? In this thesis, we attack both hardware and algorithmic aspects of this problem. A good part is devoted to holographic memory architectures, because they meet high capacity and parallelism requirements. We develop and fully characterize shift multiplexing, a novel storage method that simplifies disk head design for holographic disks. We develop and optimize the design of compact refreshable <b>holographic</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memories,</b> showing several ways that 1 Tbit can be stored holographically in volume less than 1 [ [...] . ], with surface density more than 20 times higher than conventional silicon DRAM integrated circuits. To address the issue of photorefractive volatility, we further develop the two-lambda (dual wavelength) method for shift multiplexing, and combine electrical fixing with angle multiplexing to demonstrate 1, 000 multiplexed fixed holograms. Finally, we propose a noise model and an information theoretic metric to optimize the imaging system of a holographic memory, in terms of storage density and error rate. Motivated by the problem of interfacing sensors and memories to a complex system with limited computational resources, we construct a computer game of Desert Survival, built as a high-dimensional non-stationary virtual environment in a competitive setting. The efficacy of episodic learning, implemented as a reinforced Nearest Neighbor scheme, and the probability of winning against a control opponent improve significantly by concentrating the algorithmic effort to the virtual desert neighborhood that emerges as most significant at any time. The generalized computational model combines the autonomous neural network and von Neumann paradigms through a compact, dynamic central representation, which contains the most salient features of the sensory inputs, fused with relevant recollections, reminiscent of the hypothesized cognitive function of awareness. The Declarative Memory is searched both by content and address, suggesting a holographic implementation. The proposed computer architecture may lead to a novel paradigm that solves "hard" cognitive problems at low cost. ...|$|R

30|$|Recently, various {{non-volatile}} <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (NvRAM) such as magnetic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (MRAM), ferroelectric <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (FeRAM), phrase change memory (PCM), and resistive <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RRAM) {{were widely}} investigated and discussed for applications in portable electronic products {{which consisted of}} low power consumption IC [1], non-volatile memory [2 – 6], and TFT LCD display [7 – 10]. To overcome the technical and physical limitation issues of conventional charge storage-based memories [11 – 18], the resistive <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RRAM) device which consisted of the oxide-based layer sandwiched by two electrodes was a great potential candidate for the next-generation non-volatile memory because of its superior properties such as low cost, simple structure, fast operation speed, low operation power, and non-destructive readout properties [19 – 42].|$|R
25|$|Dynamic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a type}} of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to static <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.|$|R
