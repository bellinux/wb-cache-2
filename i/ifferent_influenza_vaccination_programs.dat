Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Healthy People 2020 {{national}} {{goal is to}} “increase {{the percentage}} of healthcare personnel who are vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza, target 90 %”. Although some healthcare organizations are adopting annual HCP <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> requirements, there may never be full compliance (90 % or greater) without mandatory influenza vaccines policies by all healthcare organizations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), healthcare organizations that required all of their HCP to receive the flu vaccination experienced the highest flu vaccination rates, coverage in occupational settings with vaccination requirements was 96. 5 %. While, Healthcare organizations implement aggressive, labor-intensive voluntary <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs,</b> rarely able to achieve rates higher than 70 %. The purpose of the Capstone Project is to identify and evaluate the barriers related to why the annual <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> rates for HCP remain consistently low within healthcare organizations. Secondly, understand how patients and healthcare organizations benefit from implementing and achieving annual HCP <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> compliance; reduces financial impact to healthcare organizations’ and also lowers the risk of HCP transmitting the influenza virus to patients. And lastly, identify and evaluate the essential elements {{to develop and implement}} an organizational <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> and policy for HCP.

Methods and resultsAmong the 34   359 medically attended patients who displayed an influenza-like illness and had a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) at one of the three participating hospitals, 21. 0 % tested positive for influenza A. The highest daily number of RIDT-positive cases in each hospital ranged from 33 to 56. A well-fitted multiple linear regression time-series model (R 2 = 0. 89) showed that the establishment of special community flu clinics averted an average of nine cases daily (p= 0. 005), and an increment of 10 % in daily mean level of population immunity against pH 1 N 1 through vaccination prevented five cases daily (p< 0. 001). Moreover, the regression model predicted five-fold or more RIDT-positive cases if the mass <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> had not been implemented, and 39. 1 % more RIDT-positive cases if older adults had been prioritized for vaccination above school-aged children.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a mass <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> on the {{operation}} of a major medical center was evaluated in adult volunteer employees who were given either ether-split or whole-virus bivalent influenza vaccine in a double-blind manner by jet-injector gun. Each volunteer completed a reaction information form, nurses monitored temperatures, and data on absenteeism of the employees of the Nursing Service and the Building Management Service were collected. The {{results of this study}} demonstrated that the mass campaign did not adversely affect absenteeism. However, the whole-virus vaccine caused significantly more local, systemic, and febrile reac-tions than the split-virus vaccine. Purified inactivated influenza virus vaccines can be given in a mass campaign to hospital personnel without adversely affecting the oper-ation of the hospital.

This analysis seeks to answer the question: Can public health agencies provide influenza immunization within the funding envelope of $ 5 pe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> depends on individual-level compliance. Perceptions about {{risks associated with}} infection and vaccination can strongly influence vaccination decisions and thus the ultimate course of an epidemic. Here we investigate the interplay between contact patterns, influenza-related behavior, and disease dynamics by incorporating game theory into network models. When individuals {{make decisions based on}} past epidemics, we find that individuals with many contacts vaccinate, whereas individuals with few contacts do not. However, the threshold number of contacts above which to vaccinate is highly dependent on the overall network structure of the population and has the potential to oscillate more wildly than has been observed empirically. When we increase the number of prior seasons that individuals recall when making vaccination decisions, behavior and thus disease dynamics become less variable. For some networks, we also find that higher flu transmission rates may, counterintuitively, lead to lower (vaccine-mediated) disease prevalence. Our work demonstrates that rich and complex dynamics can result from the interaction between infectiou...|$|R
50|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{observed that}} {{six years of}} concern about H5N1 avian flu did much {{to prepare for the}} current H1N1 flu outbreak, noting that after H5N1 emerged in Asia, ultimately killing about 60% of the few hundred people infected by it over the years, many countries took steps to try to prevent any similar crisis from spreading further. The CDC and other U.S. governmental agencies used the summer lull to take stock of the United States' response to H1N1 flu and attempt to patch any gaps in the public health safety net before flu season started in early autumn. Preparations included planning a second <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> in addition to that for seasonal influenza, and improving coordination between federal, state and local governments and private health providers. On 24 October 2009, U.S. President Obama declared swine flu a national emergency, giving Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius authority to grant waivers to requesting hospitals from usual federal requirements.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Influenza {{is common}} among adults and has {{consequences}} for productivity and healthcare costs. Pertussis rates in adults {{are on the}} rise and adults with pertussis can miss work and may expose high-risk populations to infection. Influenza and Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis) vaccination rates are low among working-age adults, but workplace-based <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> can help to address this problem. Specifically, employers can use evidence-based practices to increase vaccination rates among their employees. In Chapter 2, I describe a qualitative analysis of large employers' views on workplace-based <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs.</b> Large employers offered <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinations</b> as a benefit to employees and to keep them healthy, but were not aware of the potential benefits of promoting Tdap vaccination to their workers. Overall, they had not considered how to maximize vaccination rates among their employee population. In Chapter 3, I describe a quantitative analysis of large employers' practices related to workplace <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs.</b> I estimate the prevalence of employers' use of evidence-based practices to increase vaccination rates among their employees. I show that while some promotion practices are well-used by employers, there is room for improvement in others. Employers could maximize the impact of their <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> by increasing the use of some practices, particularly those related to increasing physical access to vaccination. In Chapter 4, I shift the focus to the use of evidence-based practices in a particular small to mid-sized workplace setting, restaurants. I describe a pilot study to evaluate a workplace-based intervention to increase vaccination rates among restaurant employees. The intervention increased <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> rates among restaurant employees, although the size of the increase differed among restaurants. Restaurants can successfully implement workplace-based <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs,</b> although increasing physical and financial access does not guarantee an improvement in vaccination rates. I conclude that while employers are generally open to offering vaccinations at the worksite, they could do more to increase the impact of their <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs.</b> The full potential benefits of vaccination, both for their businesses and for the population, will only be realized if they commit to maximizing physical and financial access for employees. The investment required is modest and higher employee <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> rates are within reach for employers...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess {{pandemic}} (H 1 N 1) 2009 <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{coverage in}} Western Australians, up to 31 January 2010. Design, setting and participants: Vaccination data for Western Australians aged 10 {{years and older}} were obtained from two sources: the WA Pandemic <b>Influenza</b> <b>Vaccination</b> Database (PIVD; which collected reports of pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinations</b> from vaccination providers statewide) for the period 30 September 2009 to 31 January 2010, and the WA Health and Wellbeing Surveillance System (HWSS; a continuous population-based telephone survey) for the period 1 December 2009 to 31 January 2010. Data from the PIVD was used to impute vaccination coverage estimates for at-risk subpopulations not assessed in the HWSS interviews. Main outcome measures: Vaccination coverage of Western Australians aged 10 years and older and of subgroups targeted by the national pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> campaign. Results: A total of 171 789 pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinations</b> were reported to the PIVD by 31 January 2010 and 88 % of these were administered by 1 December 2009. Based on HWSS data, vaccination coverage of persons aged 10 years and older was 14. 5 % (95 % CI, 12. 6 %– 16. 6 %) and of persons aged 18 years and older was 15. 3 % (95 % CI, 13. 3 %– 17. 6 %). Based on PIVD data, coverage in adults ranged from 10. 3 % in pregnant women to 52. 8 % in health care workers. Conclusions: Our estimate of pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage in the adult population of WA {{is comparable to the}} national estimate of 19 %, but it did not reach levels considered sufficient to interrupt community transmission. Future <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> should target groups at increased risk of severe influenza, such as pregnant women...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of an employee <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> campaign, measured in terms of health and economic benefits. MethodsColombian bank employees volunteered to take part in this prospective observational study involving two groups: vaccinated and nonvaccinated. Socioeconomic and health status information, including influenza-like symptoms, sick leave, and postvaccination adverse events, were collected via questionnaires. Cost–benefit analyses were performed to determine whether the employer would save money overall by paying for the <b>vaccination</b> <b>program.</b> ResultsBetween October 2000 and May 2001, 424 vaccinated subjects and 335 nonvaccinated subjects volunteered to join the study. Cumulative incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) was lower among vaccinated (14. 6 %) than nonvaccinated subjects (39. 4 %). Fever was the most common ILI symptom (93 % of all reported ILI). Absence rates because of ILI were similar in the two groups (2. 59 %− 2. 69 %). Assuming that employees with ILI who continue to work have reduced effectiveness (30 %− 70 % of normal) the employer can save US$ 6. 4 to US$ 25. 8 per vaccinated employee based on labor costs alone. This saving increases to US$ 89. 3 to US$ 237. 8 when operating income is also considered. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> will be cost saving for vaccination coverage above 20 % and ILI rates above 10 %. ConclusionsAmong the studied volunteers, ILI has significant impact on work productivity in terms of indirect costs. Implementing an <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> would reduce the burden of ILI and save substantial amounts of money for the company...|$|R
