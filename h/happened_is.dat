5|$|In 31, Sejanus {{held the}} consulship with Tiberius , and began his play for power in earnest. Precisely what <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult}} to determine, but Sejanus {{seems to have}} covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} Princeps, or as a possible regent. Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

5|$|What {{followed}} Marcellinus's act of traditio, if it {{ever actually}} <b>happened,</b> <b>is</b> unclear. There {{appears to have been}} a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, and (if he had apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303, but his successor, Marcellus, was not consecrated until either November or December 306. In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority. These two groups clashed in street fights and riots, eventually leading to murders. It is said that Marcellus, a rigorist, purged all mention of Marcellinus from church records, and removed his name from the official list of bishops. Marcellus himself was banished from the city, and died in exile on January 16, 309.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} rebuilding saw {{the timber}} palisades {{of the inner}} bailey replaced by stone walls and towers. Exactly when this <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> unclear, but {{it may have been}} under Peter of Savoy, the Earl of Richmond, who was granted the castle by Henry III in 1246. There is no record of the rebuilding but in 1254 Peter ended the feudal requirement to maintain the palisades and replaced it with cash payments. This probably reflected the replacement of the palisades with the stone walls and towers visible today. The castle faced a lengthy siege only a decade later during the Second Barons' War from the rebel baron Simon de Montfort, following Henry's defeat in the Battle of Lewes. Defeated members of the royalist army fled to Pevensey, pursued by de Montford's forces, but the garrison refused an invitation to surrender and endured over a year of besiegement. Their adversaries were unable to stop supplies reaching the castle despite digging a ditch to cut it off from the mainland; its garrison raided the surrounding countryside and sought to obtain fresh supplies of men and weapons by sea in December 1264. The costly and ineffective siege was eventually lifted in July 1265. It caused significant damage to the castle, with the Roman wall toppled on the south side. The parish churches at Pevensey and Westham also suffered damage, which the attackers may have caused in using them as siege castles (temporary fortresses and artillery platforms).|$|E

25|$|At Shepherdswell a {{connecting}} spur {{was begun}} to a north-facing junction on the SECR main line but never finished (earthworks survive); instead, {{a very sharp}} curve to a junction was provided near the terminus.

25|$|What {{is clear}} from this is that these two teams are in effect one and the same.

25|$|After the {{conflict}} between Adal and Abyssinia had subsided, the conquest of the highland regions of Abyssinia and Adal by the Oromo (namely, through military expansion and {{the installation of the}} Gadaa socio-political system) ended in the contraction of both powers and changed regional dynamics for centuries to come. In essence, what had <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> that the populations of the highlands had not ceased to exist {{as a result of the}} Gadaa expansion, but were simply incorporated into a different socio-political system.|$|E

25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> part of his plan for humanity. The essence of this plan {{is a process of}} maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures {{to take a long time}} to grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E
25|$|The Ājīvika {{school is}} known for its Niyati ("Fate") {{doctrine}} of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has <b>happened,</b> <b>is</b> happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an ātman – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E
25|$|Samnite gladiators appear {{often in}} Roman texts (they are the gladiators most often {{mentioned}} in Roman writings) {{until the early}} Imperial period. A likely possibility is that the Samnite went out of favour {{during the reign of}} Augustus when Samnium became an ally of Rome. As the real Samnites became fully integrated into Roman society, the gladiator based upon them was retired. At this time, similar classes, the hoplomachus, murmillo, and the secutor first appear in texts. It seems that the Samnite became specialized into these classes, although the means by which this <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> unclear. The Samnite and its successors all fought with a footsoldier's sword and shield. The only clear distinguishing characteristics are that the secutor almost exclusively fought the net-and-trident-wielding retiarius, and the hoplomachus used a taller shield.|$|E

500|$|The {{aftermath}} of the siege was to prove troublesome for Pausanias. Exactly what <b>happened</b> <b>is</b> unclear; Thucydides gives few details, although later writers added plenty of lurid insinuations. Through his arrogance and arbitrary actions (Thucydides says [...] "violence"), Pausanias managed to alienate many of the Allied contingents, particularly those that had just been freed from Persian overlordship. The Ionians and others asked the Athenians to take leadership of the campaign, to which they agreed. The Spartans, hearing of his behaviour, recalled Pausanias and tried him on charges of collaborating with the enemy. Although he was acquitted, his reputation was tarnished {{and he was not}} restored to his command.|$|E
500|$|Later in the investigation, an {{additional}} $4,000 fine was imposed on Monteiro. The coach had {{a salary of}} only about $1,500 per month during the eight months he spent with the Rainmen. He was unable to contact team owner Andre Levingston, who did not assist or help him. Monteiro responded to the charges by claiming that they were unfair. In a statement on May 11, he said, [...] "I am looking for help to fight these unjust sanctions and fines so I can continue to work {{and be able to}} support my family.

[...] One doctor working at SMC's ER supported the government's account, accusing protesters of attacking the Under-Secretary-of-State for Health, taking control of all hospital entrances and stealing an ambulance.|$|E
