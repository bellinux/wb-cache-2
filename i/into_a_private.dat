5|$|Although The Wrestlers was {{probably}} exhibited {{as part of}} a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30guineas by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|At times, Al Jalali {{served as}} a refuge or a jail for {{a member of the}} royal family. For much of the 20th century it was used as Oman's main prison, but this {{function}} ended in the 1970s. Fort al-Jalali was restored in 1983 and converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> museum of Omani cultural history that is accessible only to dignitaries visiting the country.

50|$|The Scoville Powerhouse is a {{historic}} former power generation facility at Twin Lakes and Taconic Roads in the Taconic neighborhood of Salisbury, Connecticut. Built about 1899, it provided power to the surrounding estate of the Scoville family, owners of local iron mining and processing operations. It was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>privated</b> residence in the 1950s, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its distinctive architecture.|$|R
5|$|Due to Zog's {{concerns}} about safety during air raids, the ladies' cloakroom was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> {{shelter for the}} Albanians. Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering glass in the Ritz, most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor's house in Buckinghamshire. In total, the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing raids, and the Restaurant had to be closed twice.|$|E
5|$|George Hunt leased {{the castle}} in 1841 {{and it was}} turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> house under the {{supervision}} of the architect George Guillame. Hunt remained at Netley until 1857, by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea, and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey to the building. George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building a stone wall around the front of property.|$|E
5|$|The Parish was a Cajun, Louisiana Creole, {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in Portland, Oregon's Pearl District in the United States.

5|$|The second {{version of}} The Wounded Montenegrin was {{composed}} in 1891. It was initially owned by Arthur Toot & Sons, a London art dealer, before {{coming into the}} possession of the Salon. Afterwards, it entered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> collection, and remained in private ownership until 1989, when it was auctioned off at Sotheby's. Between 1989 and 1997, it was housed at a museum in Rome, but sold again thereafter. It is currently in a private collection.|$|E
5|$|With its oak {{panels and}} other decor recalling an earlier time, {{the heyday of}} cabaret, the Oak Room was small, intimate, and {{expensive}} (at least $100 per person, more if one had dinner, except for matinees), and was not a big moneymaker for the Algonquin. Part of the space occupied by the former Oak Room was used to enlarge the Blue Bar, the rest was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> breakfast room for Marriott Reward Elite customers.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan {{resented the}} fact that Breckinridge had {{supported}} both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination. Relations between the two were further strained when, upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told {{to come to the}} White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, {{visitors}} could {{purchase an}} early guidebook {{at the site}} outlining the castle's history, and Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence to wander around the castle. In the early 1820s, the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick attempted to purchase the site, {{with the aim of}} converting the castle back <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> dwelling, but was unable to convince the owners to sell. Instead, Meyrick built the neo-gothic Goodrich Court in a similar style next door, which greatly displeased Wordsworth when he returned to Goodrich in 1841 and found the view spoilt by the new building. The new bridge over the river Wye, built in 1828, and the 1873 railway line added to the number of visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{the hotel}} was changed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> lodging house and an extra storey of {{bedrooms}} added. The two watchman's boxes outside the museum were added around 1840. From 1853 until 1880 the building was let to the Bath Proprietary College. In 1891 the original 99-year lease of Sydney Gardens expired and its financial affairs had to be wound up. The Hotel and gardens were then sold, with plans published {{for the construction of}} a five-storey hotel to be built on the site. These plans were abandoned when the Empire Hotel was built on the opposite of the River Avon instead.|$|E

5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Walmer {{became the}} {{official}} {{residence of the}} Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and was gradually modified from a military fortification <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> residence. Various Prime Ministers and prominent politicians were appointed as Lord Warden, including William Pitt, the Duke of Wellington and Lord Granville, who adapted parts of the Tudor castle as living spaces and constructed extensive gardens around the property. By 1904, the War Office agreed that Walmer had no remaining military utility and it passed to the Ministry of Works. Successive Lord Wardens continued to use the property {{but it was also}} opened to the public. Walmer was no longer considered a particularly comfortable or modern residence, however, and Lord Curzon blamed the poor condition of the castle for his wife's death in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{had begun}} to suffer damage from the sea by the early 17th century, and {{by the middle of}} the 19th century, the {{receding}} coastline had reached the edge of the castle walls. The high costs of repair contributed to the government's decision to sell the site off in 1888. It was initially bought by a railway company and then passed into private ownership. Coastal erosion continued and by the 1950s, the southern part of the castle had been destroyed by the sea. The remaining castle was restored between 1975 and 1979 by Peter and Barbara McGregor, who turned the keep <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> residence. In the 21st century, Sandgate remains in private ownership, and is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} coastguard {{used some}} of the fortifications as bases to combat smuggling. Calshot was a good location for interception vessels to lie in wait and, {{by the middle of}} the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there; Sandown Castle in Kent was also used by the coastguard for anti-smuggling operations. In the coming decades some forts were declared obsolete and put to new uses; Portland was disarmed after the war and converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> house. Gravesend was superseded by the New Tavern Fort and demolished in 1844. Meanwhile, the ruins of Netley Castle were transformed into a Gothic-styled house from 1826 onwards.|$|E
5|$|There are 94 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in South Somerset. Most are Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{but there are}} other religious buildings as well. Muchelney Abbey consists of the remains and foundations of a medieval Benedictine Abbey and an early Tudor house dating from the 16th century, formerly the lodgings of the resident abbot. Stavordale Priory was built as a priory church in the 13th century and was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> residence in 1533. The Hamstone Stoke sub Hamdon Priory is a 14th-century former priest's house of the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, which after 1518 become a farm known as Parsonage Farmhouse. It remained a farm until about 1960, and has been owned by the National Trust since 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} defeat of Napoleon, the castle was {{disarmed}} and leased to John Manning, a Portland churchman, who converted {{it from a}} fortress <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> house. John's son, Charles Manning, took over the house in 1834 and continued to develop it. Among the Mannings' work was the conversion of an older house alongside the main castle, which had once housed the master gunner, into a grander property, known today as the Captain's House. In the late 1840s, the Portland Roads were converted into an artificial harbour {{through the construction of}} a breakwater, and new forts were built on the Verne heights and the sea front to protect it, although the structure of the old castle itself was left untouched by the growing complex of forts. Charles died in 1869 and, amid ongoing invasion fears, the War Office took over the castle again for use as accommodation for commissioned officers, including as a house for the adjutant of the Verne Citadel.|$|E
