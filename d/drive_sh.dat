5000|$|Headquarters is {{the title}} of a studio album by the music group Monkey House, {{released}} in May 2012, on the Alma Records label, which is affiliated with the Universal Music Group. It was mainly recorded at the <b>Drive</b> <b>Shed</b> in Toronto. It was produced and arranged by Don Breithaupt, and the engineer was John Beetle Bailey. Breithaupt is the founder and leader of Monkey House, who have been recording since 1992. Their previous two albums were Welcome to the Club (1992), and True Winter (1998). In 2005, they released Big Money, a collection of singles, remasters, and rarities. Stylistically, the Headquarters album shows it to be influenced by the music of Steely Dan, with arranged horns and background vocals throughout. Breithaupt says the tunes are [...] "pop songs with too many chords!" [...] Also, some guitar work comes from guest artists Drew Zingg (who {{is best known for his}} work with Boz Scaggs and Steely Dan), as well as from Kim Mitchell and Rik Emmett (founder of the band Triumph). Also making contributions on this album are Steely Dan trumpet player and musical director Michael Leonhart, with Julie Crochetière and David Blamires adding backup vocals. Headquarters has generated increasing attention and multi-genre airplay for Monkey House, with a growing international audience.|$|R

5000|$|Left is {{the title}} of a studio album by the music group Monkey House, {{released}} on June 3, 2016, on the Alma Records label, which is affiliated with the Universal Music Group. It was mainly recorded at the <b>Drive</b> <b>Shed</b> in Toronto. It was co-produced by Don Breithaupt and Peter Cardinali, and the engineer was John Beetle Bailey. After the increased popularity of their previous album from 2012, entitled Headquarters, the leader of the band Don Breithaupt stated that [...] "Part of the buzz for me on this album is that I sense {{a lot of people were}} waiting for it. I keep getting inquiries from people from all over the world giving me grief for taking so long, but that’s a fun situation to be in." [...] Once again, this release has raised comparisons to the music group Steely Dan. [...] "Theres only one comparison really, and thats Steely Dan, and in particular, the Aja-Gaucho period", states jazzcorner.com. The album title Left is derived from the fact that Breithaupt made a big move from Toronto, to the [...] "left coast", or west coast of the United States, setting up a new home in the Los Angeles, California area prior to the production and recording of the album. He states that some of the tunes originated on his long drive across the wide open spaces in North America. The album features contributions from Steely Dan veterans Michael Leonhart, Elliott Randall, Jay Graydon and Drew Zingg, and includes background vocals from Lucy Woodward (Snarky Puppy), as well as David Blamires (Pat Metheny Group).|$|R

40|$|Background: Dystroglycan is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} {{cell adhesion}} receptor best understood in {{its role as}} part of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex of mature skeletal muscle. Less is known of the role of dystroglycan in more fundamental aspects of cell adhesion in other cell types, nor of its role in myoblast cell adhesion. Principal Findings: We have examined the role of dystroglycan {{in the early stages of}} myoblast adhesion and spreading and found that dystroglycan initially associates with other adhesion proteins in large puncta morphologically similar to podosomes. Using a human SH 3 domain phage display library we identified Tks 5, a key regulator of podosomes, as interacting with b-dystroglycan. We verified the interaction by immunoprecipitation, GST-pulldown and immunfluorescence localisation. Both proteins localise to puncta during early phases of spreading, but importantly following stimulation with phorbol ester, also localise to structures indistinguishable from podosomes. Dystroglycan overexpression inhibited podosome formation by sequestering Tks 5 and Src. Mutation of dystroglycan tyrosine 890, previously identified as a Src substrate, restored podosome formation. Conclusions: We propose therefore, that Src-dependent phosphorylation of b-dystroglycan results in the formation of a Src/ dystroglycan complex that <b>drives</b> the <b>SH</b> 3 -mediated association between dystroglycan and Tks 5 which together regulat...|$|R
40|$|Geomagnetic storms {{start with}} {{activity}} on the Sun that causes propagation of magnetized plasma structures in the solar wind. The type of solar activity is used to classify the plasma structures as being either interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or corotating interaction region (CIR) driven. The ICME‐driven events are further classified as either magnetic cloud (MC) <b>driven</b> or sheath (<b>SH)</b> <b>driven</b> by the geoeffective structure responsible for {{the peak of the}} storm. The geoeffective solar wind flow then interacts with the magnetosphere producing a disturbance in near‐Earth space. It is commonly believed that a SH‐driven event behaves more like a CIR‐driven event than a MC‐driven event; however, in our analysis this is not the case. In this study, geomagnetic storms are investigated statistically with respect to the solar wind driver and the intensity of the events. We use the Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model to simulate the inner magnetospheric hot ion population during all of the storms classified as intense (Dstmin[*]≤[*]− 100 nT) within solar cycle 23 (1996 – 2005). HEIDI is configured four different ways using either the Volland‐Stern or self‐consistent electric field and either event‐based Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) data or a reanalyzed lower resolution version of the data that provides spatial resolution. Presenting the simulation results, geomagnetic data, and solar wind data along a normalized epoch timeline shows the average behavior throughout a typical storm of each classification. The error along the epoch timeline for each HEIDI configuration is used to rate the model's performance. We also subgrouped the storms based on the magnitude of the minimum Dst. We found that typically the LANL MPA data provide the best outer boundary condition. Additionally, the self‐consistent electric field better reproduces SH‐ and MC‐driven events throughout most of the storm timeline, but the Volland‐Stern electric field better reproduces CIR‐driven events. Contrary to what we expect, examination of the HEIDI model results and solar wind data shows that SH‐driven events behave more like MC‐driven events than CIR‐driven storms. Key PointsFour ring current model results are statistically compared to geomagnetic indicesResults are examined as a function of solar wind driver and storm intensityStorm time geomagnetic response is different between ICMEs and CIR...|$|R
40|$|Sky-hook damping {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} techniques for feedback control of structural vibrations. It is based on the idea of connecting the structure to an ideal fixed point of the space through passive dissipative devices. Herein the benefit of semi-active (SA) sky hook (SH) damping is investigated for seismic protection of a two-story steel frame via shaking table tests. This kind of SA control is achieved implementing a continuous monitoring of selected structural response parameters and using variable dampers. The damping properties of the latter are changed in real-time so as to make the force provided by the damper match the desired SH damping force as closely as possible. To this aim, two prototype magnetorheological dampers have been installed at the first level of the frame and remotely <b>driven</b> by a <b>SH</b> controller. The high effectiveness of the control strategy is proved comparing the floor accelerations and interstory drift in both uncontrolled and controlled configurations. Practical issues about the implementation of the measurement system needed for the monitoring activity are finally discussed...|$|R

It travels south via The Strand where it reaches the lights at Beach Road and Parnell Rise where it changes to Stanley Street. After one more set of lights at Alten Road, SH 16 becomes the Auckland Northwestern Motorway. The highway travels through the Central Motorway Junction where there are exits to SH 1 both northbound and southbound. The motorway travels west from central Auckland to West Auckland over a causeway crossing Traherne Island and the Whau Estuary. SH 16 then passes through West Auckland and past the junction with SH 18 (Upper Harbour Motorway) where it can be accessed by northbound traffic. The Northwestern Motorway terminates at the roundabout with Brigham Creek Road and Fred Taylor <b>Drive.</b> From here <b>SH</b> 16 reverts to single carriage road. It passes through the communities of Kumeu and Huapai, two areas of significant growth. SH 16 reaches the town of Helensville not long after.

40|$|Road {{transport}} {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} cost effective and preferred modes oftransport for both freight and passengers. India has an extensive road network of 4. 24 million km– the second largest in the world (MoRTH, 2005). The National Highways havea total length of 70, 934 km and serve as the arterial road network of the country. It isestimated that more than 70 per cent of freight and 85 per cent of passenger traffic in thecountry is being handled by roads. While Highways/ Expressways constitute only about 2 % of the length of all roads, rest are state highway, major district road, district roads andrural and other road which is consider as low volume road. Growing public awareness of climate change requires transportation professionals tointegrate green concepts into the transportation planning, design, construction, andoperation processes. Green highways are a relatively new concept although the implementation of technologiesinvolved in green highway design has been encouraged for many years. A green road maynot look like normal road at first glance, but with closer inspection a driver will noticesubtle difference. More plant life grows along the shoulder, and more trees are planted aswildlife buffers and ridding quality.
