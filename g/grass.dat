There are four <b>grass</b> pitches, one of which has undersoil heating, one artificial <b>grass</b> field and a multi-functional sports hall. After the closure of Munich American High School, FC Bayern purchased the DoDDS adjacent sporting fields that previously held MAHS's football pitch and baseball field. A new <b>grass</b> pitch was placed over the existing football pitch while an artificial turf field was placed over the baseball diamond.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of <b>grass</b> and several other <b>grass</b> species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of <b>grass</b> include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{monograph}} was {{to prepare}} the text portion of the topic ornamental <b>grasses,</b> outline their origins, {{to deal with the}} selected properties of <b>grasses,</b> whether environmental, horticultural or compositional. Furthermore, the search for information concerning reproduction, significance and possible recommendations on the use of <b>grasses.</b> Drafted was both a literary review, and the results of the discussions that are new valuable for practical application. At selected model areas were conducted annual observations in the 14 -day interval in 100 selected taxa of ornamental <b>grasses</b> in order to evaluate the properties of selected <b>grasses</b> on which there has been redefined and graphic arts habitual types. Results and discussion therefore engaged a total of five subchapters.

5|$|Cats do eat <b>grass</b> occasionally. A {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use <b>grass</b> {{as a source of}} folic acid.

50|$|Another {{potential}} buffer is {{to plant}} warm-season perennial <b>grasses</b> such as switchgrass, {{which do not}} grow early in the season.

40|$|Ornamental <b>Grasses</b> are a broad {{group of}} plants, which are {{presented}} {{by members of}} several species. As true <b>grasses</b> are signified {{members of the family}} Poaceae.

There are other species with their plants looking like <b>grasses</b> such as Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Araceae and Typhaceae. Among them are representatives of the genera included among the ornamental <b>grasses.</b> The main task of this thesis is to provide information on cultivation technologies and career opportunities in public and private plantations, the propagation and shipping material in horticultural companies. The emphasis is on bringing the most precise overview {{of the state of the}} current range of ornamental <b>grasses</b> and ways to use different types of plantings and living conditions.

40|$|Starch is {{the most}} {{widespread}} and abundant storage carbohydrate in crops and its production is critical to both crop yield and quality. As regards the starch content in the seeds of crop plants, there are distinct difference between <b>grasses</b> (Poaceae) and dicots. However, few studies have described the evolutionary pattern of genes in the starch biosynthetic pathway in these two groups of plants. In this study, therefore, {{an attempt was made}} to compare the evolutionary rate, gene duplication and selective pattern of the key genes involved in this pathway between the two groups, using five <b>grasses</b> and five dicots as materials. The results showed (i) distinct differences in patterns of gene duplication and loss between <b>grasses</b> and dicots; duplication in <b>grasses</b> mainly occurred prior to the divergence of <b>grasses,</b> whereas duplication mostly occurred in individual species within the dicots; there is less gene loss in <b>grasses</b> than in dicots; (ii) a considerably higher evolutionary rate in <b>grasses</b> than in dicots in most gene families analyzed; (iii) evidence of a different selective pattern between <b>grasses</b> and dicots; positive selection may have occurred asymmetrically in <b>grasses</b> in some gene families, e. g. AGPase small subunit. Therefore, we deduced that gene duplication contributes to, and a higher evolutionary rate is associated with, the higher starch content in <b>grasses.</b> In addition, two novel aspects of the evolution of the starch biosynthetic pathway were observed...|$|R

5|$|<b>Grass</b> and shrub seeds {{form the}} bulk of the diet, and leaves, flowers, fruit and scale insects are also eaten. The {{turquoise}} parrot has been recorded feeding on seeds of various plant species; more commonly consumed items include the fruit of common fringe-myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), seeds and fruit of erect guinea-flower (Hibbertia riparia), daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides), seeds of common raspwort (Gonocarpus tetragynus), Geranium species, black-anther flax-lily (Dianella revoluta) and <b>grass</b> species such as the introduced big quaking <b>grass</b> (Briza maxima) and little quaking <b>grass</b> (B. minor) and members of the genus Danthonia, members of the pea genus Dillwynia, and small-leaved beard-heath (Leucopogon microphyllus). Seed of the introduced common chickweed (Stellaria media) and capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) are also consumed. Nectar of Grevillea alpina, and spores from moss have been recorded as food items.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea couch <b>grass</b> and sea poa <b>grass</b> are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram <b>grass,</b> sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} in savanna ecology is how trees and <b>grasses</b> coexist under N limitation. We used N stable isotopes and N content to study N source partitioning across seasons from trees and associated <b>grasses</b> in a semi-arid savanna. We also used 15 N tracer additions to investigate possible redistribution of N by trees to <b>grasses.</b> Foliar stable N isotope ratio (d 15 N) values {{were consistent with}} trees and <b>grasses</b> using mycorrhiza-supplied N in all seasons except in the wet season when they switched to microbially fixed N. The dependence of trees and <b>grasses</b> on mineralized soil N seemed highly unlikely based on seasonal variation in mineralization rates in the Kruger Park region. Remarkably, foliar d 15 N values were similar for all three tree species differing in the potential for N fixation through nodulation. The tracer experiment showed that N was redistributed by trees to understory <b>grasses</b> in all seasons. Our {{results suggest that the}} redistribution of N from trees to <b>grasses</b> and uptake of N was independent of water redistribution. Although there is overlap of N sources between trees and <b>grasses,</b> dependence on biological sources of N coupled with redistribution of subsoil N by trees may contribute to the coexistence of trees and <b>grasses</b> in semi-arid savannas...|$|R
