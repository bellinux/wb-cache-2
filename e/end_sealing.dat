30|$|Viabahn stent grafts {{are covered}} self-expanding nitinol stents used in {{peripheral}} vessels, owing to their flexibility, durability and patency rates. These devices are catheter mounted and usually advanced into the desired position within an introducer sheath, and then revealed once in position. Once revealed, the device {{should not be}} re-withdrawn into the sheath. The aim of the introducer sheath is to avoid the device becoming snagged on calcified atheroma as manipulation can result in the device deploying prematurely of causing separation of the mounting catheter. Device delivery is achieved by pulling a drawstring at the device sheath hub. In this case, the RCA already had 2 overlapping stents. As a result the inner lumen was too constrained to allow a parent sheath to pass through; given the emergency nature of this case the Viabahn device was gently advanced into position through the preexisting stents not inside the a parent sheath. This was achieved with slow advancement of the device and magnified high-pulse rate fluoroscopy. Advantage wire provided a sufficiently stable platform to safely perform this maneuver. In the reviewed literature {{there is a single}} other case of a 5 [*]mm Viabahn stent used to treat a coronary pseudoaneurysm. The authors describe the flexible self-expanding nature of the stent provides good apposition within the vessel (Kim et al., 2017).

40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) {{with low}} levels of {{external}} pressurization and poor <b>end</b> <b>sealing</b> are prone to air entrapment, thus reducing the damping capability. Furthermore, existing predictive models are too restrictive. Single frequency, unidirectional load and centered circular orbit experiments were conducted on a revamped SFD test rig. The damper journal is 1 " in length and 5 " in diameter, with nominal clearance of 5 mils (0. 127 mm). The SFD feed end is flooded with oil, while the discharge end contains a recirculation groove and four orifice discharge ports to prevent air ingestion. The discharge end is fully sealed with a wave-spring that pushes a seal ring into contact with the SFD journal. The measurements conducted without and with lubricant in the squeeze film lands, along with a frequency domain identification procedure, render the mechanical seal dry-friction force and viscous damping force coefficients as functions of frequency and motion amplitude. The end seal arrangement is quite effective in eliminating side leakage and preventing air entrainment into the film lands. Importantly enough, the dry friction force, arising from the contact forces in relative motion, increases significantly the test element equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The identified system damping coefficients are thus frequency and amplitude of motion dependent, albeit decreasing rapidly as the motion parameters increase. Identified force coefficients, damping and added mass, for the squeeze film damper alone agree very well with predictions based on the full film, short length SFD model...|$|E

Specific results and accomplishments for the third quarter of 2003 include: (1) Bioreactor support systems and test facilities: (A) The solar collector used in the light delivery system showed signs of degradation and hence had to be replaced by ORNL. A set of light readings were taken after the new solar collector was installed. The readings showed an acceptable light profile. (B) The CRF- 2 test system has undergone major improvements to produce the high flow rates needed for harvesting (as determined by previous experiments). The main changes to the system are new stainless steel header/frame units with increased flow capacity and a modified pipe <b>end</b> <b>sealing</b> method to improve flow uniformity, and installation and plumbing for a new high flow harvesting pump. The improvements have been completed and the system is ready for testing. (C) The pilot scale bioreactor is ready for testing pending some information from the CRF- 2 tests. (2) Organisms and Growth Surfaces: (A) The shape of the Chlorogloeopsis sp. cells (cyanobacteria) was found to be affected by environmental pH, which may be useful in culture quality control. Besides, the further investigation of this phenomenon suggested that the rate of cell adhesion to glass surface decreases upon medium alkalinization.

40|$|Wood-water {{interactions}} {{including the}} effect of grain orientation, sample size and water potential in Pinus radiata D. Don were investigated. The influence of various chemical treatments on the wood-water interaction was also evaluated. The uptake of moisture by wood soaking in water was determined using the water soak method developed by Rowell and Banks (1985). Treatments with surfactants such as ammoniacal copper-didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC-ACQ) and linoleate salts increased the initial uptake rates of the wafers, whilst treatment with copper chrome arsenic (CCA), linseed oil (LO) and a combined CCA/LO treatment reduced uptakes of moisture. The length of time {{used to assess the}} water repellent effectiveness (WRE) was found to be crucial to the test, with most of the reduction in WRE occurring in the first 15 minutes of soaking. Exposure of wax treated wafers to weathering indicated an initial gradual reduction in efficacy, which decreased more rapidly as the length of exposure time increased Tests on the effectiveness of different wood coatings subjected to high humidity illustrated the importance of a film with low permeability and some elasticity. Wood blocks coated with resorcinol-formaldehyde resin initially inhibited moisture ingress, but failed after prolonged exposure. An extra coat increased the time required before failure. Coating the wood wafer with a silicone resin slightly reduced the uptake of water into the wafer. However, this resin was more permeable than the resorcinol-formaldehyde resin and was not as efficacious. The effect of various oil treatments on the uptake of water vapour indicated that the distribution of the oil is critical to inhibiting vapour uptake. No significant difference was found between the moisture uptake of hardwood and softwood stakes. Treatment with trimethylborate (TMB), DDAC-ACQ and CCA had no significant effect on the extent of vapour taken up by the wood. An experiment designed to investigate the importance of sample size when assessing wood performance was carried out using matched samples of treated and untreated quartersawn and flatsawn Pines radiata D. Don. It was found that samples treated with DDAC-ACQ and exposed outdoors experienced a greater flux in moisture content compared to controls. CCA reduced the extent of moisture uptake, with the incorporation of oil further enhancing the short term weathering performance. Quartersawn wood exhibited a smaller moisture flux than the flatsawn timber. However, the performance of CCA/Oil treated quartersawn wood was only marginally better than the quartersawn controls. Laboratory trials gave an identical treatment ranking as the exterior trial; however the use of the smaller sample size was identified as being inappropriate for the assessment of check formation in the timber. A sample size effect was demonstrated when assessing the efficacy of treatments by the water soak method. A treatment gradient could be demonstrated when whole stakes were impregnated with CCA and linseed oil by a two-stage process. The test indicated that the significance of improvements in the water repellency of treated wafers diminishes when larger sized samples are investigated. The effect of soil water availability on wood moisture content was determined for untreated hardwood and softwood sticks. At low soil moisture contents, hardwood sticks were found to be significantly more saturated than their softwood counterparts. At higher soil water contents (100 % water holding capacity (WHC)) the performance of the two species of wood became less significant. Chemical treatment was found to {{have a significant effect on}} reducing wood moisture levels when free water was available in the soil. Linseed oil was responsible for a significant reduction in moisture uptake, by blocking the pathways for water uptake as well as by decreasing the void volume available in the wood for water to occupy. Incorporation of a drying agent did not improve the quality of the film formed by the linseed oil as no significant change in water repellent performance was identified. The uptake and movement of water through a horticultural post was simulated using a procedure described by Baines and Levy (1979). The wick action of heartwood and sapwood stakes of Pinus radiata D. Don was investigated with distinct moisture distribution and behaviours found. Heartwood, being less permeable, showed a reduction in the volume of vapour that moved through the wood, as well as a much lower stake moisture content compared to the sapwood. This difference was most pronounced above the air/water interface and helps to explain the difference in decay resistance exhibited by the two wood types. <b>End</b> <b>sealing</b> the stakes with silicone resin was found to have no significant effect on the wick action of the stake. Lumen filling treatments with wax, oil and alkyd resins were found to significantly alter the wick action of the stakes. Treatment with low concentrations of surface active compounds such as DDAC-ACQ and linoleate soaps were found to increase the rate of water uptake. At higher concentrations the presence of the surfactant increased the hydrophobicity of the wood and reduced moisture uptake. Biological testing using a fungal cellar determined that treatment of the wood with CCA/LO, CCA, DDAC-ACQ/LO, LO and DDAC-ACQ significantly improved the resistance of the wood to decay. The incorporation of linseed oil did not cause a significant improvement to the decay resistance of the stakes over the trial periodRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide {{viscous damping}} to {{attenuate}} excessive vibrations and enhance system stability in turbomachinery. SFDs are of special importance in aircraft engines which use rolling element support bearings that, by themselves, {{do not provide}} enough damping to ensure safe operation. A modular test rig capable of simulating actual operating conditions in aircraft jet engines is used to test two centrally grooved, <b>end</b> <b>sealed,</b> SFDs. Both SFDs have diameter D and nominal radial clearance c and consist of two parallel squeeze film lands separated by a deep circumferential groove of length LG and depth dG. A short length damper with film land lengths L and a long damper with land lengths 2 L are tested. Piston rings seal the damper lands. An ISO VG 2 lubricant is supplied to the SFD via three radial holes that discharge lubricant into the central groove. The lubricant passes through the damper lands and across the piston ring seals to finally exit the damper at ambient pressure. Circular orbit tests of amplitude ~ 0. 5 c and for static eccentricities varying from 0 to ~ 0. 36 c are conducted on the two sealed dampers. The instrumental variable filter method (IVFM) serves to identify the SFD dynamic force coefficients. The parameter identification range is 50 Hz to 210 Hz for the short damper and 110 Hz to 250 Hz for the long damper. Large amplitude dynamic pressures measured in the central groove demonstrate that the central groove does not divide the damper in two separate film lands, but the lubricant in the groove interacts with the squeeze film lands, hence contributing significantly to the SFD forced response. Dynamic pressures in the film lands and in the central groove reveal that both dampers operate free of air ingestion or cavitation for the tested static eccentricities and amplitudes of motion. Comparisons to test results for the same SFD configurations but with open ends demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> on increasing the direct damping coefficients. For the <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> short length damper, the added mass coefficients are ~ 2 times larger and the damping coefficients are ~ 3. 8 times larger than the respective coefficients of the open ends long damper. For the <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> long damper, the damping coefficients are ~ 2. 8 times, and the added mass coefficients are ~ 3. 1 times larger than coefficients from the open ends configuration. The identified SFD direct stiffness coefficients are nearly zero except at the maximum static eccentricity for the long damper. Predictions from a novel computational model that include the effects of the central groove, the lubricant feed holes and the <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> are in excellent agreement with results from the short length damper. For the long damper, the predicted damping coefficients are in good agreement with the test results, while the added mass coefficients are under predicted by ~ 25 percent.

They often have entrained air within the oil film, which is usually not {{taken into account in}} rotordy-namics analysis due to lack of good formulations of the effects involved. The effects on the damping force calculation can be significant. This work presents a new formulation of the nonlin-ear Reynolds equation pressure evaluation within the squeeze film damper, including the effects of entrained air, with result-ing changes in effective lubricant density and viscosity. Viscos-ity and density expressions are developed {{as a function of the}} air/oil volume fraction. The density of the bubbly oil is a func-tion of the air bubble diameter, which changes due to surface tension effects during lubricant motion in the bubbly oil film. The lubricant viscosity decreases due to the entrained volume of air but increases due to the surface tension effects taken from experimental tests. Pressure supply and bubbly oil film cavita-tion effects are included in the analysis and <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> effects are evaluated. The nonlinear time-transient forces in the squeeze film damper are evaluated as functions of (1) lubricant and air properties; (2) damper geometry including diameter, length, clearance; (3) <b>end</b> <b>seal</b> properties; and (4) shaft position and ve-locity. Example cases of pressure calculations and radial and tangential forces are shown. Example nonlinear transient mo-tions are presented for a rigid, symmetrical rotor and for a non-symmetrical rotor representing a gas turbine–type fan rotor...|$|R
50|$|Contemporary ink {{metering}} systems {{employ a}} self contained system {{known as a}} chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> and doctor blades.One blade work as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|R
