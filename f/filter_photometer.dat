50|$|Two {{types of}} photometers are used: {{spectrophotometer}} and <b>filter</b> <b>photometer.</b> In spectrophotometers a monochromator (with prism or with grating) {{is used to}} obtain monochromatic light of one defined wavelength. In filter photometers, optical filters are used to give the monochromatic light. Spectrophotometers can thus easily be set to measure the absorbance at different wavelengths, and {{they can also be}} used to scan the spectrum of the absorbing substance. They are in this way more flexible than filter photometers, also give a higher optical purity of the analyzing light, and therefore they are preferably used for research purposes. Filter photometers are cheaper, robuster and easier to use and therefore they are used for routine analysis. Photometers for microtiter plates are filter photometers.|$|E

A comparison has been made between the simultaneous nightglow and the ionospheric parameters of virtual F-layer height and critical frequency of the F-layer at Ahmedabad (23.02 °N, 72.6 °E). In general, a good correlation (c.c. = 0.8 to 0.9) is found between the measured airglow emission and F-region peak electron densities during quiet periods but for intense magnetic disturbances the airglow fluctuations are mainly controlled by sharp changes in height variations of the h′ F layer. The period of airglow variation generally corresponds to periods of F-region height variation during magnetic disturbances. Using a long series of data between December 1989 and April 1996, the mean seasonal nocturnal variations of 630 nm emission have been compared during high and low solar activity periods.|$|R

40|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{uses the}} characteristic absorption of the molecules {{in the mid}} infrared and allows {{the determination of the}} gases and their concentration. Especially by the absorption at longer wavelengths between 8 μm and 12 μm, the so called "fingerprint" region, the molecules can be measured with highest selectivity. We present an infrared optical <b>filter</b> <b>photometer</b> for the analytical determination of trace gases in the air. The challenge in developing the <b>filter</b> <b>photometer</b> was the construction of a multi-channel system using a novel filter wheel concept - which acts as a chopper too- in order to measure simultaneously four gases: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia. The system consists of a broadband infrared emitter, a long path cell with 1. 7 m optical p ath length, a filter wheel and analogue and digital signal processing. Multi channel filter photometers normally need one filter and one detector per target gas. There are small detection units with one, two or more detectors with integrated filters available on the market. One filter is normally used as reference at a wavelength without any cross-sensitivities to possible interfering gases (e. g. at 3. 95 μm is an "atmospheric window" - a small spectral band without absorbing gases in the atmosphere). The advantage of a filter-wheel set-up is that a single IR-detector can be used, which reduces the signal drift enormously. Pyroelectric and thermopile detectors are often integrated in these kinds of spectrometers. For both detector types a modulation of the light is required and can be done - without an additional chopper - with the filter wheel...|$|E

40|$|Black carbon is {{a primary}} aerosol tracer for {{high-temperature}} combustion emissions {{and can be used}} to characterize the time evolution of its sources. It is correlated with a decrease in public health and contributes to atmospheric warming. Black carbon measurements are usually conducted with absorption <b>filter</b> <b>photometers,</b> which are prone to several artifacts, including the filter-loading effect – a saturation of the instrumental response due to the accumulation of the sample in the filter matrix. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this filter-loading effect depends on the optical properties of particles present in the filter matrix, especially on the black carbon particle coating. We conducted field campaigns in contrasting environments to determine the influence of source characteristics, particle age and coating on the magnitude of the filter-loading effect. High-time-resolution measurements of the filter-loading parameter in <b>filter</b> absorption <b>photometers</b> show daily and seasonal variations of the effect. The variation is most pronounced in the near-infrared region, where the black carbon mass concentration is determined. During winter, the filter-loading parameter value increases with the absorption Ångström exponent. It is suggested that this effect is related {{to the size of the}} black carbon particle core as the wood burning (with higher values of the absorption Ångström exponent) produces soot particles with larger diameters. A reduction of the filter-loading effect is correlated with the availability of the coating material. As the coating of ambient aerosols is reduced or removed, the filter-loading parameter increases. Coatings composed of ammonium sulfate and secondary organics seem to be responsible for the variation of the loading effect. The potential source contribution function analysis shows that high values of the filter-loading parameter in the infrared are indicative of local pollution, whereas low values of the filter-loading parameter result from ageing and coating during long-range transport. Our results show that the filter-loading parameter can be used as a proxy for determination of the particle coating, thus allowing for differentiation between local/fresh and transported/aged particles...|$|R

Compared to most commercial available thermal emitters, the one here presented {{is able to}} operate in a pulsed mode. This allows the use of lock-in techniques or pyrodetectors in the data acquisition {{without the use of}} an optical chopper for light modulation. Therefore, these types of thermal emitters are very important for small <b>filter</b> <b>photometers.</b> Several hot-plate suspension concepts were studied in order to find a design with excellent mechanical stability and high thermal decoupling. In contrary to the classical spider suspension design, a novel approach based on a non-axis-symmetric design is presented.

For temperature determination an additional Pt-structure is deposited onto the hot-plates. The emitters are mounted in TO- 5 housings using a ceramic adhesive and gold wire bonding. The used operation temperature is 750 A degrees C. In pulsed operation it's important to have a large modulation depth in terms of thermal radiation intensity in the needed spectral range. The maximal reachable modulation depth ranges from ambient temperature to steady state temperature. A modulation frequency of 5 Hz still allows using nearly the maximum modulation depth.
