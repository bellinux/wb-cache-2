40|$|A capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is {{once again}} on the {{legislative}} agenda. Proponents of a tax cut claim that {{it will lead to}} increased saving and investment, increased entre-preneurial activity, and consequently higher government revenues. Unlike in debates earlier this decade, current advo-cates of a capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> seem not to be pushing the idea that increased capital gains realizations alone are suffi-cient to cause revenues to rise in re-sponse to a lower tax rate. Current oppo-nents of a tax cut, on the other hand, maintain that a lower capital gains tax rate will have few positive incentive ef-fects, will induce an inefficient allocation of investment, and will lower taxes paid by the well-to-do. The equity argument of opponents, therefore, does rest on the assumption that capital gains realizations are not sufficiently sensitive to the capital gains tax rate to cause revenues to rise in response to a lower tax rate.

For all parameter values, the tax cut increases the mature firms ’ desired capital stock, holding interest rates constant.

40|$|The {{call for}} an {{across-the-board}} cut in {{the capital gains tax}} rate has won growing bipartisan support. Advocates claim that a tax cut would spur new investment, reward productive enterprise, serve as a simple proxy for inflation indexing, 1 and generate additional tax revenue from the consequent increases in asset turnover and productivity. Opponents contend a capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, that productive investment is relatively insensitive to capital gains tax rates, 2 and that any boost to asset turnover would be merely temporary. However, such debate ignores the fact that a large and growing share of capital gains tax revenues, perhaps as large as two-thirds of such receipts, are generated in the real estate sector, a sector that has little discernible impact on productive investment or employment. Moreover, the recent stock market rise has enlarged the number of taxpayers who now stand to gain from a capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> [...] even as it further weakens the rationale that a cut is required to stimulate economic growth. If the goal of the tax cut is to stimulate productive investment, then reductions should be targeted to those sectors most likely to generate them. A cut allowed the real estate sector not only would not stimulate new, productive investment, but would exacerbate existing economic distortions created by the tax.

40|$|Tax {{reform that}} reduces tax rates on capital income, {{no matter how}} {{successful}} it is in reducing the user cost of capital, will have at best minimal effects on capital formation and output and therefore on {{the growth of the}} U. S. economy. T hose who believe that Americans should save and invest more often call for lower taxes on various forms of capital income to boost capital formation and growth. This belief lies at the foundation of supply-side economics. It is common, for example, to see strong claims about the effect of capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> rates on the economy. Steve Forbes (1993) argued that the high-tech "boom of the 1980 s " can be attributed to late 1970 s capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> In denouncing the increase in capital income taxes in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Connie Mack (1995) complained that "we threw away the key to investment and economic growth in 1987 when the capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> rate was increased. " This kind of logic is used to justify <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> on capital income even though such tax reform is regressive, in almost all practical cases, because capital income is earned disproportionately by the wealthy. In this note, I point out some simple, but largely ignored, problems that can greatly limit the impact of lower capital income taxes on investment and growth. I work through some simple numerical exercises about the effects one might expect from a variety of widely touted cuts in capital income taxes. My argument boils dow...|$|R

For this purpose, we consider adjustment costs involved in the investment process and allow firms to make a forward looking investment decision in a R&D-based endogenous growth model.

The authors' analysis takes into account such factors as projects' degree of uncertainty, investors' degree of risk aversion, whether capital gains losses are deductible against capital gains income, whether the market value of an investment project is affected by the imposition of capital gains taxes, and whether the project is financed by internal or external means. They find that there is little theoretical or empirical basis for the view that lowering the capital gains tax rate would have a substantial effect on economic growth or level of economic activity. They estimate that the current proposal to lower the highest capital gains tax rate from 28. 0 percent to 19. 8 percent would have a long-term effect on the level of output no greater than the impact of roughly two months of normal economic growth, and it would take years to realize even this small benefit.

40|$|The price {{sensitivity}} of business investment spending {{is a central}} element in economic analysis. A substantial response of capital spending to its user cost, which combines interest, tax, and depreciation rates with relative prices, is critical to evaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy, deficit reduction, and tax reform. In spite of this central role, however, the supporting evidence for a substantial user cost elasticity (UCE) is modest. Several important concerns suggest a downward bias in elasticities estimated from the aggregate data typically employed in UCE research. These biases may arise from firm heterogeneity, measurement error, capital market frictions, and simultaneity. While such biases are theoretically plausible, their empirical importance remains to be substantiated. With a particularly rich data set, containing over 26, 000 observations, this paper explores what can be learned about the UCE from micro data. Investment and firm-level control variables are taken from an extensive panel of Compustrat forms. To construct the user cost, we tap a new data source that provides variation across firms as well as across time. A number of the econometric biases mentioned above have a substantial impact on the estimated UCE. After correcting for the biases, we obtain a precisely estimated but small value for the UCE of about - 0. 25. The effects of capital <b>gain</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and the "flat-tax" proposal on investment are evaluated with this estimated UCE. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a summary of parts of Lee 2 ̆ 7 s {{forthcoming}} article 2 ̆ 2 Critique of Current Congressional Capital Gains Contentions, 2 ̆ 2 15 Va. Tax. L. Rev. 1 (1995). Professor Lee believes that the reasons given by the House Ways and Means Committee Report and capital gains cuts proponents in the recent hearings and the House floor debate {{in support of the}} CWATRA 50 -percent individual generic capital gains cut are untrue in whole or in part. These stated reasons, reports Lee, are that a capital gains cut will (1) increase the personal savings rate, (2) encourage risk taking by entrepreneurs seeking new technologies and primarily benefit small-business people, (3) unblock many sales (true) permitting more money to flow to new, more highly valued uses such as new technologies and small business, (4) increase tax revenues short term (true) and long term, (5) primarily benefit middle-income taxpayers many of whom are temporarily pushed into higher income status by once-in-a-lifetime sales of a business, farm, or residence; (6) perhaps benefit lower income taxpayers as they become higher-income taxpayers due to substantial income mobility; and (7) lead to increased investment and thus greater productivity and higher wages for all Americans. The facts, writes Lee, are that (1) after the last capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> personal savings fell; (2) less than 10 percent of capital gains realizations go to small business (around 1 percent to venture capital startups) and most investment in small business is by the entrepreneur, family, and friends who probably would invest anyway; (3) while realizations will go up, most of the proceeds that are not consumer will go back on the public market into non-new-issue stocks; (4) increased realizations alone after an initial surge will lose revenue and any macroeconomic effects will take effect after the five-year budget window or be small (increased entrepreneurial activity); (5) taxpayers who infrequently realize capital gains account for less than 10 percent of realized gain while the top 10 percent by income of families who realize capital gains year after year account for 70 percent of the realizations; (6) income mobility studies most reflect the life cycle of young lower-income taxpayers growing older with higher wages and two-earner households and higher-income older taxpayers growing still older and retiring; and (7) notwithstanding the last capital gains tax cuts, average wages adjusted for inflation at the middle and bottom stagnated or fell.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact on}} asset prices from {{a reduction in the}} long-term capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> rate using an equilibrium approach that considers both demand and supply responses. We demonstrate that the equilibrium impact of capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> reflects both the capitalization effect (i. e., capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> decrease demand) and the lock-in effect (i. e., capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> decrease supply). Depending on time periods and stock characteristics, either effect may dominate. Using the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 as our event, we find evidence supporting a dominant capitalization effect in the week following news that sharply increased the probability of a reduction in the capital <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> rate and a dominant lock-in effect in the week after the rate reduction became effective. Nondividend paying stocks (whose shareholders only face capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes)</b> experience higher average returns during the week the capitalization effect dominates and stocks with large embedded capital <b>gains</b> and high <b>tax</b> sensitive investor ownership exhibit lower average returns during the week the lock-in effect dominates. We also find that the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> increases the trading volume during the week immediately before and after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> becomes effective and in stocks with large embedded capital <b>gains</b> and high <b>tax</b> sensitive ownership during the dominant lock-in week. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{capital income}} <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> {{that were part}} of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 are expiring this year and the {{administration}} has to decide whether to extend them or not. This paper assesses the effects of these <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> in a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium framework with uninsurable labor income risk. In particular, it looks at the effects of dividend and capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> on investment and welfare in a framework where firms are the owners of capital and make investment decisions to maximize their market value. While the effects of capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> are qualitatively similar to those found when households own the capital, we find that the effects of dividend taxes are different. Surprisingly, a dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> leads to a reduction in investment. The reason is that it raises the market valuation of the existing capital stock and households require a lower capital stock to maintain the same level of wealth. As a consequence, dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> are welfare reducing in the long run, {{not only because of the}} traditional reasons of redistribution from the poor to rich, but also because of a fall in aggregate production and consumption. Taking into account the transition mitigates the losses. Still, with our benchmark calibration, a reduction of dividend and capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> from 31 % and 24 % to 19 % leads to a reduction of more than 0. 5 % in aggregate welfare in consumption equivalent terms.
