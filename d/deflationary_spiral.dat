40|$|Abstract: The sharp fall in {{economic}} {{activity in the}} world is the result of an interaction between stock and flow deflation <b>spirals.</b> These <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals</b> have the same origin, i. e. a collective movement of fear and risk aversion (animal spirits). These lead economic agents (savers, firms and banks) to take actions that create negative externalities making these actions self-defeating. Individuals (savers, firms, banks) are unable to internalize these externalities because collective action is costly. We use a simple IS-LM model to analyze the interactions between these different <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals.</b> We find that it is the interaction between the flow and stock spirals that create an unstable economy. The banking crisis {{is at the center of}} this vicious downward spiral. In order to solve the coordination failure implicit in the <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals,</b> the government must take action. We describe the nature of the collective action by the government. Key is the resolution of the banking crisis, without which the economy cannot be stabilized. Modern macroeconomic models based on the paradigm of the rational (representative) agent who understands the complexities of the world, has become a misleading tool of analysis. The problems relating to coordination failures and movements of collective fears that are at the core of the present macroeconomic reality play no role in these models. It will not be surprising that these macroeconomic models have not informed us correctly about the nature of the economic crisis...|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} {{summarised}} {{in a historical}} analysis of monetary policy, Monetary History of the United States 1867-1960, which Friedman coauthored with Anna Schwartz.

Whether deflationary spirals can actually occur is controversial, with its possibility being disputed by freshwater economists (including the Chicago school of economics) and Austrian School economists.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> is a {{situation}} where decreases in price lead to lower production, which in turn leads to lower wages and demand, which leads to further decreases in price. Since reductions in general price level are called deflation, a <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> occurs when reductions in price lead to a vicious circle, where a problem exacerbates its own cause [...] In science, this effect is also known as a positive feedback loop. Another economic example of this principle is a bank run.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{generally}} {{believe that}} deflation {{is a problem}} in a modern economy because it may increase the real value of debt, especially if the deflation was unexpected. Deflation may also aggravate recessions and lead to a <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral.</b>|$|E
40|$|We derive policy {{implications}} for an inflation targeting central bank, who's credibility is endogenous and {{depends on its}} past ability to achieve its targets. We {{do this in a}} New Keynesian framework with heterogeneous agents and boundely rational expectations. Our assumptions about expectation formations are more in line with expectations observed in survey data and laboratory experiments than the fairly restrictive rational expectations hypothesis. We find that the region of allowed policy parameters is strictly larger under heterogeneous expectations than under rational expectations. Furthermore, with theoretically optimal monetary policy, global stability of the fundamental steady state can be achieved, implying that the system always converges to the targets of the central bank. This result however no longer holds when the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the nominal interest rate is accounted for. Self-fulfilling <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals</b> can then occur, even under optimal policy. The occurrence of these liquidity traps crucially depends on the credibillity of the central bank. <b>Deflationary</b> <b>spirals</b> can be prevented with a high inflation target, aggressive monetary easing, or a more aggressive respons to inflation...|$|R

5000|$|One {{reason a}} {{government}} will debase its currency is financial gain for the sovereign {{at the expense}} of citizens.

40|$|Liquidity and <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals</b> self‐generate {{endogenous}} {{risk and}} redistribute wealth. Monetary policy can mitigate these effects and help rebalance wealth after an adverse shock, thereby reducing endogenous risk, stabilizing the economy, and stimulating growth. The redistributive channel {{differs from the}} classic Keynesian interest rate channel in models with price stickiness. Central banks assume and redistribute tail risk when purchasing assets or relaxing their collateral requirements. Monetary policy (rules) {{can be seen as}} a social insurance scheme for an economy beset by financial frictions. As with any insurance, it carries the cost of moral hazard. Redistributive monetary policy should be strictly limited to undoing the redistribution caused by the amplification effects and by moral hazard considerations...|$|R

50|$|When {{prices are}} falling, {{consumers}} {{have an incentive}} to delay purchases and consumption until prices fall further, which in turn reduces overall economic activity. When purchases are delayed, productive capacity is idled and investment falls, leading to further reductions in aggregate demand. This is the <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral.</b> An answer to falling aggregate demand is economic stimulus to increase demand, either from the central bank, by expanding the money supply, or by the fiscal authority, by increasing public spending or decreasing or deferring taxes (see fiscal multiplier).|$|E
50|$|In modern credit-based economies, {{deflation}} may {{be caused}} by the central bank initiating higher interest rates (i.e., to 'control' inflation), thereby possibly popping an asset bubble. In a credit-based economy, a slow-down or fall in lending leads to less money in circulation, with a further sharp fall in money supply as confidence reduces and velocity weakens, with a consequent sharp fall-off in demand for employment or goods. The fall in demand causes a fall in prices as a supply glut develops. This becomes a <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> when prices fall below the costs of financing production, or repaying debt levels incurred at the prior price level. Businesses, unable to make enough profit no matter how low they set prices, are then liquidated. Banks get assets which have fallen dramatically in value since their mortgage loan was made, and if they sell those assets, they further glut supply, which only exacerbates the situation. To slow or halt the <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral,</b> banks will often withhold collecting on non-performing loans (as in Japan, and most recently America and Spain). This is often no more than a stop-gap measure, because they must then restrict credit, since they do not have money to lend, which further reduces demand, and so on.|$|E
40|$|We study {{monetary}} policy in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneity in expectations. Agents may {{choose from a}} continuum of forecasting rules and adjust their expectations based on relative past performance. The extent to which expectations are anchored to the fundamentals of the economy {{turns out to be}} crucial in determining whether the central bank (CB) can stabilize the economy. When expectations are strongly anchored, little is required of the CB for local stability. Only when expectations are unanchored, the Taylor principle becomes a necessary condition. More aggressive policy may however be required to prevent coordination on almost self-fulfilling optimism or pessimism. When the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate (ZLB) is accounted for, the inflation target must furthermore be high enough, in order to prevent coordination on self-fulfilling liquidity traps and <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider a general disequilibrium model of an applied orientation, exhibiting a {{detailed}} modelling {{of the private}} housing sector, which we have developed {{in a series of}} working papers starting from the Murphy model for the Australian economy. This modelling approach is complete with respect to budget equations and stock-flow interactions and can be reduced to a somewhat simplified 18 D core model, the dynamics of which was intensively studied in the earlier work. In the present paper we modify this type of model towards the explicit consideration of debtor and creditor households which extends the dynamics of the core model by 1 to 19 D by the addition of the dynamics of the debt to capital ratio of indebted households. Various subdynamics of these 19 D dynamics are investigated theoretically and illustrated numerically. The basic findings are that there is convergence to the balanced growth path of the model for sluggish disequilibrium adjustment processes, that persistent investment cycles in the housing sector can be generated for certain higher adjustment speeds by way of Hopf-bifurcations in particular. Furthermore processes of debt deflation my trigger monotonic depressions that get more and more severe when the real debt of debtor households is systematically increased by <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals</b> in the goods manufacturing sector in particular. structural macroeconomic models; housing; stability; investment cycles; debt accumulation; deflation...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} project we endeavour to model a financial marketplace {{dominated by a}} few interacting large institutional investors and draw conclusions about the financial market dynamics that this interaction gives rise to. More specifically, we study the problem of institutional investors, such as pension funds and life assurance companies, which operate {{in an environment of}} uncertain cash inflows and uncertain payouts with a minimum threshold. Investment strategies are taken as model primitives and an artificial financial market is populated by multiple investor types. Trading and investment decisions take place in discrete time. There exist a certain predetermined number of long-lived risky assets paying a random amount of dividends at each discrete point in time, as well as a risk-free asset with a constant interest rate. The risky assets generate random dividend intensities. Asset payoffs are aggregated and paid to investors {{at the end of each}} time period. The general economy is assumed to follow a hidden Markov model with two states, corresponding to normal and recessionary regimes. The existence of a minimum consumption constraint implies the possibility of bankruptcy. The effect of this occurrence on market clearing is modelled explicitly. We solve our model by means of numerical simulation. The size of the wealth endowment of the different agents is monitored through time over a large number of simulation runs. Our results suggest that both trend following and value investing strategies can be selected by the market under different circumstances. These two results lead to markedly different outcomes for the economy, as the prevalence of the trend following style leads to destabilization of the marketplace, volatility clustering and severe <b>deflationary</b> <b>spirals.</b> Dividend yield and modified regime-switching CAPM strategies are never selected by the market...|$|R

50|$|Ford's {{two books}} {{focus on the}} fact that {{widespread}} automation could potentially undermine economic growth or even lead to a <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral</b> because jobs are the primary mechanism for distributing purchasing power to consumers. He has warned that as income becomes ever more concentrated into the hands of a tiny elite, the bulk of consumers will eventually lack the income and confidence to continue supplying demand to the mass market industries that form the backbone of the modern economy. To deal with the rise of unemployment and to ensure that consumers have sufficient purchasing power to continue driving economic prosperity, he is in favor of a basic income guarantee.|$|E
50|$|The US Federal Reserve {{and central}} banks {{around the world}} took steps to expand money {{supplies}} to avoid {{the risk of a}} <b>deflationary</b> <b>spiral,</b> in which lower wages and higher unemployment led to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption. In addition, governments enacted large fiscal stimulus packages, by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis. The US Federal Reserve's new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma, broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity, and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Friedman {{summarized}} {{the causes of}} the crisis in November 2008: [...] Governments are having a problem arresting this <b>deflationary</b> downward <b>spiral</b> — maybe because this financial crisis combines four chemicals we have never seen combined to this degree before, and we don’t fully grasp how damaging their interactions have been, and may still be. Those chemicals are: 1) massive leverage — by everyone from consumers who bought houses for nothing down to hedge funds that were betting $30 for every $1 they had in cash; 2) a world economy that is so much more intertwined than people realized, which is exemplified by British police departments that are financially strapped today because they put their savings in online Icelandic banks — to get a little better yield — that have gone bust; 3) globally intertwined financial instruments that are so complex that most of the C.E.O.’s dealing with them did not and do not understand how they work — especially on the downside; 4) a financial crisis that started in America with our toxic mortgages. When a crisis starts in Mexico or Thailand, we can protect ourselves; when it starts in America, no one can. You put this much leverage together with this much global integration with this much complexity and start the crisis in America and you have a very explosive situation.|$|R

Economic performance was frequently poor in the following decades and the stock market never returned to its pre-1989 highs. Japan's system of lifetime employment largely collapsed and unemployment rates rose. The faltering economy and several corruption scandals weakened the LDP's dominant political position.

Within this period, Japanese output activities were stagnating; the deflation, {{in the sense of}} a negative inflation rate, was continuing to fall, and the unemployment rate was increasing.

50|$|Together, {{government}} and business spent more {{in the first half}} of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by 10%. In addition, beginning in the mid-1930s, a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the U.S.By mid-1930, interest rates had dropped to low levels, but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment were depressed.

Thus the central bank must directly set a target for the quantity of money (called [...] "quantitative easing") and may use extraordinary methods to increase the supply of money, e.g. purchasing financial assets of a type not usually used by the central bank as reserves (such as mortgage-backed securities).
