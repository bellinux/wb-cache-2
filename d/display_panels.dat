25|$|A glass solder is used, e.g., {{for joining}} {{together}} parts of cathode ray tubes and plasma <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> Newer compositions lowered the usage temperature from 450 to 390°C {{by reducing the}} lead(II) oxide content down from 70%, increasing the zinc oxide content, adding titanium dioxide and bismuth(III) oxide and some other components. The high thermal expansion of such glass can be reduced by a suitable ceramic filler. Lead-free solder glasses with soldering temperature of 450°C were also developed.|$|E
25|$|Each shoulder-clasp {{consists}} of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable chained pin. The surfaces <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On {{the underside of the}} mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the method of the LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> {{grayscale}} modulation, a method based on computer calculation is proposed. First, the development history and trends of the LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> are introduced. Second, present {{the structure of the}} LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> and the existed modulation method. Simultaneously, point out the ground for shortcomings of the existed method. Third, describe the principle modulation method based on computer calculation detail from two steps, which are the data signal transformation and the grayscale modulation. Forth, describe the realization steps of this method in accordance with the third step. Finally, this method is supplied in a LED <b>display</b> <b>panel,</b> whose resolution is 320 × 240. Experimental results show that this method is able to increase the grayscale from 14 -bit to 16 -bit, and can enhance the display result of the LED <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> significantly...|$|R
25|$|In {{this version}} of the setting, Russel Magnus works in a bucolic alpine town as a middle school history teacher who also coaches the school's martial arts team; as of the first issue he is trying to raise funds to get the team to a tournament in United Korea. He is married to Moira Magnus, a {{mechanic}} who works on industrial robots, and they are expecting their first child. Humanoid robots attend Magnus' school as students, as well as being integrated into a variety of purpose-built chassis.

25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E
25|$|A third {{version of}} the memorial, more like the {{original}} than the second in that it included the stands around the slate pitch and the figures above it, was installed in 1996, coinciding with the erection {{of the statue of}} Matt Busby, who had unveiled the original memorial. This third version was constructed by stonemasons Mather and Ellis from Trafford Park, and the second was put into storage. It is currently awaiting new <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> before being placed into the club museum's Munich display. The third plaque and the statue of Busby were originally located {{on the north side of}} the East Stand, but the statue was moved to the front of the East Stand and the plaque to the south side of the stand after the stand's expansion in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The Nintendo 2DS's {{hardware}} specifications {{are almost}} identical {{to those of the}} Nintendo 3DS; retaining features such as its GPU, CPU and memory, along with compatibility with games designed for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS. However, its hardware still contains some slight differences. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS, which uses two <b>display</b> <b>panels,</b> with a lower touchscreen panel and a top dual-layered screen panel capable of displaying autostereoscopic 3D, the Nintendo 2DS uses a single, non-stereoscopic LCD touchscreen, which is overlaid with a frame mimicking the screen dimensions of the 3DS. Despite its inability to display 3D content, the 2DS retains the 3DS's dual cameras for taking photographs in a 3D format. The Nintendo 2DS only has an internal mono speaker, as opposed to the internal stereo speakers of the 3DS, although stereo sound can still be output through the headphone jack.|$|E
25|$|Samsung {{became the}} world's largest {{producer}} of memory chips in 1992 {{and is the}} world's second-largest chipmaker after Intel (see Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Market Share Ranking Year by Year). In 1995, it created its first liquid-crystal display screen. Ten years later, Samsung grew to be the world's largest manufacturer of liquid-crystal <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> Sony, which had not invested in large-size TFT-LCDs, contacted Samsung to cooperate, and, in 2006, S-LCD was established as {{a joint venture between}} Samsung and Sony in order to provide a stable supply of LCD panels for both manufacturers. S-LCD was owned by Samsung (50% plus one share) and Sony (50% minus one share) and operates its factories and facilities in Tangjung, South Korea. As of 26 December 2011, it was announced that Samsung had acquired the stake of Sony in this joint venture.|$|E
25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E

500|$|The device's [...] LCD has a 1280×800-pixels resolution, {{giving it}} a density of 216 pixels per inch (PPI). Its IPS display enables a wide viewing angle (178°) without {{significant}} color distortion, and enhances color reproduction. The tablet's thin, lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special LCD design called Asus TruVivid. The LCD panel uses a [...] "one-glass" [...] solution and a non-traditional lamination technique. Tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass—two that sandwich the liquid crystal, a touch sensor glass, and a protective glass—whereas the Asus TruVivid design fuses the protective and sensor glass, with the sensor attached as a film. The conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding, in which the glass layers are glued around the edges, leaving air in between; Asus used a [...] "full lamination" [...] technique, in which the glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between. This yielded thinner <b>display</b> <b>panels,</b> but made production more difficult, as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting {{the quality of the}} screen. The tablet's display is protected by a layer of Corning Fit Glass.|$|E
