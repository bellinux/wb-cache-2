5|$|Designed in {{the early}} 1930s, {{it was one of}} the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war. The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, {{operating}} in the Condor Legion in various roles. Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939–1940. The Dornier was used throughout the early war, and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941, when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty {{fought a}} battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Greek naval {{plans were}} {{interrupted}} by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, however. Work halted on Vasilefs Konstantinos in August and on Salamis in December 1914. As a result, Kilkis and Lemnos were the only battleships delivered to Greece. Greece remained neutral for the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> World War I, though in October 1916, France seized the Greek Navy and disarmed both of the battleships. They remained inactive {{for the rest of}} the war. Both ships saw service in 19191922 during the GrecoTurkish War. They continued to serve with the fleet until the early 1930s, when they were reduced to secondary roles. Lemnos became a barracks ship while Kilkis became a training ship. During the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis by Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers. The two old battleships were scrapped after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral for the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war. Tensions with Germany {{came to a head}} in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E

Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice with Germany signed in November. With the war over, the Virginias were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.|$|E
