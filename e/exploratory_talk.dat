5000|$|Mercer's key {{interest}} is {{in the quality of}} talk and its impact on educational outcomes, including talk in the home for example, arguing that [...] "'social interaction and collaborative activity' in class can provide 'valuable opportunities' for learning" [...] and that classroom talk should be oriented around co-operation rather than competitiveness, to encourage <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> rather than disputational where the former focuses on explaining ideas, listening to others, and the building of mutual understanding and the latter on a lack of constructive argument which is characterised by disagreement with little explanation. [...] Research exploring this typology and its third component - cumulative talk, in which ideas are shared but not built upon or critically analysed - has found [...] "evidence of the link between the development of children's communication skills and improvements in their critical thinking.", leading to the suggestion that there should be more focus on these skills in classrooms, and commensurately teacher education programs, including in the context of computer use. This approach has been termed (and researched under the banner of) [...] "Thinking Together". This approach has been used internationally particularly in Mexico (see e.g.) and recently Chile.Mercer's research into the educationally salient components of discourse has been grounded in 'sociocultural discourse analysis' - a theory to which he has contributed.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{literature}} {{to determine if}} <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> could aid pupil learning and understanding in secondary schools and, if so, how it could best be utilised and what {{the roles of the}} ‘teacher’ and the ‘learner’ are in the process. We found five main themes related to talk and learning: <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> is educationally valuable but not easy to implement; ‘initiation-response-feedback’; is much more commonly used; there are other types of talk which are generally less good for developing thinking; <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> is good for collaborative learning; and <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> is best organised with a set of ‘ground rules’. It became apparent to us that agreeing and setting the ground rules was a very important factor in generating successful pupil to pupil talk for learning {{and that there is a}} strong relationship between adherence to ground rules for talking together and improving children’s ability to solve problems. For consistency of a whole-school approach, we found that these group-specific ground rules should be set within an overall framework developed through teachers developing ways to work collaboratively with colleagues to investigate ways of promoting <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> with all classes. Finally we highlight to school leaders the importance of developing and supporting a whole school approach to <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk...</b>|$|E

40|$|In the classroom, {{children}} are often asked {{to work in}} groups and to discuss learning activities together. However, they can find this challenging as they do not always have the necessary discussion and argumentation skills and may fail to understand what they should aim to achieve. Discussion {{is important in the}} science classroom as it is an opportunity for children to express their views and listen to those of their peers so a clearer understanding can emerge. However, it is often the case that teachers adopt a role that focuses on imparting information, thus giving students little opportunity to discuss their own views. We report on a study that involved primary school children aged 9 - 10 years, together with their teachers, in the learner-centred participatory design and evaluation of software – the Talk Factory – aimed at supporting <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> in science. The Talk Factory enables the teacher to represent, in real time on an interactive whiteboard, evolving graphical representations of specific features of classroom dialogue that constitute <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk.</b> We report on the participatory design process and how the teachers and students used the software during science lessons on evaporation. Analysis of video footage of lessons suggest that the Talk Factory was effective in supporting the teachers’ awareness and facilitation of <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk,</b> as well as the students’ engagement in rich discussions. We discuss how the teachers and students used the software to support the development of <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> in the classroom.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 64 - 68). It {{has been}} documented {{that there is a}} dearth of literacy and classroom discourse research in the northern regions of Mexico. In response, this qualitative study examines the social organization and discursive interaction of a 6 th grade classroom in a public elementary school located in the U. S. -Mexico border city of Mexicali. The interactions that occurred between the teacher and students were transcribed and then analyzed in light of the constructs of co-authorship, consensus construction, agency and <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk.</b> The results show that (1) the students usurped some of the teacher's authoritative roles and in this sense became co-authors of certain normative genres; (2) the classroom members exhibited a sociocultural tendency toward reaching consensus; and (3) the students engaged in <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> even though they had not received any explicit training in this type of discourse. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} teacher played an important role in facilitating consensus reaching and in promoting <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> by using certain participant structures that allowed spontaneous student talk. The findings are consistent with previous studies of Mexican classroom interaction and suggest it differs from interaction characteristic of the United States and other English speaking settings. This has potential implications for classrooms in the United States that receive Mexican immigrant children who bring with them discursive and interactional practices or expectations that could be misunderstood on account of their contrast with the social organization of the new classroom communit...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationships}} between Secondary school music trainee teachers and the mentors who are primarily responsible for training them to teach music. The methodology was an in-depth collective case study of a sample of trainee music teachers and their mentors, adopting primarily the methods of non-participant observations and interviews. The study is located within a review of pertinent theories of mentoring and an analysis of empirical research. This analysis compares studies of ITT mentoring in different contexts, and demonstrates that, despite the diversity of mentoring practice, research has produced findings which are consistent across two or more studies. The collective case study consists of five individual cases ofmentoring relationships, {{each of which is}} presented so as to preserve its individuality. The talk in meetings between trainees and their mentors is then analyzed drawing on Mercer's (1995) typology of classroom talk as exploratory, cumulative and disputational. The analysis shows that <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> has an underlying structure which is missing in cumulative and disputational talk. Analysis ofthe talk also reveals three further types of conversation between mentors and their trainees which are characterised as solo conversations, short conversations and parallel monologues. The study has two major conclusions: first, that in mentoring conversations <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> is more likely to promote productive reflection than other types of talk, and second, that the potential for <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> to promote reflection may not be fully realised by music mentors.

Evaluation of the first item of software, in the area of citizenship, focused upon the difference that off-computer lessons in <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> made to the way it was used. Evaluation of the second program, in the area of science, focused on the effect of the overall approach on learning outcomes. The results of these two illustrative studies support the value of the proposed framework.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{developed}} as a teacher-research project during initial teacher education – Masters Degree of Early Childhood and Primary Education, in Portugal. It analysed the interactions between children of 3 to 6 years old, during {{the use of the}} computer as a free choice activity, confronting situations between peers of the same age and situations between peers of different ages. The focus of the analysis was the collaborative interactions. This was a qualitative study. Children could choose the computer, amongst other interest areas, and work for around an hour in pairs. In the computer, children used mainly educational games. During four weeks, the interactions between the pairs were audio recorded. Field notes and informal interviews to the children were also used to collect data. Eleven children were involved in the study with ages ranging from 3 to 6 years old. Baseline data on children’s basic computer proficiency was collected using the Individualized Computer Proficiency Checklist (ICPC) by Hyun. The recorded interactions were analysed using the types of talk offered by Scrimshaw and Perkins and Wegerif and Scrimshaw: cumulative talk, <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk,</b> disputational talk, and tutorial talk. This framework was already used in a study in an early childhood education context in Portugal by Amante. The results reveal differences in computer use and characterize the observed interactions. Seven different pairs of children's interactions were analysed. More {{than a third of the}} interactions were cumulative talk, followed by <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk,</b> tutorial talk and disputational talk. Comparing same and mixed age pairs, we observed that cumulative talk is the more present interaction, but in same age pairs this is followed by <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> whereas in the mixed age pairs it is tutorial talk that has the second largest percentage. The pairs formed by the children were very asymmetrical in terms of age and computer proficiency. This lead to the more tutorial interactions, where one children showed the other or directed him/her on how to play. The results show that collaboration is present during the use of a computer area in early childhood education. The free choice of the children means the adults can only suggest pairing suited to specific interactions between the children. Another way to support children in more <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> interactions could be by discussing the way the older children can help the younger ones beyond directing or correcting their work...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possible}} effects that construction play (in {{the forms of}} guided play and guided play with <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk)</b> using the ‘ 6 Bricks’ approach has {{on the development of}} learners’ visual perception and reasoning abilities. The intervention, which aimed at developing visual perception, required the participating teachers to use the ‘ 6 Bricks’ approach three times a week over a period of six months. The sub-set of teachers in the intervention group who were also expected to facilitate discussion to promote reasoning abilities were tasked with additional ‘ 6 Bricks with exploratory talk’ activities once a week spread over ten weeks during the intervention period. The study followed an explanatory sequential mixed-method design with pre-post-testing using comparison and experimental groups to generate both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample included Grade 2 teachers and their learners in five purposively selected schools in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Quantitative data were generated via pre-post-analysis of two tests, namely, the Visual Perceptual Aspects Test (VPAT) and Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) test. Statistically significant improvements were found in the experimental group’s pooled VPAT subtest scores as opposed to only three for the comparison group’s VPAT subtest scores. Statistically significant improvements in mean scores were achieved by some schools in the <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> experimental group for the RCPM test. Qualitative data, obtained from teacher record sheets, researcher’s observations and semi-structured, open-ended teacher interviews were triangulated against the quantitative data. The findings, when considered in light of the literature, suggest that the ‘ 6 Bricks’ approach can {{contribute to the development of}} learners’ visual perception.

40|$|This is a year-long, action-research project {{investigating}} how {{to develop}} pupils' <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> and higher-cognitive thinking in secondary English classes. Four teachers, their Year 8 classes (110 pupils) in Sussex and an ITE educator collaborated to investigate whether the quality of pupils' <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> could be improved by a structured, pedagogical approach, and to explore contextual factors and other conditions for its development. The approach included making the skills of this formal, oral discourse explicit to pupils, using pupils' ground-rules, teacher modelling and structured tasks; regular practice and critical reflection on talk. It also involved cross-school collaboration, for example, classes evaluated each other‟s developing talk on video; and teachers met throughout the project to reflect on individual and collective issues and to review data and emerging findings. The data include qualitative analysis of pupil discourse taken from throughout the project, supported by associated observations and interviews with teachers and pupils. The study concludes that a rich, apprenticeship model inducting students in how to use exploratory, dialogic talk, including student critical reflection on this, contributes to the development both of this discourse and its associated higher-cognitive processes, especially {{in relation to the}} reading of texts. However, these appear to be necessary, but insufficient conditions for such development. The transformation in students‟ discourse depends on a more significant transformation in their identities, which is contingent on a similar shift in the range of teacher identities being performed. Practising <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> gives students experience of a wider range of identities, especially for those who are unconfident, low-achieving and/or from low socioeconomic backgrounds, in particular boys, but also girls, enabling them to gain a 'voice' in school precluded by the discourses and identities generally adopted. This, thus, enables students to develop ways of talking and thinking essential for achievement across the curriculum, moving from silence at the margins to speech at the centre. Teachers need to appreciate the extent to which discourse exceeds language structures, encoding ways of behaving, valuing and 'being' and therefore being related to both the relationships and teacher/pupil identities generated in the classroom. Furthermore, the study concludes that there is a highly significant relationship between pupils practising dialogic, <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> in groups and developing sophisticated reading comprehension skills: critical literacy, a key aim for all English teachers. The study defines a particular type of exploratory discourse that emerges in English lessons, when pupils are reading and collaborating in groups: 'tentative talk about text'. This is characterised by its speculative, tentative and analytical nature; its openness to plural interpretations of texts and its coconstruction of meanings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of a story-making app called Our Story and a {{selection}} of other educational apps on the learning engagement of forty-one Spanish 4 – 5 -year-olds. Children were observed interacting in small groups with the story-making app and this was compared to their engagement with a selection of construction and drawing apps. Children's engagement was analysed in two ways: it was categorised using Bangert-Drowns and Pyke's taxonomy for individual hands-on engagement with educational software, and using the concept of <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> as developed by Mercer et al. to analyse peer engagement. For both approaches, quantitative and qualitative indices of children's engagement were considered. The overall findings suggested that in terms of the Bangert-Drowns and Pyke taxonomy, the quality of children's individual engagement was higher with the OS app in contrast to their engagement with other app software. The frequency of children's use of <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> was similar with the OS and colouring and drawing apps, and a detailed qualitative analysis of the interaction transcripts revealed several instances of the OS and drawing apps supporting joint problem-solving and collaborative engagement. We suggest that critical indices of an app's educational value are {{the extent to which the}} app supports opportunities for open-ended content and children's independent use of increasingly difficult features...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports some of {{the complex}} issues encountered, {{researched}} and addressed {{in the context of}} participatory, practitioner action research to support student learning in educational settings. Research methods were devised in response to genuine school-based situations working with colleagues within communities of practice. The focus is the interplay between teachers’ communicative competence and teaching styles and students’ communicative competence and learning abilities. A series of four linked studies are reported which involved several hundred participants from pre-school to adult in a range of socio-economic and cultural settings, using mixed methods including interviews, observations and a comparative study. Improvements are reported in the cognitive-linguistic ability of students in relation to their narrative abilities following interventions conducted in classroom settings. The interventions involved support for narrative thinking and communication skills based around <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk.</b> The results suggest a positive relationship between students’ communicative and narrative competences and the potential for effective academic learning. Nursery school observations and interviews in Japan revealed informed and effective educational and cultural support for young children’s narrative competence and Japanese participants’ comparatively advanced development in narrative thinking. The results of the studies suggest that teachers’ classroom interactions involving <b>exploratory</b> <b>talk</b> serve to support and help improve students’ narrative competence and inner speech to support formal academic learning. The findings are discussed in terms of pedagogical knowledge, school culture and the UK educational climate...|$|E
