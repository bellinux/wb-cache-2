It {{is one of the}} few such Yogini temples in the country which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good condition. The temple is formed by a circular wall with 64 chambers and an open mandapa in the centre, separated by a courtyard which is circular in shape, where Shiva is deified. The temple has been declared an ancient historical monument by the Archaeological Survey of India.|$|E

The Keshava Temple {{is one of the}} finest {{examples}} of Hoysala architecture and <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> well preserved condition.

25|$|Amateur boxing {{is governed}} by the Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) and the {{equivalent}} bodies in the other home nations. British amateurs have only enjoyed a very modest amount of success in international competition in recent decades, {{partly due to the}} tendency for them to turn professional at an early stage. The amateur sport <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor state, with dramatic declines in boxer numbers. National amateur boxing championships and international team matches, which were once highlights of the British sporting calendar, receive only limited national recognition.|$|E
25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), {{as well as the}} redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E
500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> demoralized and chaotic condition, {{and will not be}} prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before that time I hope to be on the Susquehanna." [...] This was not a completely accurate assessment, but McClellan's army was moving lethargically, averaging only [...] a day.|$|E

500|$|Pendennis Castle {{continued}} in use through the 18th and 19th centuries {{under the command}} of successive captains, still operating in partnership with St Mawes. In 1714, Colonel Christian Lilly carried out an inspection of the fortification, finding it to be [...] "in a very precarious condition" [...] and noting that [...] "the body of the fort having been for many years neglected is now <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> ruinous condition". The parapets had collapsed, the ramparts could easily be scaled and the ditches were filled with brambles. Little was done to remedy this, however, until the 1730s, when the castle was extensively modernised. The interior was redesigned, the ramparts were rebuilt and the castle's guns were replaced, incorporating new 18-pounder cannons.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of twelve novels and two {{collections}} of short stories, Fleming provided a number of details relating to M's background and character. [...] In On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay {{as head of the}} Secret Service is £6,500 a year, (£ in [...] pounds) £1,500 of which comes from retired naval pay. Although his pay is good for the 1950s and 1960s, it is never explained how M received or can afford his membership at Blades, an upscale private club for gentlemen he frequents in London to gamble and dine. Blades has a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen and all must be able to show £100,000 (£ in [...] pounds) in cash or gilt-edged securities. Kingsley Amis noted in his study, The James Bond Dossier, that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling. As a personal favour to M, the staff at Blades keeps a supply of cheap red wine from Algeria on hand but does not include it on the wine list. M refers to it as [...] "Infuriator" [...] and tends only to drink it in moderate quantities unless he <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bad mood.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would {{live up to the}} original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Disturbia" [...] begins in a surrealistic, circus-like torture chamber where Rihanna is seen dressed in black, wearing dark make-up and having long black nails while she presses the keys {{of a big}} dark piano and looks into the camera. As the song starts {{different}} images of Rihanna are shown. In one of the scenes she is seen imprisoned wearing lenses that make look as if her eyes have rolled {{into the back of}} her head. Rihanna stays in the prison with two men watching on her from the both sides. Other scenes include Rihanna sitting on a throne chair and singing the song, while two strange women (one is played by American drag queen Detox Icunt) are around her. Then, multiple people around her are holding her in front of a gas chamber. As the chorus starts Rihanna is seen tied up in a bed from which she can't get out. At the bridge of the song Rihanna and her dancers are performing a Thriller-esque dance routine. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is seen holding a column and fire is around her. As the song continues, Rihanna drags a man doll around a metal web. In the second chorus she wears a metal spines corset while one tarantula is upon her arm. In the later scene, Rihanna <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tiny room, with her hands and legs been tied up. The video ends with Rihanna turning around on her chair.|$|E
500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bad way... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E
