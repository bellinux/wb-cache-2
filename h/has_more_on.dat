50|$|It's an {{experiment}} in human behavior. It's {{an exploration of the}} most natural of animal impulses. It's something new under the moon. And it bites. When security dispatcher Aaron Scates is blinded in an explosion, he's put in the care of Dr. Andrea Hewlitt, famous in her field for spearheading extraordinary - though controversial - medical breakthroughs. Her newest is cross-species organ transplants, and Aaron is her first human subject. When a severely wounded wolf is brought to Dr. Hewlitt's office by museum curator Lydia Armstrong, Dr. Hewlitt leaps on the opportunity and successfully transplants the wolf's eyes to Aaron-despite Lydia's objections. Aaron, however, is thrilled. Not only can he see again, he can see in the dark. He also develops an unusually acute sense of hearing, and tears into a raw steak like never before. Unfortunately, he also begins to growl, and to target people as prey. Lydia knows why. Knowing Aaron is in danger - to himself and to others - Lydia confesses that she too is a cross-breed but has learned to channel her feral instincts into a source of strength, not violence, {{with the help of her}} shaman friend, Claude Robertson. After Lydia and Aaron explore their other animal instincts in the privacy of Lydia's lair, she takes him to Claude's for a rite-of-passage to integrate the young man's spirit with that of a wolf. But Dr. Hewitt's colleagues, who have seen Aaron's wilder side, are determined to hunt the beast down and destroy him. What they don't know is that Aaron <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his side than a shaman and an empathetic girlfriend. He's made some new friends at the zoo. They travel in packs. And they don't need a full moon to commune.|$|E
5000|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 53% of 19 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.6/10. [...] Metacritic rated it 59/100 based on 13 reviews. [...] Eddie Cockrell of Variety called it [...] "slick but cliched", although [...] "Marcus {{and his team}} make up in substance what they fall short of in style." [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In his debut doc about superstar fighters, Bert Marcus offers more sociology than boxing fans may expect, using mean-streets origin stories not just for biographical intrigue but to comment on hardships his subjects faced later in life," [...] {{as well as that}} the film is a [...] "very polished doc <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> its mind than action in the ring." [...] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "needs a trip through a cliché-removing machine". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the documentary experiences [...] "varied success" [...] but [...] "comes from a place of caring for an oft-maligned sport". [...] Nick Schlager of Slant Magazine rated it 2/4 stars and called it [...] "an unfocused mishmash that thrives only when it fixates on footage of actual bouts". [...] At Indiewire, Kevin Jagernauth wrote that it [...] "examines {{what it means to be}} a man" [...] and [...] "while the director has no shortage of famous people showing up — Mark Wahlberg, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Spike Lee, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent — their contributions are carefully and tastefully selected, with Marcus largely ceding to the more knowledgeable and less flashy experts, who are the ones that truly contribute the context to make Champs as insightful as it is", and Zeba Blay described it as [...] "more a social documentary than a sports documentary". [...] Ashton Morris of The Hot Zone said, [...] "Bert Marcus, with keen intellect and whimsical creativity, illuminates a long ignored [...] "issue" [...] - that's putting it lightly - in a sport that has left its mark on the fabric of our country's history." [...] Jeff Sorensen of Crave Online wrote, [...] "Champs is really a film that needs to be viewed to really understand the scope of what it tries to show the viewer. It really attempts to show the courage of what it takes to be a man among such hardships. We all fail at times. We all hit major turning points in our lives. Champs shows 3 men who have been through the best of the best and the absolute worst of the worst." ...|$|E
