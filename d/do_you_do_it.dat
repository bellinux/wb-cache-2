2500|$|Breathing soon {{attracted}} his attention. According to Liberati, [...] "It {{is an easy}} {{matter to}} hold a tone for say twenty seconds, isn't it? Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Well I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth as long as I could hold a tone. When you play you must let only the amount of air pass the lips that is needed to produce the tone—no more. I went to work on this and now I can play an air or an allegro exercise as long as I can hold a tone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--and I wouldn't {{want you}} to. You couldn't {{understand}} unless you {{was an old}} man who had it in him once to do something and be a MAN, and just went and made himself a devilish fool. But there must be something in you that understands things--all kinds of things--or you couldn't put it all into music the way you do. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> How in--how <b>DO</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> young Felix?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Something {{that was}} not all oil here shining in Lamps's eye, Barbox Brothers withdrew his own a little disconcerted, looked at the fire, and put a foot on the top bar. [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then?" [...] he asked after a short pause; {{abruptly}} enough, but in a softer tone. [...] "If <b>you</b> didn't want to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> sing them? Public-house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' cried Nuttie, with a {{prolonged}} intonation. 'Is it?--Oh, Mark! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{that night when}} <b>you</b> led the horse home?' ...|$|R
6000|$|She did not flinch. [...] "Do we {{know the}} truth now?" [...] she asked, looking at him steadfastly. [...] "I don't want to hurt you--you know that; but please tell me, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> really <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I mean, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{in the way we}} have been led to suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|MAGGIE. Ah, but John, {{whatever}} you <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so tremendously; {{and if you}} were to love, what a passion it would be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} care!" [...] Lois exclaimed tremulously. [...] "You {{know very well}} that you don't care. It is all pretence, this. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Why do you make me so unhappy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then--" [...] The captain hesitated {{and cleared}} his throat. [...] "With {{all the money}} you've got, only a fool would take the risk you did with those two curs. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Mr. Worthington in Washington," [...] said he. [...] "Now it is 'Bob' and 'Miss Wetherell.' Rank patronage! How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Cynthia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, afore. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Gabe?" [...] said Olly, comfortably fixing {{her chin}} in her hands, {{and looking up}} in her brother's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the same}} old Johnny," [...] said Gilliam, joyfully. [...] "What the devil--I mean why-- Oh, {{confound}} <b>it!</b> what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for, old man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] gasped Peter. [...] "Oh, Mocker, how {{under the}} sun <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I was {{sure that it was}} Glory whom I heard whistling. Never again will I be able to believe my own ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you take}} it then? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Your life is not like his. Oh, Scatcherd! Scatcherd!" [...] and the doctor {{prepared}} to pour out the flood of his eloquence in beseeching this singular man to abstain from his well-known poison.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, {{thrusting}} out {{my head as}} a tortoise does, [...] "when in {{this very}} hut you seemed to produce the shape, also out of smoke, I think, of one whom I used to know. Say, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Zikali?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS GEORGE. <b>Do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> strike <b>you</b> {{that if we}} {{were all}} as clever as <b>you</b> at <b>doing</b> without, there wouldnt be much to live for, would there? ...|$|R
2500|$|Shāmi also cites a {{usage of}} al- as an {{interrogative}} particle. For example, [...] al fa‘alta (<b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?).</b> Notice that the al- stands alone and un-prefixed here.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wonderful--wonderful!" [...] I {{could not}} help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip. [...] "But how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> By what process of induction--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your face ain't cherubic," [...] {{observed}} the Bloater, {{looking down at}} his little friend. [...] "If anythink, I should say it partakes of the diabolic; so you've got no occasion to make it wus than it is by twistin' it about like that. Wotever <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You make a slave of me already. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I never obeyed a woman before. Jean, I {{think you}} are a witch. Scotland {{is the home of}} weird, uncanny creatures, who take lovely shapes for the bedevilment of poor weak souls. Are you one of those fair deceivers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're early out, Muster Crawley," [...] said Morris, {{and then}} he went on with his fire. [...] "Drat the sticks, if they bean't as wet as the old 'un hisself. Get up, old woman, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> for I can't. They wun't kindle for me, nohow." [...] But the old woman, having well noted the {{presence}} of Mr. Crawley, thought it better to remain where she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "I figured you'd {{be blown}} into very little pieces {{less than a}} minute ago," [...] said one of those who stood by. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for, anyway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why, in God's name, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I wasn't myself, then, {{you ought}} to have seen that. And when I heard from Caldwell here that you'd joined those anarchists--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Simson considered. There came {{a softer}} {{look into his}} eyes. [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> last time?" [...] he asked. [...] "It came up brown, I remember, with thick gravy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, my dear,' said Merry, with {{engaging}} candour, 'that I {{have been}} afraid of that, myself, all along! So much incense and nonsense, {{and all the rest}} of it, is enough to turn a stronger head than mine. What a relief it must be to you, my dear, to be so very comfortable in that respect, and not to be worried by those odious men! How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Cherry?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] he cried. [...] "I'm {{taking the}} air. You {{seem to be}} able to drive donkeys forward. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I can't. Never done {{anything}} so dangerous in my life before. I've just been missed by two motor cars, and hung for a terrible minute with my left wheel on the very verge of an unfathomable ditch. I could hear the little ducklings far, far below, and bits of mould dropping. I tried to count before the splash. Aren't you--white?" ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. You play {{tricks on}} me--and on yourself. You know you <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for the pure {{enjoyment}} of it. You're making a scene {{here in this}} filthy market-place, just {{for the fun of}} it. You like to see these accursed colliers standing eyeing you, and squatting on their heels. You like to catch me out, here where I'm known, where I've been the object of their eyes since I was born. This is a great coup de main for you. I knew it the moment I saw you here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Stubbs, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it?--why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> That {{money would}} have got us away from this hateful place, an' we'd {{have gone back to}} Uncle Dan'l's, where we'd have been so happy, you an' me. An' now it's all gone--all gone. What made you, Mr. Stubbs--what made <b>you</b> <b>do</b> such a bad, cruel thing? Oh, what made you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me, what's this, what's this!" [...] he said, {{rubbing his}} head and walking about with his good-humoured vexation. [...] "What's this they tell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have <b>you</b> been <b>doing?</b> Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> How could <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> How much apiece was it? The wind's round again. I feel it all over me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say, are <b>you</b> crazy? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for? Didn't I {{tell you}} as plain as I could; didn't I say it twenty times, {{when you came}} for the tickets, that yours was thirty-six?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake tell me," [...] {{she cried}} passionately, [...] "what {{has come to}} you, what manner of a man are you? You loved me once! Now, even, after all these years, you cannot deny it. You {{have gone out of}} your way to be with me, to be my {{companion}} wherever we are. People are beginning to smile when they see us together. I don't mind. I--for God's sake tell me, Wingrave! Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Why do you lend me this money? What can I do for you? What {{do you want me to}} be? Are you as cold as a stone? Have you no heart--no heart even for friendship!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{turn and}} {{consider}} you," [...] Dominey continued, ignoring altogether his friend's remark. [...] "You are only my age, {{and you look}} ten years younger. Your muscles are hard, your eyes are as bright {{as they were in}} your school days. You carry yourself like a man with a purpose. You rise at five every morning, the doctor tells me, and you return here, worn out, at dusk. You spend every moment of your time drilling those filthy blacks. When you are not doing that, you are prospecting, supervising reports home, trying {{to make the best of}} your few millions of acres of fever swamps. The doctor worships you but who else knows? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for, my friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} like it in literature," [...] Martin said, when at last {{he was able to}} speak. [...] "It's wonderful!--wonderful! It has gone to my head. I am drunken with it. That great, infinitesimal question--I can't shake it out of my thoughts. That questing, eternal, ever recurring, thin little wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears. It is like the dead-march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of {{elephants}} and the roaring of lions. It is insatiable with microscopic desire. I now I'm making a fool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me. You are--I don't know what you are--you are wonderful, that's all. But how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> How do you do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{know about}} that!" [...] Pamela interrupted. [...] "That {{is the one}} thing that always sets me {{thinking}} about <b>you.</b> What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for? How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> know what <b>it</b> meant to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, how was {{it about}} digging for <b>it?</b> Tell us, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Were <b>you</b> there? Did you see it? And why couldn't they get it?" [...] we both asked eagerly and in one breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Have <b>you</b> {{searched for}} hidden treasure, or {{discovered}} a pole, or done {{time on a}} pirate, or flown the Channel, or what? Where is the glamour of romance? How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get it?" ...|$|R
