5|$|The initial budget, at {{approximately}} $140 million, led Evan Almighty {{to become the}} most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million. The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777). His leg wound left Arnold bedridden for five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andre led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne's right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Grand Fleet was dissolved, and Benbow was {{assigned}} to the 4th Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, where she served until March 1926. In 1919, Captain Charles Douglas Carpendale took command of the ship, a position he held until 1921. During this period, from April 1919 to June 1920, the ship took part in anti-communist operations in the Black Sea. Benbow and other elements of the Mediterranean Fleet supported the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. In late January 1920, Benbow was sent from Constantinople to Novorossiysk. There, the ship relieved Iron Duke, and shortly thereafter rescued a group of 150 Russian soldiers and their British adviser, who had been attacked by bandits. On 1 February, Rear Admiral Michael Culme-Seymour hoisted his flag aboard Benbow. Shortly thereafter, men from the ship were sent to inspect White positions in the Kerch Peninsula. Benbow was ordered to return to Constantinople in June, where the Mediterranean Fleet was concentrating to begin supporting Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War; she arrived there on 19 June. On 5 July, Benbow and several other vessels left Constantinople to land a force at Gemlik to secure the harbor in order to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Greek forces that would arrive later. Benbows men returned to the ship on 16 July after a Greek battalion reached the town.|$|E
25|$|Wasteland {{could be}} leased for reclamation, the tenant being rent-free {{for three years}} and paying a stipulated rent in the fourth year. If the tenant {{neglected}} to reclaim the land, the Code stipulated that he must <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> in good tilth and set a statutory rent. Gardens or plantations were leased in the same ways and under the same conditions; but for date groves, four years' free tenure was allowed.|$|E

However, Sheriff Simmons went to Ciudad Juarez and convinced the Mexican jefe, Rafael Garcia Martinez, to take the body to San Elizaro and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> Captain Jones was first buried at his father-in-law's ranch, but in 1936 he was exhumed and reburied in Ysleta. A state historical marker has since been placed at the grave.|$|E
25|$|In April 1803, Napoleon sold Louisiana (New France) (which then {{included}} {{portions of}} more than a dozen present-day states) to the U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase. A French prefect, Pierre Clément de Laussat, who had only arrived in New Orleans on March 23, 1803, formally took control of Louisiana for France on November 30, only to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the U.S. on December 20, 1803. In the meantime he created New Orleans' first city council, abolishing the Spanish cabildo.|$|E

The pandit of the east will then sum up the anointment with a similar speech as above, with appropriate replies from the king. The Chief Brahmin will then approach the king and hand him the great royal nine-tiered white umbrella, the symbol of a consecrated king. The king will accept it and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to a royal page. A mantra is then invoked by the Brahmin, to fanfare and music. The king will then rise from the throne and proceed to the crowning.|$|E

The housing units below the slide would also be secured against landslides by a concrete wall. Furthermore, the municipality gave the residents new, temporary places to live and monetary compensation. The owners of the housing unit not included in the agreement risked having to move back to his home after his insurance company paid its repairs, which they were very reluctant to do. However, eventually the company decided to take over the house and then <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the municipality for demolishing.|$|E
25|$|The Margraviate of Brandenburg {{entered the}} scene after Mestwin II, son of Swietopolk, {{concluded}} the Treaty of Arnswalde with them, {{in order to}} receive aid against his brother, Wartislaw. The margraves took over the town in 1270/1 from Wartislaw, but did not <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Mestwin until the latter was able to force them out by concluding an alliance with Boleslaw Pobozny, duke of Greater Poland. Under the rule of Brandenburg conflicts erupted between Slavic and German population, which cost many lives. In the 1282 Treaty of Kępno Mestwin II promised his Pomerelian duchy to his ally Przemysł II, duke and later king of Poland, who succeeded to the duchy after Mestwin's death in 1294.|$|E

In response to it, Tsang set up a Commissioner for Heritage Office and earmarked $1billion to revitalise historic buildings. He also proposed a series of revitalisation projects that would add {{a new dimension to}} Central. For instance, to reduce the development density of the Central Ferry Piers site and open up the public space along the waterfront for entertainment, recreational and cultural uses; to remove the Central Market from the Application List and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Urban Renewal Authority for conservation and revitalisation; and to convert the Murray Building into a hotel through open tender etc.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} 1970s there was widespread debate about running MG into the Aston Martin consortium. 85 Tory MPs formed themselves into a pressure group to get British Leyland to release their grip and <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> CH Industrials plc (car components) bought a 10% share in AML. But in July 1980 blaming a recession AML cut back their workforce of 450 by more than 20% making those people redundant and the following day British Leyland announced it had abandoned hope of an MG rescue by Aston Martin.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} recruit migrant {{domestic}} workers, Lebanese recruitment agencies collaborate with {{agencies in the}} migrant sending countries. Migrant domestic workers are required to pay a fee to the local agent in their home country, usually a large sum of money which causes them to incur a large debt. Once the fee transaction is complete the agency arranges the transportation. The employer is obliged to meet the migrant worker at the airport gate where a general security guard who holds the employee's passport will <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> directly to the employer. A medical examination and the resulting report must be fulfilled before the work permit is issued and the insurance for the worker must be paid by the employer within three months. A standard unified contract is drawn up which is more in favour of the employer than the migrant worker.|$|E

Ben signs the paperwork for the garage when Phil decides to <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to him and Sharon is left stunned when he decides to give Jay the car lot land as it {{is worth more than}} the garage. Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about giving Jay the car lot land. Ben finds a solicitor's letter of Phil's that mentions Raymond and after confronting Phil, Phil tells Ben that Raymond is his half-brother. Ben is angry with Phil for making him feel second best to his and Sharon's other children. Jay attempts to confront Phil about why he is receiving the car lot and Phil admits he killed his biological father who was the homeless man who died in the car lot fire when Phil torched it 23 years previously in an insurance scam. Phil then reveals this to be a lie in a mysterious phone call. Billy confronts Phil over his actions and ends up punching him. Later, Phil is knocked unconscious when the exposed gas line explodes during the Walford in Bloom event, but he is unharmed.|$|E
