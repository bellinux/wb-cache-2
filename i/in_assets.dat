40|$|Serial {{correlations}} <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> {{prices are}} {{often associated with}} irrational investment decisions (e. g., speculative bubbles) or inefficient markets. This paper shows that even asset prices determined rationally in an efficient market become predictable if underlying cash flows contain predictable components. In particular, I show that cash flows from real estate tend to contain a predictable "overshooting" component, due to slow adjustments <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> supply. Such predictable cash flows result in overshooting prices of real estate. Even though rational capitalization rates counteract the overshooting, the property price still exhibits predictability. The analysis indicates that the rational benchmark price must be carefully modeled when one tests irrationality or inefficiency <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> prices. ...|$|R

It shows that the fall in US macroeconomic volatility since the mid- 1980 s only leads to a relatively small increase <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> prices when investors have full information about the highly persistent, but not permanent, nature of low volatility regimes. When investors infer the persistence of low volatility from empirical evidence, however, Bayesian learning can deliver a strong rise <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> prices by up to 80 %. Moreover, the end of the low volatility period leads to a strong and sudden crash <b>in</b> prices. <b>Asset</b> Prices; Great Moderation; Macroeconomic Risk...|$|R

By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits and $108.5 million by 1989. By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries.

5|$|With {{the success}} of his chain of bookstores, Wilkinson pursued other {{business}} ventures in the fields of real estate development, farming, transportation, banking, coal interests, and construction. He purchased several private aircraft to help him tend to his diverse interests throughout the state, and in 1973, created Wilkinson Flying Service to keep the planes busy when he wasn't using them. After investing in the unfinished Bluegrass Commerce Center in Lexington in early 1977, he purchased one-third interest in the Purcell building on Lexington's Vine Street later that year. The building was only partially occupied, but had become more valuable because of the opening of nearby Rupp Arena in October 1976 and a new Hyatt hotel in May 1977. Developers Donald and Dudley Webb developed plans to construct the Vine Center on the block; by May 1979, they had options to buy every property on the block except Wilkinson's interest in the Purcell building. Unwilling to meet Wilkinson's asking price, they instead formed a partnership with him to co-develop the Vine Center. When Wilkinson eventually sold his interest in the venture at the end of 1981, he turned a profit of at least $1.3 million on his investment. Next, he formed a public-private partnership with the city of Lexington to construct the Capital Plaza Hotel in 1983. The city provided $3 million in capital and another $8.5 million in guaranteed loans to supplement Wilkinson's $1.15 million investment. Wallace's Book Stores was given 95% ownership in the hotel, allowing the company to shield $2 million <b>in</b> <b>assets</b> from federal income taxes and claim over $400,000 in tax credits.|$|E
