500|$|There {{was this}} really amazing quality in 'Paparazzi', where {{it kind of}} had this pure pop music quality {{but at the same}} time it was a {{commentary}} on fame culture... I wanted to do the same thing with this video... There certainly is a Tarantino-inspired quality in the [...] video... His direct involvement in [...] came from him lending me the Pussy Wagon. We were having lunch one day in Los Angeles and I was telling <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> concept for the video and he loved it so much he said, [...] "You gotta use the Pussy Wagon." ...|$|E
2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over to talk to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I {{asked him if he}} had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{says that}} his views on {{abortion}} were drastically altered on November 9, 2004, after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at Harvard University. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning. The Governor says that Melton declared that the research [...] "is not a moral issue because we kill the embryos at 14days." [...] "I looked over at Beth Myers, my chief of staff, and we both had exactly the same reaction, which is it just hit us hard," [...] recalled Romney. [...] "And as they walked out, I said, 'Beth, we have cheapened the sanctity of life {{by virtue of the}} Roe v. Wade mentality.' And from that point forward, I said to the people of Massachusetts, 'I will continue to honor what I pledged to you, but I prefer to call myself pro-life.'" [...] Melton disputes Romney's account of the meeting, declaring [...] "Governor Romney has mischaracterized my position; we didn't discuss killing or anything related to it ... I explained my work to him, told <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{then gave}} me some {{particulars}} concerning the large thing he travelled in; and when I had expressed all the interest and admiration the subject called for, he condescendingly invited me to tell <b>him</b> something <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own small line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then be nice, sweet, good to him.... {{make him}} love you.... Don't tease <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> other beaux. Think {{how you can}} make him like 'Many Waters.'" ...|$|E
60|$|When Sullivan {{appeared}} in the morning, I asked <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> mare, which he informed me was doing well. I then bade him bring me hot shaving-water, in a loud dignified tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me begin}} with what I hate most to remember, and so be the sooner done with it--let {{me begin with}} the paltry string of falsehoods which I told <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family troubles.|$|E
60|$|But soon {{that night}} she was closeted with Dudley, and closely {{questioning}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the affair. <b>My</b> lord was mightily vehement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, your husband, to be sure; don't he {{take his}} turn in sitting? If he don't, he ought to. I shall speak to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>My</b> husband always sits {{regularly}} half the time, that I may {{have time to}} go about and exercise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{will take}} myself," [...] Mr. Vickars said. [...] "I {{was just going}} up to <b>him</b> to speak <b>about</b> <b>my</b> parish affairs when you arrived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I will go," [...] said Edward. [...] "Confound that Quaritch. At {{any rate}} I can {{show him how}} to shoot, and what is more I will have it out with <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> aunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] added Morris, [...] "and when I {{spoke to}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> windows, as got blown in, he said `cottages were {{no end of}} expense, and we hadn't treated them so as they would wish to come back nohow.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|P.S.--Papa gave us such a fright, for {{he came in}} {{just now}} {{and said that the}} window-cleaner and all his family were very ill. This was a joke, because the coachman had told <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> tart. Wasn't it horrid of him? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My visitor," [...] she said, [...] "was a detective--from Scotland Yard. He {{came to know}} if I {{could give}} <b>him</b> any {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> fellow--passenger from Accreton on February 10th." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you keep}} Vigil to dinner?" [...] he said. [...] "I {{could have given}} him things for the night. I {{wanted to talk to}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{insuring}} <b>my</b> life; he knows, about that. There'll be a lot of money wanted, to pay my death-duties. And if the Radicals get in I shouldn't be surprised if they put them up fifty per cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To defend {{me against}} Mr. Littlemore? I’ve known him since I was a baby—I know the worst he can do.” She fixed her charming {{smile on her}} {{retreating}} visitor and added with much unexpectedness: “I {{want to talk to}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> past!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I am not ungrateful. And as to consulting, Bernard, I {{should be}} much more {{inclined}} to consult you than <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> marriage. If you would let me look on you altogether as a brother, I should think little of promising to marry no one whom you did not approve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you breakfasted at six this morning, {{you must}} be hungry. My dinner will be ready in half an hour, and you had better share it with me. I must go now, and tell the king the news that you have brought. I said nothing to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> having sent you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. MacKenzie very rightly thought I {{should know}} at once {{what was said}} <b>about</b> <b>him</b> and <b>my</b> brother. He sent me the paper himself this evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You may be easy <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>my</b> dear,' said James. 'He {{has laid}} hold of Louis, who would swallow the whole Spanish legion of impostors. He will be after us {{directly}} with a piteous story.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Captain Hagberd, {{inside his}} dark house, had {{kept on the}} alert. A window ran up; and {{in the silence of}} the stony country a voice spoke above her head, high up in the black air--the voice of madness, lies and despair--the voice of inextinguishable hope. [...] "Is he gone yet--that {{information}} fellow? Do you hear <b>him</b> <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> dear?" ...|$|E
60|$|I told <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> guide, for I {{was proud}} of what I had done, and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence. At {{the mention of the}} five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two, and was glad he could not see my blushes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll {{have the}} {{goodness}} to notice, Mr Boffin,' remarked Venus, 'that I {{said nothing to}} <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> going out of the affair altogether, because I didn't wish to take you anyways by surprise. But I can't be too soon out of it for my satisfaction, Mr Boffin, and I now {{put it to you}} when it will suit your views for me to retire?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has done}} nothing that I know. There;--I {{will tell you the}} whole. I found <b>him</b> prowling <b>about</b> <b>my</b> garden at near midnight, yesterday. Had he been alone I should have thought nothing of it. He thinks he owes me a grudge for {{speaking}} to his father; and had I found him paying it by filling his pockets with fruit, I should only have told him {{that it would be better}} that he should come and take it in the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|I did {{not sleep}} under a roof that night. But I hungered and ate. I ate near midnight {{at a little}} inn over toward Birmingham, and miles away from my home. Instinctively I had avoided the crests where the bonfire crowds gathered, but here there were many people, and I had to share {{a table with a}} man who had some useless {{mortgage}} deeds to burn. I talked to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> them--but <b>my</b> soul stood at a great distance behind my lips. [...] .|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} her to the door. I asked leave to call on her father, and satisfy <b>him</b> <b>about</b> myself and <b>my</b> family connections. She only answered that her father was too ill to see visitors. I went out with her on to the landing. She turned on me sharply for the first time.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} family-tree-man, {{whose name was}} Brandish, {{in a small room}} not too clean, over a shop not far from St. Paul's Churchyard. He had another business, which related to patent poison for flies, and at first he thought I had come to see him about that, but when he found out I wanted to ask <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family tree his face brightened up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hitherto, I had {{not written}} to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> daughter's disappearance. Knowing he would, on hearing of it, at once hasten here, {{where he could}} do no good and would only add to my trouble, I thought it best to let matters go on as they were. I had been doing {{everything}} that was possible, and to have his troubles {{as well as my}} own on my hands would have driven me to distraction.|$|E
60|$|How I {{must have}} bored that sweet and gracious soul! He {{could not escape}} me. If he moved to Belmont I pursued him. If he went to Nahant or Magnolia or Kittery I spent my money like water in order to follow him up and bother <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> work, or worry him into a public {{acceptance}} of the single tax, and yet every word he spoke, every letter he wrote was a benediction and an inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, miss, I fall in {{with your}} wishes. The Yellow God that all these gentlemen worship, quite another god to that of which you desire that I should tell you. You know all <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> <b>My</b> god is of female sex." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am at Charles d'Orléans.

6000|$|... 'O no, no--not at all--it {{might have}} been a mistake of mine,' said Jones. 'I should quite have {{forgotten}} the circumstance if Mr. Neigh's words had not brought it to my mind. It was really nothing to notice, and I beg that you will not say a word to <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it on <b>my</b> account.' ...|$|R
