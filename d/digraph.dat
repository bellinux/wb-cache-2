40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} finding the largest graphs and <b>digraphs</b> of given degree and {{diameter}} {{is known as the}} ‘degree–diameter’ problem. One of the families of largest known vertex-transitive <b>digraphs</b> of given degree and diameter is the Faber–Moore–Chen <b>digraphs.</b> In our contribution we will classify those Faber–Moore–Chen <b>digraphs</b> that are Cayley <b>digraphs...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe study {{a family}} of vertex {{transitive}} <b>digraphs</b> whose vertices represent the k-permutations of n elements.

We also characterize those <b>digraphs</b> which are Cayley <b>digraphs.</b> Finally, the diameter of these <b>digraphs</b> is obtained for values of n and k which include almost all values for which they are Cayley <b>digraphs...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{introduce}} {{the concepts of}} arc ideals, unmixed <b>digraphs,</b> and Cohen-Macaulay <b>digraphs,</b> and study their algebraic and combinatorial properties by using commutative algebra and graph theory. The main results are the complete characterizations of the unmixed <b>digraphs</b> with δ > 0 and Cohen-Macaulay <b>digraphs.</b> The thesis consists of five chapters, which are organized as follows. Chapter 1 provides the algebraic backgrounds which are needed in the thesis {{with the aim of}} introducing the Cohen-Macaulay rings and Cohen-Macaulay modules. Chapter 2 presents the basic terminology and notion for graphs and <b>digraphs,</b> a short exposition of matching theory, and some relevant results on two types of digraphs: acyclic <b>digraphs</b> and transitive <b>digraphs.</b> Chapter 3 mainly includes the theory of Stanley-Reisner rings, combinatorial topological characterization of Cohen-Macaulay complexes, and the properties of the Hibi ideals. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 are dedicated to the applications of the previous chapters to the study of <b>digraphs,</b> in which unmixed <b>digraphs</b> and Cohen-Macaulay <b>digraphs</b> are characterized...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in [15] that {{vertices}} of Kautz <b>digraphs,</b> similarly to de Bruijn <b>digraphs,</b> can be partitioned into in a natural way into mutually disjoint cycles, called necklaces. There is a linear-time algorithm generating the Kautz necklaces in lexicographic order and the number of the necklaces is known. In this report, we present a necklace-based algorithm to partition the arcs of d-regular Kautz/de Bruijn <b>digraphs</b> of diameter D into d arc-disjoint 1 -factors. Using this factorization, we show how to construct Kautz partial line <b>digraphs</b> with connectivity close to the connectivity of the full Kautz <b>digraphs.</b> We describe a construction of d-regular partial line <b>digraphs</b> of d-regular Kautz <b>digraphs.</b> This result implies that the space between d-regular Kautz <b>digraphs</b> of diameter D and D + 1 is evenly populated by d Γ 2 <b>digraphs</b> with the same routing and connectivity properties. Finally, a generalization of this method enables to construct partial line <b>digraphs</b> of any size with [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} <b>digraphs</b> — called extended locally semicomplete <b>digraphs,</b> or extended LSD's, {{for short}} — {{that can be}} obtained from locally semicomplete <b>digraphs</b> by substituting independent sets for vertices. We characterize Hamiltonian extended LSD's as well as extended LSD's containing Hamiltonian paths. These results as well as some additional ones imply polynomial algorithms for finding a longest path and a longest cycle in an extended LSD. Our characterization of Hamiltonian extended LSD's provides a partial solution to a problem posed by Häggkvist (1993). Combining results from this paper with some general results derived for the so-called totally Φ 0 -decomposable <b>digraphs</b> in Bang-Jensen and Gutin (1996) we prove that the longest path problem is polynomially solvable for totally Φ 0 -decomposable <b>digraphs</b> — a fairly wide family of <b>digraphs</b> which is a common generalization of acyclic <b>digraphs,</b> semicomplete multipartite <b>digraphs,</b> extended LSD's and quasi-transitive <b>digraphs.</b> Similar results are obtained for the longest cycle problem and other problems on cycles in subfamilies of totally Φ 0 -decomposable <b>digraphs.</b> These polynomial algorithms are a natural and fairly deep generalization of algorithms obtained for quasi-transitive <b>digraphs</b> in Bang-Jensen and Gutin (1996) in order to solve a problem posed by N.

25|$|In the 15th century, the Czech {{language}} used to contain many digraphs like modern Polish does {{but most of}} them were replaced by single letters with diacritic marks by the reform of Jan Hus. Besides ch, there is only one <b>digraph</b> used in the Czech language - dž, representing voiced postalveolar affricate. However, ch is the only Czech <b>digraph</b> which is treated as a single letter while dž is used in translating a foreign word into Czech (to approximate a foreign phonetic sound that has no Czech counterpart e.g. jam in Czech is džem).|$|E
25|$|Acute accents {{may be used}} to emphasise a word in a phrase, on the vowel in the {{stressed}} syllable. If the vowel {{is written}} as a <b>digraph,</b> an acute accent is put on both parts of the <b>digraph.</b> Although that rule includes ij, the acute accent on the j is frequently omitted (resulting in íj instead of íj́), as putting an acute accent on a j is problematic in most word processing software. If the vowel is written as more than two letters, the accent is put on the first two vowel letters.|$|E
