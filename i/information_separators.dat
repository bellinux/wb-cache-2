40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is {{currently}} developing a Centrifugal Downhole Separator (CDHS) which will extend {{the application of}} remotely operated separations equipment developed for the nuclear industry to in-well recovery of oil with in-situ recycle of the produced water. These units have been successfully used for surface treatment of produced water and wastewater generated during environmental clean-up operations. Performance data has shown that centrifugal units are capable of separating stable emulsions into ``single-phase`` streams with generally less than 1 % cross-phase contamination. Initial testing will be conducted with a bench-scale separator to determine the separation efficiency of various crude oils and to provide information necessary to scale up the <b>separator.</b> <b>Information</b> from the bench-scale unit {{will be used in}} the design of a larger prototype, which will have a much larger height/diameter ratio and will incorporate some of the components necessary for down-hole operations.

The full-scale system will be fabricated, installed in the field, and operated to demonstrate the technology.

40|$|The oil {{industry}} uses gas separators in production wells as the free gas {{present in the}} suction of the pump reduces the pumping efficiency and pump lifetime. Therefore, free gas {{is one of the}} most important variables in the design of pumping systems. However, in the literature there is little <b>information</b> on these <b>separators.</b> It is the case of the inverted-shroud gravitational gas separator. It has an annular geometry due to the installation of a cylindrical container in between the well casing and pioduction pipe (tubing). The purpose of the present study is to understand the phenomenology and behavior of inverted-shroud separator. Experimental tests were performed in a 10. 5 -m-length inclinable glass tube with air and water as working fluids. The water flow rate was in the range of 8. 265 - 26. 117 l/min and the average inlet air mass flow rate was 1. 1041 kg/h, with inclination angles of 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, 80 degrees and 85 degrees. One of the findings is that the length between the inner annular level and production pipe inlet {{is one of the most}} important design parameters and based on that a new criterion for total gas separation is proposed. We also found that the phenomenology of the studied separator is not directly dependent on the gas flow rate, but on the average velocity of the free surface flow generated inside the separator. Maps of efficiency of gas separation were plotted and showed that liquid flow rate, inclination angle and pressure difference between casing and production pipe outlet are the main variables related to the gas separation phenomenon. The new data can be used for the development of design tools aiming to the optimized project of the pumping system for oil production in directional wells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
