5|$|By 31March, the Army of the Danube {{established}} {{itself in}} Neustadt, <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau,</b> Freudenstadt and Schiltach. Jourdan {{set up his}} command headquarters at Hornberg. The cavalry could not find enough forage in the mountains, and were sent to Offenburg.|$|E
5|$|Lack of bridges did not {{slow the}} Coalition pursuit. The Austrians {{repaired}} the bridges by Matterdingen, {{and moved on}} Moreau at Freiburg. On 20 October, Moreau's army of 20,000 united south of <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau</b> with Ferino's column. Ferino's force was smaller than Moreau had hoped, bringing the total of the combined French force to about 32,000. Charles' combined forces of 24,000 closely followed Moreau's rear guard from Freiburg, southwest, to a line of hills stretching between Kandern and the river.|$|E
5|$|The army {{advanced}} in four columns. First Division, the right wing, assembled at Hüningen, crossed at Basel and advanced eastward {{along the north}} shore of the Rhine toward Lake Constance. The Advanced Guard crossed at Kehl, and Vandamme led it north-east through the mountains via Freudenstadt. This column eventually became the left flank. It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, further south via the valley at <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau,</b> where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.|$|E
50|$|The Sun Ship (Das Sonnenschiff) {{is a small}} {{community}} that is run entirely by solar energy. It was built in 2004 in <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau's</b> renowned Vauban quarter. Sonnenschiff was designed by architect Rolf Disch, who also built the Heliotrope, and generates four times more energy than it uses.|$|R
5000|$|The three-part eight-axle {{articulated}} trams used on <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau's</b> tram network are the GT8s. From 1971 to 1991, {{they were}} exclusively produced for the Freiburger Verkehrs AG by the Düsseldorfer Waggonfabrik in three series, {{which is why}} they are defined as Typ Freiburg. They have been designed to be used uni-directionally.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau's</b> parks, green spaces, {{recreational}} facilities, playgrounds, roadside greeneries and the Mundenhof {{add up to}} an area of 397 ha (3.97 km2), which {{corresponds to}} 18.05 m2 of green space per Freiburg citizen. On average, major cities in Baden-Württemberg have 22.66 m2 green space/citizen. However, there {{is an area of}} 2600 ha (26 km2) of forest in the close proximity of Freiburg as well as additional recreational area like the Rieselfeld district (a former sewage farm). The majority of the green spaces came into existence from the 1960s on.|$|R
5|$|Moreau {{preferred}} to retreat through the Black Forest via the Kinzig River valley, but Nauendorf blocked that route. Instead, Saint-Cyr's column {{led the way}} over the Höllenthal, breaking through the Austrian net at Neustadt and reaching <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau</b> on 12 October. Moreau's supply trains took a route down the Wiese River to Hüningen. The French general wanted to reach Kehl farther down the Rhine, but by this time Charles barred the way with 35,000 soldiers. In order for his trains to get away, Moreau needed to hold his position for a few days. The Battle of Emmendingen was fought on 19 October, the 32,000 French losing 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,800 men and two guns captured. The Austrians sustained 1,000 casualties out of 28,000 troops engaged. Beaupuy and Wartensleben were both killed. There was some fighting on the 20th, but when Charles advanced on 21 October the French were gone.|$|E
5|$|The Reserve {{crossed the}} river at Kehl, swung south toward <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau,</b> and crossed the {{mountains}} at Neustadt, to Loffingen, Bruhlingen and Hüfingen. At the Battle of Ostrach, the Reserve remained in the northern outskirts of Pfullendorf and {{did not participate in}} the battle except in small groups. When Jourdan decided to withdraw, d'Hautpoul's cavalry moved to the west first, to secure bridges and the east-west roads. At the battle of Stockach, the Reserve was slow to support of Ferino's I. Division, which had run out of ammunition; when a cavalry charged failed to materialize, the Austrians acquired the upper hand. Jourdan later charged d'Hautpoul with dereliction. After the Stockach engagement, most of the Reserve withdrew to {{the west side of the}} Black Forest, where the horses could find forage, but by late April, the Reserve had joined with the André Masséna's Army of Helvetia outside of Zürich; d'Hautpoul joined them in July after he was cleared by a Courts-martial in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear to him that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at <b>Freiburg</b> <b>im</b> <b>Breisgau.</b>|$|E
