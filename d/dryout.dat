40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} of the post-dryout heat transfer in annulus test section has been performed in the high-pressure two-phase loop at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Nuclear Reactor Technology division. The test section has an annular geometry with 10 mm rod outer diameter and 22. 1 mm tube inner diameter. Seven spacers are located along the test section to keep the rod and the tube equidistant along the test section. Both the tube and the rod are manufactured of Inconel 600 to withstand high temperatures. The experiments indicate a very strong influence of spacers on post-dryout heat transfer. In particular, for several cases with relatively low local quality the <b>dryout</b> spot was limited to a direct proximity (upstream) of spacers.

40|$|Dispersed flow {{film boiling}} is {{characterized}} by liquid-phase droplets entrained in a continuous vapor-phase flow. In a previous work at MIT, a model of dispersed flow heat transfer was developed, called the Local Conditions Solution, which is amenable to hand calculation of wall temperatures. This solution identifies a single nonequilibrium parameter which depends solely on conditions at <b>dryout,</b> particularly a characteristic droplet diameter. Previous to the current study, no simple model including mechanisms occurring upstream of <b>dryout</b> had succeeded in predicting the droplet distribution at <b>dryout.</b> The Local Conditions Solution is rederived to identify which droplet diameter characterizes the distribution of droplets at <b>dryout</b> for purposes of dispersed flow heat transfer analysis. Based on mechanisms of droplet entrainment and deposition, the <b>dryout</b> droplet distribution is derived. This distribution is integrated to obtain the characteristic droplet diameter. A simple method of calculating the characteristic droplet diameter is presented. With the droplet distribution model, the Local Conditions Solution is compared with three correlations and seven data sets. In general, the Local Conditions Solution predicts wall temperature data to within about 5 % better than the three correlations.

40|$|In {{evaporation}} of {{a liquid}} flowing in a tube or nuclear fuel element, {{there exists a}} transition (known as "dryout", "burnout", "boiling crisis" or "critical heat flux", CHF) from a high heat transfer coefficient regime to one of greatly reduced heat transfer coefficient. The conditions leading to <b>dryout</b> or CHF and the behaviour of wall temperatures in the ("post <b>dryout</b> or post CHF") region beyond it are of immense importance in nuclear reactor safety. In a nuclear reactor, the clad temperature excursion in the post-dryout region may be unacceptably high and the prediction of the location of <b>dryout</b> and {{the magnitude of the}} temperature excursion into the post-dryout region is of great importance. Moreover, the <b>dryout</b> transition and its effects are important not only in nuclear plant but also in many other types of heat transfer equipment. The main focus of work described in this thesis was the improvement and validation of phenomenological models for the prediction of CHF and of heat transfer beyond CHF ("post CHF" or "post dryout" heat transfer). The main focus has been on the process of annular film <b>dryout.</b> In phenomenological modelling of this process the <b>dryout</b> location prediction is sensitive to the boundary value of entrained fraction at churn annular transition, especially at high flow rates. The model was extended to churn flow so that integration of entrainment, deposition and evaporation processes could be started from onset of churn flow. A new correlation for the prediction of entrainment rate in churn flow was presented. The application of the new methodology to experimental data leads to improved predictions of CHF. Another long-standing problem, i. e. effect of heat flux on droplet entrainment, is addressed by analysing the contradictory results of previous experiments by using the annular film <b>dryout</b> model. The capability of phenomenological models to cover the whole range of CHF scenarios, i. e. from subcooled or very low quality to very high quality CHF, was demonstrated by using a possible transition criterion from bubble crowding model (an improved version of the Weisman Pie model) to annular film <b>dryout</b> model. These improved phenomenological models captured trends of CHF data very well (including the Look Up Table data of Groeneveld et al. 2007) and produced improved results over a wide range of system parameters such as pressure, mass flux and critical quality. The implementation of the phenomenological models was pursued by modifying and developing an Imperial College computer code GRAMP. In addition to its application in modelling CHF, the GRAMP code was extended to the post <b>dryout</b> region and predictions for this region compared to a range of data and the results were found to be satisfactory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on the <b>dryout</b> during flow boiling of R 245 fa, R 134 a and R 32 inside a 0. 96 mm diameter single circular microchannel. In the present tests, the channel is not electrically heated; instead, the flow boiling {{is achieved by}} means of a secondary fluid (water) resulting in a non-uniform distribution of the heat flux along the channel. Since the wall temperature is limited by the temperature of the secondary fluid, the onset of <b>dryout</b> is detected by means of the standard deviation of the temperature readings in the wall. The wall temperature in fact displays larger fluctuations in the zone where <b>dryout</b> occurs, which are related to the presence of the liquid film drying up at the wall with an oscillating process. These temperature fluctuations are detected by means of the standard deviation of the wall temperature. These fluctuations never appear during flow boiling at low vapor qualities; they also disappear in the post-dryout zone. Experimental values of <b>dryout</b> quality measured with the above method are reported in this paper for mass velocity ranging between 100 and 900 kg m- 2 s - 1, during annular flow.
