5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E

25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|Ælfric {{was asked}} by Æthelweard to {{translate}} the book of Genesis up {{to the story of}} Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that is, into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of what the Bible said was the most important thing to be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's first {{choices for}} the boat's crew were Worsley and Tom Crean—the latter, he said, [...] "begged to go". Crean was a shipmate from the Discovery Expedition, 1901–04, and had also been with Scott's Terra Nova Expedition in 1910–13, where he had {{distinguished}} himself on the fatal polar march. Shackleton was confident that Crean would persevere to the bitter end, and had great faith in Worsley's skills as a navigator, especially his ability to work out positions in difficult circumstances. Worsley later wrote: [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the hardest thing we had ever undertaken, for the Antarctic winter had set in, and {{we were about to}} cross one of the worst seas in the world".|$|E

500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you {{and it makes you}} feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the end".|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting to act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E

500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|Producers Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz co-wrote [...] "Jacksonville", one {{of their}} {{frequent}} collaborations. Filmmaker Charles Beeson served as the episode's director. Prior to the initial broadcast of [...] "Jacksonville", co-creator J.J. Abrams and showrunners/executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman released a joint statement about its plot, [...] "Along with the usual mystery, suspense, science and general wackiness, the episode contains one big answer, the consequences of which will affect our team {{for the remainder of}} the season and beyond." [...] Stentz later explained in the DVD audio commentary that in [...] "Jacksonville by and large, the fringe event is Olivia. Olivia realizing that even in chasing all of these fringe events, she is the biggest fringe event of them all." [...] Also in the commentary, Pinkner added that for the episode's final scene, [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in the back third of the season that we would really acknowledge for Olivia that Peter came from the Other Side. The worst circumstance that could happen in is at a moment when they are getting as close together as possible".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a huge hit." [...] The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.|$|E

500|$|Referring to [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic", Skaff {{said that}} the song's title—a {{reference}} to Tails and Sonic from the video game series—had [...] "really came out of nowhere." [...] McKinnon said the song is a [...] "more personal song [...] It discusses how the choices I've made to put my best foot forward in my career, in a sense, have really done damage to my personal life." [...] Both [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] and [...] "Out of Time" [...] talk about [...] "how I feel like I'm doing what I want with my life, but I think, [...] "Wow, I just did something that really affected me."" [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person." [...] On being asked whether he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the final song on the album, McKinnon said [...] "It just felt right [...] seemed like a good ending".|$|E
500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else {{at the time that}} was out ... When I made the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E
500|$|In July 1941, deHavilland was {{reunited with}} Flynn for their eighth movie together, Raoul Walsh's epic They Died with Their Boots On. The film is {{loosely based on}} the {{courtship}} and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth [...] "Libbie" [...] Bacon. Flynn and deHavilland had a falling out the previous yearmainly over the roles she was being givenand she {{did not intend to}} work with him again. Even Flynn acknowledged, [...] "She was sick to death of playing 'the girl' and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress." [...] After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film, deHavilland accepted. Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes, and improve the overall dialogue. The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together. Their last appearance on screen is Custer's farewell to his wife. [...] "Errol was quite sensitive," [...] deHavilland would later remember, [...] "I think he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the last time we worked together." [...] Flynn's final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her: [...] "Walking through life with you, ma'am, has been a very gracious thing." [...] They Died with Their Boots On was released on November 21, 1941, and while some reviewers criticized the film's historical inaccuracies, most applauded the action sequences, cinematography, and acting. Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times found deHavilland [...] "altogether captivating". The film went on to earn $2,550,000 (...) , Warner Bros' second-biggest money-maker of that year.|$|E
