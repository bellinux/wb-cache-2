40|$|Experiments and {{supporting}} 3 -D numerical computations {{have been performed}} for water and FC- 77 to investigate mixed convection heat transfer from a four-row, in-line array of twelve, square heat sources which are flush mounted to the lower wall of a horizontal, rectangular channel. The experimental data encompass heat transfer regimes characterized by natural convection, mixed convection, laminar forced convection, and the initiation of transition to turbulence. The variation of the row-average Nusselt number with Reynolds number exhibits a minimum, suggesting that, due to buoyancy-induced flow, heat transfer may be enhanced and pumping power requirements may be reduced by reducing the flow rate. ^ Experiments {{and supporting}} 3 -D numerical computations have also been performed for FC- 77 and a heat source array whose surface area is augmented {{by the use of}} longitudinal fins. The experimental data indicate that the first heater row is forced convection dominated, while data for rows 2 - 4 encompass heat transfer regimes characterized by natural convection (row 4 only), mixed convection, and transition to turbulence. Although the variation of the row-average Nusselt number with Reynolds number for the flush mounted results exhibits a minimum, the row-average Nusselt number for the finned results decreases monotonically with decreasing Reynolds number <b>for</b> <b>rows</b> <b>1</b> - 3, and becomes nearly independent of Reynolds number for row 4. ^ Increasing the Rayleigh number, for the unfinned and finned arrays, enhances heat transfer and increases the Reynolds number range for which enhancement occurs. Appropriate scaling parameters are introduced for both geometric configurations to characterize mixed convection heat transfer from an array of discrete sources. ...|$|E

40|$|Box-lifting {{ability is}} an {{important}} characteristic of military personnel. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to determine the usefulness of the upright row free weight exercise, and simple anthropometric tests, to predict maximal box-lifting performance that simulates the loading of military supply vehicles. Two groups of adults performed maximal box lifts to 1. 4 m (study one) and 1. 7 m (study two) respectively. All subjects were also tested <b>for</b> upright <b>row</b> <b>1</b> -repetition maximum (1 RM) strength, body mass, height and body composition. In study one, a remarkably good prediction of maximal box-lift performance to 1. 4 m (42 ? 12 kg) was obtained from a regression equation including the variables body mass, body composition and upright <b>row</b> <b>1</b> RM. Approximately 95 % of the variation in 1. 4 m box-lifting performance could be accounted for. In contrast, in study two, only 80 % of the variation in 1. 7 m box-lifting performance (51 ? 15 kg) could be accounted for by the best predictor equation. Upright <b>row</b> <b>1</b> RM strength appears to be a useful tool in the prediction of box-lifting ability to approximately chest height for most adults, probably due to a close match between the muscle groups and contraction modes required during both tasks. Military or other organizations could use the data reported here to substitute simple anthropometry and a 1 RM test of strength and for the direct assessment of 1. 4 m box-lifting performance...|$|R

40|$|A binary matrix has the {{consecutive}} ones property ($C <b>1</b> P$) <b>for</b> <b>rows</b> (columns) {{if there}} is a permutation of its columns (rows) that arranges the ones consecutively in all the rows (columns). A binary matrix has the simultaneous consecutive ones property ($SC 1 P$) if it has both the $C <b>1</b> P$ <b>for</b> <b>rows</b> and columns. We consider the following two categories of problems: Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Submatrix ($SC 1 S$) and Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Editing ($SC 1 E$) in a similar spirit as that of Consecutive Ones Submatrix and Consecutive Ones Editing problems. For a given binary matrix $M$, Consecutive Ones Submatrix problem decides {{if there is}} a submatrix of $M$ that satisfies the $C <b>1</b> P$ <b>for</b> <b>rows</b> and Consecutive Ones Editing problem decides {{if there is a}} set of $ 1 $-entries of size at most $k$ in $M$ whose flipping results in a matrix with the $C <b>1</b> P$ <b>for</b> <b>rows.</b> $SC <b>1</b> S$ problems focus on deleting a minimum number of rows (columns) to establish the $SC 1 P$ whereas $SC 1 E$ problem deals with flipping a minimum number of $ 1 $s to obtain the $SC 1 P$. We consider the parameterized versions of $SC 1 S$ and $SC 1 E$ problems with $k$ as the parameter and are defined as follows. Given a binary matrix $M$ and a positive integer $k$, $k$-$SC 1 S$-$R$ ($k$-$SC 1 S$-$C$) problem decides whether there exists a set of rows (columns) of size at most $k$ whose deletion results in a matrix with the $SC 1 P$. The $k$-$SC 1 P$-$ 1 E$ problem decides whether there exists a set of $ 1 $-entries of size at most $k$ whose flipping results in a matrix with the $SC 1 P$. We show that $k$-$SC 1 S$-$R$, $k$-$SC 1 S$-$C$ and $k$-$SC 1 P$-$ 1 E$ are fixed-parameter tractable on $(2,*) $-matrices and $(*, 2) $-matrices. We observe that using our algorithm, $k$-$SC 1 S$-$R$, $k$-$SC 1 S$-$C$ and $k$-$SC 1 P$-$ 1 E$ can be approximated in polynomial-time on $(2,*) $-matrices and $(*, 2) $-matrices.
