5|$|When Congress {{created the}} Michigan Territory in 1805, it used the Northwest Ordinance's {{language}} {{to define the}} territory's southern boundary, which therefore differed from that in Ohio's state constitution.

5|$|Dungeons & Dragons was {{the first}} modern {{role-playing}} game and <b>it</b> <b>established</b> many of the conventions that have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a game mechanic, character record sheets, use of numerical attributes and gamemaster-centered group dynamics. Within months of Dungeons & Dragonss release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by D include Tunnels & Trolls (1975), Empire of the Petal Throne (1975), and Chivalry & Sorcery (1976).|$|E
