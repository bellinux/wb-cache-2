40|$|The {{development}} of the concepts of linear and nonlinear optimization models presumes {{that all of the}} data for the optimization model are known with certainty. However, uncertainty and inexactness of data and outcomes pervade many aspects of most optimization problems. As it turns out, when the uncertainty in the problem is of a particular (and fairly general) form, it is relatively easy to incorporate the uncertainty into the optimization model. 2 Brief History of Optimization under Uncertainty • 1950 s, Dantzig and Beale started to work on linear optimization under uncertainty • 1962, solution method developed by Benders • Many and varied applications in the linear, nonlinear, and discrete form – <b>Electric</b> <b>utility</b> <b>capacity</b> planning...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> <b>capacity</b> {{expansion and}} energy production models developed for energy policy analysis. The models {{use the same}} principles (life cycle cost minimization, least operating cost dispatching, and incorporation of outages and reserve margin) as comprehensive utility capacity planning tools, but are faster and simpler. The models were not designed for detailed utility capacity planning, {{but they can be}} used to accurately project trends on a regional level. Because they use the same principles as comprehensive utility capacity expansion planning tools, the models are more realistic than utility modules used in present policy analysis tools. They can be used to help forecast the effects energy policy options will have on future utility power generation capacity expansion trends and to help formulate a sound national energy strategy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integer programming model and algorithm for an <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> <b>capacity</b> expansion problem which considers {{the option of}} investing in nondispatchable or renewable energy sources. A branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed for this problem in which the continuous relaxation of the subproblem associated with each node in the enumeration tree is solved via an efficient two-phase procedure. This procedure solves a deterministic approximation {{of the problem in}} the first phase in order to determine a quick near-optimal solution. The resulting solution is subsequently refined in a second phase using more accurate techniques to represent the negative load due to the renewable sources, and to perform the probabilistic production costing. This technique conserves about 80 % of the effort which would be required without the deterministic phase. An implementation of this approach is described for the Tijuana-Mexicali subsystem of the Mexican utility, which is not connected {{to the rest of the}} Mexican electric system, and which faces a very high summer peak load and a comparatively low winter load. The results suggest that along with a prescribed capacity expansion of conventional equipments, the utility should invest in some solar cooling systems, and, more pertinently, should involve itself intensely in conservation measures in homes of individual customers. integer programming, branch and bound, capacity expansion...|$|E

40|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> <b>capacity</b> {{expansion}} {{problem is}} a problem of choosing the type, size and timing of capacity additions to meet a projected demand in the specified planning horizon. Traditionally the problem has been separated into a generator and a separate transmission capacity-expansion problem. A least cost generator only capacity expansion plan would be found and then a transmission line expansion plan to match. This planning paradigm sufficed in the regulated monopoly environment where transmission lines were built mainly for system reliability. In the emerging unregulated environment, transmission lines, in addition to enhancing system reliability are recognized as a significant economic resource, a resource whose economic planning is vital in maintaining a utility 2 ̆ 7 s competitive advantage. This has brought about the need for planning models that take into account the location in space of generators and demands and the cost associated with transmitting power among these spatially separated elements. Such models that have recently emerged have relied on the transshipment constraints to capture this flow of power. ^ The model presented in this dissertation improves on this by adding DC power flow equations onto the transshipment formulation. The DC power flow equations provide approximate but linear relationships between the generation and demand levels at nodes and the real power flow through the lines. In addition, the model provides for transmission capacity additions. This is done by grouping the transmission lines into a limited set of alternatives whose network characteristics can be constructed prior to starting the solution search process. The model then chooses the least cost alternative by adding the cost of each alternative to the cost of the least cost generation plan associated with that transmission alternative. ^ Data from the country of Kenya is used to compare the expansion plan from the model with power flow equations with that from the transshipment only model. Five different transmission expansion alternatives are considered. The transmission capacity expansion plans recommended by the two models differ significantly. The total cost of the model with power flow constraints is 19...|$|E
