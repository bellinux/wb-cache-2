500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> good I was on my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E

5000|$|Larry Murphy {{was convicted}} of first degree murder and is serving a life term in Folsom Prison for {{shooting}} his father, which he feels was justified because his father was raping his stepsister. In prison he is nicknamed [...] "Lickety Split" [...] by the other inmates, but remains a loner who has only one person he calls a friend: a black inmate named Stiles. The film centers around his obsession for running around the prison yard. Larry {{has no idea how}} fast he is actually running until the prison psychologist (Geoffrey Lewis) has the prison sports writer time him. Once the warden (Billy Green Bush) <b>finds</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> fast Murphy is, he has the state track and field coach (Ed Lauter) bring up a couple of his distance runners to run against Murphy. Murphy beats them and ultimately allows the track coach to train him in anticipation of the upcoming olympic trials. Before that can happen however, a new track has to be built to proper specs in the yard for Murphy to run on so he can register an official time to be eligible to compete at the olympic trials. The Warden asks the inmates to volunteer to build the new track.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing. I {{refuse to}} live on her charity, that's all, and I want you to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much I owe her--how much you owe her--for I intend to pay her back every dollar with interest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come back?" [...] said Hilary, whose civic {{morality}} flew {{much lower}} than this. [...] "Nonsense! And stir the whole filthy mess up in the courts? I mean, make use of this fellow to find him, and enable us to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much money he has left, and how much {{we have got to}} supply, in order to make up his shortage." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are so prompt," [...] said she. [...] "Promptness {{is one of the}} most {{important}} things in life.

I've no doubt but if we could have him among us again, in the attractive garb of the State's-prison inmates, I should be hand and glove with brother Northwick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we can't use her {{any more}} to-day," [...] said Dick. [...] "Let us cover {{the engine and}} walk to that cottage and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> where we are, {{and how we can}} get to Brill." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Toby {{that no other}} monkey could {{possibly}} behave half so badly as did Mr. Stubbs's brother on that occasion. He danced {{back and forth from}} one end of the tent to the other, as if he had been a tight-rope performer giving a free exhibition; then he would sit down and try to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> large a hole he could tear in the tender canvas, until it seemed as if the tent would certainly be a wreck before they could get him down.|$|E
6000|$|When at last {{all were}} crowded about her {{as closely as}} they could get, Old Mother Nature spoke and this time her voice was soft. [...] "I am ashamed of you," [...] said she. [...] "Truly I am ashamed of you. How could you think that I would allow any harm to come to you? Reddy Fox is here because I sent for him, but {{he is going to}} sit right where he is until I tell him he can go, and not one of you will be harmed by him.

60|$|He made it no less {{his duty}} to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much {{hardship}} it would work Northwick's daughters, {{and he tried to}} lend them money. But Suzette answered for both that her father had left them some money when he went away; and Hilary could only send Louise to explain how he must formally appear in the legal proceedings; he allowed Louise to put whatever warmth of color she wished into his regrets and into his advice that they should consult a lawyer. It was not business-like; if it were generally known it might be criticised; but in the last resort, with a thing like that, Hilary felt that he could always tell his critics to go to the deuce, and fall back upon a good conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beatrice is made {{of silent}} stuff," [...] she declared. [...] "I should never be afraid of her. All the same, I wish I could <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> where she is. It would look better if we were living together." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Tut, tut, tut!" [...] chided Old Mother Nature. [...] "Tut, tut, tut, Jimmy Skunk! It is {{high time}} {{you came to}} school. Digger the Badger is just as much a cousin of yours as is Shadow the Weasel. You {{are members of the}} same order and it is a rather large order. It is called the Car-niv-o-ra, which means 'flesh-eating.' You are a member of the Marten or Weasel family, and that family is called the 'Mus-tel-i-dae.' Digger the Badger {{is also a member of}} that family. That means that you two are cousins. You and Digger and Glutton the Wolverine belong to the stout-bodied branch of the family. Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Shadow the Weasel, Pekan the Fisher and Spite the Marten belong to its slim-bodied branch. But all are members of the same family despite the {{difference}} in looks, and thus, of course, are cousins. Seeing that you are here, Jimmy, I think we will <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much these little folks know about you.|$|E
60|$|For {{three days}} Mr. Brumley was so {{staggered}} by {{these things that}} it did not occur to him that it was quite possible for him to see Lady Harman for himself and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> things stood. He remained in London with an imagination dazed. And as it was the Christmas season and as George Edmund in a rather expectant holiday state had now come up from Margate, Mr. Brumley went in succession to the Hippodrome, to Peter Pan and to an exhibition at Olympia, assisted at an afternoon display of the kinemacolor at La Scala Theatre, visited Hamley's and lunched George Edmund once at the Criterion and twice at the Climax Club, while thinking of nothing in all the world but the incalculable strangeness of women. George Edmund thought him a very passive leadable parent indeed, less querulous about money matters and altogether much improved. The glitter and colour of these various entertainments reflected themselves upon the surface of that deep flood of meditation, hook-armed wooden-legged pirates, intelligent elephants, ingenious but extremely expensive toys, flickering processions, comic turns, snatches of popular music and George Edmund's way of eating an orange, pictured themselves on his mind confusedly without in any way deflecting its course. Then on the fourth day he roused himself, gave George Edmund ten shillings to get himself a cutlet at the CafÃ© Royal and do the cinematographs round and about the West End, and so released reached Aleham in time for a temperate lunch. He chartered the Aleham car to take him to Black Strand and arrived there about a quarter past three, in a great effort to feel himself a matter-of-course visitor.|$|E

5000|$|It's a strip I've enjoyed doing, but on {{the other}} hand, it has been, oh, a chore. The sheer {{mechanics}} of producing that much work week in and week out ties you down... Taste in strips seems to be changing. People just don't seem to follow continuity strips any more the way they used to. They get an average of three to four complete stories a night off the boob tube.
