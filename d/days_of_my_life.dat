With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{element of}} the album was most obvious in the hymn-like [...] "Word on a Wing", though for some {{commentators}} religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to [...] "test his numbness". Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, [...] "the passion is genuine". When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from [...] "the darkest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life...</b> I'm {{sure that it was}} a call for help". The closing ballad, [...] "Wild Is the Wind", was the album's sole cover, and has been praised as one of the finest vocal performances of Bowie's career. Bowie was inspired to record it after he met singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone (whose version is on the eponymous 1966 album).|$|E
500|$|On November 20, Gaga went on [...] and {{explained}} the meaning behind the [...] "Marry the Night" [...] music video. [...] "I know how rejection feels in the business. I got signed, I got dropped, I got signed again. That's actually what the 'Marry the Night' video is about. It's {{about one of}} the most horrible <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> when I got dropped from my first record label and it's the story of what happened that day." [...] A second preview of the music video, shot in a dance studio, premiered on November 25, 2011. Gaga told Vanity Fair magazine that the video is [...] "autobiographical" [...] and illustrates [...] "the worst day of my life." [...] The entire video premiered on December 1, 2011 on E! Online at 8.00 pm EST. However, the video appeared online several hours before its official release. Gaga took her Twitter to express dissatisfaction with the leak of the video, saying that it was [...] "like an old tampon." [...] The video for the song is 13minutes long.|$|E

Macauley later said, [...] "I entered some concentration camps the day we liberated them-- the most horrifying <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> My job was to interview survivors.

2500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and {{felt that they had}} been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ wrote that Taylor was [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said that [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] Thi was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of the}} happiest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> ...

2500|$|The couple {{continued}} to live separately after the civil marriage. In October 1956, Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire {{and fell to the}} floor, thereby breaking her left upper leg. At the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, she was diagnosed with incurable cancer, with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he {{had fallen in love with}} her, realizing how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: [...] "new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or perhaps you would not?) to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us." [...] Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: [...] "One of the most painful <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Sentence of death has been passed on Joy, and the end is only a matter of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perri {{recorded}} the album in 33 days in two studios {{located on the}} same property, both running at the same time. She described the process as [...] "the best 33 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> {{and it was the}} worst 33 days of my life." [...] Describing the hectic conditions she was under while recording, she stated, [...] "I was running from studio one to studio three and I was running back and forth doing the vocals, the piano, the guitar, the harmonies, and the doubles.” Perri stated that sometimes they would record two songs in one day, forcing Perri to mentally prepare to sing about one relationship in 2007, then sing another other song with different emotions about a relationship in 2008. Perri stated that she was [...] "ripping [...] stitches" [...] to ensure that a certain song was sung with the right emotions, later adding that it took such an emotional toll on her that she would be driving home later that night crying at two in the morning, forcing herself to pull over and drink a milkshake.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, Fry {{joined the}} board of {{directors}} at Norwich City Football Club.

[...] Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as [...] "Norwich City Ambassador". Fry said, [...] "My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost anything I can remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I’m going to. It was all me. It can’t have been a coincidence ... But now I’m so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City. We have so much to be proud of, both on and off the pitch, and I hope to welcome many new fans to the greatest club of all. On the Ball, City!" [...] In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president of Proud Canaries, a new club for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.|$|E
