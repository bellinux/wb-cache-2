5|$|Following {{the path}} of his {{grandfather}} Vic Richardson, who was a radio commentator for many years, Chappell entered the media in 1973 by writing <b>ghosted</b> magazine articles and a column for The Age. He did television commentary for the 0–10 Network and the BBC before playing WSC. During the 1980s, Chappell spent eight years co-hosting with Mike Gibson, Wide World of Sports, an innovative magazine-style program broadcast by Channel Nine on Saturday afternoons and co-hosted a sister show, Sports Sunday, for five years. Early in his stint on the former program, he swore without realising that he was live to air. A similar incident occurred during a live telecast of the 1993 Ashes series. Channel Nine suspended him on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a {{professional}} footballer and for years afterwards, Ramsey claimed to be two years younger than he really was — including in his <b>ghosted</b> autobiography, Talking Football, published in 1952. This began when Ramsey first turned professional with Southampton during the Second World War. He told Southampton he was born in 1922 rather than 1920, reasoning that this might improve his career prospects and compensate for the years he had lost to the hostilities. He propagated this false age for over two decades, in press articles, his autobiography and Who's Who — but not on official documents such as his marriage papers, in which he listed his true date of birth. Only after his knighthood in 1967 did Ramsey reveal his true age, deciding that he could not lie to Debrett's, publisher of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage.|$|E

25|$|Schapiro was bridge {{correspondent}} of The Sunday Times from 1968 {{until his}} death in 2002.

25|$|William Thomas Overgard {{was born}} on April 30, 1926 in Santa Monica, California, son of silent-movie actor William A. Overgard, and grew up there. Inspired as a boy by Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates, at age twelve he sent him a fan letter and samples of his own art, and {{received}} encouragement. They continued corresponding during Overgard's high school years and {{two years in the}} Navy during World War II. Afterwards, he headed for New York and worked with Caniff, assisting him on his new strip Steve Canyon. (He later regarded this apprenticeship as his only true training for cartooning.) Then, on Caniff's advice, he launched his own cartooning career in the 1950s with comic books such as Jungle Jim, Ben Bowie, Daredevil, and the western Black Diamond. He also freelanced in <b>ghosted</b> strips and animation, continuing to refine his artwork, and contributed to Boy Magazine and the satirical Whack.|$|E
500|$|Morrell's second {{projected}} {{source of}} funds was his account of his voyages, which the firm of J. and J. Harper were willing to publish. They engaged an experienced writer and dramatist, Samuel Woodworth, {{to make sense of}} Morrell's notes and sea journals, although Woodworth's role as ghost writer was not made public. Abby Morrell's journals received similar treatment from another established author, Samuel Knapp. His book was published in December 1832, hers early in 1833. Morrell's was very successful and sold well; the New York Mirror found it [...] "a highly interesting and instructive work", with [...] "stirring adventures and much geographical and nautical information". [...] France's leading explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville was complimentary, acknowledging Morrell as [...] "courageous, skilled and dedicated"; the explorer and journalist Jeremiah Reynolds, on the other hand, observed that the account contained more poetry than truth. Abby's book attracted less attention. It purported to be written to promote [...] "the amelioration of the condition of the American seaman", [...] a subject in which she had not otherwise evinced interest. Woodworth exploited the public's curiosity by preparing a stage play, The Cannibals, which opened at the Bowery Theatre, New York, in March 1833 and had a lengthy and successful run. Morrell's <b>ghosted</b> account was one of the sources used by Edgar Allan Poe in his novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.|$|E

500|$|For {{guitar and}} bass players, {{the players are}} given the {{opportunity}} to play single notes or chords, both as single notes or sustained, during which the players must continue to hold down the fret button(s) for the extent of the sustain. Some charts provide the ability to hold down one sustained note via its fret button while strumming additional notes. Warriors of Rock also provides simulated hammer-ons and pull-offs, where, after striking one note, specifically marked notes can be played by fingering the correct buttons but without strumming. There are also note portions of some songs where notes appear semi-transparent relative to normal notes; these notes, introduced in Guitar Hero World Tour, can be played simply by tapping the correct buttons on the controller without strumming or using a touch-sensitive [...] "slider bar" [...] below the fret buttons, if the player is using a World Tour controller. [...] Bass players can play open chords by strumming without holding any fret buttons. Warriors of Rock introduces sustained open chords for bass players, although unlike other sustainable notes, does not require you to hold down the button required to execute the note initially. Drum players, when using velocity-sensitive drum kits, may be presented with both <b>ghosted</b> notes or notes with a shield icon over them; these represents drum notes that should be struck softer or harder than normal, respectively, to score more points. Drum players can also attach a second bass drum pedal, necessary for certain songs in the [...] "Expert+" [...] difficulty.|$|E

2500|$|Direct free-kicks are a {{key part}} of attacking in football, and can lead to many goals. Numerous feints and ruses are tried to fool the opposition, {{including}} having attackers join the [...] "wall." [...] A successful free kick from the 1970 World Cup- Brazil vs Czechoslovakia, illustrates how the technique works. Brazilian forwards Jairzinho and Tostao cunningly joined the end of the defensive wall as the Czechs set it up. As Pele backed off and feinted as if to take the kick, both Jair and Tostão began to move off, creating space.

2500|$|Waugh {{held that}} while the dangers of smoking (especially passive smoking) and {{drinking}} were exaggerated, the dangers of hamburger eating were seriously under-reported; he frequently referred to [...] "hamburger gases" [...] as a serious form of atmospheric pollution and even made references {{to the dangers of}} [...] "passive hamburger eating". He also advised that computer games [...] "produce all the symptoms and most known causes of cancer". The Tobacco Advisory Council of the UK organised for a pro-smoking book to be <b>ghosted</b> for either Bernard Levin or Auberon Waugh. Neither columnist agreed to put their name to it, but Waugh wrote a foreword endorsing the book and hitting out at the anti-smoking lobby: [...] "Let us hope this book strikes a blow against the new control terrorists," [...] he said. He also posed for photos, with a cigarette in his hand.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Hart {{attracted}} major {{attention with}} the publication of The Royce Hart Story, a <b>ghosted</b> autobiography. Very few biographies of Australian football players had been released thus far, and never one by a current player, especially not one by somebody 22 years of age. Hart received universal criticism for naming a team of best players where he was placed at centre half forward. But the team was not a [...] "greatest team ever", rather a team of the best contemporary players that Hart would like to play with. The book contains some perceptive opinion about the future of Australian football. Hart's ideas on full-time professionalism were well ahead of the time. He wrote about his dedication to making the most of his talents and what it takes to succeed. At times, Hart also reveals the somewhat uncompromising attitude that could often get him offside with people. Notably, he had a number of disagreements with teammate, Kevin Sheedy.|$|E

The unauthorised publication of the book technically laid him open to prosecution as he was holding office as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time. The King was angered, and Bonar Law warned French that the government could not defend him if the House of Commons demanded his resignation as Irish Viceroy. Smith-Dorrien as a serving officer was not permitted to reply.

60|$|Gradually, {{however, the}} quiet night {{received}} me into its peace (just as, poor soul, did the Moor Desdemona), {{and its influence}} stole into my darkened mind. The smooth, columnar boughs of the beeches lifted themselves archingly into the sky. Soon I was climbing over the moss-bound roots of my customary observatory. But this night the stars were left for a while unsignalled and unadmired. The crisped, frost-lined leaves scattered between the snake-like roots sparkled faintly. Years seemed to have passed away, dwindled in Time's hour-glass, since my previous visit. That Miss M. had <b>ghosted</b> herself away for ever. In my reverie the vision of Fanny re-arose into my imagination--that secret still fountain--of herself. Asleep now....

60|$|INFERIAE, n. [Latin] Among the Greeks and Romans, sacrifices for {{propitiation}} of the Dii Manes, or {{souls of}} the dead heroes; for the pious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual needs, and {{had to have a}} number of makeshift deities, or, as a sailor might say, jury-gods, which they made out of the most unpromising materials. It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of Agamemnon that Laiaides, a priest of Aulis, was favored with an audience of that illustrious warrior's shade, who prophetically recounted to him the birth of Christ and the triumph of Christianity, giving him also a rapid but tolerably complete review of events down to the reign of Saint Louis. The narrative ended abruptly at the point, owing to the inconsiderate crowing of a cock, which compelled the <b>ghosted</b> King of Men to scamper back to Hades. There is a fine mediaeval flavor to this story, and as it has not been traced back further than Pere Brateille, a pious but obscure writer at the court of Saint Louis, we shall probably not {{err on the side of}} presumption in considering it apocryphal, though Monsignor Capel's judgment of the matter might be different; and to that I bow--wow.|$|E
