25|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs {{have yet to be}} demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a <b>floating</b> <b>structure</b> will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The <b>floating</b> <b>structure</b> must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the <b>floating</b> <b>structure</b> and power distribution system, which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large load centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs).|$|E

60|$|Such {{a bridge}} as this answers {{a very good}} {{temporary}} purpose, and in still water, as, for example, over narrow lakes or very sluggish streams, where {{there is very little}} current, a <b>floating</b> <b>structure</b> of this kind is sometimes built for permanent service. Such bridges will not, however, stand on broad and rapid rivers liable to floods. The pressure of the water alone, in such cases, would very much endanger all the fastenings; and in cases where drift wood or ice is brought down by the stream, the floating masses, not being able to pass under the bridge, would accumulate above it, and would soon bear upon it with so enormous a pressure that nothing could withstand its force. The bridge would be broken away, and the whole accumulation--bridge, drift-wood, and ice--would be borne irresistibly down the stream together.|$|E
