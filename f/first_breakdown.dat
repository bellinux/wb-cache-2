2500|$|Yates claimed that, {{despite his}} urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed {{had refused to}} {{continue}} her regimen of the antipsychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> in 1999."The real question to me is: How could she have been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her...Rusty testified that he never {{knew that she had}} visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could have been found in medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital" [...] He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.|$|E
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{breakdown}} is relevant for our present discussion for two reasons. <b>First,</b> <b>breakdowns</b> may {{happen in the}} normal functioning of a city and increase the visibility of city layers and users, similarly to what proposed by Winograd and Flores. Second, the notion of breakdown as “interruptions of the action flow” may be extended in a city to include {{out of the ordinary}} events, like fairs, social events, strikes, and so on, and not only actual breakdowns.|$|R

50|$|It must be {{emphasised}} {{that this}} {{is by no means}} an exhaustive list of stressful life events, because the events which trigger brief reactive psychosis tend, due to the individualistic nature of human psychology, to be extremely personalized.

50|$|Bragg has {{publicly}} discussed two nervous breakdowns {{that he has}} suffered, one in his teens and another in his 30s. His <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> began at age 13; inspired by a passage in Wordsworth's The Prelude, in the following years he found ways to cope, including exploring the outdoors and {{the adoption of a}} strong work ethic, as well as meeting his first girlfriend. The second followed his wife's suicide. He traces the origin of a lifelong nervousness of public speaking to the experience of giving a reading from the lectern as a choirboy at age 6.|$|E

Farley tries to escape and in the ensuing fight, a bag of sulfur-based fertilizer falls into the nearby pool. The pool turns to acid and Farley falls in, horribly burning him. Pulling {{him out of the}} pool, Farley is arrested and Alan manages to get away with his crimes.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of Hunt's birth, his family lived in the small, coastal town of Greystones in Wicklow, Ireland. His father was a violent {{alcoholic}} {{and his mother had}} few supports in raising her children. His four-year-old brother drowned when he was eleven years old. Thereafter, Hunt began getting into fights and taking drugs. Humphrys attributes these behaviours to his history of trauma and low self-esteem. His <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> occurred shortly after the end of his relationship with his first long-term girlfriend. Humphrys has expressed the view in relation to Hunt's history that, 'trauma and loss, amongst other factors, form the bedrock of John’s problems — his so-called attachment disorder and paranoid schizophrenia.' ...|$|E

50|$|Her poems {{were first}} {{published}} in The Dublin Magazine of 1937. Although initially supportive her husband later requested her not {{to be involved in}} the literary circle in Ireland. During her life she produced eight collections of verse and three memoirs of Irish life, although she is not well known in Ireland. This is despite the admiration of Elizabeth Bowen, W. B. Yeats, John Betjeman, T. S. Eliot and James Stephens. However, she and Yeats had a falling out when she used his praise from a private letter on the cover of her first publication. She suffered her <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> during the production of that publication. Lady Powerscourt wanted to be a respected poet. She suffered from addictions to alcohol, morphine and cocaine. Her drug use had started during her seasons in London.|$|E
50|$|Rutsweiler am Glan {{has never}} had its own church. The villagers were {{formerly}} almost exclusively Protestant, and thus their religious past {{was always the same}} as for the church at Deinsberg (Theisbergstegen) on the Potzberg, whereas the Catholics always belonged to the parish of St. Remigius am Remigiusberg. The <b>ﬁrst</b> <b>breakdown</b> by religion comes from the year 1802, according to which the population was made up of 9 Catholics, 99 Lutherans and 9 Calvinists. In 1837, it was 11 Catholics and 138 Protestants. According to the latest statistics from 1986 and 1997, the share of Evangelical Christians had shrunk from 82% to 76%, while the Catholic share of the population remained steady at 12%. Some 10% of the villagers now belong to another religious community besides these two, or they acknowledge membership in none.|$|E
50|$|The {{period of}} the {{publication}} of Frithjof's saga (1825) was the critical epoch of his career. It {{made him one of}} the most famous poets in Europe. It transferred him from his study in Lund to the bishop's palace in Växjö; it marked the <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> of his health, which had hitherto been excellent; and it witnessed a singular moral crisis in the inner history of the poet, about which much has been written, but of which little is known. Tegnér was at this time passionately in love with a certain beautiful Euphrosyne Palm, the wife of a town councillor in Lund, and this unfortunate passion, while it inspired much of his finest poetry, turned the poet's blood to gall. From this time forward the heartlessness of woman is one of Tegnér's principal themes.|$|E
50|$|The {{last twenty}} years of Hart's life were plagued by bouts of {{depression}} and insomnia. He suffered his <b>first</b> nervous <b>breakdown</b> in 1887, followed by another in 1888. A final, severe breakdown led to his retirement from the OUP in 1915 {{at the age of}} seventy-five. The following year, he drowned himself in Youlbury Lake near Oxford, a secluded lake in the grounds of a neighbour’s garden. His gloves were folded neatly on the bank.|$|R

50|$|Ella Pontefract {{was born}} in the textile valleys of Yorkshire into prosperous {{families}} of Huddersfield and Penistone district. Her father's people had been manufacturers and yeomen farmers, her mother's grandfather the founder of Haig textile machinery manufacturers. The family upheld liberal politics and the high standards of conduct of the nonconformist Chapel. Ella attended Wheelwright Grammar School in Dewsbury, then Highfield Private School in Harrogate. In 1912 the parents moved the family moved up to Lindley Moor between Huddersfield and Halifax, but the postwar slump of 1925 necessitated they move again, and they chose Wetherby. Also at that time Ella had her <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> due to high blood pressure and spent a year or two in forced inactivity. Her neighbour's daughter Marie Hartley, although nine years younger, became her inseparable lifelong friend. In 1927 they started walking tours, with friends, of the Yorkshire Dales. Ella kept journals whist Marie painted and drew landscapes.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> at Cerro Dragón (Dragon Hill) was {{repaired}} on 11 February, the aqueduct broke again near Valle Hermoso (Beautiful valley). This issue {{created a}} longer-lasting {{lack of water}} that affected the area until 17 February. The moment that the pipes were refilled with drinking water new punctures and cracks appeared at the Caleta Olivia area. This issue mainly occurred because when pipes are not carrying water inside they tend to contract; once the pressure of water returns {{the expansion of the}} tubes makes them burst. From 1999 the aqueduct accumulated more than 550 cracks and punctures in its 77 km section from Cerro Arenales (Arenales Hill) to Caleta Olivia. This damage was mainly caused by the low-quality materials used {{in the construction of the}} aqueduct. In Comodoro Rivadavia, the water supply is interrupted during weekends due to the high water consumption rates of industry, the Argentine Army, and the local population.|$|E
50|$|The video {{opens with}} one of the band's members next to a girl at Planet Hollywood. When the girl walks away after his first verse, both of the men do trick shots {{throughout}} the video to win back the girl. On the <b>first</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the song, it is shown that she married the other man. He does another trick shot, but that fails. He then does another trick shot, throwing a soccer ball down an upriding escalator, but the ball gets stuck. While the trio were going down the adjacent escalator, the soccer ball from earlier was still there. At the end of the video, he throws a ball down to the pool from the roof of the building but the other man throws another one from higher up in a helicopter, and the video shows that he could not win his love back. After the song ends, the video cuts to the same escalator where the ball remained.|$|E
