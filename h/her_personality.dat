5|$|Carey {{began to}} infuse <b>her</b> <b>personality</b> into her work, {{something}} that showed throughout various tracks. During her stay, she {{was influenced by}} the Latin culture, and began harmonizing and singing the music she heard there. When she arrived back to New York, she already had the melody developed, and soon began working on the song in San Francisco with Afanasieff.|$|E

50|$|As the Shadow Initiative {{prepares to}} capture Hardball in Madripoor, Mary {{reveals that the}} reason why she joined the Initiative is because she couldn't merge or block out <b>her</b> four <b>personalities,</b> so she offered to join in {{exchange}} for a pardon and to help integrate her fractured mind, which is still a work in progress. During the Shadow Initiative's fight against HYDRA, Mary loses control of <b>her</b> <b>personalities,</b> having spent too much time from the Zero Room, and flees into the wilds of Madripoor.|$|R

5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and <b>her</b> <b>personality</b> as a dancer. She also tried to {{understand the meaning of}} the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading about}} the case while in college, Peirce {{conducted}} extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses {{on the relationship between}} Brandon and his girlfriend Lana Tisdel. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story. Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because <b>her</b> <b>personality</b> seemed similar to Teena's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.|$|E
5|$|Amy Rose is {{also one}} of the five main {{characters}} in the CGI series Sonic Boom, along with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and the new character Sticks, the latter of whom she is best friends with. <b>Her</b> <b>personality</b> has been changed into a stronger, more independent role, being a natural-born leader and the backbone of the team.

5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized <b>her</b> <b>personality</b> and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Tapping {{was offered}} {{a part in the}} {{original}} web series by series creator Damian Kindler and director Martin Wood. It became the actress' first regular role since playing Samantha Carter on Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for eleven years.

She also dyed her hair darker and spoke with an English accent throughout the run, as she herself was born in England. In addition, Tapping serves as the series executive producer and on some occasions, director.|$|E

Cliff Steele is staying in the same institution as Jane when Will Magnus asks Cliff to look after her, which leads to Jane's becoming a member of Doom Patrol.|$|R
5|$|The {{script was}} written {{specifically}} for Hepburn, and was tailored to <b>her</b> <b>personality.</b> Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938; {{it was over}} schedule and over budget. Production was frequently delayed due to uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant. Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by her co-star, vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett. A tame leopard was used during the shooting; its trainer was off-screen with a whip for all its scenes.|$|E
5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years of experience as a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} <b>her</b> <b>personality.</b> Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E
5|$|Nanako is {{an extreme}} tomboy with an {{insensitive}} personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with the students and Akira's parents after the exchange due to <b>her</b> <b>personality</b> and Akira's masculine appearance. Initially Nanako intended {{to return to her}} body after having fun as a male and was very strict on how Akira treated her body. She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the statusquo as they accept Nanako's hopelessness as a female. She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{revealed}} in the episode [...] "Omega" [...] that once Echo joined the Dollhouse, the Active Alpha became immediately attracted to her, going {{as far as to}} attack fellow Active Whiskey while pruning a bonsai tree, apparently so that Echo may become the most requested Doll, stating, [...] "Why don't you let Echo be number one?" [...] In [...] "Briar Rose", Alpha finally reenters the Dollhouse and imprints Echo with a personality previously imprinted within Whiskey. He takes all of Echo's [...] "wedges" [...] (computer hard drives each containing a <b>personality</b> imprint), including <b>her</b> original <b>personality,</b> and destroying the lone back-up of the latter. In [...] "Omega", Alpha attempts to recreate the same composite event that he experienced, imprinting Echo simultaneously with every single personality she has ever experienced except for Caroline- whom he separately imprints into a waitress whom he has kidnapped, with the intention of allowing the newly composited Echo to kill her. Instead of destroying <b>her</b> original <b>personality,</b> however, Echo attacks Alpha, saying that even with all of <b>her</b> <b>personalities,</b> not {{one of them is the}} one that truly belongs inside of her body, and that she is nothing more than an empty shell. She mentions at that time, all of <b>her</b> <b>personalities</b> totals up to thirty-eight. She later chooses to save her original [...] "wedge" [...] so that one day Caroline can be imprinted back within her body.|$|R

5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for <b>her</b> <b>personality.</b> Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{kind and}} caring to others {{no matter what}} their circumstances, as {{depicted}} in the television series. In an early episode, Ariel helps an orphaned merboy who had fallen in with a bad crowd. In another episode, Ariel befriends a supposed bad luck creature and protects it from Ursula and other merfolk who wish it harm. Ariel appears as an adult in Return to the Sea and gives birth to a daughter named Melody, becoming the first, and currently, only, Disney princess to become a mother. Ariel is protective of her daughter, as Triton was of Ariel in the first film. After Morgana threatens Ariel and King Triton, Prince Eric and Ariel build a wall around the palace to protect Melody from Morgana and other terrors of the ocean. Although it protected her, it could not protect her curiosity. Ariel's Beginning depicts <b>her</b> <b>personality</b> {{as it was in the}} original film after Jodi Benson had advocated returning the character to her roots. Ariel is once again rebellious, and after her father decrees music to be banned in Atlantica she runs away with Sebastian and his band.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee because of <b>her</b> <b>personality,</b> and {{her relationship with}} other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having her skirt shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where they}} would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E

5|$|The Divas {{rivalry between}} Mickie James and Trish Stratus over the WWE Women's Championship {{continued}} entering the event. Stratus and James first fought over the title at New Year's Revolution, with Stratus retaining.

5|$|The Dream Within a Dream Tour was {{the fourth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her third studio album, Britney (2001). The tour was promoted by Concerts West, marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment. On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage, united by a runway. Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of <b>her</b> <b>personality.</b> Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.|$|E
