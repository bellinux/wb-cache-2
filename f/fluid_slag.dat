50|$|The oxygen {{flow rate}} during blowing for a three tonne {{capacity}} furnace is 20-30 Nm3/h. Zinc is initially oxidized to form a zinc oxide dross {{on the surface of}} the charge, but as lead oxide subsequently forms, a <b>fluid</b> <b>slag</b> of zinc and lead oxides is created. Most of the copper is removed at the same time as the lead. The final removal of copper to a level of 0.04% is undertaken at the end of the process by further additions of lead to collect the copper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hammer mills}} smelted iron ore using {{charcoal}} in so-called bloomeries (Georgius Agricola 1556, Rennherden, Rennfeuer or Rennofen: from Rinnen = [...] "rivulets" [...] of slag or Zrennherd from Zerrinnen = [...] "to melt away"). In these smelting ovens, which were equipped with bellows also driven by water power, the ore was melted into a glowing clump of soft, raw iron, <b>fluid</b> <b>slag</b> and charcoal remnants. The iron was not fluid {{as it would}} be in a modern blast furnace, but remained a doughy, porous lump mainly due to the presence of liquid slag. These lumps of sponge iron, known historically as [...] "blooms" [...] were initially compacted by hand using a sledgehammer. After that they were forged several times, usually with the trip hammer or with sledgehammers until all the slag and charcoal had been removed. For that, the iron was heated in another forge oven or smith's hearth. The iron could then be directly used as soft iron. A further improvement process, such as fining as used in blast furnace operations, was not needed.|$|E
40|$|A 1 / 12 scale {{tank was}} {{constructed}} to physically simulate the metallurgical skimming process {{in order to}} gain a better insight of the skimming of <b>fluid</b> <b>slag</b> from copper anode furnaces. 1 -decanol and water were used to represent the slag and the underlying liquid metal respectively. It was observed that slag skimming was comprised of two steps, a transportation step to carry slag to the skimming lip, and a removal step to move the slag across the lip. The efficiency of the transportation by bath surface circulation was strongly affected by the method of creation of the surface movement. Submerged gas injection failed to carry slag to the lip effectively because of the uncontrollable circulation pattern generated on the bath surface. On the other hand, three impinging gas jets in glancing contact with the bath surface were able to carry slag to the lip effectively. The Re of the jets (I. D. 0. 01 m) inclined 50 ° to the horizontal was 6100. The jet configuration was two of the jets were placed close and parallel to the rear wall of the model and faced each other. The third jet was parallel to the model short axis and was directed at the skimming mouth. With the same amount of time, 70 % of the slag originally charged to the tank was skimmed with the assistance from the impinging gas jets in comparison to 20 % when no jet was used. Detailed analysis of the skimming process revealed that the underlying liquid bath level continuously decreased as the slag was skimmed and resulted in continuous reduction of the skimming rate. In order to compensate the reduction of skimming rate due to bath level reduction, a control strategy was proposed for rotating the furnace continuously to maximize the skimming effectively...|$|E
50|$|Over much of {{tropical}} Africa the ore used was laterite, which is widely {{available on the}} old continental cratons in West, Central and Southern Africa. Magnetite sand, concentrated in streams by flowing water, was often used in more mountainous areas, after beneficiation to raise the concentration of iron. Precolonial iron workers in present South Africa even smelted iron-titanium ores that cannot be used by modern blast furnaces.This is because titanium oxide is not reduced in bloomeries, and mixes readily with iron and silica to produce <b>fluid</b> <b>slags.</b> In the blast furnace titanium oxide is partially reduced and makes the calcium-magnesium-silica-alumina slags sticky, so that they cannot be drained from the furnace. Bloomery furnaces were less productive than blast furnaces, but were far more versatile.|$|R
50|$|After {{a desired}} carbon and {{temperature}} level have been reached the process moves to reduction. Reduction recovers the oxidized {{elements such as}} chromium from the slag. To achieve this, alloy additions are made with elements that have a higher affinity for oxygen than chromium, using either a silicon alloy or aluminum. The reduction mix also includes lime (CaO) and fluorspar (CaF2). The addition of lime and fluorspar help with driving the reduction of Cr2O3 and managing the slag, keeping the <b>slag</b> <b>fluid</b> and volume small.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{ceramics}} {{are considered}} as components in energy related systems, {{because they are}} known to be strong, wear and corrosion resistant in many environments, even at temperatures well exceeding 1000 °C. However, the presence of additives or impurities in important ceramics, for example those based on Silicon Nitride (Si 3 N 4) or Al 2 O 3 makes them vulnerable to the corrosion by hot aqueous fluids. The temperatures in this type of corrosion range from several tens of centigrade to hydrothermal conditions above 100 °C. The corrosion processes in such media depend on both pH and temperature and include often partial leaching of the ceramics, which cannot be monitored easily by classical gravimetric or electrochemical methods. Successful corrosion penetration depth monitoring by polarized reflected light optical microscopy (color changes), Micro Raman Spectroscopy (luminescence changes) and SEM (porosity changes) will be outlined. The corrosion process and its kinetics are monitored best by microanalysis of cross sections, Raman spectroscopy and eluate chemistry changes in addition to mass changes. Direct cross-calibrations between corrosion penetration and mechanical strength is only possible for severe corrosion. The methods outlined should be applicable to any ceramics corrosion process with partial leaching by <b>fluids,</b> melts or <b>slags...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{electric}} {{smelting furnace}} is {{found at the}} heart of the platinum recovery process where the power input from the electrodes produces a complex interplay between heat transfer and fluid flow. A fundamental knowledge of the dynamic system hosted by the electric furnace is valuable for maintaining stable and optimum operation. However, describing the character of the system hosted by the electric furnace poses great difficulty due to its aggressive environment. A full-scale threedimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was therefore developed for the circular, three-electrode Lonmin smelting furnace. The model was solved as time dependent to incorporate the effect of the three-phase AC current, which was supplied by means of volume sources representing the electrodes. The slag and matte layers were both modelled as fluid continuums in contact with each other through a dynamic interface made possible by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) multi-phase model. CO-gas bubbles forming at electrode surfaces and interacting with the surrounding <b>fluid</b> <b>slag</b> were modelled through the Discrete Phase Model (DPM). To account for the effect of concentrate melting, distinctive smelting zones were identified within the concentrate as assigned a portion of the melting heat based on the assumption of a radially decreasing smelting rate from the centre of the furnace. The tapping of slag and matte was neglected in the current modelling approach but compensation was made for the heating-up of descending material by means of an energy sink based on enthalpy differences. Model cases with and without CO-gas bubbles were investigated as well as the incorporation of a third phase between the slag and matte for representing the ‘mushy’ chromite/highly viscous slag commonly found in this region. These models were allowed to iterate until steady state conditions has been achieved, which for most of the cases involved several weeks of simulation time. The results that were obtained provided good insight into the electrical, heat and flow behaviour present within the molten bath. The current density profiles showed a large portion of the current to flow via the matte layer between the electrodes. Distributions for the electric potential and Joule heat within the melt was also developed and showed the highest power to be generated within the immediate vicinity of the electrodes and 98 % of the resistive heat to be generated within the slag. Heat was found to be uniformly distributed due the slag layer being well mixed. The CO-gas bubbles was shown to be an important contributor to flow within the slag, resulting in a order of magnitude difference in average flow magnitude compared to the case where only natural buoyancy is at play. The highest flow activity was observed halfway between electrodes where the flow streams from the electrodes meet. Consequently, the highest temperatures are also observed in these regions. The temperature distribution within the matte and concentrate layers can be characterized as stratified. Low flow regions were identified within the matte and bottom slag layer which is where chromite and magnitite deposits are prone to accumulate. The model results were partially validated through good agreement to published results where actual measurements were done while also falling within the typical operating range for the actual furnace. The modelling of the electric furnace has been valuably furthered, however for complete confidence in the model results, further validation is strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|Viscosity & flow {{characteristics}} of the Blast Furnace slag constitute twovery Important parameters for ensuring the smooth operation of the Blast Furnace producing pig iron. Ideally, the Blast Furnace slag should neither be very viscous nor very <b>fluid.</b> A Viscous <b>slag</b> interferes with efficient slag- metal separation; while a slag with very low viscosity {{is more likely to}} interfere with the thermal balance of the Furnace & affect the retention time of the metal droplets in the slag affecting the slagmetal reactions/ exchanges. Flow characteristics in the Blast Furnace slag can provide a fair knowledge about the location & extent of the cohesive zone in the Furnace. The cohesive zone in the Furnace acts as a gas distributor & its place lower down the Furnace would create less probability for the softened slag for choking the Furnace. Also a cohesive zone lower down the Furnace would result in less Si pick up in the hot metal. The present work aims at characterizing the Blast Furnace slag {{on the basis of its}} viscosity and {{flow characteristics}}. Empirical equations are developed to predict the flow characteristics of Blast Furnace slag and the same was validated through further experimentation. The viscosity of the Blast Furnace slag (synthetic one prepared in laboratory in line with the compositional details as encountered in the industry) is determined for C/S (CaO/SiO 2) variation, MgO content variation and TiO 2 variation and along with that to the simultaneous variation of C/S ratio & MgO content. The compositional dependence of the slag viscosity is discussed at length. ...|$|R
40|$|Iron and slag are the {{products}} from blast furnace and normally drained {{out as a}} mixture via taphole. Two tapholes are opening alternatively in the large-scale blast furnace hearth. After the taphole switches, molten iron is only tapped out at the first few minutes. This phenomenon is observed widely in the large-scale blast furnace and {{it is called the}} Slag delay. Due to the high temperature and high pressure inside the furnace, it is hard to execute real-time observations. A CFD model is developed to study the <b>fluids</b> of iron, <b>slag,</b> and gas inside the blast furnace hearth. This numerical simulation was performed by finite volume method that considers the key forces involved, including the gravity, buoyancy, and the drag between liquid-solid and liquid-liquid. The pressure difference between the liquid surface inside furnace and outside the atmosphere induces the pitting of the liquid surface during the liquids tapping. Consequently, when the bottom of pit reaches the taphole, the gas is drained out through the pit. The computational simulation results by liquid level model are consistent with the observations in the physical water model experiment. The gas is drained out at the water surface still above the taphole level. The pit cause by gas pressure forms a pathway of gas. The experiments show {{that it is possible to}} drain out the gas before liquid level attaches the taphole. Calculations are presented which suggest that under actual blast furnace conditions the gas can be drained out during the slag-iron interface is still above the taphole. This scenario in liquid level during the drainage successfully explains the slag delay in the research. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for entrained flow coal gasification was developed {{with the objective}} of predicting the influence of coal properties and gasification conditions on the performance of entrained flow gasifiers operating at pressures up to 21 atmospheres (2. 1 MPa). The model represents gasifiers as plug flow reactors and therefore neglects any mixing or turbulence effects. Coal properties were predicted through use of correlations from a variety of literature sources and others that were developed from experimental data in the literature. A sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that errors in the calculated values of coal volatile yield, carbon dioxide gasification reactivity and steam gasification may significantly affect the model predictions. Similarly errors in the input values for gasifier wall temperatures and gasifier diameter, when affected by slagging, can cause model prediction errors. Model predictions were compared with experimental gasification results for a range of atmospheric and high pressure gasifiers, the majority of the results being obtained by CSIRO at atmospheric pressure for a range of coals. Predictions were accurate for the majority of atmospheric pressure results over a large range of gas feed mixtures. Due to the limited range of experimental data available for high pressure gasification the capability of the model is somewhat uncertain, although the model provided accurate predictions {{for the majority of the}} available results. The model was also used to predict the trends in particle reactions with gasification and the influence of pressure, gasifier diameter and feed coal on gasifier performance. Further research on coal volatile yields, gasification reactivities and gas properties at high temperatures and pressures was recommended to improve the accuracy of model inputs. Additional predictions and model accuracy improvements could be made by extending the model to include <b>fluid</b> dynamics and <b>slag</b> layer modelling. PhD Doctorat...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{radioactive material}} (NORM) is everywhere; we {{are exposed to}} it every day. It is found in our bodies, the food we eat, the places where we live and work, and in products we use. We are also bathed {{in a sea of}} natural radiation coming from the sun and deep space. Living systems have adapted to these levels of radiation and radioactivity. But some industrial practices involving natural resources concentrate these radionuclides to a degree that they may pose risk to humans and the environment if they are not controlled. Other activities, such as flying at high altitudes, expose us to elevated levels of NORM. This session will concentrate on diffuse sources of technologically-enhanced (TE) NORM, which are generally large-volume, low-activity waste streams produced by industries such as mineral mining, ore benefication, production of phosphate Fertilizers, water treatment and purification, and oil and gas production. The majority of radionuclides in TENORM are found in the uranium and thorium decay chains. Radium and its subsequent decay products (radon) are the principal radionuclides used in characterizing the redistribution of TENORM in the environment by human activity. We will briefly review other radionuclides occurring in nature (potassium and rubidium) that contribute primarily to background doses. TENORM is found in many waste streams; for example, scrap metal, sludges, <b>slags,</b> <b>fluids,</b> and is being discovered in industries traditionally not thought of as affected by radionuclide contamination. Not only the forms and volumes, but the levels of radioactivity in TENORM vary. Current discussions about the validity of the linear no dose threshold theory are central to the TENORM issue. TENORM is not regulated by the Atomic Energy Act or other Federal regulations. Control and regulation of TENORM is not consistent from industry to industry nor from state to state. Proposed regulations are moving from concentration-based standards to dose-based standards. So when is TENORM a problem? Where is it a problem? That depends on when, where, and whom you talk to! We will start by reviewing background radioactivity, then we will proceed to the geology, mobility, and variability of these radionuclides. We will then review some of the industrial sectors affected by TENORM, followed by a brief discussion on regulatory aspects of the issue...|$|R
