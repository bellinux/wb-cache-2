50|$|The World Health Organization {{reports of}} the need to {{intervene}} when more than one third of the total Disability Adjusted Life Years was lost as a result of exposure to indoor air pollution in Africa. Fuel is needed to power lights at night. The fuel being burned causes great emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Because of the increased urbanization in Africa, people are burning more and more fuel and using more vehicles for transportation. The rise in vehicle emissions and the trend towards greater industrialization means the urban air quality in the continent is worsening. In many countries, the use of leaded gasoline is still widespread, and vehicle emission controls are nonexistent. Indoor air pollution is widespread, mostly from the burning of coal in the kitchen for cooking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking, passive smoking, and <b>indoor</b> air <b>pollution</b> from biomass fuels {{have been}} implicated as {{risk factors for}} {{tuberculosis}} (TB) infection, disease, and death. Tobacco smoking and <b>indoor</b> air <b>pollution</b> are persistent or growing exposures in regions where TB poses a major health risk. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between these exposures {{and the risk of}} infection, disease, and death from TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies reporting effect estimates and 95 % confidence intervals on how tobacco smoking, passive smoke exposure, and <b>indoor</b> air <b>pollution</b> are associated with TB. We identified 33 papers on tobacco smoking and TB, five papers on passive smoking and TB, and five on <b>indoor</b> air <b>pollution</b> and TB. We found substantial evidence that tobacco smoking is positively associated with TB, regardless of the specific TB outcomes. Compared with people who do not smoke, smokers have an increased risk of having a positive tuberculin skin test, of having active TB, and of dying from TB. Although we also found evidence that passive smoking and <b>indoor</b> air <b>pollution</b> increased the risk of TB disease, these associations are less strongly supported by the available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of TB. The finding that passive smoking and biomass fuel combustion also increase TB risk should be substantiated with larger studies in future. TB control programs might benefit from a focus on interventions aimed at reducing tobacco and <b>indoor</b> air <b>pollution</b> exposures, especially among those at high risk for exposure to TB...|$|R
