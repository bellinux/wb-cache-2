50|$|The {{stickiness}} of spiders' webs is {{courtesy of}} droplets of glue suspended on the silk threads. This glue <b>is</b> <b>multifunctional</b> - that is, its behavior {{depends on how}} quickly something touching it attempts to withdraw. At high velocities, they function as an elastic solid, resembling rubber; at lower velocities, they simply act as a sticky glue. This allows them to retain a grip on attached food particles. The web is also electrically conductive which causes the silk threads to spring out to trap their quarry, as flying insects tend to gain a static charge which attracts the silk.|$|E

5000|$|The hollow {{design of}} bird bones <b>is</b> <b>multifunctional</b> by {{establishing}} high specific strength and supplementing open airways {{to accommodate the}} skeletal pneumaticity common to many birds. The specific strength and resistance to buckling is optimized through their bone design that combines a thin, hard shell that encases a spongy core of trabeculae. The allometry of their trabeculae allows the skeleton to tolerate loads without significantly increasing the bone mass. The Red-Tailed Hawk optimizes its weight with a repeating pattern of V-shaped struts that give the bones the necessary lightweight and stiff characteristics. The inner network of trabeculae shifts mass away from the neutral axis, which ultimately increases the resistance to buckling.|$|E
