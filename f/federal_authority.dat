5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of this country's history, most American Indian tribes have been subject to <b>federal</b> <b>authority</b> and jurisdiction. In Maine, however, indigenous populations lived on reservations that were exclusively and completely administered by the state. This unique arrangement shaped tribal life in Maine, and proved to be a crucial issue in the development and resolution of the tribe's land claim.|$|E
5|$|In January 1858, Powell {{was elected}} to the United States Senate. In April of that year, President James Buchanan {{appointed}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch commissioners to negotiate settlements with the Mormons in Utah. On arriving in Utah, Powell and McCulloch issued a proclamation by President Buchanan offering clemency to Mormons who agreed to submit to <b>Federal</b> <b>authority.</b> The offer was accepted, and violence was averted.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the <b>federal</b> <b>authority</b> of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E

Whereas in the old Federal Constitution the <b>federal</b> <b>authorities</b> were only given competence over specific statistical matters, under Art. 65 of the Federal Constitution of 1999, the <b>federal</b> <b>authorities</b> have general statistical competence: [...] "The <b>federal</b> <b>authorities</b> shall obtain the necessary statistical data concerning the current status {{and changes in the}} population, the economy, society, education, research, spatial development and the environment in Switzerland".

5|$|The {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. This {{was the first time}} the new government had been directly opposed, and through a clear show of <b>federal</b> <b>authority,</b> Washington established the principle that federal law is the supreme law of the land, and demonstrated that the federal government had both the ability and willingness to suppress violent resistance to the nation's laws. The government's response to the rebellion was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. This also was one of only two times in U.S. history that an incumbent president has personally commanded the military in the field; James Madison would command an army in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Banff, {{established}} in 1885, {{is the main}} commercial centre in Banff National Park, {{as well as a}} centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and <b>federal</b> <b>authority</b> in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.|$|E

25|$|Since World War II, {{the federal}} {{constitution}} authorizes the Confederation to levy {{a number of}} taxes, the most significant of which are an income tax, a withholding tax and a value added tax. However, Switzerland is unique among modern sovereign states in that the authority to levy these taxes is limited in duration and extent. The Constitution imposes an upper limit on the federal tax rates and causes the <b>federal</b> <b>authority</b> to levy taxes to expire in 2020. A renewal of that authority requires a constitutional amendment, which must be approved in a popular referendum by both {{a majority of the}} popular vote and the cantons. If that renewal is not approved at the polls (as it has been six times since 1958), the Confederation itself will conceivably dissolve for lack of funds. All attempts to remove this limitation by amending the constitution to provide for a permanent <b>federal</b> <b>authority</b> to levy taxes have been rejected in Parliament or – no less than five times – by popular vote, most recently in 1991.|$|E

25|$|The liberal-dominated Assembly elected Manuel José Arce as {{president}} {{but he soon}} turned against his own faction and dissolved the Assembly.

The victors led by the Honduran Francisco Morazán took power and Morazán was proclaimed president in 1830. To appease liberal supporters, the capital was relocated from Guatemala City to San Salvador in 1831 but Morazán's hold on power was waning as conservatives regained control in the provinces.|$|E
25|$|Congress was {{dominated}} by southern Congressmen, as apportionment was based on three-fifths {{of the number of}} slaves being counted in population totals. They passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their <b>federal</b> <b>authority.</b> Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, Indiana, whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.|$|E
25|$|The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the <b>Federal</b> <b>authority</b> {{for patient}} safety {{and quality of}} care {{and has been a}} leader in {{pediatric}} quality and safety.

Eighteen pediatric quality indicators are included in the AHRQ quality measure modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient indicators are recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient indicators are treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.|$|E
