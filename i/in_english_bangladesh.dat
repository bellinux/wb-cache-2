A large number of students receive private supplementary tutoring <b>in</b> <b>English</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh.</b> Payment-based private supplementary tutoring has also spread all over the world, both in developed and developing countries-from east to the west. The {{aim of this study}} is to find out the reasons and necessity of private tutoring <b>in</b> <b>English</b> for Bangla medium school students in Bangladesh. Besides, It will be also investigated that private tutoring has any positive effects or not. To conduct this research, thirty five respondents were surveyed successfully with a written questionnaire. And classroom observation was done successfully to find out where there was any lacking <b>in</b> <b>English</b> teaching or not. The findings from the survey show that most of the primary level learners receive private tutoring and they are satisfied with the English lesson provided by their private tutor rather than their school teacher. But learners should not fully depend on private tutor. Private tuition has both positive and negative effects. Parents and learners should recognize the importance of private tutoring <b>in</b> <b>English</b> and also be aware about negative effects of it. Samia ManzoorM. A. in Englis...|$|R

Here substantial command over English is considered as a linguistic passport to the arena of globalization and competitive white-collar job market, especially the non-government ones. The booming of multinational companies along with the private ones {{in the recent years}} has acted as a socio economic factor underlying the increasing awareness <b>in</b> learning <b>English.</b> This job related factor has given English language the status of career oriented language with a colonial tinge of aristocracy and high prestige triggering Bangladeshi people to learn English not for mutual communicative purpose but to compete the job market. <b>In</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> <b>English</b> is associated with better white-collar job, which earns a person social prestige. Here, a person’s socioprofessional identity can be better understood from the nature of his spoken language. White-collar service holders and professionals, in Bangladesh, are found to mix Bangla and <b>English</b> <b>in</b> their conversation. This article is mainly based on Wardhaugh’s (1992 : 107) definition of conversational code-mixing which “involves the deliberate mixing of two languages without an associated topic change. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>Bangladesh,</b> <b>English</b> is a {{compulsory}} subject from primary to higher secondary level. The introduction of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) has influenced the curriculum, textbooks and teaching methods of English since the 90 s.

However, the aims and objectives of this communicative curriculum can never be achieved without an assessment system that assesses the communicative ability of the learners (Haider, 2008). When new contents are introduced in the curriculum, teachers often need to review their teaching and assessment procedures in order to cope with the demands of change. The current study aimed to explore - to what extent, the assessment measures used in secondary schools are being treated as means to gather evidence on the targeted learning outcomes and best meet the learners’ needs for future learning.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of three studies designed to investigate the influences of backgrounds on learners and instructors in learning and teaching second language (L 2) writing <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> The participants, thus, were learners and instructors of L 2 writing <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> The studies {{took place in the}} ESL context of New Zealand and in the EFL context of Bangladesh. The first two studies focused on how learners from various linguistic, academic, and cultural backgrounds learned to write <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> The third study demonstrated how instructors’ academic training and the context of teaching influenced their modes of teaching L 2 writing <b>in</b> <b>English</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh.</b> In the first study, 30 participants were recruited from an <b>English</b> Language College <b>in</b> New Zealand. All participants were honing their <b>English</b> language skills <b>in</b> order to embark on undergraduate or graduate studies in New Zealand. Their proficiency <b>in</b> the <b>English</b> language was similar given the results of a placement test. The age of participants ranged from 16 - 40 years, and they came from such countries as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and Colombia. Participants were divided based on Chinese (N= 20) and non-Chinese (N= 10) backgrounds. All participants completed background questionnaires, grammaticality judgement tests, vocabulary tests, and writing tasks. A critical finding of this study was that for the non-Chinese participants both vocabulary and grammar tests’ scores correlated with the scores of the writing test; however, for the Chinese learners, scores in the vocabulary test did not correlate with those of the writing and grammar tests. This suggested that the L 2 writers across cultures and languages did not learn to write <b>in</b> <b>English</b> exactly alike, though participants of this study also demonstrated some similar areas of L 2 writing development. The study reinforced the caution about generalizing L 2 writers across languages, cultures, and academic backgrounds. The second study included 70 undergraduate students from a private university in the capital city of Bangladesh, Dhaka. The age of the participants ranged from 17 - 24 years, and their native language was Bangla. English language development was similar across participants given the results of an admission test and the mandatory pre-requisite English courses taken. Participants completed background questionnaires, vocabulary tests, grammaticality judgement tests, and writing tasks <b>in</b> <b>English</b> and Bangla. Participants also completed a questionnaire that gleaned information about their perceptions of writing <b>in</b> <b>English</b> and Bangla. One of the critical findings of the study was the cross-language correlations between essays, implying that a strong or a weak writer in a first language would show similar ability levels in an L 2. This study suggested that the teaching of L 2 writing <b>in</b> <b>English</b> should be based on an appreciation of how the development of writing in an L 1 can help or hinder the development of writing in an L 2. The third study focused on L 2 writing instructors at different public and private universities in Bangladesh. This study included 46 participants who completed background questionnaires, provided feedback on a piece of writing and completed questionnaires that gleaned information regarding their styles and strategies of providing feedback. The study revealed that the areas of specialization <b>in</b> <b>English</b> studies between the junior and senior instructors significantly varied [...] senior instructors specialized mostly in literature, whereas the junior instructors mostly specialized in language-related areas. Despite this, their practice and perceptions of teaching L 2 writing across the universities in Bangladesh did not vary significantly. This may change over time as instructors with language -area specializations become the majority in the future. The three studies of this thesis shifted the focus from learning to teaching L 2 writing across contexts and languages. The findings should inform explanation of why learners from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and with differing language abilities, learned or failed to learn to write <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> Furthermore, empirical data were presented to appreciate influences on instruction which in turn would influence the ways learners learn L 2 writing <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> Such findings should support the development of theories and practices in the teaching and learning of L 2 writing...|$|R
30|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has shown how education policy in Bangladesh has been embroiled in vested political interests {{from the very beginning}} of its emergence as an independent nation in 1971. Sadeque (2000, in Rahman [2010]), for example reports the general lack of policy direction in Bangladesh's education sector, while Unterhalter et al. ([2003]) lament the futility of politics and the ‘fragile dialogue’ between policy makers and practitioners of English that have always characterised Bangladesh's education policy. Policy and practice have been ‘fragmented and inconsistent’ (Imam [2005]), and to a large extent researchers have blamed this on the tendency of research and education policy development predominantly being the preserve of elite groups associated with the government (Unterhalter et al. [2003]), and education policy and reform historically being largely dictated by international funding rather than expert opinion (Hamid [2009]). In his comprehensive study on the relevance of humanities education in Bangladesh, Rahman ([2010]) has labelled the education system as characterised by ‘internal and external inefficiency’, devoid of ‘productivity… and clear-cut objectives… and policy directions’, ‘stagnant’, ‘inadequate’, ‘out-dated’, ‘limited’, and one that ‘produces graduates with no productive skills’ (p. 5). A newspaper report summarises the system as ‘still sunk in theoretical or textbook education’ (New Nation 2005, in Rahman [2010], p. 5). [Aminuzzaman (n.d.)] argues that the quality of education in Bangladesh has ‘declined steadily, in some cases quite alarmingly, over the last two decades’ and has been said to be ‘characterised by a mismatch of the objectives and the curriculum’ (Ali [2004], n.p.) - a discontinuity marked most conspicuously <b>in</b> <b>English</b> education. Rahman regrets that the country still confronts a dilemma on the language issue - should the medium of instruction be English or the mother tongue? Similarly Johanson ([2000]) bemoans the lack of a visionary plan and lack of policy <b>in</b> relation to <b>English</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh.</b> Indeed the acknowledgement of such deteriorating quality in education comes from within policy makers themselves - the 2003 National Education Committee (NEC) itself lamented the conspicuous lack of a language policy for Bangladesh.|$|R

Includes bibliographical references (page 57 - 59). This study {{is concerned with the}} existing methods and approaches that are in action at the tertiary level. It attempts to assess the suitability of the current methods that are used in different private universities of Dhaka from the perspective of post-methods. In the postmethod era, the traditional methods/approaches are thought to be dead, and a method is only considered suitable when it is context sensitive. Our learners, even after studying English for twelve years, fail to acquire sufficient mastery over English. This may happen because of the somewhat inappropriate choice of methods by the teachers. Many a times, teachers of our country execute a given method without judging the context. As a result, a mismatch between the context and the method being implemented becomes obvious and when the learners come to a university, the mismatch may continue. This study aims to see the present situation and suitability of the methods implemented at tertiary level. In other words, the study aims {{to find out if the}} methods are context sensitive. It will provide future researchers a good understanding of the conditions of different methods and approaches. The results of this study can be used to make necessary modifications and enhancements in those approaches. The study uses interviews (semi-structured) to collect data. The findings show that the teachers of private universities in Dhaka make a conscious effort to contextualize features of different methods and approaches and implement them accordingly. At the same time, the teachers need to be aware of a few key issues which the researcher discussed as recommendations, for example, the status of <b>English</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh,</b> need for local materials, need for "needs analysis" etc. to improve the teaching standard of English of the private universities of Dhaka.

Research findings [...] Chapter 5. Discussion [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. This research {{focuses on}} university teachers’ cognition {{regarding the use of}} computers for teaching <b>English</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh,</b> one of the developing countries in the world. Though both teachers and students are leading players in CALL environments, teachers, particularly university teachers who teach English as a second language in Bangladesh, are the primary participants of the study. The study aims at seeking answers to the following questions: (1) What conceptions and attitudes do university English teachers hold about CALL in Bangladesh as a developing country? (2) What is the relationship between these conceptions and attitudes and teachers’ reported practices regarding CALL? The research data, collected through online-based questionnaire and interview, reveal that university English teachers conceptualize computers mostly as an essential tool in their CALL practices for various pedagogic and administrative purposes. They conceptualize themselves mostly as ‘resource providers’ and computers mostly as ‘presenters of information’ in CALL lessons. Teachers also hold favourable attitudes towards CALL due to their experienced benefits with CALL despite the presence of certain contextual constraints such as load-shedding and slow Internet. They also hold positive attitude towards the future improvement of CALL in Bangladesh. All these conceptions and attitudes, namely teacher cognition is revealed to be a strong influence on teachers’ reported practices which interacts with contextual constraints directly by altering their practices accordingly. Thus, the study explores the complexity of teacher cognition regarding CALL in Bangladesh. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (163 pages) diagrams, table...|$|R
40|$|The ‘social turn’ {{in applied}} {{linguistics}} and second language acquisition (SLA) {{has seen the}} emergence of a range of socially-oriented perspectives, such as sociolinguistic, sociocultural, socio-historical and situated learning, yet this has not resulted in L 2 learners’ social origins and backgrounds being given sufficient attention in L 2 research. The present study therefore argues for taking a sociology of language learning perspective to investigate L 2 learners’ social biographies and their academic achievement <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> This social perspective is informed by the sociology of education as well as critical approaches to applied linguistics. Learners’ social biographies consist of learner-internal (personal) and -external (social) factors. These factors are conceptualised as learner habitus and family educational capital (economic, social and cultural) respectively, with reference to Bourdieu’s theories in the sociology of education. The study investigates secondary school students’ <b>English</b> learning outcomes <b>in</b> relation to their habitus and family capital situations in a rural context in Bangladesh. It uses a mixed methods research design and draws on both quantitative and qualitative data. It also utilises multiple perspectives, provided by 10 th grade students (n = 228) and their English teachers, head teachers and parents. The data collection instruments include a questionnaire survey, an English proficiency test and participant interviews. The study shows that aspects of family economic and cultural capital and learner habitus are significantly associated with the students’ English achievement. However, social capital, operationalised as parental input into the students’ English studies, is not associated with their academic achievement <b>in</b> <b>English,</b> although it is significantly correlated with learner habitus and parental education. The students’ perceptions of their family capital situations and the perceived impact of these situations on their academic experience were supportive of structuralist determinism. Despite the constraining effects of family capital disadvantage on academic experience, disadvantaged students can neutralise these effects by means of their habitus and thus negate social determinism {{in the context of their}} scholastic achievement. The study also shows that contrary to the widening gap in the academic achievement of students in favour of females in many social contexts, the female students in the present context performed somewhat less well than their male counterparts in the school-leaving examination. Finally, the students’ English learning and academic outcomes were embedded in their social biographies. Their academic achievement or underachievement cannot be fully understood without recourse to their familial and social worlds, their lived experiences, their desires for better futures and their disadvantage, and lack of means to pursue those desires. Despite some caveats, the findings have important implications for the theory and practice of teaching <b>English</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bangladesh</b> and other social contexts. First, it is necessary to include both learner-internal and -external family/social factors in the investigation of L 2 learners’ English learning experience and outcomes. Second, ELT policies should have provisions that address these beyond-the-school factors in order to develop English language skills across social classes and geographic locations. Finally, schools should embrace the question of inequality <b>in</b> <b>English</b> learning outcomes and devise mechanisms for the reduction of inequalities within their limited resources and capacities. The major contribution of the study is to our understanding of the factors associated with <b>English</b> language learning <b>in</b> rural communities in developing societies. In particular, the study substantiates non-cognitive, non-methodological and non-curricular approaches to EFL/ESL. Identification of these factors is facilitated by the perspective of sociology of English learning and the concept of social biography. In addition, the study designs a theoretical and conceptual framework and instruments for researching student achievement <b>in</b> <b>English</b> <b>in</b> relation to family capital and learner habitus...|$|R
