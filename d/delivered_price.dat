50|$|Transportation is a {{major factor}} in the <b>delivered</b> <b>price</b> of crushed stone. The cost of moving crushed stone from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of {{transportation}} and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, crushed stone is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving crushed stone quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material. Economies of scale, which might be realized if fewer, larger operations served larger marketing areas, would probably not offset the increased transportation costs.|$|E
50|$|Just as superhighways change valuations of land {{due to the}} {{proximity}} {{to the ability to}} transport valuable commodities, businesses are strongly motivated to influence the siting of a super grid to their benefit. The cost of alternative power is the <b>delivered</b> <b>price</b> of electricity, and if production of electricity from North Dakota wind or Arizona solar is to be competitive, the distance of the connection from the wind farm to the interstate transmission grid must not be great. This is because the feeder line from the generator to the transmission lines is usually paid for by the owner of the generation. Some localities will help pay for the cost of these lines, at the cost of local regulation such as that of a public utilities commission. T. Boone Pickens' project has chosen to pay for the feeder lines privately.

40|$|This study compares two principally {{different}} harvesting systems {{used for}} the thinning of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] plantations in the Alps. The first system was whole-tree harvesting (WTH), producing only whole-tree chips for energy purposes. This system minimizes the production costs by simplifying the harvesting process. The other system was cut-to-length (CTL) mechanical harvesting with an excavator-based harvester. This system maximizes value recovery by producing both short sawlogs and quality fuel chips. Trials were conducted on two similar sites in the Dolomites, in northern Italy, and demonstrated that the CTL system resulted in slightly higher harvesting costs, and also higher revenue. The price differences between the different products determine which system offers the best economic results. If the <b>delivered</b> <b>price</b> of sawlogs does not exceed € 25 t- 1, WTH and CTL harvesting offer very similar economic performances, and become profitable only if the <b>delivered</b> <b>price</b> of raw chip wood exceeds € 40 t- 1.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} spatial differentiation on the sustainability of collusion on <b>delivered</b> <b>prices.</b> It shows that {{the choice of the}} punishment mechanism that enforces collusion is crucial for determining whether differentiation facilitates cartel pricing or not. If punishments are optimal, then differentiation tends to facilitate collusion. Optimal punishments impose minmax profits on deviators independently of the degree of differentiation. A high degree of differentiation then renders deviations less profitable, since it makes business stealing more costly but does not affect the deviator's punishment profits. Depending on the transport cost technology, excessive differentiation may have a countervailing effect, however, because it also implies high transport costs for the cartel. If collusion is sustained by standard grim trigger punishments instead, then collusion may be easiest for minimal differentiation. The reason is that competitive and thus grim trigger punishment profits are higher the higher the degree of differentiation. <b>Delivered</b> <b>pricing</b> Collusion Optimal penal codes Spatial differentiation...|$|R

While this additional unlicensed spectrum allows for market expansion, it also influences competition among providers and can increase congestion (interference) among consumers of wireless services.

40|$|A region {{comprises}} {{markets with}} {{different kinds of}} spatial competition such as free-entry competition and local monopoly. In this paper, a model is built to analyze spatial and economic structure established {{in each of the}} markets. This model shows as follows. Interactions between the markets with different kinds of competition influence a firm through the <b>delivered</b> <b>price</b> at the boundary of its market area and the net wage level at the edge of its commuting range. Under the interaction between these markets, a local monopoly firm first determines the size of its market, and then workers’ commuting range to the firm is settled. As a local monopoly firm moves closer to a competitive market, the local monopoly’s market area and commuting range become smaller. In addition, the firm, compared with a firm farther from the competitive one, is forced to sell consumers the goods at a lower price and to offer higher wages to workers.

40|$|There is {{more than}} one price policy in a spatial market. Three main spatial price {{policies}} are: (1) uniform mill price under which the seller chooses a constant f. o. b. price and transportation costs are paid by consumers; (2) spatial price discrimination (hereafter, SPD) under which different and location-specific prices are selected over space; and (3) uniform <b>delivered</b> <b>price</b> policy (UDP) under which consumers at different market sites pay the same <b>delivered</b> <b>price.</b> Among these price polices, price discrimination is treated by antitrust authorities of many countries being illegal per se, but uniform mill price is often appealing because of “its imitation of the spatial structure of marginal costs ” (Hobbs, 1986). Perhaps because of this, much efforts in the literature has been devoted to the socially superiority of SPD as compared with uniform mill price. 1 The main conclusion hereupon is that in some cases, SPD is socially preferable as compared with uniform mill price. This implies that as compared with uniform mill price, the social superiority of SPD is model specific. Uniform delivered pricing is also appealing as compared with SPD, and often tolerated by antitrust authorities. But there is a paucity of research that seeks t...|$|E

This paper analyzes the effects of that regulatory change on the prices charged by the two railroads that hauled low-sulfur coal east from Wyoming.

Firms compete by setting quantity schedules independently over space. We show that under general conditions a Nash equilibrium in this game exists and is unique.

Over the interval between two firms, the equilibrium spatial price schedule is quasi‐concave (quasi‐convex) when transport costs are concave (convex). With linear transport costs, the model predicts uniform <b>delivered</b> <b>pricing.</b> Uniform pricing could moreover be obtained {{by a combination of}} increasing returns to volume in transportation together with concavity of unit transport costs in distance.
