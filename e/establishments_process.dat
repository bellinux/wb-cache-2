40|$|The {{large size}} of the Japanese IT market makes it {{attractive}} to and important for foreign high technology companies. However, the Japanese market is very challenging, highly competitive, and difficult to penetrate for foreign {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). Most SMEs fail to penetrate into the Japanese market effectively by using modern IT-tools in the international subsidiary <b>establishment</b> <b>process.</b> No earlier in-depth empirical research exists on the IT-supported international subsidiary <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> for this market. This study investigated and analyzed how a Finnish high technology SME implemented the ITsupported international subsidiary <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> for the Japanese market. In this study, a case study method was used to execute the research. This study validated and refined a conceptual model of the ITsupported international subsidiary <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> by using empirical data. The research findings revealed that by using various IT-tools high technology companies can improve their internationalization process, penetrate the Japanese market rapidly and effectively, and manage global information exchange. This study also demonstrates that the use of IT-tools in the international subsidiary <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> includes some limitations and not all tasks can be performed using ITtools alone.

40|$|Based on this study, {{it seems}} that China {{has a lot to}} offer for western {{telecommunication}} companies in terms of providing lucrative location for foreign R&D presence. If the challenges relating to the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> of the local R&D site are tackled appropriately and the Chinese governmental policies do not radically change from the current situation, then local R&D presence can offer a particular company long term competitive advantage. In addition to cost savings, the extended scope of the global R&D function to China might offer the company as a whole benefits such as increased market share, access to market and technological knowledge, and important strategic contribution of the established R&D site. The former benefits relate closely to attaining a trusted position within the local Chinese relationship network, GuanXi, while the latter benefit relates to the high quality of the local engineers. Along the increasing wage levels, high turnover of the local engineers, problems associated with compliance to intellectual property rights and the risks associated with the uncertainty regarding the future policies of the Chinese government, the western companies operating in China might, however, be facing challenges. The way in which the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> of the R&D site in China is conducted plausibly at least to an extent determines the future role, productivity and competence of the site. If not conducted properly, the site might not increase its R&D contribution as planned and the potential benefits might not be attained. Understanding the effects of the local business environment characteristics to the appropriate management of the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> is crucial. This understanding facilitates the execution of the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> as appropriate practices and patterns can be followed. An important observation provided by this Master’s Thesis is that such appropriate practices and patterns do exist and thus most of the challenges can be overcome and the site can attain the benefits described. The main result of this Master’s Thesis is that the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> of foreign R&D site to China might be relatively fast. This is facilitated by the high quality of the local workforce. On the other hand, the fast <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> might be needed to get access to the Chinese relationship networks. Relating to this, {{it is important that the}} management is committed to the process and that enough of reciprocal visits is done. Secondly, transferring interesting R&D tasks to the established site is important as they serve as a way to increase the competence of the site and a way for the management at the parent R&D site to discover the capabilities of the established site. Finally, it is important that local Chinese employees are taking part to the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> as they are familiar with the local business environment...|$|R

Cg-Prkdcscid Il 2 rgtm 1 Sug/Jic (NOD/Shi-scid, IL- 2 Rγnull or NOG) mouse are important tools for oncology research. During the <b>establishment</b> <b>process,</b> a lymphoproliferative lesion (LPL) that replaces the original tumor cells in the site of transplantation occurs. In the present study, we studied {{the impact of the}} LPL on the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> and the characteristics of the lesion, investigated the systemic distribution of the lesion in the mouse, and evaluated the potential of a simple identification method. The incidence of the lesion varied among tumor types, and the lesion was found to be the leading cause of unsuccessful establishment with gastric and colorectal cancer. The lesion consisted of a varying population of proliferating lymphoid cells that expressed CD 20. The cells were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -related antigens, and EBV DNA was detected. There was systemic distribution of the lesion within the NOG mouse, and the most consistent gross finding was splenomegaly. Additionally, identification of LPL-affected cases was possible by detecting splenomegaly in the 1 st and 2 nd generation mice at necropsy. From our findings the lesion was judged to arise from EBV-infected B cells originating from the donor, and monitoring splenomegaly at necropsy was thought effective as a simple method for identifying the lesion at an early stage of the <b>establishment</b> <b>process.</b> Key words: donor tissue, Epstein-Barr virus, lymphoproliferative lesion, NOG mous...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the issues of how {{business}} people perceive the business environment, how government policies impact the environment and how the environment impacts the <b>establishment</b> <b>processes</b> and position development of new firms in the Eritrean market. The process is discussed by keeping a strict focus on the main actors and the activities they carried out, as well as how the available resources are utilized and exchanged in the market. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> model developed from the network approach, case studies based on interviews and focus group discussions have been used to shed light on the extent to how government policies and the environment impacts the <b>establishment</b> <b>processes</b> and position development in the Eritrean market. Findings – An important conclusion of this paper is that the main obstacle for business establishment is the hostile attitude of the government to the private sector. Another significant obstacle for building a successful position in the market is the state-owned command economy network of relationships. An additional crucial hindrance is the non-existence of a market economy network of relationships that can provide firms in the private sector with the resources they need to perform their operations. Research limitations/implications – All firms in this paper have demonstrated that the main obstacle for establishment is the hostile attitude of the government to the private sector. Another obstacle is the state-owned command economy network of relationships, which hinders firms from building a successful position in the market. An additional crucial hindrance is the non-existence of a market economy network of relationships that can provide firms in the private sector with the resources they need to perform their operations. Since the paper is based on case studies and focus group discussions, conducting a similar study on a representative sample of firms selected from a larger population will be very useful. Originality/value – This paper makes a unique contribution by focusing on the <b>establishment</b> <b>process</b> in a market, which is regulated, controlled and owned by the one party government. The other unique contribution is that a firm has to identify the secrets of business success and to follow the same strategy.
