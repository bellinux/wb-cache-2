30|$|The {{miscibility}} and/or solubility of {{the diesel}} samples is tested by mass {{and because of}} the apolar nature of both fluids, dissolution is not a problem. Since there are no functional groups and the molecular structure is similar, there are no chemical reactions between the two products. In certain cases, some problems of stratification and turbidity of the fats could be seen at low temperatures. The conclusion is that for combustion assays using mixtures of animal fats and diesel, it is important to <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> <b>stir</b> the (animal fat-diesel) mixture before it is fed into the burner for subsequent use as fuel.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of temperature, agitation, sludge concentration, and solids retention time (SRT) to obtain readily biodegradable organic matter on primary sludge (PS) fermentation, which would be used as substrate in a biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. Stirring <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> the sludge as well as increasing SRT improved the PS fermentation, producing a large amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD). The influence of each operational parameter on PS hydrolysis was observed clearly. A great performance on SCOD production was obtained when the PS was <b>stirred</b> <b>and</b> <b>heated</b> for 3 days. However, PS concentration did not affect the fermentation. Sludge agitation is a simple process with minimal energy consumption. Warming the sludge is very interesting in those plants with anaerobic digestion, where heat energy is obtained from biogas. Therefore, PS fermentation can be improved with a minimum investment and leveraging existing resources in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Fermenter volume can also be reduced if sludge is being <b>heated</b> <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> during fermentation...|$|R

Textile fibre may be dyed before spinning ("dyed in the wool"), but most textiles are [...] "yarn-dyed" [...] or [...] "piece-dyed" [...] after weaving. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile fibres; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers. Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.|$|R
