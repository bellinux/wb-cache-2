40|$|Cloud-assisted <b>image</b> <b>services</b> {{are widely}} used for various applications. Due to the high {{computational}} complexity of existing image encryption technology, it is extremely challenging to provide privacy preserving <b>image</b> <b>services</b> for resource-constrained smart device. In this paper, we propose a novel encrypressive cloud-assisted image service scheme, called eCIS. The key idea of eCIS is to shift the high computational cost to the cloud allowing reduction in complexity of encoder and decoder on resource-constrained device. This is done via compressive sensing (CS) techniques, compared with existing approaches, {{we are able to}} achieve privacy protection at no additional transmission cost. In particular, we design an encryption matrix by taking care of image compression and encryption simultaneously. Such that, the goal of our design is to minimize the mutual information of original image and encrypted image. In addition to the theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security properties and complexity of our system, we also conduct extensive experiment to evaluate its performance. The experiment results show that eCIS can effectively protect image privacy and meet the user's adaptive secure demand. eCIS reduced the system overheads by up to 4. 1 ×∼ 6. 8 × compared with the existing CS based image processing approach.

Modeling and simulation of the Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) network of Telus Mobility (a commercial service provider) were performed using the OPNET tool. We use trace-driven simulations with genuine traffic trace collected from the CDPD network to evaluate the performance of CDPD protocol. This trace tends to exhibit longrange dependent behavior. Our simulation results indicate that genuine traffic traces, compared to traditional traffic models such as the Poisson model, produce longer queues and, thus, require larger buffers in the deployed network's elements.
