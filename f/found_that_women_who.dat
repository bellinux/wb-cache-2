5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> identify as lesbian or bisexual {{are less likely to}} abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|John Frederick Conway's book, The Canadian Family in Crisis, explores {{effects of}} the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} {{differences between men and}} women faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{study of}} several {{thousand}} men and women, <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> regularly drank cola-based sodas (three or more a day) had significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) of ~4 % in the hip than those who didn't, even though researchers controlled for important factors like calcium and vitamin D intake. The study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> drank non-cola soft drinks didn't appear to have lower BMD and that BMD of women drinking decaffeineted cola wasn't as low as women drinking caffeinated cola sodas. The {{study found that the}} effect of regular consumption of cola sodas was not significant on men's BMD.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{examined}} specific subgroups of Mormon women. A study by Ann Pritt in 1998 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Mormon <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were sexually abused {{were more likely to}} feel distant from God, blame themselves for bad things that happen to them, and be more pessimistic in general compared to Mormon <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were not sexually abused (with both parties having received counseling at some point). Another study by Jacobsen and Wright in 2014 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Mormon <b>women</b> <b>who</b> experience same-sex attraction feel isolation and worthlessness and need to form a positive self-identity.|$|R
50|$|Heidi Posavac, Steven Posavac, and Emil Posavac <b>found</b> <b>that</b> young <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{are already}} content {{with their bodies}} are {{generally}} unaffected by media images of models and other attractive <b>women.</b> They concluded <b>that</b> only those who are dissatisfied with their bodies prior to viewing advertisements will then feel poorly after seeing advertisements featuring thin, attractive women.|$|R
25|$|In Italy, a 2006 National Statistic Institute {{survey on}} sexual {{violence}} against <b>women</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 91.6% of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> suffered {{this did not}} report it to the police.|$|R
25|$|In a {{study of}} 488 college {{students}} regarding ambivalent sexism towards men, researchers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not identify as feminists {{were more likely to}} be hostile towards men than self-identified feminists, but also more likely to hold benevolent views towards men.|$|E
25|$|New {{research}} has <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> smoke are at significantly {{increased risk of}} developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm, {{a condition in which}} a weak area of the abdominal aorta expands or bulges, and is {{the most common form of}} aortic aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{studies have}} <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{have had a}} {{hysterectomy}} are at {{more than double the}} risk of developing RCC than those who have not. Moderate alcohol consumption, on the other hand, has been shown to have a protective effect. The reason for this remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Another study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{pregnant}} <b>women</b> <b>who</b> consumed 340grams of low-mercury containing {{fish with}} fatty acids per week have benefits that outweigh the risks for mercury poisoning. They {{were less likely}} to have children with low verbal IQ, motor coordination and behavioral problems. However, foods containing high amounts of mercury, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, might cause mental retardation.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a study {{conducted}} for the Women's Health Initiative in the US <b>found</b> <b>that</b> postmenopausal <b>women</b> <b>who</b> consumed 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D per day for seven years had a 17% higher risk of developing kidney stones than subjects taking a placebo. The Nurses' Health Study also showed an association between supplemental calcium intake and kidney stone formation.|$|R
40|$|On October 24, 2000, the Rosie the Riveter World War II/Home Front National Historical Park was {{established}} in Richmond, CA to commemorate in a substantial way the wartime women workers in the shipyards. A review of the 1942 â€“ 1945 published case reports from the medical records of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> worked in the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> helped build ships for the war effort suffered {{many of the same}} medical problems as the men with whom they worked...|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{research}} looking into attachment style and mate guarding resistance too. It has been <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> show more avoidant attachment styles {{are more likely to}} resist their partners mate guarding attempts. They are most likely to use avoiding public displays of affection, covert tactics and resisting a partners control as resistance strategies. Those who express anxious attachment styles are more likely to resist mate guarding via covert methods.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study by}} the California Department of Public Health <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> lived near farm fields sprayed with {{endosulfan}} and the related organochloride pesticide dicofol during the first eight weeks of pregnancy are several {{times more likely to}} give birth to children with autism. This is the first study to look for an association between endosulfan and autism, and additional study is needed to confirm the connection. A 2009 assessment concluded that epidemiology and rodent studies that suggest male reproductive and autism effects are open to other interpretations, and that developmental or reproductive toxicity in rats occurs only at endosulfan doses that cause neurotoxicity.|$|E
500|$|A 2012 study {{conducted}} by Kimuna, {{using data from the}} 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey III, found that domestic violence rates vary across numerous sociological, geographical and economic measures. [...] The study found that the poorest women faired worst among middle and high-income women. [...] Researchers believe that the reason for higher rates of domestic violence come from greater familial pressures resulting from poverty. Additionally the study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were part of the labour force faced greater domestic violence. According to the researchers, working women may be upsetting the patriarchal power system within Indian households.|$|E
5000|$|Women of a Certain Age (1979), {{looks at}} middle age from a woman's {{perspective}} and relies interviews from 160 different {{women for the}} narrative. Rubin <b>found</b> <b>that</b> many <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had lived {{the first half of}} their lives as dependents on their husband's income often had difficultly transitioning and becoming more independent. The book helps dispel some stereotypes about middle age, like the idea that middle-aged people have less interest in sex, and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> experience an [...] "empty nest syndrome" [...] when their children leave home.|$|R
5000|$|The Girls Gone Wild (GGW) team tours {{locations}} {{where there are}} numerous {{young people who are}} likely to be drinking large quantities of alcohol - spring break destinations, sports bars, Mardi Gras, and [...] "hard-partying colleges" [...] - filming young <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are willing to expose their bodies on camera. Levy <b>found</b> <b>that</b> many <b>women</b> <b>who</b> appeared on GGW were eager to display their bodies for a GGW hat or T-shirt, while others did not immediately comply with the cajoling of peers or the crew, but eventually relented.|$|R
50|$|A 2010 study {{published}} in the European medical journal Human Reproduction examined the prevalence of congenital cryptorchidism among offspring whose mothers had taken mild analgesics, primarily over-the-counter pain medications including ibuprofen (e.g. Advil) and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Combining the results from a survey of pregnant women prior to their due date in correlation with the health of their children and an ex vivo rat model, the study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had been exposed to mild analgesics had a higher prevalence of baby boys born with congenital cryptorchidism.|$|R
2500|$|Locus {{of control}} {{has also been}} applied {{to the field of}} {{consumer}} research. For example, Martin, Veer and Pervan (2007) examined how the weight locus of control of women (i.e., beliefs about the control of body weight) influence how they react to female models in advertising of different body shapes. They <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> believe they can control their weight ("internals"), respond most favorably to slim models in advertising, and this favorable response is mediated by self-referencing. In contrast, women who feel powerless about their weight ("externals"), self-reference larger-sized models, but ...|$|E

5000|$|When Gilligan asked women, [...] "How {{would you}} {{describe}} yourself?" [...] she <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> define <b>who</b> they are by describing relationships. Men defined themselves by separation, {{or the use of}} [...] "I" [...] statements. She also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> men think in more violent terms than women. Gilligan compares these results to childhood fairytales. Where men fantasize about slaying dragons, women fantasize about a relationship. [...] "Justice is ultimate moral maturity for adolescents (usually male) who see themselves as autonomous. Care is the ultimate responsibility of adolescents (usually female) who see themselves as linked to others." ...|$|R

50|$|Female {{derogation}} {{is a form}} {{of indirect}} aggression where females attempt to reduce the perceived value of another female 'rival'. Fisher (2004) studied female derogation and the effects of estrogen levels on this form of competition. Females disclosed their ovulation status and rated the attractiveness of male and female faces. Competitor derogation (giving low ratings) towards same-sex rivals occurred frequently when women were at their most fertile stages. In contrast, women gave same-sex rivals higher ratings during the least fertile stages of their ovulation. This indirect form of competition appears exclusive toward females as findings also showed <b>that</b> <b>women,</b> irrespective of ovulation status (high or low), showed no difference in the rating of male faces. Supporting research has also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> younger <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are considered as having high fertility, gossip about other women more than older <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> are no longer at their most fertile stage.|$|R
