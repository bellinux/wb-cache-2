5|$|Also of {{historical}} importance were the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms {{to the south}} of the Kongo Empire, in the Ambundu area. Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these cleavages and <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> emergence of new and distinct social identities.|$|E
5|$|Riley's chief legacy was his {{influence}} in <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of a}} midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. Along with other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.|$|E

5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{household}} {{included many}} young men of ability, including his successor Thomas Becket. Theobald {{was instrumental in the}} early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E

From the outset, performers have comprised a mixture of British and Commonwealth singers and international guest stars, but <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> careers of singers from within {{the company was}} a consistent policy of the early years. Among the many guest performers have been Maria Callas, Plácido Domingo, Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson, Luciano Pavarotti and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Among those who have risen to international prominence {{from the ranks of}} the company are Geraint Evans, Joan Sutherland, Kiri Te Kanawa and Jon Vickers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better understand, from a foster parent perspective, how the {{integration}} process of <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child is carried out in <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> family. <b>The</b> purpose is to identify the challenges and success factors in the process. The study is based on a qualitative method. The data consist of interviews with six <b>foster</b> families. <b>The</b> study’s theoretical framework is mostly based on system theory and also on the theory of ambivalence. The results show that most of our families considered five factors to be important in order to facilitate the integration process. <b>The</b> <b>foster</b> family needs to bond with <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child, let <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child in into the family system, open up and be who they really are, respect each other and reserve time to be able to satisfy <b>the</b> needs of <b>foster</b> child. <b>The</b> results emphasize that <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> parents should treat <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child in <b>the</b> same way as the biological child.   We have also been able to identify factors that may have an impact on integration, like the age of <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child. Our results suggest that foster parents experience different varieties of ambivalence to both <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child and <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> child's biological parents. Those children who have a poor relationship with their biological parents and are of relatively young age tend to be over-integrated in <b>the</b> <b>foster</b> family...|$|R
5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative {{for the office of}} public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for <b>fostering</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of new writers without worrying about maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of}} the female professional writer, a role that began opening to women only at the end of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to demonstrate that they could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called for an end to the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E
