5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

50|$|The Mandaloceratidae {{are derived}} from the Reudemannoceratidae through Madiganella. The {{earliest}} mandeloceratid is Pseudogomphoceras which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to Ovocerina.

5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> {{to their}} corresponding phenotypes when paired {{with any other}} allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald.

Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E

About 40–70% of people born with a MEN1 mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently mutated include DAXX, mTOR and ATRX.|$|E

50|$|According to Donovan et al (1981) the Stephanoceratidae and Otoitdae {{both have}} their {{origin in the}} Hildoceratoidea, in the Phymatoceratidae. The Otoitidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Sphaeroceratidae which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Cardioceraticae, the Stephanoceratidae to the Kosmoceratidae, all within the Stephanoceratoidea.

50|$|The Phylloceratina is {{the ancestral}} stock, {{derived from the}} Ceratitida {{near the end of}} the Triassic.

50|$|This {{differs from}} the older {{phylogeny}} of the Treatise Part L the Stephanoceratoidea {{are thought to be}} derived from the Hammatoceratidae (Hildocerataceae) through the ancestral family, the Otoitidae which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> in the early MIddle Jurassic to the Stephanoceratidae and Sphaeroceratidae, forming two main lineages. The Stephanoceratidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Thamboceratidae which in turn <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Clydoniceratidae. The Sphaeroceratidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> to the Tulitidae which is the source for both the Macrocephalitidae and the Pachyceratidae. The Pachyceratidae lead to the Mayitidae, the Macrocephalitidae both the Kosmoceratidae and Cardioceratidae.|$|R
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals.
