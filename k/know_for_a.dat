500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that you wrote [...] But there's nothing I can do about it. That's all I can say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E

Tim Byron, writer for The Vine, [...] "'Grenade' is about the feeling of [...] ". The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she is bad for him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have her the way he wants, but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her." [...] As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: [...] "'Grenade' represents the OTHER side of love– where you're in love with a woman and you <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that she doesn't love you the way you love HER." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley was {{a central}} figure in the {{development}} of rockabilly, according to music historians. Katherine Charlton even calls him [...] "rockabilly's originator", though Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that [...] " [...] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly." [...] and, according to Michael Campbell, [...] "Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit." [...] "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. [...] "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old." [...] However, [...] "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as [...] "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": [...] "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [...] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [...] country". In [...] "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, [...] "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion." ...|$|E

500|$|Certain {{elements}} of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he {{was familiar with the}} Japanese original. However, The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: [...] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that [...] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time." [...] He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is [...] "not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas." [...] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, [...] "we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!" ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you <b>know,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Asmussen {{estimated}} overall game {{length to}} be 10 to 20 hours, [...] "depending on how good of a gamer you are." [...] Santa Monica studio director John Hight reassured players that God of War III lasts longer than 10 hours: [...] "We've {{done a lot}} of play testing on it... We <b>know,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> really hardcore player, it'll take them longer than it took them to play either of the previous God of War games." [...] The finished game script was about 120 pages long, and the number of onscreen enemies increased from 15 in the previous games to a maximum of 50. To light the game, Turtle by Illuminate Labs was used. Head of development Christer Ericson of SCE Santa Monica Studio confirmed that God of War III has seamless loading; no loading screens and no hard disk drive installation requirement. SCE America animator Bruno Velazquez said that while the first two God of War titles had computer-generated imagery (CGI) cinematics, there would be no true CGI in the third game: [...] "all the cutscenes are created using our in-game engine." [...] A God of War III game trailer debuted on Spike's GameTrailers TV on February 11, 2010, and Asmussen confirmed that all footage is of gameplay. New camera angles were added; during some major battles the player can still control Kratos while the camera pans away from the fight, and a first-person camera view was used for the final portion of the Poseidon and Zeus boss fights. According to Sony Santa Monica director of technology Tim Moss, God of War III used 35 gigabytes (GB) of Blu-ray Disc. God of War IIIs budget was $44million USD, and the game had a staff of 132 {{at the end of its}} development.|$|E

[...] Lythgoe also questioned why it took two years for Clark to reveal his alleged affair with Abdul, fueling speculation that Clark was merely attempting to gain publicity for his upcoming album.|$|E

I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway.

The producers replied, [...] "Whatever we have done is legal, so the claim is false {{and so are the}} charges. This is an absolutely new film and there is no question of a delay in releasing Don 2." [...] Khan added in an interview with Mumbai Mirror, [...] "While my producers are best qualified to give a fitting reply to the whole matter, I as a lead actor can say that as for the sequel, the Amitabh Bachchan Don never had a sequel. So where is the question of us copying anything. Farhan and his team have worked on the script, I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that we haven't copied from anywhere and this is an original script." [...] On 19 December, a week before Don 2s release, the Bombay High Court refused to stay the film's release. The court's ruling considered the film's scheduled release on 21 December overseas and 23 December in India, for which many theatres had been booked.|$|E
2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department. Inman developed a characteristic limp-wristed mincing walk, and a high-pitched catchphrase, [...] "I'm free!", which soon entered popular culture. Inman reported that four or {{five members of the}} group Campaign for Homosexual Equality picketed one of his shows in protest as they believed his persona did not help their cause. Inman said that [...] "they thought I was over exaggerating the gay character. But I don't think I do. In fact there are people far more camp than Mr. Humphries walking around this country. Anyway, I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that an enormous number of viewers like Mr. Humphries and don't really care whether he's camp or not. So far from doing harm to the homosexual image, I feel I might be doing some good". Both Inman and David Croft stated that the character was [...] "just a mother's boy", and that his sexual orientation was never explicitly stated. Inman continued to play in live shows after his success as Mr. Humphries, and began to incorporate camp mannerisms to those performances too, once saying [...] "Even when I'm not playing Mr Humphries, say at a summer season, I camp it up a bit.

In Glamorama, now an [...] "A-list model, would-be-actor and current [...] "It boy", [...] "an uberstereotype of the male model", Victor lives by his catchphrase mantra [...] "the better you look, the more you see".

[...] Uncharacteristic for an Ellis protagonist, as the Crimson notes, Victor is [...] "terrified by" [...] the [...] "coldbloodedness" [...] he encounters when he becomes embroiled in international terrorism.
