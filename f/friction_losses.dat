25|$|Large brushes are desired for {{a larger}} brush contact area to {{maximize}} motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize {{the speed at which}} the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs {{can also be used to}} make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.|$|E
25|$|This {{construction}} permits free {{expansion and}} contraction of each plate individually under the varying influence {{of heat and}} centrifugal force and possesses {{a number of other}} advantages which are of considerable practical importance. A larger active plate area and consequently more power is obtained for a given width, improving efficiency. Warping is virtually eliminated and smaller side clearances may be used, which results in diminished leakage and <b>friction</b> <b>losses.</b> The rotor is better adapted for dynamic balancing and through rubbing friction resists disturbing influences thereby ensuring quieter running. For this reason and also because the discs are not rigidly joined it is protected against damage which might otherwise be caused by vibration or excessive speed.|$|E

25|$|Mazda had {{improved}} the fuel {{efficiency of the}} thermal reactor system by 40% when the RX-7 was introduced in 1978. However, Mazda eventually shifted to the catalytic converter system. According to the Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of unburned hydrocarbon in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures producing less hydrocarbon. Curtiss-Wright showed also that the rotor can be widened, keeping the rest of engine's architecture unchanged, thus reducing <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> and increasing displacement and power output. The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds. Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds, and leakage at low speeds.|$|E

It was in this decade that the company began to install flat belt drive systems for the transfer of power from its stationary steam engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. This technique was common in the US but rare in Britain until this time: the advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, {{and it was a}} more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.|$|E

A single bored tunnel feasible by TBM machine has the double-deck road tunnel and stormwater bypass underneath. In the multi-functional tunnel, the shape of the stormwater bypass is usually not circular. Therefore, the <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> in the non-circular pipe should be evaluated for the accurate design. In this study, hydraulic experiment was set and the <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients were evaluated using 6 different Reynolds numbers. As the result, the difference between measured and computed <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients become substantial when the Reynolds number is decreased less than 2, 000 for the laminar flow.
