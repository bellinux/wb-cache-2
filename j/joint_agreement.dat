25|$|Davis' appointees in {{the second}} term {{included}} outgoing State Representative Claude Kirkpatrick of Jennings, the seat of Jefferson Davis Parish, who was named to succeed Lorris M.

40|$|BackgroundTo {{increase}} {{levels of}} physical activity (PA), interventions that create or enhance access to places for PA are recommended. Establishing a <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement</b> {{is one way to}} increase access to existing PA and recreational facilities. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present a case study of In-Motion, a pilot <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement</b> project at one urban high school in Honolulu, Hawaii. ContextResidents of urban Honolulu are underserved by the amount of parkland and recreational facilities available for their use. The Honolulu County Department of Parks and Recreation sought to implement a <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement</b> to use the facilities of one urban high school for a recreational program. The high school selected for the pilot project has a student population primarily from low-income and ethnic minority backgrounds. MethodsAn assessment of the potential of 7 urban high schools to implement a <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement</b> was conducted to select the pilot site. In-Motion developed and implemented a <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement.</b> PA preferences of students, staff, and community members were assessed to guide recreational program offerings. Various recreational classes were offered free to the school community. ConsequencesSeveral barriers to implementing the <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement</b> and recreational program were encountered. However, participants were satisfied with the recreational classes they attended and said that the In-Motion program helped them to engage in more PA. Program awareness by high school students and staff was high. InterpretationIn-Motion has successfully modeled a pilot <b>joint</b> use <b>agreement</b> and provided new opportunities for PA to the high school’s students, teachers, and staff, and to community residents...|$|R

The route travels west-northwest, then turns to the west for another [...] before approaching Oasis, the only community that the route passes through. At Oasis, SR 266 intersects SR 168, which serves as the gateway into the Owens Valley from Nevada. Upon leaving Oasis, SR 266 continues to the west briefly, then turns north-northwest. Within the last , SR 266 slowly curves northwest as the route approaches the Nevada state line. The route ends at the state line at the southern terminus of Nevada State Route 264.

500|$|Porphyrogenitus {{said the}} tribes did not [...] "obey their own {{particular}} , but [...] a <b>joint</b> <b>agreement</b> to fight together with all earnestness and [...] wheresoever war breaks out", suggesting the tribal chiefs were military rather than political leaders. According to Kristó, the emperor's report also shows the tribal confederation {{was not a}} [...] "solid political formation with strong cohesion" [...] in the early 9th century. The Gesta Hungarorum referred to the seven Magyar chiefs as [...] "Hetumoger", [...] or [...] "Seven Magyars". Similar ethnonymsincluding Toquz Oghuz ("Nine Oghuzes") and Onogur ("Ten Ogurs")suggest the Gesta preserved {{the name of the}} confederation of the Magyar tribes. According to Porphyrogenitus, Levedia was named after Levedi, one of the Magyar voivodes. During Levedi's life, the Kangars, a distinct group within the Pechenegs' tribal confederation whom the Khazars had expelled from their homeland, invaded Levedia and forced the Magyars to cede the territory. A Magyar group fled across the Caucasus Mountains as far as Persia. However, the masses departed for the West and settled in a region called Etelköz. Most historians agree the Magyars' forced exodus from Levedia occurred around 850.|$|E
500|$|By June 1943, it {{was clear}} to the USCG that the {{recruiting}} process in place did not favor the SPARS, so it withdrew from the <b>joint</b> <b>agreement</b> effective 1 July 1943. Hence, all women applicants for SPARS would be interviewed and enlisted at USCG district recruiting stations. The change was met with increased enthusiasm by the recruiters and it proved positive overall. Still, the competition remained keen with the other, better known, women services. Some recruiters referred to themselves as peddlers of patriotism, but their lot was not an easy one. In their book, Three Years Behind the Mast, the authors Mary Lyne and Kay Arthur, both officers in SPARS, described the realities of recruiting in this way: During the day, we made speeches distributed posters, decorated windows, led parades, manned information booths, interviewed applicants, appeared on radio programs, and gave aptitude tests. By night, we made more speeches; prayed women would be drafted, and went to bed dreaming about our quotas. [...] The main recruiting effort had ended. During the 25-month recruitment period, about 11,000 women signed enlistment contracts to serve in the SPARS. Yeoman Third Class Dorothy Tuttle was the first woman to enlist in the SPARS at a recruiting station on 7 December 1942.|$|E
