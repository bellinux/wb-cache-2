500|$|For {{around a}} decade, Marmarosa {{was much less}} active as a musician. Shaw and DeFranco raised the idea of {{psychiatric}} treatment, but the former was rebuffed by Marmarosa himself, and the latter by the pianist's parents: [...] "They were not reconciled to his needing professional help. They were from the old school, they {{saw it as a}} stigma. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> big argument about it with his father. He really blew up." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} public demonstrations were planned in Australia {{to assist in}} fund-raising, {{the first of which}} was {{scheduled}} for 5 October 1911 at the Cheltenham Racecourse in Adelaide. During a test flight the day before, excessive pressure in the fuel tank caused it to rupture, almost blinding Watkins. That problem resolved, Watkins took Frank Wild, whom Mawson had hired to command a support base during the expedition, on another test flight the morning of the demonstration. In Watkins' account, which he addressed to Vickers' Aviation Department, he wrote: [...] " [...] about 200 ft. up. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fierce tremor, and then into an air pocket, and was brought down about 100 ft., got straight, and dropped into another, almost a vacuum. That finished it. We hit the ground with an awful crash, both wings damaged, one cylinder broken, and the Nose bent up, the tail in half, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights to produce an English-language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer. On remakes, {{director}} Bayona noted that [...] "The Americans have {{all the money in}} the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money" [...] and [...] "The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits". On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E

500|$|The Times {{gave the}} game four stars {{out of five}} {{and said it was}} [...] "more for 24 fans, who will {{instantly}} love it — so long as they don’t mind another TV addiction to feed." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, [...] "Newcomers to the trials and tribulations of Jack Bauer are unlikely to be impressed by this game's generic shooting and driving action. But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me. And the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meldrum {{moved around}} during {{childhood}} {{and grew up}} largely {{with one of his}} grandmothers in Quambatook where he attended the local primary school alongside future country music artist, John Williamson. He also stayed with a number of aunts and was raised in the traditions of the Church of England. He developed a musical interest in Gilbert & Sullivan and Verdi. Meldrum's father later ran a hardware store in Kyabram. His mother had periodic hospitalisations for mental illness including some years at Larundel Mental Asylum, Bundoora in the mid-1960s. In the early 1960s Meldrum arrived in Melbourne where he briefly attended Taylors College. Initially intending to become a disc jockey he studied at a radio school. He would go to University of Melbourne – without formally enrolling – carrying law books, to eat lunch with the law students: [...] "I hung around, I wouldn't even say <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> course." ...|$|E

From late 2009 Littlemore worked in Montreal, Canada with the Cirque Du Soleil as a composer and musical {{director for the}} touring arena show, Zarkana, which debuted on 29 June 2011 in New York. Pnau's fourth album, Soft Universe, was recorded in London. Upon its release Mayes confirmed Littlemore and Steele were working on a second Empire of the Sun album. Littlemore expanded, [...] "We just started writing {{two or three weeks}} ago in New York ... Luke and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> studio, which was run by blind people – it was great. It's good to be in weird places with Luke, we enjoy that. He has an extraordinary mind – it's sounding so good". As from July 2011, when not touring or performing, he lives in LA. During late 2011 Pnau toured through Australia promoting their album.|$|E

60|$|I {{received}} your revised proofs only yesterday, and I {{sat down}} to read them last night.

60|$|I recommenced my wanderings; but I {{remember}} {{nothing else}} particularly {{claiming to be}} mentioned, unless it be Paternoster Row,--a little, narrow, darksome lane, in which, it being now dusk in that density of the city, I could not very well see what signs were over the doors.

By eleven, sometimes a few minutes earlier or later, my thousand words were finished. Another half-hour at cleaning up my desk, and my day's work was done, so that at eleven-thirty <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hammock under the trees with my mail-bag and the morning newspaper. At twelve-thirty I ate dinner and in the afternoon I swam and rode.|$|E

[...] "Would I be so good, if <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> difficulty anywhere, as to take it easy, and catch hold of him tight?"--"Yes, very tight!" [...] With these answers the guide appeared to be satisfied. He gave his hat a smart knock with one hand, to fix it on his head; and pointing upwards with the other, said, [...] "We'll try that rock first, to look into the gulls' nests, and get some wild asparagus."
