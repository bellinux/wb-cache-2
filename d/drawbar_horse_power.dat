For example, a Class 5 cost £16,000, compared to £78,100 for a 1,600 h. p. diesel, £138,700 for a gas turbine, or £37,400 for electric.

5000|$|Although A4s were {{primarily}} designed for high speed express work {{they were also}} capable of high power outputs. In 1940 4901 Capercaillie exerted 2200 <b>drawbar</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> on the straight and level track north of York when hauling 21 coaches (730 tons gross) {{at an average of}} 75.9 mph for 25 miles.The highest recorded power output from an A4 was 2450 drawbar horsepower when Mallard herself was hauling 11 coaches (390 tons tare, 415 tons gross) up Stoke Bank at a sustained 80 mph in 1963. O.S. Nock thought this performance superior to Mallard's world record run in 1938. An A4 with the same load on a [...] "good run" [...] would be doing about 50 to 60 mph at the summit of Stoke Bank. On a run on 8 September 1961 Mallard had its train travelling at 78 mph.To put all this in perspective the highest possible drawbar horsepower from a Class 40 diesel (a class which was supposed to replace the A4s,) was 1450, though they could achieve this figure over long distances and with no effort from the crew.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives. A high performance sandrail Volkswagen engine can produce well into the 170-200+ <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> range and as high as 700 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> with methanol fuel.|$|R
