25|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{have seen}} as I did the passionate {{enthusiasm of the}} whole town of Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia, at the news of your triumphal march across the {{possession}} of the mad king of Naples, you would have said as I did {{that there is no}} longer space or frontiers.|$|E
25|$|I {{have often}} {{sat back and}} thought just how nice it would be <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I {{have tried to do}} this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E

6000|$|Luka {{shook his}} head. [...] "You might drive it down {{five or six}} feet, but you would never get {{it down to the}} roof, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never pull it up again." ...|$|R
25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not tell {{they were looking at}} you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

[...] "It is dreadful to hear {{so much of}} it. <b>If</b> <b>thee</b> <b>could</b> {{only have}} carried away with thee one of thy diamonds, thee might have cracked it up into little pieces, and thee might have sold these, one at a time, without suspicion." ...|$|R

500|$|On December 13, 2013, it was {{announced}} on her official TeamAyu site that Hamasaki had become engaged to an American medical student 10 years her junior, whom she had been with since the spring of that year, adding: [...] "As my partner is an ordinary student, I would be very happy <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> watch over us quietly." ...|$|E
500|$|National Review writer Mark Hemingway lauded the film's {{celebration of}} liberty. [...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I {{have yet to}} see it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take one day and do absolutely anything, piling into a convertible with your best girl and your best friend and taking in a baseball game, an art museum, and a fine meal seems about as good as it gets," [...] wrote Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|The film asks, [...] "what <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> live forever" [...] and depicts one man's {{journey to}} {{overcome}} death. Related to this path, Darren Aronofsky described {{the core of}} the film as [...] "a very simple love story" [...] about {{a man and a woman}} in love, with the woman's life cut short. The director researched people who were dying young, and learned from doctors and caregivers that such patients find new ways of coping. Aronofsky observed that the patients often die more alone because their families cannot recognize what happens with them, calling it [...] "an incredible tragedy": ...|$|E

There is not much {{consolation}} in <b>Ifs.</b> <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not be better off than you are unless <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be Marian Lind again. Think of all the women who would give their souls to have a husband who would neither drink, nor swear at them, nor kick them, nor sulk whenever he was kept waiting half a minute for anything. You have no little pests of children----" ...|$|R

500|$|According to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] {{is about}} [...] "all the rings of {{communication}} around the world. All the rings of pollution, {{and all the}} radioactivity that goes around. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> visualize {{all the things we}} don't see, Earth could look like some kind of fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head– surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|Shira is {{frequently}} shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron {{did not know}} how to play. She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Betty White would guest star on the show playing herself. After winning his second Emmy Award as Jack Donaghy at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in that same month, Alec Baldwin revealed that White was the cast's first choice to make a guest appearance. [...] "We all put names in a hat, and we took a vote– <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have one guest star for the whole season, who would it be? And Betty White was the winner." [...] Television host Jimmy Fallon played himself in [...] "Stone Mountain". The character Rick Wayne, a ventriloquist, was played by real-life ventriloquist Jeff Dunham. Actor Blaine Horton, who reprised his role as Sasha, a gay friend of Jenna Maroney's, first appeared as the character in [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] that was broadcast during the show's second season.|$|E

500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve gave you the opportunities to do things that would really be memorable, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|Gray {{wanted the}} film to be as {{realistic}} as possible; accordingly, the actors did most of their own stunts, and computer-generated imagery was used very sparingly. The second unit, under director Alexander Witt and cinematographer Josh Bleibtreu, filmed establishing shots, the Venice canal chase sequence, and the Los Angeles chase sequence {{over a period of}} 40 days. Filming on location posed some challenges. The opening heist sequence in Venice, Italy, was strictly monitored by the local authorities, due to the high speeds the boats were driven at. The frigid temperatures at Passo Fedaia in the Italian Alps created problems during production: [...] "The guns would jam, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> imagine not being able to walk 40 feet with a bottle of water without it freezing, those are the conditions we had to work in," [...] Gray remarked. Pedestrians had to be allowed to use the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard between takes. Also, scenes which took place on freeways and city streets were only filmed on weekends.|$|E
500|$|... "Walkabout" [...] {{comprises}} {{a significant}} chapter in Losts history, persuading viewers of the series' ability {{to exist in}} the long term. Viewers learned that the series would be full of surprises and mysteries, and Lindelof even considered it [...] "a litmus test" [...] for viewers, particularly regarding how after a twist like Locke's past, [...] "the show isn't going to openly state what the implications of that are." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered [...] "Walkabout" [...] to be the best episode of Season 1. IGN ranked [...] "Walkabout" [...] as the fifth best Lost episode ever, behind [...] "The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham", the Pilot, [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and [...] "The Constant". The episode was also featured in similar lists by the Los Angeles Times, TV Guide, National Post, and ABC2. Jason Snell of The Incomparable thought similarly, saying [...] "Skippable? Are you kidding? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> watch only one first-season episode of “Lost,” this might be it." ...|$|E

500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} Radiohead met while {{attending}} Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood {{were in the}} same year, guitarist Ed O'Brien and drummer Phil Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became the lead guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their respective instruments because they wanted to play music together, rather than through an interest in the particular instrument: [...] "It was more of a collective angle, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool." [...] At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.|$|E
500|$|The writer David Kimbell {{states that}} in Luisa Miller and Stiffelio (the {{earliest}} operas of this period) {{there appears to}} be a [...] "growing freedom in the large scale structure...and an acute attention to fine detail." [...] Others echo those feelings. Julian Budden expresses the impact of Rigoletto and its place in Verdi's output as follows: [...] "Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with Rigoletto. The so-called ottocento in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit." [...] One example of Verdi's wish to move away from [...] "standard forms" [...] appears in his feelings about the structure of Il trovatore. To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms—"cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. ... and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> avoid beginning with an opening chorus....", he would be quite happy.|$|E
