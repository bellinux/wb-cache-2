40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study the direct product <b>decompositions</b> <b>of</b> closure {{operations}} and lattices of closed sets. We characterize the direct product <b>decompositions</b> <b>of</b> lattices of closed sets {{in terms of}} closure operations, and find those <b>decompositions</b> <b>of</b> lattices which correspond to the <b>decompositions</b> <b>of</b> closures. If a closure on a finite set is represented by its implication base (i. e. a binary relation on the powerset), we construct a polynomial algorithm to find its direct product decompositions. The main characterization theorem is also applied to define direct product <b>decompositions</b> <b>of</b> relational database schemes {{and to find out}} what properties of relational databases and schemes are preserved under the decompositions...|$|R

Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier.

5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf litter in a region. The leaf litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> the leaf litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi.
