5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

Rivers have also been temporarily closed to fishing to avoid anglers spreading the snails.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson's ground sloth has {{a special}} place in modern paleontology, for Thomas Jefferson's letter on Megalonyx, read before the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia in August 1796, marked the {{beginning}} of vertebrate paleontology in North America. When Lewis and Clark set out, Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for ground sloths. He was hoping they would find some living in the Western range. Megalonyx jeffersonii was appropriately named after Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Empedocles {{postulated}} that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> of the four elements and that she lit {{the fire in the}} eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.|$|E

25|$|On May 10, 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy can {{be fitted}} with a new {{collision}} avoidance feature, called EyeSight. It consists of twin CCD cameras, {{one on each side}} of the rear view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a driver alert warning for various safety situations, and even keeps an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|E

25|$|The four {{survivors}} were bitterly grieved by the loss, {{for they}} had grown into a band of brothers, and they swore to keep a sharp <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for the Albatroses of Richthofen's squadron which had brought down Nash. At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware at the moment that he was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who knew every trick, had met.|$|E
25|$|As Robert E. Lee {{moved his}} Army of Northern Virginia northward in June 1863 through the Shenandoah Valley towards Pennsylvania, {{portions}} of his cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart slipped eastward across {{the path of}} the Union Army of the Potomac. A series of raids in eastern Maryland netted prisoners and supplies, as well as disrupting Federal communications and telegraph lines. However, Stuart was not in position to effectively screen Lee's advance or to provide intelligence on the movements of the Federal army. As Stuart headed north in an effort to link with Lee, Union cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, riding towards Pennsylvania to the west of Stuart, ordered his divisions to fan out across a wide swath, keeping an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for Confederates.|$|E

During the November 26 episode of World Championship Wrestling, which was under strict {{instructions}} from TBS television executives prohibiting blading, the Road Warriors attacked Rhodes, removed a spike from their shoulder pads, and attempted to gouge his <b>eye</b> <b>out.</b> Rhodes was fired for that episode shortly after Starrcade '88. Before Rhodes was fired, Animal beat him at the Clash of the Champions, so the Road Warriors were allowed to pick a new partner to hold the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team titles; they picked AJPW superstar Genichiro Tenryu but the titles were quickly abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the success of bicanalicular lacrimal intubation as a primary treatment in cases of epiphora caused by congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children up to 6 years of age. Patients and methods A prospective surgical intervention case series study was carried out in the Ophthalmology Department of Minia University Hospital. Forty-six eyes of 43 children with epiphora (dated since birth or shortly after) were enroled in this study. A bicanalicular lacrimal silicon tube was introduced through the nasolacrimal duct to the nose. Results In this study, the primary lacrimal intubation was successful in 40 <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> of 46 <b>eyes</b> (87 %). For children aged 1 – 2 years, primary intubation was successful in 22 <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> of 24 (91. 6 %), and for those aged 2 – 4 years it was successful in 12 <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> of 14 (85. 7 %). On the other hand, for children aged between 4 and 6 years, the procedure was less successful: six <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> of eight (75 %). Improvement of symptoms occurred in two <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> of four (50 %) when the tubes were removed early, and this rate increased to 90. 9 % in 20 <b>out</b> of 22 <b>eyes</b> when the tubes were retained for up to 3 – 6 months and to 90 % in 18 <b>out</b> of 20 <b>eyes</b> when the tubes were retained for up to 6 – 12 months. Conclusion Bicanalicular lacrimal intubation is a successful treatment for children with nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and the younger the age of the children the higher the success rate...|$|R

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} plate, {{the scene is}} Thavies Inn Gate (sometimes {{ironically}} written as Thieves Inn Gate), one of the Inns of Chancery which housed associations of lawyers in London. Tom Nero has grown up and become a hackney coachman, and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a man at work. Tom's horse, worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading, has collapsed, breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage. Disregarding the animal's pain, Tom has beaten it so furiously that he has put its <b>eye</b> <b>out.</b> In a satirical aside, Hogarth shows four corpulent barristers struggling {{to climb out of}} the carriage in a ludicrous state. They are probably caricatures of eminent jurists, but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects' names, and they have not been identified. Elsewhere in the scene, other acts of cruelty against animals take place: a drover beats a lamb to death, an ass is driven on by force despite being overloaded, and an enraged bull tosses one of its tormentors. Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print: ...|$|E

Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film [...] "treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the [...] "chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility." [...] In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, [...] "It is [...] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion." [...] Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden.|$|E
