5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to find sites, one example can be through surveys. Surveys involve walking around {{analyzing}} the land looking for artifacts. It can also involve digging, according to the Archaeological Institute of America, “archaeologists actively search areas that were likely to support human populations, or in places where old documents and records indicate people once lived.” This helps archaeologists in the future. In case there was no time, or money during the finding of the site, archaeologists can come back and visit the site for further digging to find out the extent of the site. Archaeologist can also sample randomly within a given area of land as another form of conducting surveys. Surveys are very useful, according to Jess Beck, “it can tell you where people were living at different points in the past.” Geophysics is a branch of survey becoming more and more popular in archaeology, because it uses different types of instruments to investigate features below the ground surface. It is not as reliable, because although they can see what is under the surface of the ground it does not produce the best picture. Archaeologists have to still dig up the area in order to uncover the truth. There are also two most common types of geophysical survey, which is, magnetometer and ground penetrating radar. Magnetometry is the technique of measuring and mapping patterns of magnetism in the soil. It uses an instrument called a magnetometer which is required to measure and map traces of soil magnetism. The ground penetrating radar is a method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It uses <b>electro</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> in the microwave band of the radio spectrum, and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures.|$|E

40|$|In this study, it was {{experimentally}} proved, for {{the first}} time, {{that it is possible}} to predict the frequency of electromagnetic radiation that can modulate activity of proteins and more specifically activity of enzymes. The prediction was obtained using the computational model so called the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM). The model was tested here experimentally using the reaction catalysed with the enzyme l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The RRM model was applied to the group of the enzymes belonging to the sub-subclass EC 1. 1. 1. 27 i. e. l-lactate dehydrogenase. The wavelengths of the <b>electro</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> calculated by the RRM and proposed to alternate activity of l-lactate dehydrogenate were identified at = 620 25 nm and = 840 25 nm. Enzyme activity was then measured after the exposure to the low-intensity, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) within the proposed EMR range [560 - 860 nm]. The experimental results have indeed shown that there is a significant increase in the activity of LDH only after irradiation within the range of the frequencies predicted by the RRM: 596 nm (12 %; P less than 0. 001) and 829 nm (11. 8 %, P less than 0. 001). These results prove successfully that activity of proteins and more specifically enzymes could be modified by EMR radiation of specific frequencies and even more that RRM computational model can successfully predict these frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Dark pulses are dips {{in power}} of <b>electro</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> on a {{constant}} background {{that are often}} accompanied by a phase jump across the intensity minimum. Since their discovery, dark pulses have attracted considerable attention in many fields such as dark solitons and optical communications. Here we report generation of 11 fs dark pulses using the regime of “perfect absorption”. When two coherent counter-propagating electromagnetic waves of the same intensity form a standing wave, a thin absorber placed in the antinode of the wave could completely dissipate energy of both waves if its traveling wave absorption is 50 %. If one of the waves is a “gate pulse” in time domain, the “perfect absorption” regime will exist only during the pulse, when a dip in power of “carrier pulse” will be created. “Dark pulses” are generated by positioning plasmonic absorber in the anti-node of the standing wave and balancing peak intensities. These dark pulses are characterized using cross-correlation technique. Measured width of the “dark pulse” is border than 6 fs “gate pulse”, which is nearly 11 fs as shown in Fig. 1 B. Width of the “dark pulse” is limited by transient plasmonic absorption establishes with completion of the plasmon relaxation time, which is typically 11 fs in gold nanostructures. We argue that bandwidth of dark pulses {{is limited by the}} plasmon relaxation time of the absorber...|$|E

In our first research project, silver core-vanadium/ferrous-doped titanium dioxide shell novel nanocomposite was synthesized to be used as an antibacterial agent. The results indicated that Ag core- 0. 1 %V/Fe-doped TiO 2 shell had the strongest antibacterial activity under lambdamax∼ 420 nm light source, which was three times as strong as that of well known antibacterial agent, Ag. V/Fe doped TiO 2 did not show antibacterial activity under lambdamax∼ 394 nm and lambdamax∼ 500 nm light sources. However, it showed very mild inhibition under lambda max∼ 420 nm light source. The results also showed that insertion of the Ag core to V/Fe-doped TiO 2 made it a strong antibacterial agent under the conditions used. Moreover, doping TiO 2 shell of Ag core-TiO 2 shell composite, with V/Fe, tremendously enhanced its antibacterial properties under visible light. Under the above-mentioned experimental conditions, Fe/V contributed to extend the photo responding range of TiO 2 to visible light while Ag played a dominating role in charge separation. Therefore, this is an excellent method of overcoming two major drawbacks of TiO 2 as a photocatalyst, namely low photo responding range and low quantum yield. In our second project, we synthesized Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) stabilized monodispersed crystalline nano zinc oxide (ZnO) and silica core-gold shell nanocomposite. Those nanomaterials were encapsulated in a water-based acrylic resin and dispersed in the emulsion using high shear force. Our emulsion was 100 % transparent and the ZnO dispersed coating, cured on glass substrate, absorbed∼ 90 % UV radiation while maintaining 80 %- 90 % visible light transmittance with good adhesion to glass. Although the plasmon band of gold nanoshells was tuned as desired to NIR, the visible light transmittance was not satisfactory. However, that coating could have been utilized as a broadband filter. Therefore, two organic dyes, IR 806 and IR 165, were used in the emulsion to absorb NIR. IR 806 was employed with ZnO, but its narrow absorption band did not absorb NIR beyond 850 nm. Although water-insoluble stable IR 165 cannot be dispersed in water-based acrylic resin, it was well dispersed in the solvent-based resin Duramac. The cured coating on glass, poly carbonate (PC), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) had good UV and NIR absorbance and visible light transmittance with good adhesion to substrate. Being cost effective and non-permanent, this kind of coating can be applied on any surface/object exposed to sunlight without adding considerable additional cost to whichever it is applied. In our third project, we formulated a conductive coating by dispersing bimetallic Cu core-Ag shell (Cu Ag) nanocomposite in nonconductive acrylic polymers. Monometallic Cu, Ni, Ag and bimetallic Cu Ag, Ni Ag core-shell and Cu/Ag alloy nanocomposites were successfully synthesized. Morphologies of all monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles/composites were spherical. TEM images clearly showed the Ag shell and Cu core of Cu Ag. Although UV-visible spectra of Cu Ag and Cu/Ag alloy nanocomposites showed broader plasmon bands located between Cu and Ag plasmon bands, the plot of the wavelength of the maximum plasmon absorbance vs. the composition of the nanocomposites of different nanocomposites of varying Ag:Cu ratios followed completely opposite trends. Conductivity of the Cu Ag nanocomposite dispersed emulsion depended on the metal loading. Cured coating of Cu Ag (Cu:Ag= 1 : 3) nanocomposite dispersed in Water-based non-conductive acrylic emulsion (volume ratio emulsion: metal= 1 : 1) showed conductivity in 20 kO range. These types of coatings, with improved conductivity, might be used on touch panels or cell phones for <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Radiation</b> (EMR) shielding.
