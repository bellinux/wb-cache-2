40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a tag separation method for better cardiac boundary segmentation and tag tracking. Our approach {{is based on}} two observations in the cardiac tagged MR images: 1) the <b>tag</b> <b>patterns</b> have a regular texture; 2) the cardiac images without <b>tag</b> <b>patterns</b> are piecewise smooth with sparse gradients. These observations motivate us to use two dictionaries, one based on the Discrete Cosine Transform for representing <b>tag</b> <b>patterns</b> and the other based on the Wavelet Transform for representing the underlying cardiac image without <b>tag</b> <b>patterns.</b> The two dictionaries are built such that they can lead to sparse representations of the <b>tag</b> <b>patterns</b> and of the piece-wise smooth regions without <b>tag</b> <b>patterns.</b> With the two dictionaries, a new tag separation approach is proposed to simultaneously optimize w. r. t. the two sparse representations, where optimization is directed by the Total Variation regularization scheme. While previous methods have focused on tag removal, our approach to acquiring both optimally-decomposed tag-only image and the cardiac image without tags simultaneously {{can be used for}} better tag tracking and cardiac boundary segmentation. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on large sets of cardiac tagged MR images. ...|$|R

40|$|The New York Times Annotated Corpus and the ACM Digital Library are two prototypical {{examples}} of document collections {{in which each}} document is tagged with keywords and significant phrases. Such collections {{can be viewed as}} high-dimensional document cubes against which browsers and search systems can be applied {{in a manner similar to}} online analytical processing against <b>data</b> cubes. The <b>tagging</b> <b>patterns</b> in these collections are examined and a generative tagging model is developed that can mimic the tag assignments observed in those collections. When a user browses the collection by means of a Boolean query over tags, the result is a subset of documents that can be summarized by a centroid derived from their document term vectors. A partial materialization strategy is developed to provide efficient storage and access to centroids for such document subsets. A customized local term vocabulary storage approach is incorporated into the partial materialization to ensure that rich and relevant term vocabulary is available for representing centroids while maintaining a low storage footprint. By adopting this strategy, summary measures dependent on centroids (including bursty terms, or larger sets of indicative documents) can be efficiently and accurately computed for important subsets of documents. The proposed design is evaluated on the two collections along with PubMed (a held-back document collection) and several synthetic collections to validate that it outperforms alternative storage strategies. Finally, an enhanced faceted browsing system is developed to support users' exploration of large multi-tagged document collections. It provides summary measures of document result sets at each step of navigation through a set of indicative terms and diverse set of documents, as well as information scent that helps to guide users' exploration. These summaries are derived from pre-materialized views that allow for quick calculation of centroids for various result sets.

40|$|Abstract. Many Web {{documents}} such as HTML {{files and}} XML files have no rigid structure and are called semistructured data. In general, such semistructured Web documents {{are represented by}} rooted trees with ordered children. We propose a new method for discovering frequent tree structured patterns in semistructured Web documents by using a <b>tag</b> tree <b>pattern</b> as a hypothesis. A <b>tag</b> tree <b>pattern</b> is an edge labeled tree with ordered children which has structured variables. An edge label is a tag or a keyword in such Web documents, and a variable can be substituted by an arbitrary tree. So a <b>tag</b> tree <b>pattern</b> is suited for representing tree structured patterns in such Web documents. First we show {{that it is hard}} to compute the optimum frequent <b>tag</b> tree <b>pattern.</b> So we present an algorithm for generating all maximally frequent <b>tag</b> tree <b>patterns</b> and give the correctness of it. Finally, we report some experimental results on our algorithm.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>Tags</b> are strings used in {{journals}} {{to indicate}} {{the origin of the}} archival data and to enable the reader to recover the data. The NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) has recently introduced a new approach to production of <b>data</b> <b>tags</b> and recovery of data from them. Many of the data access services at the IRSA return filtered data sets (such as subsets of source catalogs) and dynamically created products (such as image cutouts); these dynamically created products are not saved permanently at the archive. Rather than <b>tag</b> the <b>data</b> sets from which the query result sets are drawn, the archive tags the query that generates the results. A single tag can, then, encode a complex dynamic data set and simplifies the embedding of tags in manuscripts and journals. By logging user queries and all the parameters for those query as <b>Data</b> <b>Tags,</b> IRSA can re-create the query and rerun the IRSA service using the same search parameters used when the <b>Data</b> <b>Tag</b> was created. At the same time, the logs give a simple count of the actual numbers of queries made to the archive, a powerful metric of archive usage unobtainable from the Apache web server logs. Currently, IRSA creates tags for queries to more than 20 data sets, including the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) and Spitzer Space Telescope Legacy <b>Data</b> Sets. These <b>tags</b> are returned by the spatial query engine, Atlas. IRSA plans to create tags for queries to the rest of its services in late Spring 2007.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of heart motion from image sequence data {{has received a}} great deal of attention in recent years because cardiac motion is complex and analysis of cardiac motion can be used to diagnose damage to the heart muscle caused by a heart attack. Magnetic resonance imaging has shown great promise for imaging cardiac motion because of a technique called tagging. Tagged images appear with a spatially encoded pattern that moves with the heart tissue as it moves through the heart cycle. In this dissertation we develop two new approaches to cardiac motion estimation that exploit MR tagging techniques. Both approaches are developed within a stochastic estimation framework, which serves as an important unifying theme. In the first approach, we use Horn and Schunck's optical flow (HSOF) algorithm to estimate motion and design a continuously varying <b>tag</b> <b>pattern</b> that is optimal for the HSOF algorithm.
