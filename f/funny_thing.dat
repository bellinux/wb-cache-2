25|$|Howerd was {{a regular}} feature in the 1950s version of the comic Film Fun but when he began experimenting with {{different}} formats and contexts, including stage farces, Shakespearean comedy roles, and television sitcoms, he began {{to fall out of}} fashion. After suffering a nervous breakdown {{at the start of the}} 1960s, he began to recover his old popularity, initially with a season at Peter Cook's satirical Establishment Club in Soho in London. He was boosted further by success on That Was the Week That Was (TW3) in 1963 and on stage with A <b>Funny</b> <b>Thing</b> Happened on the Way to the Forum (1963–1965), which led into regular television work.
