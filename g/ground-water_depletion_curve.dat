40|$|Snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curves</b> are {{required}} for several water management applications of snow hydrology and are often difficult to obtain automatically using optical remote sensing data owing to both frequent cloud cover and temporary snow cover. This study develops a methodology to produce accurate snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curves</b> automatically using high temporal resolution optical remote sensing data (e. g. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Aqua MODIS or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) by snow cover change trajectory analysis. The method consists of four major steps. The first is to reclassify both cloud-obscured land and snow into more distinct subclasses and to determine their snow cover status (seasonal snow cover or not) based on the snow cover change trajectories over the whole snowmelt season. The second step is to derive rules based on the analysis of snow cover change trajectories. These rules are subsequently used to determine for a given date, the snow cover status of a pixel based on snow cover maps {{from the beginning of}} the snowmelt season to that given date. The third step is to apply a decision- tree-like processing flow based on these rules to determine the snow cover status of a pixel for a given date and to create daily seasonal snow cover maps. The final step is to produce snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curves</b> using these maps. A case study using this method based on Terra MODIS snow cover map products (MOD 10 A 1) was conducted in the lower and middle reaches of the Kaidu River Watershed (19 000 km 2) in the Chinese Tien Shan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. High resolution remote sensing data (charge coupled device (CCD) camera data with 19. 5 m resolution of the China and Brazil Environmental and Resources Satellite (CBERS) data (19. 5 m resolution), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data with 15 m resolution of the Terra) were used to validate the results. The study shows that the seasonal snow cover classification was consistent with that determined using a high spatial resolution dataset, with an accuracy of 87 - 91 %. The snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curves</b> clearly reflected the impact of the variation of temperature and the appearance of temporary snow cover on seasonal snow cover.

The Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), a distributed land surface model (LSM) with a multilayer, physically-based snow model, has been applied in the upstream part of this watershed where snowfall accounts for 50 % of the precipitation. The CLSM subdivides the upper Durance watershed, where elevations range from 800 m to 4000 m within 3580 km 2, into elementary catchments with an average area of 500 km 2. We first show {{the difference between the}} dynamics of the accumulation and ablation of the snow cover using MODIS images and snow depth measurements. The extent of snow cover increases faster during accumulation than during ablation because melting occurs at preferential locations. This difference corresponds to the presence of a hysteresis in the snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curve</b> of these catchments, and we adapted the CLSM by implementing such a hysteresis in the snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curve</b> of the model. Different simulations were performed to assess the influence of the parameterizations on the water budget and the evolution of the extent of the snow cover.

The method is aimed at routing sediment in morphologically diverse bedrock-controlled channels in which sediment transport and storage is not a continuous process {{in space and time}} and mostly occurs in response to discrete discharges. The relative value of the ultimate stable scour depth (Huss) for each steady discharge with respect to the current scour depth after adding sediment supply determines the potential to scour or store sediment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop techniques for the representation and parameterization of subgrid and distributed snow processes within snowmelt models. Snowmelt is driven by energy exchanges at the snow surface that have horizontal variability down to scales of 1 to 10 m. When areas with large extent are modeled, it is impractical to apply models distributed on a 1 to 10 m grid. Large model elements, either grid squares or topographically delineated, need to be used. Therefore, it is necessary to develop modeling approaches that can parameterize the variability within these elements, referred to as subgrid variability. The role of subgrid variability increases as the model element size is increased, so as scale increases the representation of subgrid variability becomes more important. Computational tools are needed to explore the scale dependence of the subelement representation. Since subgrid variability is closely relatedto the topography, the parameterization of subgrid variability from the topography or iii topographical features was investigated. This dissertation is a collection of four papers that address some of these challenges. The goal is to combine physically based modeling emphasizing physical understanding of the reasons for and processes involved in spatial variability of snow and snowmelt with the analysis of extensive existing remotely sensed and field-based data from a Colorado Front Range watershed – Green Lakes Valley (GLV) watershed.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop a spatial-temporal model to forecast the snow water equivalent (SWE) within a watershed. This model defined the relationship between the physical parameters of a watershed and the spatial distribution of SWE within that watershed. Many models of snowmelt runoff rely on snow <b>depletion</b> <b>curves,</b> which describe the seasonal decline of snow covered fraction and SWE, assuming some interannual uniformity of basin response. The null hypothesis associated with {{this research}} was that the spatial and temporal variability of SWE within a watershed is a random process that is independent of the physical characteristics of the watershed. 	A conceptual model of spatially distributed SWE accumulation and depletion that can be calibrated and validated with spatially distributed observations was created. The effects of the physical variables and parameters on the SWE distribution within a watershed were demonstrated, and both significant and insignificant physical variables and parameters were identified. How data were used in the calibration/validation of the model was demonstrated, including showing the benefit of additional data on model accuracy. Finally, the proper calibration and validation of the model using an actual watershed was demonstrated on three different watersheds. 	Results of the research were mixed in terms of accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis. Created SWE maps and satellite images of the Upper Rio Grande Watershed visually suggested that similar SWE patterns exist for this watershed.

The spatial variability of shortwave irradiance during melt under uniform and discontinuous evergreen canopies at a U. S.

All observations used arrays of pyranometers randomly spaced under evergreen canopies of varying structure and latitude. The spatial variability of irradiance for both overcast and clear conditions declined dramati-cally, as the sample averaging interval increased from minutes to 1 day. At daily averaging intervals, there was little influence of cloudiness on the variability of subcanopy irradiance; instead, it was dominated by stand structure. The spatial variability of irradiance on daily intervals was higher for the discontinuous canopies, but it did not scale reliably with canopy sky view.

Data unambiguously show that Vitamin E reacts with P° and POO° whereas 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl phenols only react with POO°. Kinetic parameters of the stabilization reactions for both kinds of antioxidants were tentatively extracted from phenol <b>depletion</b> <b>curves,</b> and discussed regarding {{the structure of the}} stabilizer. They were also used for completing an existing kinetic model used for predicting the stabilization by antioxidants.

40|$|Snow <b>depletion</b> <b>curves,</b> {{required}} as {{input to}} many snowmelt models, relate the time-varying snow-covered fraction, S(t), to the cumulative melt energy received, M(t). In hydrologic models, snow water equivalent (SWE, particularly the mean value) is generally {{the most important}} variable in mass accounting; however, S(t) is more easily observed (by remote sensing, for example). In atmospheric models, S(t) exerts a strong control on land–atmosphere coupling. Generally, the coarse resolution of model grids or response units requires a sub model relating S(t) to areal-average SWE. <b>Depletion</b> <b>curves</b> often express snow-covered fraction directly {{as a function of}} cumulative melt, in the form S(M). Under simplifying assumptions, S(M) can be derived from the end-of-winter frequency distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) (Martinec 1972, Liston 1999). Usually, however, this distribution is unknown, and S(M) must be inferred from sparse observational data of S(t) and estimated M(t). We make the simplifying assumption that all disappearance of snow is due to melt, and define the following variables: Z(x) = SWE [cm] at end of winter (start of melt), a random variable in space, described by a probability density function f(Z); M(t) = Cumulative potential melt energy, expressed as melt depth [cm], monotonically increasing in time; and S(t) = areal fraction snow covered [dimensionless], monotonically decreasing in time. Assuming that M(t) is uniform in space, snow cover depletion S(t) as a function of M(t) is equal to the complement of cumulative distribution function (cdf) for end-of-winter Z(x) ...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing is an {{important}} source of snowcover extent for input into the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) and other snowmelt models. Since February 2000, daily global snowcover maps have been produced from data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The usefulness of this snowcover product for streamflow prediction is assessed by comparing SRM simulated streamflow using MODIS snowcover product with streamflow simulated using snow maps from the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC). Simulations were conducted for two tributary watersheds of the Upper Rio Grande (URG) during the 2001 snowmelt season using representative SRM coefficient values. Snow <b>depletion</b> <b>curves</b> developed from MODIS and NOHRSC snow maps were generally comparable in both watersheds, and satisfactory streamflow simulations were obtained using both snowcover products in larger watershed (Volume difference: MODIS- 2. 6 %, NOHRSC- 14. 0 %) and less satisfactory streamflow simulations in smaller watershed (Volume Difference: MODIS [...] 33. 1 %, NOHRSC [...] 18. 6 %). April 1 st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) in the 3 rd zone of each basin was computed using the Modified <b>Depletion</b> <b>Curve</b> (MDC) produced by SRM and was compared with in situ SWE measured at SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL) sites located in the 3 rd zone of each basin. The SRM-calculated SWEs using both snow products agree to the measured SWEs in both watersheds. Based on these results, MODIS snowcover products appear to be of sufficient quality for streamflow prediction using SRM in the snow dominated basins...|$|R

Journal of Hydrometeorology, 9, (6), 1482 - 1490. The spatial {{variation}} of melt energy can influence snow cover depletion rates {{and in turn}} {{be influenced by the}} spatial variability of shortwave irradiance to snow. The spatial variability of shortwave irradiance during melt under uniform and discontinuous evergreen canopies at a U. S. Rocky Mountains site was measured, analyzed, and then compared to observations from mountain and boreal forests in Canada. All observations used arrays of pyranometers randomly spaced under evergreen canopies of varying structure and latitude. The spatial variability of irradiance for both overcast and clear conditions declined dramatically, as the sample averaging interval increased from minutes to 1 day. At daily averaging intervals, there was little influence of cloudiness on the variability of subcanopy irradiance; instead, it was dominated by stand structure. The spatial variability of irradiance on daily intervals was higher for the discontinuous canopies, but it did not scale reliably with canopy sky view. The spatial variation in irradiance resulted in a coefficient of {{variation of}} melt energy of 0. 23 for the set of U. S. and Canadian stands. This variability in melt energy smoothed the snow-covered area <b>depletion</b> <b>curve</b> in a distributed melt simulation, thereby lengthening the duration of melt by 20 %. This is consistent with observed natural snow cover <b>depletion</b> <b>curves</b> and shows that variations in melt energy and snow accumulation can influence snow-covered area depletion under forest canopies. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
