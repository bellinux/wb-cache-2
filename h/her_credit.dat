5|$|Bokhary was {{involved}} in a second altercation at around 3am on 13 July 2008, again in Central. Short of cash with which to pay the HK$17.80 taxi fare, she proffered <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> card. When the taxi driver refused, Bokhary angrily flung <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> card in the driver's face; she kicked him when he prevented her from leaving the scene. The police were called. As she was being questioned by the two officers, Bokhary struck one of them. She {{was arrested and charged with}} common assault and assaulting a police officer. She was on medication and had taken wine prior to the incident. Pleading guilty to both charges in November 2008, she was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay the driver HK$1,000 in compensation.|$|E

5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{necessary}} for the seeker to have a correct creed (Aqidah), and to embrace with certainty its tenets. The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).|$|E
25|$|Though music critics noted Amuro's {{evolution}} from pop to R, the mid-2000s saw {{a decline in}} sales, both albums and singles. Play (2007), her eighth studio album, {{was a period of}} resurgence in Japanese music for her. Eventually, she moved onto electronic dance music and English language with follow-up records Uncontrolled (2012) and Feel (2013); her eleventh studio album, Genic (2015), is her last studio album, whereas Finally (2017) will be her final overall release of her career. While some parts of her career gained <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> as a songwriter and producer, Amuro has mainly been a studio and touring artist, with many of her releases reaching number-one in Japan.

25|$|Davis was the {{co-founder of}} the Hollywood Canteen, {{and was the first}} female {{president}} of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

25|$|Hou has {{attempted}} to balance chess with life outside of it. She enrolled in Peking University in 2012, studying International Relations, against the wishes of her trainer. She took a full course load and participated in many extracurricular activities; after graduation she applied to and was accepted by the University of Chicago for a masters in social work. Compared to the best professional male players who dedicate their lives to chess, Hou's split focus puts her as a disadvantage, {{and as a consequence}} her results against them have been lackluster. These competitors give <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> for what she has achieved in spite of her lack of preparation, and for her life outside of chess. However, they recognize that while Hou can probably remain the best female player in the world without extra effort, she cannot compete with the best male players unless she dedicates herself to chess. Hou is aware of this as well, but has yet to make the choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{next week}} in the Tier I 2008 Qatar Total Open, Li met Likhovtseva again in the first round.

In the third round, she enjoyed a more comfortable victory over Israeli world No. 17 Shahar Pe'er, recovering from a 1–3 deficit in the second set. In the quarterfinals, she met her old rival and friend world No. 4 Jelena Janković, coming into the match with a winning 3–1 head-to-head record to <b>her</b> <b>credit</b> against the Serbian player. By defeating Janković she extended this record to 4:1 and moved into the semifinals, where she played Vera Zvonareva, against whom she had won both of her previous encounters. Despite taking the first set, Li lost the second by the same scoreline; and although she was 3–2 up in the final set, she then ceded four successive games to her opponent to lose the match.|$|E

25|$|Seahorse {{then moved}} to Palau and on 28 January, Cutter {{discovered}} three freighters emerging from the harbor under heavy escort. He tracked the convoy for 32 hours waiting for an opening and at 0200 on the 30th {{was finally able to}} put three torpedoes into Toku Maru (2,747 tons). One of these blew the stern off, and she went down directly, taking over 450 troops with her. Harassed by the escorts and accompanying aircraft, Cutter nonetheless kept Seahorse in trail of the remaining Japanese for another 48 hours and attempted another attack just after midnight on 1 February. Eight torpedoes missed. Under heavy pressure from an escort, he shot two last torpedoes from his stern tubes just before going deep. Amid the ensuing depth charge attack, Cutter's men heard both torpedoes hit and the now-familiar sound of exploding gasoline drums. Indeed, it was later confirmed that they had sunk the Japanese steamer Toei Maru (4,004 tons). After this 80-hour chase - nearly a record, Seahorse returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 February with another five ships and 13,716 tons to <b>her</b> <b>credit.</b> The patrol earned Cutter a second Navy Cross.|$|E
25|$|Vivian Vance {{became a}} {{consideration}} {{on the recommendation}} of Lucy director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to <b>her</b> <b>credit.</b> Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play The Voice of the Turtle in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels {{that it would be a}} big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings were lukewarm at best. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series The Lucy Show after the end of I Love Lucy.|$|E
