5|$|Toyo Miyatake, who {{was born}} in Kagawa, Shikoku, Japan, in 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1909. He settled in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, and was incarcerated at Manzanar along with his family. A photographer, Miyatake smuggled a lens and <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> into Manzanar and later had a {{craftsman}} construct a wooden box with a door that hid the lens. He took many now-famous photos of life and the conditions at Manzanar. His contraband camera was eventually discovered by the camp administration and confiscated. However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press the shutter button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this simple task. Merritt finally saw no point to this technicality, and allowed Miyatake to take photos.|$|E

50|$|To {{take the}} photograph, the {{photographer}} pulls back the ground glass and slides the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> into its place. The shutter is then closed and cocked, the shutter speed and aperture set. The photographer removes the darkslide {{that covers the}} sheet of film in the <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> and triggers the shutter to make the exposure. Finally, the photographer replaces the darkslide and removes the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> with the exposed film.|$|E

5000|$|Absence of {{international}} standards for <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> beyond 11" [...] x 14" [...] (30 cm x 40 cm) - this is rarely an issue as <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> are custom built to match cameras. An {{exception to this}} is 14" [...] x 17" [...] - the size of X-Ray and MRI films - which is indeed an international standard.|$|R
50|$|Some {{models have}} {{detachable}} <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> to handle multiple formats {{with the same}} camera.|$|R
50|$|Some 4×5-inch {{films were}} {{previously}} available in single-shot, pre-loaded, disposable envelopes {{which can be}} conveniently loaded into a special <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> in daylight (Kodak Readyload and Fuji Quickload). Each manufacturer made a <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> for its system's envelopes; the Polaroid 545/545i instant film holders also worked with both systems' films. In addition to eliminating dust problems, these daylight-loading systems reduced the amount of gear a photographer needed to carry to only a single <b>film</b> <b>holder.</b> However, as of 2014, no manufacturer offers quick-loading envelopes.|$|E

25|$|The 8 × 10 cameras he {{preferred}} were large and heavy, {{and due to}} the weight {{and the cost of}} the film he never carried more than twelve sheet <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> with him. At the end of each day, he had to go into a darkroom, unload the <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> and load them with new film. This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a darkened room somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.|$|R

50|$|When using a sheet <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> {{the device}} is {{inserted}} into the camera, often a view camera, and the dark slide is withdrawn, making the film available for exposure. After the exposure has been made, the dark slide is reinserted into the <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> and {{the device is}} removed from the camera for later processing of the exposed film.|$|E
50|$|To use sheet film, the {{photographer}} places {{a sheet of}} film, emulsion side out, into a <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> in the dark, and closes the dark slide over the loaded film. Next, the holder is inserted into a large-format camera, and the dark slide {{is removed from the}} holder. The exposure is made, the dark slide is replaced, and the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> is removed from the camera.|$|E

50|$|Polaroid {{produced}} {{the widest range}} of instant sheet and pack film, but discontinued all production in 2008, leaving Fujifilm as the only producer of instant film and backs. The Polaroid 545, the lighter and more modern 545i, and the 545 Pro backs were 4&times;5 inch instant sheet <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> that many photographers used. New55 Holdings, LLC started producing {{a black and white}} P/N film for the 545 and 545i backs. This new instant sheet film produces a black and white negative and a positive image. The older Polaroid 550 packfilm back can take Fuji FP-100C film (3.25x4.25 inches), which was the last product of this type and was discontinued in February 2016. Polaroid also produced 8&times;10 inch <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> and <b>films.</b> Polaroid produced 10-sheet 4&times;5 inch instant <b>film</b> packs and <b>holders.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> usually {{contains}} {{a number of}} filters that attenuate radiation, such that radiation types and energies can be differentiated by their effect when the film is developed.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1950s, {{the market}} for twin-lens medium format cameras had {{gradually}} become saturated. More and more amateur photographers and photojournalists were using 35 mm format cameras, while studio photographers preferred single-lens medium format cameras. Although they were more expensive, single-lens cameras offered <b>film</b> <b>holders,</b> which could quickly be swapped (an assistant loaded the film), as well as interchangeable lenses.|$|R
50|$|Another {{use for a}} {{darkroom}} is to load film {{in and out of}} cameras, development spools, or <b>film</b> <b>holders,</b> {{which requires}} complete darkness. Lacking a darkroom, a photographer can make use of a changing bag, which is a small bag with sleeved arm holes specially designed to be completely light proof and used to prepare film prior to exposure or developing.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} actions {{need to be}} taken to use a typical large format camera, {{resulting}} in a slower, often more contemplative, photographic style. For example, film loading using sheet <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> requires a dark space to load and unload the film, typically a changing bag or darkroom, although prepackaged film magazines and large format roll films have also been used in the past.|$|R

50|$|Panoramic {{photography}} {{soon came}} to displace painting {{as the most}} common method for creating wide views. Not long after {{the introduction of the}} Daguerreotype in 1839, photographers began assembling multiple images of a view into a single wide image. In the late 19th century, flexible film enabled the construction of panoramic cameras using curved <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> and clockwork drives to rotate the lens in an arc and thus scan an image encompassing almost 180 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{sheet film}} and glass plate holders {{have been made}} out of wood. Wooden holders, {{properly}} treated, can last a very long time, and apart from possible warpage, many very old specimens are still in service. Some companies continue to make wood models today, particularly for more uncommon film sizes, and as many are mostly handmade, they can be quite expensive. The majority of new sheet <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> are now made out of plastic.|$|R
