40|$|During {{the past}} fifteen years, {{recreational}} divers have been developing and experimenting with advanced diving equipment and techniques. This so-called “Technical Diving ” includes {{a wide range of}} extended-range diving activities, but primarily involves <b>deep</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>dives</b> incorporating multiple breathing gas mixtures, ranging from a few minutes to several hours in duration, to depths of 60 - 150 meters or more. During these years, a large collective body of anecdotal observations has yielded interesting trends, and suggests possible avenues for future hyperbaric research. Specific decompression strategies developed by the technical diving community include deep initial decompression stops and slow final ascents to the surface. A conglomeration of four factors coinciding with the end of a typical dive (sudden drop in ambient pressure, sudden decrease in inspired oxygen partial pressure, sudden increase in physical exertion, and sudden shift from immersion to gravity) may together serve as a “trigger ” for the onset of decompression sickness (DCS) symptoms. The practice of In-Water Recompression (IWR) has been embraced by members of the Technical Diving community, who are both in greater need for it, and are better prepared to properly perform it. A variety of unusual physiological symptoms have been observed by Technical Divers, including Oxygen-induced Myopia, Oxygen Narcosis, “Shallow ” HPNS, successful use of Heliox for decompression, and the possibility of oxygen-induced DCS. The technical diving community has much to offer for preliminary hyperbaric investigations, and collaborations between the two communities should be maintained...|$|R

5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a <b>bounce</b> <b>dive</b> the diver descends {{directly to}} the maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends {{directly to the}} surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial <b>diving</b> a <b>bounce</b> <b>dive</b> is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty.

50|$|The {{procedure}} described so far {{is known}} as bell <b>bounce</b> <b>diving,</b> and it is used for work where {{the amount of time}} spent at depth is relatively short. When the time spent decompressing would exceed the time between shifts, the diver would be more profitably employed underwater, and the time in the chamber would be less risky if the diver was nor being decompressed, so a larger set of chambers can be used, in which the divers spend off-shift time under the same pressure they will experience at the underwater worksite. At the end of the job they are all decompressed together slowly, but the total time in decompression is reduced. This is cost-effective and puts the divers at less risk of decompression sickness than <b>bounce</b> <b>diving</b> for the same amount of time at the worksite.|$|R
50|$|The closed bell is a {{pressure}} vessel for human occupation, {{which may be}} used for <b>bounce</b> <b>diving</b> or saturation diving, with access to the water through a hatch at the bottom. The hatch is sealed before ascent to retain internal pressure. At the surface, this type of bell can lock on to a hyperbaric chamber where the divers live under saturation or are decompressed. The bell is mated with the chamber system via the bottom hatchway or a side hatchway, and the trunking in between is pressurized to enable the divers to transfer through to the chamber under pressure. In saturation diving the bell is merely the ride to and from the job, and the chamber system is the living quarters. If the dive is relatively short (a <b>bounce</b> <b>dive),</b> decompression can be done in the bell {{in exactly the same way}} it would be done in the chamber.|$|R
5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for <b>bounce</b> <b>dives</b> to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{oriented}} dives {{are those}} in which the diver is not under saturation. These are {{also referred to as}} <b>bounce</b> <b>dives,</b> and the divers may be deployed using a diving stage, wet bell or closed bell, or for shallow dives directly from the vessel or platform, depending on what water access is available. Launch and recovery systems (LARS) are used to lower the stage or bell and to lift it out after the dive.|$|R
40|$|Diel {{variation}} in beaked whale diving behavior is investigated {{using data from}} time-depth recorders deployed on six Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) and two Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) beaked whales. Deep foraging dives (> 800 m) occurred at similar rates {{during the day and}} night for Blainville's beaked whales (daymean= 0. 38 h- 1;nightmean= 0. 46 h- 1), and there were no significant diel differences in depths, durations, ascent or descent rates for deep dives. Dives to mid-water depths (100 - 600 m) occurred significantly more often during the day (mean= 1. 59 h- 1) than at night (mean= 0. 26 h- 1). Series of progressively shallower <b>bounce</b> <b>dives</b> were only documented following deep, long dives made during the day, while at night whales spent more time in shallow (< 100 m) depths. Significantly slower ascent than descent rates were found following deep foraging dives both during the day and night. Similar patterns were found for the Cuvier's beaked whales. These results suggest that so-called <b>bounce</b> <b>dives</b> do not serve a physiological function, although the slow ascents may. This diel {{variation in}} behavior suggests that beaked whales may spend less time in surface waters during the day to avoid near-surface, visually-oriented predators, such as large sharks or killer whales (Orcinus orca).

Divers used the <b>bounce</b> <b>diving</b> techniques for repair and maintenance of the TBM. The tunnel boring machine jammed at its deepest depth. As a result the work time was not sufficient. The saturation diving technique was developed and permitted longer work time at great depth. Thirty-one divers were involved in this project. Twenty-three divers were examined using Doppler ultrasound. Data analysis addressed 52 exposures to Trimix at 4. 6 - 4. 8 bar gauge using the bounce technique and 354 exposures to Trimix at 4. 0 - 6. 9 bar gauge on saturation excursions. No decompression incidents occurred with either technique during the described phase of the project. Doppler ultrasound revealed that the bubble loads assessed in both techniques were generally low. We find out, that despite longer working hours, shorter decompression times and larger physical workloads, the saturation-excursion technique was associated with significant lower bubble grades than in the bounce technique using Doppler Ultrasound.

40|$|Abstract Aquatic organisms {{exhibit a}} variety of diel changes in {{vertical}} movement that are investigable {{through the use of}} biotelemetry. While certain species do not change their movements between day and night, others exhibit diel vertical migration (DVM) or a diverse range of diel activity patterns (DAPs). Consequently, day 2 ̆ 013 night differences in depth distribution may be stark and easily detectable, or more subtle and difficult to identify. To augment the discovery and classification of cryptic diel vertical movement behavior, we developed and utilized a novel method that analyzed entire depth distributions while comparing diel period, season, and season/diel period models. This analysis revealed a seasonally variable DAP previously unreported in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). In summer and fall, Chinook salmon in the Salish Sea juxtaposed shallow and confined daytime movements with nighttime <b>bounce</b> <b>diving.</b> This DAP was reversed in winter, when they occupied deeper sections of the water column during the day, resulting in a substantially overlapping, but more even depth distribution than at night. These results demonstrate the analytical utility of accompanying other metrics with holistic examination and visualization of the entire distribution of depth data. Additionally, we highlight the need to use a framework that answers all of the following questions: (1) does the target species exhibit seasonal variation in depth, (2) does it undergo DVM, (3) if it does not undergo DVM, does it follow a DAP, and (4) if it follows a DAP, what is the difference in vertical movement behavior between diel periods...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{attempted}} {{to determine whether}} the higher prevalence of reported "forgetfulness or loss of concentration" among professional divers can be confirmed using objective neuropsychological tests. Secondary aims were to qualify the functional nature of the complaints and to ascertain whether reduced performance was linked to diving history. METHODS: In a case-control study, the neuropsychological test performance of divers complaining of moderate or severe "forgetfulness or loss of concentration" was compared with two age-matched control groups reporting no or slight "forgetfulness or loss of concentration" ("nonforgetful" divers and "nonforgetful" nondivers). The group differences were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of co-variance, followed by canonical discriminant function analysis. Altogether 102 divers with a complaint, 100 nonforgetful divers, and 100 nonforgetful nondivers completed the study. RESULTS: The overall neuropsychological performance differed significantly between the groups [Pillai's trace: F(24, 484) = 2. 04, P= 0. 003]. Verbal memory (Logical Memory and the California Verbal Learning Test), current intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and sustained attention (rapid visual processing) were poorer among the divers with a complaint than among the nonforgetful divers or the nonforgetful nondivers. The tests of memory, but not those of executive function, differentiated the divers with complaints from the two control groups. Mixed gas <b>bounce</b> <b>diving</b> and surface oxygen decompression diving, but not other techniques, were negatively associated with memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: A cognitive complaint of divers was confirmed using objective tests of neuropsychological performance. Memory, rather than executive function, was affected at the group level, but only to a mild degree. The relationships between diving experience and neuropsychological test performance were small and only seen with diving techniques used in the offshore oil and gas industry...|$|R
40|$|The phase-transition induced {{collapse}} of a neutron star to a more compact configuration (typically a ``strange'' star) and the subsequent core bounce is often invoked {{as a model for}} gamma-ray bursts. We present the results of numerical simulations of this kind of event using realistic neutrino physics and a high density equation of state. The nature of the collapse itself is represented by the arbitrary motion of a piston deep within the star, but if any shock is to develop, the transition, or at least its final stages, must occur in less than a sonic time. Fine surface zoning is employed to adequately represent the acceleration of the shock to relativistic speeds and to determine the amount and energy of the ejecta. We find that these explosions are far too baryon-rich (ejected Mass > 0. 01 solar masses) and have much too low an energy to explain gamma-ray bursts. The total energy of the ejecta having relativistic lorentz factors > 40 is less than 10 ^ 46 erg even in our most optimistic models (<b>deep</b> <b>bounce,</b> no neutrino losses or photodisintegration). However, the total energy of all the ejecta, mostly mildly relativistic, is roughly 10 ^ 51 erg and, if they occur, these events might be observed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} scalar particle {{creation in}} a set of bouncing models where the bounce occurs due to quantum cosmological effects described by the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The scalar field can be either conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, and it can be massive or massless, without self interaction. The analysis is made for models containing a single radiation fluid, and for the more realistic case of models containing the usual observed radiation and dust fluids, which can fit most of the observed features of our Universe, including an almost scale invariant power spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations. In the conformal coupling case, the particle production is negligible. In the minimal coupling case, for massive particles, the results point to the same physical conclusion within observational constraints: particle production is most important at the bounce energy scale, and it is not sensitive neither to its mass nor whether there is dust in the background model. The only caveat is the case where the particle mass is larger than the bounce energy scale. On the other hand, the energy density of produced massive particles depend on their masses and the energy scale of the bounce. For very large masses and <b>deep</b> <b>bounces,</b> this energy density may overcome that of the background. In the case of massless particles, the energy density of produced particles can become comparable to the background energy density only for bounces occurring at energy scales comparable to the Planck scale or above, which lies {{beyond the scope of this}} paper: we expect that the simple Wheeler-DeWitt approach we are using should be valid only at scales some few orders of magnitude below the Planck energy. Nevertheless, in the case in which dust is present, there is an infrared divergence, which becomes important only for scales much larger than today's Hubble radius. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} modulation of pre- activity related to different types and heights of deep jump. Sixteen male soccer players without experience in deep jumps training (the national competition; 15. 0 ± 0. 5 yrs; weight 61. 9 ± 6. 1 kg; height 1. 77 ± 0. 07 m), who participated in the study, performed three types of <b>deep</b> jump (<b>bounce</b> landing, counter landing, and bounce drop jump) from three different heights (40 cm, 60 cm, and 80 cm). Surface EMG device (1000 Hz) was used to estimate muscle activity (maximal amplitude of EMG - AmaxEMG; integral EMG signal - iEMG) of five muscles (mm. gastrocnemii, m. soleus, m. tibialis anterior, m. vastus lateralis) within 150 ms before touchdown. All the muscles, except m. gastrocnemius medialis, showed systematic increase in pre-activity when platform height was raised. For most of the lower extremity muscles, the most significant differences were between values of pre-activity obtained for 40 cm and 80 cm platforms. While the amount of muscle pre-activity in deep jumps from the heights above and beneath the optimal one did not differ significantly from that generated in deep jumps from the optimal drop height of 60 cm, the patterns of muscle pre-activity obtained for the heights above the optimal one did differ from those obtained for the optimal drop height. That suggests that deep jumps from the heights above the optimal one do not seem to be an adequate exercise for adjusting muscle activity for the impact. Muscle pre-activity in bounce drop jumps differed significantly from that in counter landing and bounce landing respectively, which should indicate that a higher amount of pre-activity generated during bounce drop jumps was used for performing take-offs.
