50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> is {{native to}} Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria and Turkey. It is quite common in Iran but is {{uncommon}} over much of its range. It {{is thought to be}} extinct in Jordan and its status is unclear in Albania, Iraq, Moldova and Ukraine. It lives in light woodland, bushy and semi-desert areas, badlands, arable fields and dunes. It prefers loose soil where it can use its spades to dig the burrow in which it lives, but is also found in rocky areas and pebbly clay soils. The range of <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> is limited by mean annual temperature and rainfall (the species does not live in the areas with insufficient summer temperature and in areas with a high rainfall level), but the northern distribution limit may additionally depend on the distribution of common spadefoot. Because the species has large tadpoles, the distribution is additionally limited by presence of sufficiently large but fishless ponds.|$|E

50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> is a plump toad {{with a large}} {{head with}} a flat topped skull, large, {{protruding}} eyes and vertical slit-like pupils. It can grow to a length of about 9 cm. The skin is smooth with a scattering of small warts. The male has a large gland {{at the back of}} his fore legs which becomes enlarged in the breeding season. The front foot has four toes and the back foot has five with deeply indented webbing between them. The hind legs are short and at the back of each hind foot is a yellowish bony protuberance, the inner metatarsal tubercle or spade, that gives the animal its name. The colour of the frog is quite variable, the back often being pale grey with large, greenish, irregularly shaped blotches and the belly being pale grey. The <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> can be distinguished from the western spadefoot (Pelobates cultripes) by the colour of the spade which is black in the latter, and from the common spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) by the fact that its head is not domed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>Spadefoot</b> {{entered the}} {{endangered}} list of Pennsylvania in 2005 (though also endangered in: Ohio, Connecticut, and Rhode Island), when living populations were only found {{in two of}} their known locations. Which is odd because the American Spadefoot tadpole has the highest metamorphosis rates in any amphibian. Though one possibility for their lacking of population size could be that, “the pools often dry up before the tadpoles get to complete metamorphosis”(Naish, 2015); though there are countless others.|$|E

In 2012 a couple learned that thirty two acres of a property they planned to subdivide and break ground on could potentially be Spadefoot habitat.

50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> toads (Leptobrachium, {{also known}} as large-eyed litter frogs) is a genus of the Megophryidae family in the order Anura, and are found in {{southern}} China, northeast India, Southeast Asia, and islands of the Sunda Shelf {{as well as the}} Philippines. They are characterized by a stocky body with slender, short hindlimbs. In identifying species, iris colour is a valuable diagnostic morphological characteristic (see Leptobrachium bompu for an example of a blue-eyed species); the iris has uniform colour in some species, whereas in other species the upper half is coloured and the lower half is dark.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> is nocturnal {{and returns}} to the same lair each night when it has {{finished}} foraging for molluscs, spiders, insects and other small arthropods. As well as digging its own burrow, it sometimes makes use of a rodent hole or a crevice under a rock. At times when the air temperature is very hot it retires to the deepest part of its burrow and may aestivate in mid-summer. At these times the toads that live in the moist soil of riverbanks may fare better than those elsewhere and in times of drought, there may be a high mortality rate among toads.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> is {{considered}} of [...] "Least concern" [...] by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

However, some of its separate populations are susceptible to local extinction due to adverse conditions, especially in arid areas.|$|E
5000|$|Scaphiopus is a genus of North American {{amphibian}} {{commonly referred}} to as the North American spadefoots, southern spadefoots, or <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> toads. They differ greatly from true toads (those of the family Bufonidae) by having eyes with vertical pupils, no parotoid gland, and relatively smooth skin. Their most distinctive feature is a spade-like projection on their hind feet, from which their common name is derived. This projection enables spadefoot toads to dig in loose soils with ease. Its scientific names means ‘spade-foot’ as well, from the Ancient Greek [...] ( [...] , ‘spade, shovel’) and [...] ( [...] , ‘foot, leg’).|$|E

Breeding pond {{selection}} and movement patterns by <b>eastern</b> <b>spadefoot</b> toads (Scaphiopus holbrookii) {{in relation to}} weather and edaphic conditions. J. Herp. 38 (4) : 569 - 577. Abstract: <b>Eastern</b> <b>Spadefoot</b> Toads (Scaphiopus holbrookii) require fish-free, isolated, ephemeral ponds for breeding but otherwise inhabit the surrounding uplands, commonly xeric longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana). Hence both pond and upland conditions can potentially affect their breeding biology, and population persistence. Hardwood invasion due to fire suppression in sandhills could alter upland and pond suitability by higher hardwood density and increased transpiration. In this paper we explore breeding and neonatal emigration movements in relation to weather, hydrological conditions of ponds, and surrounding upland matrices. We use 9 years of data from continuous monitoring with drift fences and pitfall traps at 8 ephemeral ponds in 2 upland matrices: regularly-burned, savanna-like sandhills (n = 4), and hardwood-invaded sandhills (n = 4). Neither adult nor neonate captures differed between ponds within the 2 upland matrices, suggesting that they are tolerant of upland heterogeneity created by fire frequency. Explosive breeding occurred during 9 periods and in all seasons; adults were captured rarely otherwise. At a landscape-level rainfall, maximum change in barometric pressure, and an interaction between those 2 variables were significant predictors of explosive breeding. At a pond-level, rainfall, change in pond depth during the month prior to breeding, and days since a pond was last dry were significant predictors of adult captures. Transformation date, rather than weather, was associated with neonatal emigrations, which usually were complete within a week. Movement by first-captured adults and neonates was directional, but adult emigrations were apparently not always toward their origin. Our results suggest that Spadefoot Toads are highly adapted to breeding conditions and upland habitat heterogeneity created by weather patterns and fire frequency in Florida sandhills...|$|E
