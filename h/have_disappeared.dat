5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects have {{stress on}} the {{penultimate}} syllable of a word. In Mexicanero from Durango, many unstressed syllables <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> from words, and the placement of syllable stress has become phonemic.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{is typical}} of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many {{previously}} wooded areas <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{brook trout}} {{naturally}} reproduce in Little Catawissa Creek. However, introducing rainbow trout into the creek is forbidden, {{although they were}} historically stocked there by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. River chubs were historically present in the creek, but <b>have</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The reason for this disappearance is unknown.|$|E

50|$|In birds, the tarsus <b>has</b> <b>disappeared,</b> {{with the}} {{proximal}} tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia <b>having</b> <b>disappeared,</b> and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals {{to form a}} single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|R
5|$|Woodland caribou once {{inhabited}} the region but <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> due to predation by wolves, encroachment by deer, {{and the effects}} of a brainworm parasite carried by deer which is harmful to both caribou and moose populations. Very rare sightings have been reported in nearby areas.|$|E
5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen an unexpected attack on Bannerman Road, from an unknown alien species. Sarah Jane would <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> along with several other residents. It would have been left to Clyde, Rani and Luke to stop the Alien.|$|E
5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat. These included the mosquito fish, bluegill, bass, and channel catfish, as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most of these species were reported to <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> completely.|$|E

5|$|At the RV park, Mulder finds Ronnie. As {{he tries}} to arrest him, Mulder is {{surrounded}} and overwhelmed {{by a group of}} people with glowing green eyes. He wakes up the next morning in the RV park, in his car, where he is rejoined by Scully. They are both unharmed and the vampires <b>have</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Back in Washington, they give their unified report to Skinner, who is dumbfounded by what he has heard.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{died out}} {{relatively}} recently {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. Babakotia radofilai lived during the Holocene epoch and is thought to <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1000 years. However, the only radiocarbon date that has been reported for it dates back to about 31002800BCE.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd centuryBC read any but a few of his lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{gardens are}} listed as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special {{historic}} interest in England. The original 17th-century gardens <b>have</b> <b>disappeared.</b> However, the Jenners laid them out in an Arts and Crafts style {{with a series of}} 'rooms', which are separated from each other by high, neatly clipped box and yew hedges. These are complemented by ponds and walks in and between each of the 'rooms'.|$|E
5|$|The {{mining sector}} remains very lucrative, {{with some of}} the world's largest {{platinum}} reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum. The Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006, are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century. They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably, but almost all revenues from the field <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> into the pockets of army officers and ZANU-PF politicians.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{is most likely}} extinct, and may already have been close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} subtypes of the Breton breed. Two, the Trait Breton and the Postier Breton, are officially recognised, while others {{such as the}} Corlais or Cheval de Corlay and the Centre-montagne or Central Mountain Breton are not. Older types that <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> include the Grand Breton and the Bidet Breton or Bidet d'Allure.|$|E
5|$|Whales in the Great Salt Lake: Local legend {{maintains}} that in 1875, entrepreneur James Wickham had two whales {{released into the}} Great Salt Lake, {{with the intent of}} using them as a tourist attraction. The whales are said to <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> into the lake and subsequently sighted multiple times over a number of months, but there have never been any confirmed sightings of the whales since the time of their supposed release.|$|E

5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations <b>have</b> <b>disappeared.</b> A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> {{and there}} has been diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E
5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. It {{is written in}} the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a language that is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have come down from the pre-migration era.|$|E
