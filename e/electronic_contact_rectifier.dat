40|$|Abstract—We {{report a}} new structure, called the {{shielded}} Ohmic <b>contact</b> (ShOC) <b>rectifier</b> which utilizes trenches {{filled with a}} high-barrier metal to shield an Ohmic contact during the reverse bias. When the device is for-ward biased, the Ohmic contact conducts with a low forward drop. How-ever, when reverse biased, the Ohmic contact is completely shielded by the high-barrier Schottky contact resulting in a low reverse leakage current. Two dimensional numerical simulation is used to evaluate and explain the superior performance of the proposed ShOC rectifier. Index Terms—Breakdown, diode, forward voltage drop, Ohmic <b>contact,</b> <b>rectifier,</b> reverse leakage current, Schottky barrier, simulation. I...|$|R

40|$|Using data {{collected}} among 742 respondents, this article aims at gaining greater insight into (i) {{the interaction between}} face-to-face (F 2 F) and <b>electronic</b> <b>contacts,</b> (ii) the influence of information content and relational distance on the communication mode/ service choice and (iii) the influence of relational and geographical distance, {{in addition to other}} factors, on the frequency of F 2 F and <b>electronic</b> <b>contacts</b> with relatives and friends. The results show that the frequency of F 2 F contacts is positively correlated with that for electronic communication, pointing at a complementarity effect. With respect to information content and relational distance, we find, on the basis of descriptive analyses, that synchronous modes/services (F 2 F and telephone conversations) are used more for urgent matters and that asynchronous modes (in particular email) become more influential as the relational distance increases. Finally, ordered probit analyses confirm that the frequency of both F 2 F and electronic communication declines when the physical and relational distance to social network members increases...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} an electrochemical catalyzation {{technique for}} producing gas-diffusion electrodes for proton-exchange-mem-brane fuel cells (PEMFC). The electrochemical technique deposits platinum catalyst particles in {{regions of the}} electrode that are in ionic contact with the proton-exchange membrane and in <b>electronic</b> <b>contact</b> with the carbon support. Since ionic and <b>electronic</b> <b>contact</b> are necessary components of catalyst utilization in gas-diffusion electrodes, the electrochemical catalyzation technique reduces the amount of platinum required for PEMFC. We present data for oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation with gas-dif-fusion electrodes containing 0. 05 mg Pt/cm 2. A major impediment to the commercialization of PEMFC technology is the high content of the unsupported platinum electrocatalyst,- 4 mg Pt/cm 2, corresponding to a platinum cost of-$ 400 /kW at 500 mA/cm 2. The platinum content could be lowered by increasing the platinum utilization in the gas-diffusion electrode. The two major contributions to the low utilization of the unsupported platinum electrocatalyst are: (i) the large platinum particle size (120 A), and (ii) inaccessibility of the reactants to the platinum. For spherical particles of 120 A, the fraction of surface atoms is less than 10 %; consequently, the maximum platinum utilization is less than 10 %. An approach to preparing smaller platinum particles, developed for use in phosphoric acid fuel cells, is to support the platinum on a high-surface-area mate-rial such as carbon. In contrast to carbon-supported platinu...|$|R
