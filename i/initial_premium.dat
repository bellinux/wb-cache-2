5000|$|Option {{products}} have immediate value {{at the outset}} because they provide specified protection (intrinsic value) over a given time period (time value). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value). Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option's intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e. if it is [...] "in the money") or expire at no cost (other than to the <b>initial</b> <b>premium)</b> (i.e. if the option is [...] "out of the money").|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} {{empirical evidence}} that bidders tailor their takeover strategy when facing entrenched target managers. Key elements of takeover strategies comprise the toehold investment and the <b>initial</b> bid <b>premium.</b> Intervening variables {{are the principal}} outsider and contest parameters. Several relationships are identified. First, <b>initial</b> bid <b>premiums</b> for targets characterized by entrenchment are comparatively low because bidders can not compensate entrenched managers for lost private benefits without overpaying. Second, toeholds alone have no explanatory power in explaining bidders’ takeover strategy. Instead, for targets with entrenched managers toeholds are optimized {{with respect to the}} principal outsider rather than the target management block {{in order to create a}} foothold that effectively threatens entrenchment. Thus, bidders with toeholds effectively bypass entrenched target managers. Third, our measure of free rider cost savings is increasing in toehold/principal outsider and decreasing in entrenchment, implying an optimal toehold strategy (in tandem with a low bid premium) that recognizes the pivotal role of the principal outsider.

5000|$|In recent years, many indexed annuities can {{be issued}} with a rider {{designed}} to supply a lifetime income payment to the policyholder {{that does not}} require annuitization, thus leaving the policyholder {{in control of the}} balance of the account. These [...] "income riders" [...] are calculated separately than the indexed annuity itself, however, they use the same <b>initial</b> <b>premium</b> figures for each calculation. An [...] "income rider" [...] generally will provide a specified accumulation rate which is guaranteed for a certain period of years. The [...] "income rider" [...] calculations create an [...] "income pool" [...] which is strictly an accounting figure that cannot be accessed as a single lump sum by the policyholder or beneficiary. The [...] "income pool" [...] continues to grow annually at the specified accumulation rate until such time the guarantee period expires or the policyholder opts to begin taking [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] from the account. Once [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] begin, the [...] "income pool" [...] stops accumulating, and the value of the income pool is used to determine the amount of income that will be paid out annually (it can usually be paid monthly, quarterly or semi-annually as well). The amount of income produced by the [...] "income rider" [...] will depend on several factors, primarily the age of the policyholder at the time they opt for income, the specified accumulation rate and the length of time the [...] "income pool" [...] has been given to accumulate. Each time an income payment is paid to the policyholder, the indexed annuity account value is decreased by that same amount. [...] "Income riders" [...] that provide lifetime income are generally used as a means of allowing a policyholder to supplement their income, especially in retirement, without the possibility of outliving their money because even if the indexed annuity's account value falls to zero, the income payment from the [...] "income rider" [...] will continue until the death of the policyholder. If the policyholder dies and funds remain in the indexed annuity account value, those funds would be paid to the beneficiary(-ies). Some of these income riders are offered with no fees, while others carry an annual fee (generally 1% or less) which is deducted directly from the indexed annuity account value.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the valuation of European continuous-installment options where the aim is to determine the <b>initial</b> <b>premium</b> given a constant installment payment plan.

40|$|Installment {{options are}} path-dependent {{contingent}} claims {{in which the}} premium is paid discretely or continuously in installments, instead of paying a lump sum {{at the time of}} purchase. This paper deals with valuing European continuous-installment options written on dividend-paying assets in the standard Black-Scholes-Merton framework. The valuation of installment options can be formulated as a free boundary problem, due to the flexibility of continuing or stopping to pay installments. On the basis of a PDE for the <b>initial</b> <b>premium,</b> we derive an integral representation for the <b>initial</b> <b>premium,</b> being expressed as a difference of the corresponding European vanilla value and the expected present value of installment payments along the optimal stopping boundary. Applying the Laplace transform approach to this PDE, we obtain explicit Laplace transforms of the <b>initial</b> <b>premium</b> as well as its Greeks, which include the transformed stopping boundary in a closed form. Abelian theorems of Laplace transforms enable us to characterize asymptotic behaviors of the stopping boundary close and at infinite time to expiry. We show that numerical inversion of these Laplace transforms works well for computing both the option value and the optimal stopping boundary.
