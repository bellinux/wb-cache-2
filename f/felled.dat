5|$|Gold rush–related boomtowns {{sprang up}} near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), {{was founded in}} the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, {{immediately}} northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were <b>felled</b> to provide timber for the mill.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the UNTAC {{administration}} had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued {{an order to}} lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already <b>felled</b> to be exported for timber. The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues. In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a bilateral agreement with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The agreement provided for <b>felled</b> trees to be legally exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.|$|E
5|$|Loggers <b>felled</b> {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could not {{keep pace with the}} rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were <b>felled</b> between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were <b>felled</b> for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, {{and one or two}} layers of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield was {{particularly}} hard-hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 'Big Freeze'. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Sheffield Wednesday grounds flooded due to {{being close to}} nearby rivers that flow through the city. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents {{over the fate of}} the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been <b>felled</b> as part of a scheme to maintain the city streets.|$|E
5|$|St. Leger's {{artillery}} {{was held}} up by a tactic that was also used to slow down Burgoyne's army {{after the fall of}} Ticonderoga: Gansevoort and his men had systematically <b>felled</b> trees across the wooded track the expedition came down, and St. Leger needed to clear the track to make way for his artillery. This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's white men, with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E

Winds over 90 mph (145 km/h) <b>felled</b> millions of cubic miles of forest, and a storm surge severely damaged the cities of Kemi and Tornio, claiming two lives.|$|E
5000|$|The term Furness <b>Fells</b> is also {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym with Coniston <b>Fells,</b> perhaps {{partly as a result}} of the placing of the words [...] "Furness Fells" [...] on some Ordnance Survey 1:250 000 maps. The Coniston <b>Fells</b> properly form only part of the Furness <b>Fells,</b> albeit with all the highest mountains; other <b>fells</b> in Furness are of lower altitude. The Coniston <b>Fells</b> form part of the Southern <b>Fells</b> of the Lake District as defined by Alfred Wainwright.|$|R

5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} {{was ending}} its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases <b>felled</b> many more of Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was <b>felled</b> around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the house}} there is parkland known as The Park, whilst to the west there is an area known as 'Back Lawn'. To the south-west, near the Home Farm, there is a meadow and to the {{south-east}} there is parkland known as Church Park. The Park is enclosed by woodland, sloped along the valley towards Dawlish, and is used for grazing. Church Park includes exotic trees from the 19th century, {{as well as an}} ornamental pond and waterfall from the same period. In the 20th century, some of the nearby woodland was <b>felled</b> to make glades.|$|E

5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of the}} city of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were <b>felled.</b> Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber <b>felled</b> {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A {{significant part of the}} exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was <b>felled</b> and, after replanting, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.|$|E

5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are <b>felled</b> annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E
