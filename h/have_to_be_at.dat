The two of them are met with hostility by Aquaman and King Shark. A brief fight ensues, but eventually, Joseph allows them to take the kryptonite. Before doing so, he points out that not {{everyone}} may want Superman to find all of Earth's kryptonite, and that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least part human to know that.|$|E
25|$|Fifty-one {{municipalities}} {{applied to}} join the project and fourteen were selected. The computing industry warned against the proposals, which would use ND's proprietary minicomputers instead of open standard servers and personal computers. Another concern which was voiced was that if fifteen new computing centers were to be established, it would either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the expense of existing major centers, such as the Norwegian Computing Center and SINTEF, or would have to receive subsidies. The project was also disapproved of by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education and Research and the Regional Development Fund, but the issue was carried through by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.|$|E

The fire support version, armed with a 76mm gun, was named Scorpion as the rear-mounted turret suggested a sting in the tail. Following the example of Alvis predecessor vehicles Saladin, Stalwart (load carrier) and Saracen (personnel carrier), all CVRTs started with the letter 'S'. The other vehicles were named to reflect their function; Striker anti–tank guided weapons, Spartan armoured personnel carrier; Samaritan ambulance; Sultan command and control and Samson recovery vehicles. In addition, the British General Staff had requested another vehicle armed with a 30mm cannon, which became Scimitar.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{development}} and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the Electronic Timing System. The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier {{does not even}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the loft to clock the birds as they return. Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny RFID chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons arrival. The pad or antenna is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock {{is attached to the}} antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to transponder timing systems used in human races.|$|E
25|$|The Broadway subway {{plan was}} changed in 1915 to route both tracks into 60th Street and {{to cross the}} East River by a tunnel {{just north of the}} Queensboro Bridge. The 59th Street {{crossing}} was obviously now useless, and at 60th Street, the subway would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a lower grade, {{on its way to the}} 60th Street Tunnel. The 59th Street crossing was worked into a pedestrian underpass for the IRT 59th Street station, which turned into a way to get between the downtown platform and the direct subway entrance to Bloomingdale's on the uptown platform. That section is still in use, and the floor level is that of the never-completed BMT station. The 60th Street crossing was mostly destroyed when the existing station was built at a lower grade. A door in the southern wall across from the platform opens into a remaining unused space, and suggests the platform level of the original grade, which is the same as the 59th Street underpass.|$|E

He stated that the paranormal concept of astral projection [...] "just sort of fit". Some members of the writing staff were concerned about killing Callahan's young son, Trevor, but Shiban was not bothered by it and felt that Rappo wanted to take everything from Callahan, and the worst blow would be to kill his son.|$|E
500|$|Profitable though La fille du tambour-major was, {{composing}} it left Offenbach {{less time}} to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera. Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann, by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré. [...] Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair. Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The Tales of Hoffmann"). He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, [...] "I would give everything I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the première". However, Offenbach did not live to finish the piece. He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration. [...] Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making significant changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the Opéra-Comique's director, Carvalho. [...] The opera was first seen at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881; Guiraud added recitatives for the Vienna premiere, in December 1881, and other versions were made later.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the physics}} of radio transmission, antennas have to be {{about as long as}} the {{wavelength}} of the radio signal to achieve reasonable gain. The half-wave dipole, with two poles each about one-quarter the length of the signal, is a particularly common solution. CH operated at anywhere from 10m to 50m depending on the version, meaning antennas would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least [...] long, which made it totally impractical for use on an aircraft. Bowen started development of a new system operating at shorter wavelengths, first at 6.7m following work by the British Army, and then finally settling on 1.5m, the practical limit of available technology. This became known as Airborne Interception radar (AI), and was the primary focus of Bowen's work from 1936 to 1940.|$|E

2500|$|Dimension {{stone is}} one of the most {{sustainable}} of the industrial minerals since it is created by separating it from the natural bedrock underlying all land on every continent. [...] Dimension stone rates very well in terms of the criteria on the ASTM checklist for sustainability of building products: there are no toxic materials used in its processing, there are no direct greenhouse gas emissions during processing, the dust created is controlled, the water used is almost completely recycled (per OSHA/MSHA regulation), and it is a perpetual resource (virtually inexhaustible in a human time scale). [...] Dimension stone in use can last many generations, even centuries, so the dimension stone manufacturers have not needed a product recycling program. [...] However, there are practical qualifications to and constraints on that sustainability. [...] The dimension stone color and pattern can be changed by weathering when it is very near the surface. [...] The color and pattern can also be changed by proximity to an igneous rock body or by the presence of circulating groundwater charged with carbon dioxide (i.e., limestone, travertine, marble). [...] On the other hand, changes in color and/or pattern can be positive. [...] For example, there are at least 14 separately trade-named varieties of Carrara Marble with many patterns (or no patterns) ranging in shade from white to gray. [...] The presence of faults or closely spaced joints can render the stone unusable. [...] These faults and joints do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> odd angles in the stone mass. [...] Closely spaced, wrongly spaced, or nonparallel bedding planes can make the stone unusable, particularly if the bedding planes are planes of weakness. [...] If part of the stone in one area is unusable, there will be another usable part of the stone elsewhere in the formation. [...] A quarry is not a short-term project unless it encounters one of these constraints. [...] Examples of big, old quarries operating for more than a century include the Barre (VT) granite quarry, the Georgia Marble quarry at Tate, several of the Carrara (Italy) marble quarries, and the Penrhyn (Wales) slate quarry. [...] A quarry will produce dust, noise, and some water pollution, but these can be remedied without too much trouble. [...] The landscape may also have to be restored if quarry waste is temporarily or permanently placed on adjacent land.|$|E
