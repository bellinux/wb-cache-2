40|$|This {{qualitative}} research investigates the alcohol experiences of <b>entertainers</b> who perform within licensed premises. Previous, mainly quantitative, {{studies have found}} that <b>entertainers,</b> specifically musicians, are an occupational group who drink excessively. This qualitative study draws on a wider sample of <b>entertainers</b> to examine their accounts of drinking in the workplace and the explanations they provide for this. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews (n = 24) with band-members, variety acts and DJs in Glasgow, Scotland. This revealed a workplace characterised by continual opportunities for often free alcohol consumption. Unlike most occupations, for <b>entertainers</b> ‘drinking-on-the-job’ was normative, expected, and sometimes encouraged by peers, the public, employers or sponsors. <b>Entertainers</b> also experienced performance-related incentives to drink before, during and/or after a show; including anxiety, matching their intoxication level to the audience's, and ‘reward-drinking’. This {{qualitative research}} confirms the unique nature of the entertainer-alcohol link, even in comparison to that found within other leisure industry occupations. While providing some explanation as to why <b>entertainers</b> might drink excessively, participants’ accounts also suggested potential strategies for avoiding the negative outcomes of workplace drinking...|$|R
