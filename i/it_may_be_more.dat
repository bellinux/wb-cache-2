5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, perhaps because <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> biologically productive {{than most other}} sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks {{from a number of}} locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, {{people may be}} discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the length of hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Rastodon is most parsimoniously placed as the basalmost bidental dicynodont, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> slightly <b>more</b> derived within Bidentalia.|$|R

5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may defend their chick from attack, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> passive if the chick is sickly.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{closely related}} to the {{rhinoceros}} auklet than the other puffins, it is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Lunda.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{economical}} to find {{an alternative}} market for unused electricity, rather than try and store it. High Voltage Direct Current allows for transmission of electricity, losing only 3% per 1000km.|$|E

50|$|Glossolepis incisus is an {{omnivore}} and {{in captivity}} it will eat most common commercial aquarium foods readily. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> slightly <b>more</b> carnivorous {{than most of}} the Australian rainbowfish.|$|R
25|$|When {{a project}} has {{multiple}} IRRs <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> convenient {{to compute the}} IRR of the project with the benefits reinvested. Accordingly, MIRR is used, which has an assumed reinvestment rate, usually equal to the project's cost of capital.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{production}} of phosphorus trichloride is controlled under the Chemical Weapons Convention, {{where it is}} listed in schedule 3. In the laboratory <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> convenient to use the less toxic red phosphorus.

25|$|Although {{the boiler}} is {{typically}} placed horizontally, for locomotives {{designed to work}} in locations with steep slopes <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> appropriate to consider a vertical boiler or one mounted such that the boiler remains horizontal but the wheels are inclined to suit {{the slope of the}} rails.|$|E

5000|$|The sync token {{might be}} a single pulse (a [...] "start bit" [...] as noted above), or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a <b>more</b> {{complicated}} syncword or self-synchronizing code such as HDLC or 8B/10B encoding.|$|R
25|$|Inhalable insulin {{has been}} developed. The {{original}} products were withdrawn due to side effects. Afrezza, under development by the pharmaceuticals company MannKind Corporation, {{was approved by}} the FDA for general sale in June 2014. An advantage to inhaled insulin is that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> convenient and easy to use.|$|E
25|$|Mania or {{hypomania}} {{may occur}} in 1% {{of patients with}} depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder.

25|$|Keratoconus affects about 1 in 2000 people. It occurs most {{commonly}} in late childhood to early adulthood.

The word is from the Greek kéras meaning cornea and the Latin cōnus meaning cone.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the acute}} {{external}} otitis generally resolves {{in a few}} days with topical washes and antibiotics, complete return of hearing and cerumen gland function may take a few more days.

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of vWD {{is about one}} in 100 individuals. However, {{the majority of these}} people do not have symptoms. The {{prevalence of}} clinically significant cases is one per 10,000. Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose bleeding tendency shows during menstruation. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> severe or apparent in people with blood type O.|$|E
25|$|An α2A {{adrenergic}} receptor agonist {{has also been}} approved in the US. Clonidine was initially developed {{as a treatment for}} high blood pressure. Low doses in evenings and/or afternoons are sometimes used in conjunction with stimulants to help with sleep and because clonidine sometimes helps moderate impulsive and oppositional behavior and may reduce tics. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> useful for comorbid Tourette syndrome.|$|E

5000|$|Outside {{linguistics}} {{the term}} grammar {{is often used}} in a rather different sense. In some respects, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>more</b> broadly, including rules of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider to form part of grammar, {{but rather as a}} part of orthography, the set of conventions used for writing a language. In other respects, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>more</b> narrowly, to refer to prescriptive grammar only and excluding those aspects of a language's grammar that are not subject to variation or debate. Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, [...] "Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to." ...|$|R
