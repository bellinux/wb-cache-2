Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> <b>knowledge,</b> a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader. This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.

500|$|When he was arrested, it {{was rumored}} that his {{detention}} resulted from his support of the [...] "impieties" [...] of the French Revolution. However, Espejo {{was one of the}} few people at the time who distinguished between the actual deeds of the French Revolution and the irreligious spirit connected to it, while his contemporaries in Spain and the colonies erroneously identified the emancipation of the Americas with loss of the Catholic faith. The accusation of impiety was calculated to incite popular hatred against him. Espejo never lost his faith in Catholicism throughout his lifetime. He condemned the decadence of the clergy, but he never criticized the Church itself. Eugenio Espejo had a restless <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> <b>knowledge</b> and was anxious to reform by his works a state that seemed to him, influenced as he was by the Enlightenment, to be barbarian in every way.|$|E

Egyptian authority continued to expand southward, with the consequent additions to knowledge of the Nile. The city of Zanzibar, on the island of that name, rapidly attained importance.

In this thesis animal models of complement-mediated ischemia and reperfusion are employed and examples of translation into the human clinical setting are explored...|$|R

60|$|To go {{into this}} {{argument}} fully at our present stage would be impossible, since it raises points requiring a considerable preliminary discussion; but certain reasons for rejecting the argument may be noticed at once. To begin at the end: {{there is no reason}} why what cannot have any practical importance for us should not be real. It is true that, if theoretical importance is included, everything real is of some importance to us, since, as persons desirous of knowing the truth about the universe, we have some interest in everything that the universe contains. But if this sort of interest is included, it is not the case that matter has no importance for us, provided it exists even if we cannot know that it exists. We can, obviously, suspect that it may exist, and wonder whether it does; hence it is connected with our <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and has the importance of either satisfying or thwarting this desire.|$|E
60|$|With {{the moral}} quality {{that we have}} seen, Morellet adds that for the {{intellectual}} side Turgot as a boy had a prodigious memory. He could retain {{as many as a}} hundred and eighty lines of verse, after hearing them twice, or sometimes even once. He knew by heart most of Voltaire's fugitive pieces, and long passages in his poems and tragedies. His predominant characteristics are described as penetration, and that other valuable faculty to which penetration is an indispensable adjunct, but which it by no means invariably implies--a spirit of broad and systematic co-ordination. The unusual precocity of his intelligence was perhaps imperfectly appreciated by his fellow-students, it led him so far beyond any point within their sight. It has been justly said of him that he passed at once from infancy to manhood, and was in the rank of sages before he had shaken off the dust of the playground. He was of the type of those who strangle serpents while yet in the cradle. We know the temperament which from the earliest hour consumes with eager <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and energises spontaneously with unceasing and joyful activity in that bright and pure morning of intellectual curiosity, which neither the dull tumultuous needs of life nor the mists of spiritual misgiving have yet come up to make dim. Of this temperament was Turgot in a superlative degree, and its fire never abated in him from college days, down to the last hours while he lay racked with irremediable anguish.|$|E
60|$|One way {{of escape}} is by philosophic contemplation. Philosophic contemplation does not, in its widest survey, divide the {{universe}} into two hostile camps--friends and foes, helpful and hostile, good and bad--it views the whole impartially. Philosophic contemplation, {{when it is}} unalloyed, does not aim at proving {{that the rest of}} the universe is akin to man. All acquisition of knowledge is an enlargement of the Self, but this enlargement is best attained when it is not directly sought. It is obtained when the <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> <b>knowledge</b> is alone operative, by a study which does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that character, but adapts the Self to the characters which it finds in its objects. This enlargement of Self is not obtained when, taking the Self as it is, we try to show that the world is so similar to this Self that knowledge of it is possible without any admission of what seems alien. The desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion and, like all self-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of Self which it desires, and of which the Self knows that it is capable. Self-assertion, in philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to its own ends; thus it makes the world of less account than Self, and the Self sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. In contemplation, on the contrary, we start from the not-Self, and through its greatness the boundaries of Self are enlarged; through the infinity of the universe the mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.|$|E
40|$|Many {{critics have}} read The Golden Bowl as {{a fairy tale}} because the novelist Henry James designs his protagonist, Maggie Verver, {{as a young woman}} who in her innocence flees from life until the Prince {{ironically}} awakens her to the redeeming experience of evil. Consequently, James portrays Maggie embarking upon a psychological quest to discover the reality behind social pretense and self-denial. By learning to distinguish the subtle nuances between virtue and vice, she gains self-awareness through multiple recognition scenes. In his magnum opus, James depicts his most complex character evolving from archetypal beginnings of excessive romanticism to a multi-faceted identity in which she exchanges her subconscious <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of reality...|$|R
