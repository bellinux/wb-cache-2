40|$|We {{discuss a}} new {{solution}} of the Kompaneets-equation for physical situations in which low frequency photons, forming relatively narrow spectral details, are Compton scattered in an isotropic, infinite medium with an intense ambient blackbody field that {{is very close to}} full thermodynamic equilibrium with the free electrons. In this situation the background-induced stimulated Compton scattering slows down the motion of photons toward higher frequencies by a factor of 3 in comparison with the solution that only takes into account Doppler-broadening and boosting. This new solution is important for detailed computations of cosmic microwave background spectral distortions arising due to uncompensated atomic transitions of hydrogen and helium in the early Universe. In addition we derive another analytic solution that only includes the background-induced stimulated Compton scattering and is valid for power-law ambient radiation fields. This solution might have interesting applications for radio lines arising inside of bright <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source,</b> where according to our estimates line shifts because of background-induced stimulated scattering could be amplified and even exceed the line broadening due to the Doppler-effect.

Using the WENSS survey, we have {{selected}} a complete sample of these sources. We {{have investigated the}} properties of their radio structures. We find, among other things, that these sources are old (50 - 100 Myr) and have higher advance velocities than smaller sources of similar radio power. We find pressure gradients in their radio lobes, suggesting that the lobes are still overpressured {{with respect to the}} environment. Further, we find no evidence for a cosmological evolution of the radio lobe pressures with increasing redshift, at least up to z ∼ 0. 4, other than that caused by selection effects. We argue that a much fainter sample of giant sources than currently available is needed to constrain the pressure in their environments, the IGM, and that SKA can {{play an important role in}} studying such sources. Another extremely important discovery is that of a population of radio sources with a so-called ‘double-double ’ structure, i. e. that of a small two-sided radio source embedded inside a much larger two-sided structure.

40|$|Introduction In recent years, rapid (intraday) cm-wavelength {{variations}} in both total and polarized flux density {{have been observed}} {{in a number of}} strong <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> (Wagner & Witzel 1992 [4], for example). In many cases, the amplitude of the {{variations in}} polarized flux density is substantially greater than that for total flux density. In different intraday variable (IDV) sources, variations in total and polarized flux may be either correlated or anti-correlated. During one event in 0917 + 624, a ¸ 180 ffi swing in polarization position angle occurred over a timescale of ¸ 1 : 3 days. In at least one case (0716 + 714; Wagner et al. 1996 [5]), there is some evidence for correlated IDV at optical and radio wavelengths. It is not entirely clear whether such variations are extrinsic, e. g. due to gravitational micro-lensing or refractive scintillation in the interstellar medium, or intrinsic. Thoug...|$|R

40|$|Absorption or {{emission}} {{against the}} cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) may be observed in the redshifted 21 cm line if the spin temperature of the neutral intergalactic medium prior to reionization differs from the CMB temperature. This so-called 21 cm tomography should reveal important information on the physical state of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts. The fluctuations in the redshifted 21 cm, due to gas density inhomogeneities at early times, should be observed at meter wavelengths by the next generation radio telescopes such as the proposed Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Here we show that the <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> provide a serious contamination to the brightness temperature fluctuations expected in the redshifted 21 cm emission from the IGM at high redshifts. Unless the <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> population cuts off at flux levels above the planned sensitivity of SKA, its clustering noise component will dominate the angular fluctuations in the 21 cm signal. The integrated foreground signal is smooth in frequency space and it should nonetheless be possible to identify the sharp spectral feature arising from the non-uniformities in the neutral hydrogen density during the epoch when the first UV sources reionize the intergalactic medium.

5000|$|All {{values of}} ΔT before 1955 depend on {{observations}} of the Moon, either via eclipses or occultations. The angular momentum lost by the Earth due to friction induced by the Moons tidal effect is transferred to the Moon, increasing its angular momentum, which means that its moment arm (its distance from the Earth) is increased (for the time being about +3.8 cm/year), which via Keplers laws of planetary motion causes the Moon to revolve around the Earth at a slower rate.

Motivated by clear patterns in the observed distribution of RMs over the sky, we considered GMF models consisting of the two components: disk (spiral or ring) and halo. The parameters of these components were determined by fitting different model field geometries to the observed RMs. We found that the model consisting of a symmetric (with respect to the Galactic plane) spiral disk and anti-symmetric halo fits the data best, and reproduces the observed distribution of RMs over the sky very well. We confirm that ring disk models are disfavored. Our results favor small pitch angles around - 5 degrees and an increased vertical scale of electron distribution, in agreement with some previous studies. Based on our fits, we identify two benchmark models suitable for studies of cosmic ray propagation, including the ultra-high energies.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the inverse Compton catastrophe when the synchrotron brightness temperature exceeds a threshold value, usually estimated to be 10 ^ 12 K, {{appears to be in}} contradiction with observation because: (i) the threshold is substantially exceeded by several intra-day variable <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> but the inverse Compton emission is not observed, (ii) powerful, <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> of known angular size do not appear to congregate close to the predicted maximum brightness temperature. We re-examine the parameter space available to synchrotron sources using a population of monoenergetic electrons, in order to see whether the revised threshold temperature is consistent with the data. The electron distribution and the population of each generation of scattered photons are computed using spatially averaged equations. We confirm our previous finding that intrinsic brightness temperatures T_ B 10 ^ 14 K can occur without catastrophic cooling. We show that substantially higher temperatures cannot be achieved either in transitory solutions or in solutions that balance losses with a powerful acceleration mechanism. Depending on the observing frequency, we find strong cooling can set in at a range of threshold temperatures and the imposition of the additional constraint of equipartition between particle and magnetic field energy is not warranted by the data. Postulating a monoenergetic electron distribution, which approximates one that is truncated below a certain Lorentz factor, γ_min, alleviates several theoretical difficulties associated with the inverse Compton catastrophe, including those mentioned above.

40|$|We {{include a}} general {{form for the}} {{scattering}} mean free path in a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of relativistic shock formation and Fermi acceleration. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, as well as analytic work, suggest that relativistic shocks tend to produce short-scale, self-generated magnetic turbulence {{that leads to a}} scattering mean free path (mfp) with a stronger momentum dependence than the mfp ~ p dependence for Bohm diffusion. In unmagnetized shocks, this turbulence is strong enough to dominate the background magnetic field so the shock can be treated as parallel regardless of the initial magnetic field orientation, making application to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), pulsar winds, Type Ibc supernovae, and <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> more straightforward and realistic. In addition to changing the scale of the shock precursor, we show that, when nonlinear effects from efficient Fermi acceleration are taken into account, the momentum dependence of the mfp has an important influence on the efficiency of cosmic-ray production as well as the accelerated particle spectral shape. These effects are absent in nonrelativistic shocks and do not appear in relativistic shock models unless nonlinear effects are self-consistently described. We show, for limited examples, how the changes in Fermi acceleration translate to changes in the intensity and spectral shape of gamma-ray emission from proton-proton interactions and pion-decay radiation.

40|$|In the {{standard}} gravitational lensing scenario, rays from a background source are bent {{in the direction}} of a foreground lensing mass distribution. Diverging lens behaviour produces deflections in the opposite sense to gravitational lensing, and is also of astrophysical interest. In fact, diverging lensing due to compact distributions of plasma has been proposed as an explanation for the extreme scattering events (ESEs) that produce frequency-dependent dimming of <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> and may also be related to the refractive radio-wave phenomena observed to affect the flux density of pulsars. In this work we study the behaviour of two families of astrophysical diverging lenses in the geometric optics limit, the power-law and the exponential plasma lenses. Generally, the members of these model families show distinct behaviour in terms of image formation and magnification, however the inclusion of a finite core for certain power-law lenses can produce a caustic and critical curve morphology that is similar to the well-studied Gaussian plasma lens. Both model families can produce dual radial critical curves, a novel distinction from the tangential distortion usually produced by gravitational (converging) lenses. The deflection angle and magnification of a plasma lens varies with the observational frequency, producing wavelength-dependent magnifications that alter the amplitudes and the shape of the light curves. Thus, multi-wavelength observations can be used to physically constrain the distribution of the electron density in such lenses.

The optical depth spectra for most sources have {{root mean square}} noise values ≲ 10 ^- 3 per 1 km/s velocity channel and are thus sufficiently sensitive to detect absorption by warm neutral hydrogen with HI column densities N_HI ≳ 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2, spin temperatures T_s ≤ 5000 K, and line widths equal to the thermal width (20 km/s). HI 21 cm absorption was detected against all background sources but one, B 0438 - 436. The spectra of sources observed separately with GMRT and WSRT show excellent agreement, indicating that spectral baseline problems and contamination from HI 21 cm emission are negligible.

On every sightline, the maximum spin temperature detected (at > 3 sigma significance) even at a velocity resolution of 1 km/s is ≳ 1000 K, indicating that we are detecting the warm neutral medium along most sightlines. This {{is by far the}} largest sample of Galactic HI 21 cm absorption spectra of this quality, providing a sensitive probe of physical conditions in the neutral atomic ISM.

The inverse Compton {{catastrophe}} is {{the dramatic}} {{rise in the}} luminosity of inverse-Compton scattered photons predicted to occur when the synchrotron brightness temperature exceeds a threshold value, usually estimated to be 10 12 K. However, this effect {{appears to be in}} contradiction with observation because: (i) the threshold is substantially exceeded by several intra-day variable <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> but the inverse Compton emission is not observed, (ii) powerful, <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> of known angular size do not appear to congregate close to the predicted maximum brightness temperature. Aims. We re-examine the parameter space available to synchrotron sources using a non-standard electron distribution, in order to see whether the revised threshold temperature is consistent with the data. Methods. We apply the theory of synchrotron radiation to a population of monoenergetic electrons. The electron distribution and the population of each generation of scattered photons are computed using spatially averaged equations. The results are formulated in terms of the electron Lorentz factors that characterise sources at the threshold temperature and sources in which the particle and magnetic field energy density are in equipartition. Results. We confirm our previous finding that intrinsic brightness temperatures T B ~ 10 14 K can occur without catastrophic cooling. We show that substantially higher temperatures cannot be achieved either in transitory solutions or in solutions that balance losses with a powerful acceleration mechanism. Depending on the observing frequency, we find strong cooling can set in at a range of threshold temperatures and the imposition of the additional constraint of equipartition between particle and magnetic field energy is not warranted by the data. Conclusions. Postulating a monoenergetic electron distribution, which approximates one that is truncated below a certain Lorentz factor γ min}, alleviates several theoretical difficulties associated with the inverse Compton catastrophe, including anomalously high brightness temperatures and the apparent lack of clustering of powerful sources at 10 12 K...|$|R
40|$|Some {{intra-day}} variable, compact <b>extra-galactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> show brightness temperatures severely exceeding 10 ^{ 12 } K, {{the limit}} set by catastrophic inverse-Compton (IC) cooling in sources of incoherent synchrotron radiation. The {{violation of the}} IC limit, possible under non-stationary conditions, would lead to IC avalanches in the soft-gamma-ray energy band during transient periods. For the first time, broadband signatures of possible IC catastrophes were searched for in S 5 0716 + 71. A multifrequency observing campaign targetting S 5 0716 + 71 {{was carried out in}} November 2003 under the framework of the European Network for the Investigation of Galactic nuclei through Multifrequency Analysis (ENIGMA) together with a campaign by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT), involving a pointing by the soft-gamma-ray satellite INTEGRAL, optical, near-infrared, sub-millimeter, millimeter, radio, and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) monitoring. S 5 0716 + 71 was very bright at radio frequencies and in a rather faint optical state during the INTEGRAL pointing; significant inter-day and low intra-day variability was recorded in the radio regime, while typical fast variability features were observed in the optical band. No correlation was found between the radio and optical emission. The source was not detected by INTEGRAL, neither by the X-ray monitor JEM-X nor by the gamma-ray imager ISGRI, but upper limits to the source emission in the 3 - 200 keV energy band were estimated. A brightness temperature Tb> 2. 1 x 10 ^{ 14 } K was inferred from the radio variability, but no corresponding signatures of IC avalanches were recorded at higher energies. The absence of IC-catastrophe signatures provides either a lower limit delta> 8 to the Doppler factor affecting the radio emission or strong constraints for modelling of the Compton catastrophes in S 5 0716 + 71.
