2500|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Nick Clegg registered a formal complaint about Huhne's conduct to Chris Rennard, the party's Chief Whip and returning officer. Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: [...] "the politics of innuendo, mounting false challenges {{and running a}} campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents." [...] Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg {{on a number of}} policy and political issues and was titled [...] "Calamity Clegg". When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the <b>document</b> <b>title</b> but agreed with the points within it. Asked how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied: [...] "It's quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office... But I can assure you that's not had my authorization." [...] After Clegg complained about what he called [...] "dirty tricks" [...] and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an [...] "over-zealous researcher" [...] and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release.

As a consequence, Functional Development Assurance Level (FDAL) is introduced for aircraft and systems concerns and the term Design Assurance Level has been renamed Item Development Assurance Level (IDAL). [...] Furthermore, the addition of definitions for Error, Failure, and Failure Condition are acknowledge as derived from AMC 25.1309.

40|$|The {{sublanguage}} analysis methodology {{is based}} on the theory that texts generated by a group of people possess their own lexical, syntactic, and semantic characteristics. The main thrust of the research reported here is to apply the methodology to Korean <b>document</b> <b>titles,</b> reflecting the fact that there has been little research in applying the methodology for the Korean language although much research has been done with English texts. The research had the goal of finding a way to construct the lexicosemantic representation from the <b>document</b> <b>titles</b> and laying out a firm ground for automating the entire process by developing necessary components and analyzing the linguistic phenomena. We conducted intellectual analyses and extracted a number of lexico-semantic relations between concepts existing in <b>document</b> <b>titles.</b> For each relation, we generated relation-revealing patterns (RRPs). A program was written to extract relations by using RRPs as well as concepts connected by a relation. We appli [...] ...|$|R

The cards were sorted and run through a printer to produce the final result. Ohlman named this result a [...] "permutation index" [...] (or Permuterm for short) because the words went through a cyclic permutation process.The first actual permutation index was issued later that year as a subject guide to SAGE programming documents—based on 1,800 documents (2/3 from the Lincoln Laboratory).In 1958 Ohlman submitted a paper titled [...] "Subject-word letter frequencies with applications to superimposed coding" [...] to the International Conference on Scientific Information (ICSI) in Washington, DC.
