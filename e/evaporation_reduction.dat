The application rates were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 Mg ha- 1. The experiment was conducted in a growth chamber under low (4. 5 mm day- 1) and high (16. 0 mm day- 1) evaporative demand conditions. Soil moisture profiles were also measured. Incorporated residue treatments did not show any significant advantages over the control, under both evaporative demands. In general, evaporation decreased and thus {{the amount of water}} conserved increased with increasing surface-residue rates under both evaporative demands. Those <b>evaporation</b> <b>reductions</b> were clearly reflected in soil-moisture profiles. However, it has been concluded that 4 Mg ha- 1 was the most efficient surface residue rate in water conservation. The amount of water conserved with the rate of 4 Mg ha- 1 was 1. 7 times that of the control under low evaporative demand. Whereas, the amounts or water conserved were 1. 4, 1. 5 and 1. 3 times that of the control {{by the end of the}} first, second and third cycles, respectively, under high evaporative demand.

We review the available literature on water-evaporation reduction by duplex-oil films and outline the theoretical underpinnings of spreading and evaporation kinetics that govern behavior of these systems.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{utility of}} monomolecular layers ('monolayers') and other surface film {{materials for the}} reduction of open water evaporation has long been argued. However, outside the laboratory, trials to quantify the effectiveness of artificial surface films have produced highly variable results after application to water surfaces, whether natural water bodies or managed farm storages. This paper briefly reviews the physical mechanisms involved in evaporation suppression and the biophysical literature on aquatic surface microlayers. The wide-ranging results from sixteen months of outdoor trough-scale and (simultaneous) replicated bucket-scale <b>evaporation</b> <b>reduction</b> trials are interpreted using biophysical measurements made on microlayer and immediate subsurface water samples taken from the experimental troughs. When the prevailing environmental conditions and other ancillary measurements are taken into account, plausible hypotheses arise to account {{for at least some}} of the observed trial-to-trial differences in <b>evaporation</b> <b>reduction</b> and surface film performance. Results for the commercial monolayer product are inconclusive, as the concentration of the active ingredient in its formulation lacked the uniformity required for the accuracy at which these trials were conducted. Results for the temperature differential between open (unprotected) water and film-covered water, and the influence of windspeed on evaporative loss, indicate that the mechanism of evaporation suppression for mono-molecular (monolayer) organic films differs from that for thicker silicone oil films. These results have implications for both small-scale trialling of evaporation suppressants and the deployment and management of artificial surface film materials on agricultural water storages. In addition, it concluded that despite the attractiveness of simple side-by-side comparisons of performance, meaningful interpretation of results must consider prevailing meteorological conditions, and a timescale of hours rather than days. ...|$|E
40|$|Journal of Hydrology, 312 Abstract Oasis {{self-supporting}} mechanisms due to oasis breeze circulation (OBC) {{are proposed}} and simulated numerically {{in this study}} using a coupled mesoscale and land-surface model.

The sensible heat-ﬂux gradient from oasis to surrounding desert drives the OBC with downdraft over the oasis and updraft over the desert. The horizontal length-scale of the OBC is around four times {{as large as the}} oasis scale. This secondary circulation creates two mechanisms to reduce heat and moisture exchange between the oasis and the surrounding desert: (1) the updraft over the desert reduces low-level hot, dry air ﬂowing from the desert into the oasis; and (2) the downdraft increases the atmospheric static stability that reduces the oasis <b>evaporation.</b> <b>Reduction</b> of the oasis scale weakens the oasis self-supporting mechanisms through the decrease of the OBC associated with the increase of the oasis surface evaporation and decrease of the atmospheric stability over the oasis...|$|E

Salinity, total phosphorous (TP), phosphate, total nitrogen (TN), nitrate, chlorophyll-a and relative abundance of the thrombolite microflora were measured in Lake Clifton to analyse changing conditions in this lake and to determine the effect of these water parameters on the thrombolite community. Comparisons with historical data revealed a significant increase in salinity since 1985 and a possible increase in phosphorus concentrations in the lake in the recent decade, although historical nutrient data are rather sparse.

Results: Liquid silicate droplets (~ 2 mm) were maintained stable in levitation using a nozzle with a 0. 8 mm bore and an opening angle of 60 °. The gas flow was ~ 250 ml min- 1. Rock powders were melted and homogenized for microchemcial analyses. Laser melting produced chemically homogeneous glass spheres. Only highly (e. g.
