25|$|Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when {{outdoor air}} is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, {{depending}} on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, {{they use the}} ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up {{the temperature of the}} ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>system</b> by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.|$|E

To get a clearer {{view on the}} real performance of <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems,</b> the WP-DIRECT-project (<b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> in sustainable, innovative and realistic energy concepts) was started in 2008. In this project, around 15 <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems</b> in dwellings are measured to determine their real-life performance (SPF = seasonal performance factor). To measure this performance, calorimeters and electrical energy sensors were installed following the EN 15450 standard: Heating systems in buildings- Design of <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems.</b> The monitoring data provided by these sensors will be available through an internet connection for an extra year. Furthermore, <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are considered as controllable loads in the smart grid context.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems</b> offer {{economical}} alternatives {{of recovering}} heat from different sources {{for use in}} various industrial, commercial and residential applications. As the cost of energy continues to rise, it becomes imperative to save energy and improve overall energy efficiency. In this light, the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> becomes a key component in an energy recovery system with great potential for energy saving. Improving <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> performance, reliability, and its environmental impact has been an ongoing concern. Recent progresses in <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems</b> have centred upon advanced cycle designs for both heat- and work-actuated systems, improved cycle components (including choice of working fluid), and exploiting utilisation in {{a wider range of}} applications. For the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> to be an economical proposition, continuous efforts need to be devoted to improving its performance and reliability while discovering novel applications. Some recent research efforts have markedly improved the energy efficiency of <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> For example, the incorporation of a heat-driven ejector to the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> has improved <b>system</b> efficiency by more than 20 %. Additionally, the development of better compressor technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption of <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems</b> by as much as 80 %. The evolution of new hybrid systems has also enabled the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> to perform efficiently with wider applications. For example, incorporating a desiccant to a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> cycle allowed better humidity and temperature controls with achievable COP as high as 6. This review paper provides an update on recent developments in <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems,</b> and is intended to be a "one-stop" archive of known practical <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> solutions. The paper, broadly divided into three main sections, begins with a review of the various methods of enhancing the performance of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> This is followed by a review of the major hybrid <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>systems</b> suitable for application with various heat sources.

5000|$|The {{sustainable}} {{approach to}} the redevelopment has focused on passive measures to maximise light penetration and maximising thermal performance of all new walls and windows. Active measures {{include the use of}} geothermal boreholes, which feed a ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>system</b> plus a biomass boiler, using waste timber material formed into woodchips, to provide heating and hot water via a centralised system. The ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>system</b> consists of a network of 100 m deep boreholes, through which fluid is pumped. This combination of heating technologies ensures the building’s supply of heating and hot water is virtually 100% renewable.

50|$|Air-source {{heat pumps}} are more popular in milder winter climates where the {{temperature}} is frequently {{in the range of}} 40-55 °F (4-13 °C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>system</b> must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>system</b> will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.|$|E
