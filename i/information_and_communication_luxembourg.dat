40|$|The use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> {{technology}} {{has increased in}} the society, and {{can be useful in}} nursing care. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe district nurses' attitudes regarding the implementation of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in home nursing. The first and third authors performed five focus group discussions with 19 district nurses' from five primary healthcare centres in northern Sweden. During the focus group discussions, the following topics were discussed: the current and future use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in home nursing; expectations, advantages, disadvantages and hindrances in the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in home nursing; and the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology from an ethical perspective. The transcribed focus group discussions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that district nurses' attitudes were positive regarding the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in their work. They also asked for possibilities to influence the design and its introduction. However, the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in home nursing can be described as a complement to communication that could not replace human physical encounters. Improvements and risks, as well as the importance of physical presence in home nursing were considered vital. The results revealed that the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology requires changes in the district nurses' work situation.

Followed by a short historical overview of the application of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in educational processes. In the empirical part the results of the research are presented, which I conducted in the elementary school with pupils from sixth grade in home economics class. Pedagogical experiment lasted fourteen days, pupils were split into two groups – the control and the experimental group. In the control group they were repeating the home economics subject matter using the worksheet, and in the experimental group they were solving a quiz, which was accessible on the internet. My purpose was to find out what students think about the usage of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology for teaching, and whether they consider classes more interesting, if we put it in the teaching process. I also tried to determine whether the pupils repeating the subject matter with the help of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology will better remember the subject matter. I found that pupils, who repeated the subject matter in home economics with the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology, achieved a better result in the examination, and also remembered the subject matter better. In integrating <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in home economics class it is necessary to be aware that the pupils wish to use <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology more frequently, and that they find teaching with the help of computer in home economics class more interesting than frontal methods of teaching. Therefore, the integration of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology in home economics class makes sense. ...|$|R

The Federal State Educational Standards for elementary education calls for developing pupils’ motivation sphere at every lesson and in each school subject. There is a system of means of developing pupils’ learning motivation which were elaborated in pedagogy and psychology but modern education places special emphasis on <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technologies. The purpose of the research is to define pedagogical and psychological conditions of using <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technologies {{as a means of}} develop a pupil's learning motivation in elementary school. We supposed that there were three main conditions: the first one is to use <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technologies at different stages of a lesson; the second one is to teach pupils to make use of these technologies; the third is to have pupils use <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technologies in educational activity without assistance. We made our research with the primary goal to examine conditions during complex experimental work in elementary school. According to the results, we made a system of lessons using <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technologies at different stages of lessons and teach pupils how to use these technologies on their own.

40|$|The Norwegian {{hospital}} {{field is}} subject {{to a series of}} continuous change processes. The comprehensive reforms introduced over the two last decades coincide with a clear {{increase in the number of}} <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> professionals employed in Norwegian hospitals. In reform documents, strategy plans and steering letters, challenges related to <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> is stressed as important for both the daily business of and the more profound change processes in the Norwegian hospital system. In this working paper, the central discussion revolves around the relation between reforms, steering and management on the one hand, <b>and</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work on the other. Departing from the somewhat unclear distinction between reputation management, unidirectional <b>information</b> <b>and</b> multidirectional <b>communication,</b> three questions are raised and discussed: Firstly, the relationship between marketization <b>and</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work: As NPM reforms build on premises of increased transparency <b>and</b> open <b>information</b> exchange, does (quasi-) marketization following NPM entail an increased focus on <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work? Secondly, the role of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work in relation to the population’s trust towards the system is discussed: In the current narrative of welfare state crisis, to what extent can <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work be connected to the re-establishment, sustainment or development of trust-based relations between the hospitals and their surroundings? Thirdly, <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work is discussed in relation to the balance between central control and local autonomy in hospital governance: To what extent is the nature of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work dependent on the relative distance between those who govern and those that are governed, and on new tools of steering and management? A central argument forwarded in the paper is that in spite of the relatively clear ambition for <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> work to solve issues of increased complexity and contribute to a higher degree of integration, the opposite may be the case: An increasing complexity may well also increase ambiguity in our understanding of this line of work within the hospital sector.
