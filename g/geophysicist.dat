5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most {{earthquakes}} in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. One <b>geophysicist</b> has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US <b>geophysicist</b> has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian <b>geophysicist</b> and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E

The term is named after Serbian <b>geophysicist</b> and astronomer Milutin Milanković. In the 1920s, he theorized that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit resulted in cyclical variation in the solar radiation reaching the Earth, and that this orbital forcing strongly influenced climatic patterns on Earth.|$|E

25|$|Bardeen {{stayed on}} for some time at Wisconsin furthering his studies, but he {{eventually}} went to work for Gulf Research Laboratories, the research arm of the Gulf Oil Corporation, based in Pittsburgh. From 1930 to 1933, Bardeen worked there on the development of methods for the interpretation of magnetic and gravitational surveys. He worked as a <b>geophysicist.</b> After the work failed to keep his interest, he applied and was accepted to the graduate program in mathematics at Princeton University.|$|E
25|$|When Alvin {{inspected}} one of {{the sites}} they located, the scientists observed black smoke billowing out of the vents, something not observed at the Galápagos Rift. Ballard and <b>geophysicist</b> Jean Francheteau went down in Alvin {{the day after the}} black smokers were first observed. They were able to take an accurate temperature reading of the active vent (the previous dive's thermometer had melted), and recorded 350°C (662°F). They continued searching for more vents along the East Pacific Rise between 1980 and 1982.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{airborne}} detectors to prospect for radioactive minerals was first proposed by G.C. Ridland, a <b>geophysicist</b> working at Port Radium in 1943. In 1947, the earliest recorded trial {{of airborne}} radiation detectors (ionization chambers and Geiger counters) {{was conducted by}} Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited.

25|$|The {{three major}} {{employers}} of career physicists are academic institutions, laboratories, and private industries, {{with the largest}} employer being the last. Physicists in academia or government labs tend to have titles such as Assistants, Professors, Sr./Jr. Scientist, or postdocs. As per the American Institute for Physics, some 20% of new physics Ph.D.s holds jobs in engineering development programs, while 14% turn to computer software and about 11% are in business/education. A majority of physicists employed apply their skills and training to interdisciplinary sectors (e.g. finance). Job titles for graduate physicists include Agricultural Scientist, Air Traffic Controller, Biophysicist, Computer Programmer, Electrical Engineer, Environmental Analyst, <b>Geophysicist,</b> Medical Physicist, Meteorologist, Oceanographer, Physics Teacher/Professor/Researcher, Physiognomist, Research Scientist, Reactor Physicist, Engineering Physicist, Satellite Missions Analyst, Science Writer, Stratigrapher, Software Engineer, Systems Engineer, Microelectronics Engineer, Radar Developer, Technical Consultant, etc.|$|E
