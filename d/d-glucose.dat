25|$|Amygdalin {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1830 from bitter almond seeds (Prunus dulcis) by Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard. Liebig and Wöhler found three hydrolysis products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide). Later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it into <b>D-glucose,</b> benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, <b>D-glucose,</b> and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Dextrins are a {{group of}} low-molecular-weight {{carbohydrates}} produced by the hydrolysis of starch or glycogen. Dextrins are mixtures of polymers of <b>D-glucose</b> units linked by α-(1→4) or α-(1→6) glycosidic bonds.|$|E
25|$|Some β-glucan {{molecules}} have branching glucose side-chains {{attached to}} other {{positions on the}} main <b>D-glucose</b> chain, which branch off the β-glucan backbone. In addition, these side-chains can be attached to other types of molecules, like proteins, as in polysaccharide-K.|$|E
25|$|Oat {{beta-glucan}} is a viscous polysaccharide made up {{of units}} of the monosaccharide <b>D-glucose.</b> Oat beta-glucan is composed of mixed-linkage polysaccharides. This means the bonds between the <b>D-glucose</b> or D-glucopyranosyl units are either beta-1, 3 linkages or beta-1, 4 linkages. This type of beta-glucan is {{also referred to as}} a mixed-linkage (1→3), (1→4)-beta-D-glucan. The (1→3)-linkages break up the uniform structure of the beta-D-glucan molecule and make it soluble and flexible. In comparison, the indigestible polysaccharide cellulose is also a beta-glucan, but is not soluble because of its (1→4)-beta-D-linkages. The percentages of beta-glucan in the various whole oat products are: oat bran, having from 5.5% to 23.0%; rolled oats, about 4%; and whole oat flour about 4%.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, a {{disaccharide}} {{composed of}} one D-galactose molecule and one <b>D-glucose</b> molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The systematic name for lactose is O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include maltose (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides {{can be classified}} into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, <b>d-glucose</b> and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|When saffron is dried {{after its}} harvest, the heat, {{combined}} with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield <b>D–glucose</b> {{and a free}} safranal molecule. Safranal, a volatile oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma. Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples. A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like. Chemists find {{this is the most}} powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal. Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating pH levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and oxidising agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.|$|E
2500|$|Sorbitol {{also may}} be {{synthesized}} through a catalytic hydrogenation of <b>d-glucose</b> to form d-sorbitol [...] This reaction has a 100% yield of d-sorbitol when <b>d-glucose</b> is reacted with hydrogen in water at 120 degrees Celsius, under 150001.5 Torr, for 1 hour.|$|E
2500|$|Glucans are {{arranged}} in six-sided <b>D-glucose</b> rings connected linearly at varying carbon positions depending on the source, although most commonly β-glucans include a 1-3 glycosidic link in their backbone. Although technically β-glucans are chains of <b>D-glucose</b> polysaccharides linked by β-type glycosidic bonds, by convention not all β-D-glucose polysaccharides are categorized as β-glucans. Cellulose is not typically considered a β-glucan, as it is insoluble and does not exhibit the same physicochemical properties as other cereal or yeast β-glucans.|$|E
2500|$|Sucrose, pictured to the right, is {{the most}} {{abundant}} disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants. It is composed of one <b>D-glucose</b> molecule and one D-fructose molecule. The systematic name for sucrose, O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things: ...|$|E
2500|$|In metabolism, the β-glycosidic bond in D-lactose is hydrolyzed to form D-galactose and <b>D-glucose,</b> {{which can}} be absorbed through the {{intestinal}} walls and into the bloodstream. [...] The overall reaction that lactase catalyzes is C12H22O11 + H2O → C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 + heat.|$|E
2500|$|Pectin {{is mainly}} D-galacturonic acid {{connected}} by α (1-4) glycosidic linkages. The side chains of pectin may contain {{small amounts of}} other sugars such as L-fructose, <b>D-glucose,</b> D-mannose, and D-xylose. In jams, pectin is what thickens the final product via cross-linking of the large polymer chains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} forms of β-glucans are those {{comprising}} <b>D-glucose</b> units with β-1,3 links. [...] Yeast and fungal β-glucans contain 1-6 side branches, while cereal β-glucans contain both β-1,3 and β-1,4 backbone bonds. The frequency, location, {{and length of}} the side-chains {{may play a role}} in immunomodulation. Differences in molecular weight, shape, and structure of β-glucans dictate the differences in biological activity.|$|E
2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose <b>D-glucose,</b> for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making <b>D-glucose</b> one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light. This usage of [...] "d-" [...] and [...] "l-" [...] is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{catalytic}} {{mechanism of}} D-lactose hydrolysis retains the substrate anomeric configuration in the products. [...] While {{the details of}} the mechanism are uncertain, the stereochemical retention is achieved through a double displacement reaction. [...] Studies of E. coli lactase have proposed that hydrolysis is initiated when a glutamate nucleophile on the enzyme attacks from the axial side of the galactosyl carbon in the β-glycosidic bond. [...] The removal of the <b>D-glucose</b> leaving group may be facilitated by Mg-dependent acid catalysis. [...] The enzyme is liberated from the α-galactosyl moiety upon equatorial nucleophilic attack by water, which produces D-galactose.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the sensors adopting environmentally sensitive dyes have utilized [...] , transport protein that binds to <b>D-glucose</b> and D-galactose and transports them to the membrane-bound Trg receptor triggering the chemotaxis of the bacterium towards that glucose source. It belongs to the malG family in Escherichia coli, which includes the maltose-binding protein, which, depending {{on the presence of}} glucose, can adopt two distinct conformations or possibly three generating a 31° hinge movement between the two globular domains connected by a hindge, which is the glucose-binding pocket. Its affinity for glucose is K= 0.2 µM, which is much lower than the pathophysiological range of glucose found in diabetes (1.7-33 mM). As a consequence, several studies have been done to lower the affinity of [...] , which otherwise would result in near-saturation of [...] throughout the pathophysiological glucose concentrations. The binding affinity of [...] changes when it is labelled endosterically or peristerically, so several mutants that work at range close to pathophysiological glucose have been created.|$|E
