These friction losses are responsible for up to 10 % penalty in fuel economy over the official drive cycles like the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), where the <b>temperature</b> of the <b>oil</b> even {{at the end of}} the 1180 s of the drive cycle is below the fully warmed up values of between 100 °C and 120 °C.

Therefore <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 100 °C are desirable to minimize engine wear through blow by condensate.

40|$|The {{market for}} heavy duty engines is {{constantly}} requiring engines {{that should be}} more and more powerful, while still maintaining low fuel consumption. As a result of increasing engine power, the engine and coolant temperature increases as well due to insufficient cooling performance (because of design issues, cost etc.). Also, emission legislations, both current and future, require more and more measures to be taken by engine manufacturers. One way of meeting the legislations is the use of cooled EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), which also lead to increased coolant temperatures. Both these factors also naturally lead to increased <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the consequences of which are not thoroughly investigated. This thesis project aims to investigate effects of high <b>temperatures</b> on <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> degradation, with focus on the greatest degradation process: oxidation. To do this several engine runs have been performed on a 310 hp engine with EGR to see what happens to the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> in a real engine when exposed to high temperatures. During the tests oil samples have been taken and analysed for important parameters. As a complement to these engine tests some laboratory oxidation testing have also been performed, to be able to compare engine test data with laboratory tests. One goal of the project was to try to formulate an empirical oxidation model, which would be able to predict oil oxidation levels in an engine, given any running parameters. This model was {{to be based on the}} results of the <b>engine</b> tests and <b>oil</b> analysis. This goal was not achieved though, as it showed that the engine tests were too short to show any good tendencies in oil oxidation. It was therefore decided that further and longer engine tests were to be made, but these did not fit into the timeframe of this project. However, an embryo of an oxidation model has been presented, and suggestions for further development have been made. Another goal was to clarify where and to what extent the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> is exposed to high temperatures in an engine, and to discuss what can be done to improve the situation. Whether or not a dedicated <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> gauge in production engines is needed, and where that would be mounted, is discussed. This has been done based on the results of the engine and laboratory testing. One interesting finding is that increasing the flow to the piston cooling system does not seem to improve anything for the oil; instead the oil consumption as well as oil oxidation seems to be able to increase. Another conclusion is that using a sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> gauge as a standard part of the new engine generation might be a good idea, since it has been shown that high <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the sump have great negative effects on <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> oxidation, and that the <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> in the sump is behaving quite irregularly in relation to other <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures.</b> To support the work in this project a thorough literature survey was undertaken including various SAE and other technical papers, books and Scania reports. Based on these facts the procedures behind <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> oxidation on a chemical level have been investigated, among other things. For confidentiality reasons this report has been edited in such a way that absolute values of measured parameters have been removed. Where possible, these values have been replaced by percentages of normal values. Marknaden för tunga motorer kräver ständigt motorer som är starkare och starkare, men som ändå behåller en låg bränsleförbrukning. Ett resultat av att göra motorer starkare är att motoroch kylvattentemperaturer ökar, på grund av otillräcklig kylning (på grund av konstruktionsmässiga skäl, kostnader och dylikt). Dessutom kräver nuvarande och framtida emmissionslagstiftning att fler och fler åtgärder vidtas av motortillverkare världen över. Ett sätt att tillmötesgå lagkraven är användandet av kyld EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), vilket också leder till ökade kylvattentemperaturer. Båda dessa faktorer leder också till ökade motoroljetemperaturer, med följder som ej är grundligt utredda. Detta examensarbete syftar till att utreda följderna av höga temperaturer på motoroljedegradering, med inriktning mot den grövsta degraderingsprocessen: oxidation. För att göra detta har ett antal motortest utförts på en 310 hk motor med EGR för att se vad som händer med motoroljan när den utsätts för höga temperaturer. Under dessa tester har oljeprover tagits för analys av viktiga oxidationsparametrar. Som ett komplement till dessa motorprover har även oxidationstester utförts i oljelaboratorium, för att kunna jämföra motortestdata med laboratorietestdata. Ett mål med detta projekt har varit att försöka formulera en empirisk oxidationsmodell, som skulle kunna förutsäga oljeoxidationsnivåer i en motor, givet godtyckliga driftsparametrar. Denna modell skulle baseras på resultaten från motor- och labbtesterna. Detta mål uppnåddes inte dock, då det visade sig att motorproverna var för korta för att visa några tydliga tendenser i oljeoxidation. Det beslutades därför att ytterliggare och längre motorprov skulle köras, men dessa rymdes tyvärr inte inom tidsramen för detta examensarbete. Ett embryo till en oxidationsmodell har ändå föreslagits, och förslag för vidareutveckling av denna har presenterats. Ett annat mål med projektet var att klargöra var och i vilken utsträckning motoroljan utsätts för höga temperaturer i en motor, samt att diskutera vad som kan göras för att förbättra situationen. Huruvida en dedikerad temperaturgivare för motoroljetemperatur går att motivera i produktionsmotorer, och vart denna i så fall skulle sitta, diskuteras. Detta har gjorts med grund i resultaten från motor- och labbproverna. En intressant slutsats är att ökat flöde til...|$|R

In this study two types of agricultural tractors (MF 285 and U 650) and some tillage implements such as centrifugal type spreader, boom type sprayer and rotary tiller were employed. Some of the exhausted gases from both tractors in each condition were measured such as, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2) and nitrogen oxide (NO). <b>Engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> was measured at every step for both types of tractors.

Also, {{it is possible to}} use the carbon foam to heat the engine oil during startup to reduce emissions and possibly engine wear. The mesophase pitch derived carbon foam, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a material that offers excellent thermal management capability. The foam has an open cell structure (0. 98 fraction open porosity) with graphitic ligaments aligned parallel to the cell walls. The alignment of the graphitic ligaments in a three dimensional array gives the foam homogeneous thermal properties, unlike graphite fibers. The bulk thermal conductivity of the foam has been measured to be 175 W/m{center_dot}K, placing it on the level of 6061 aluminum, which has a bulk thermal conductivity of 180 W/m{center_dot}K. Copper has a bulk thermal conductivity over two times higher, at 400 W/m{center_dot}K. The proposed research will entail using the carbon foam, with its excellent thermal management capabilities, as a cooling and heating medium for engine oil, or in other words an oil temperature regulator. The foam will aid in maintaining a specific oil temperature during steady state operation and in heating of the engine oil at startup. Being able to maintain a consistent oil temperature will ensure better operation of engine oil, by extending the life of the oil and engine.

As such, a network-based approach was employed to demonstrate the contributions of the different components of the PCM to the overall team process. Information processing patterns that are not modelled in the original PCM were found. Implications for this work in relation to modelling distributed cognition and application in the naturalistic decision making literature are discussed. Relevance to industry: The Perceptual Cycle Model underpins much research with industrial relevance, including decision making and situation awareness. Teams are a feature in all industrial applications; however the perceptual cycle model has yet to be applied to teams. A case study investigating a team representation of the perceptual cycle is presented and the implications discussed...|$|E
40|$|Reliability and {{performance}} of modern engines are directly dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} lubricating systems. To be effective, an engine lubricating system must successfully perform the functions of minimizing friction between the bearing surfaces of moving parts, dissipating heat, and keeping the engine parts clean by removing carbon and other foreign matter. In almost all modern internal-combustion engines, the system that provides the lube for these functions is the forced-lubrication system. Although there are many variations in lubricating systems for internal-combustion engines, the components and method of operation are basically the same. Steady state thermal analysis is carried out for the thermal fluid flow in the engine. Solidwork software is used for modeling the design and steady state analysis. The upper piston with variation of groove has been design for this simulation. For each piston, four different radius of groove design at the upper piston are use to analyze the thermal effect to the cylinder head and <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>temperature.</b> For conclusion, the quality of engine lubrication depends upon how much oil is supplied and how the lubricant is fed under thermal load of the components. This state of lubrication is closely related to the safe operation of an engine and its lifetime. Therefore, a practically optimized analytical method has been required by engine designers...|$|E
40|$|The {{fretting}} wear behaviour of forged hypereutectic P/M Al-Si {{in contact with}} hardened steel and Cu-Sn-Pb bearing material is investigated. Fretting tests are performed {{with a view to}} the movement in the contact between the small end of the connecting rod and the piston pin in a car engine. Therefore, the tests are carried out under <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> lubrication at <b>temperatures</b> up to 150 degrees C. The behaviour of the Al alloy is compared to that of steel, the current connecting rod material. Some tests under non-lubricated conditions are also performed. The correlation between the friction coefficient, the wear volume and the microscopic wear mechanisms is discussed. After the running-in wear, a stable wear condition is reached for the Al-Si/steel contact. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston {{of an air}} cooled engine was {{investigated}} by measuring the heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston rings. <b>Engine</b> sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>oil</b> viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston ring. Engine load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler sump. Changes in oil viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase oil splash, its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>engine</b> load as well as sump <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>oil</b> viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|R
2500|$|During 1991, a 1.8L 16-valve engine {{producing}} [...] (also {{first seen}} in the Renault 19) capable of propelling the car to [...] {{was introduced to the}} Clio engine range, known simply as the Clio 16S in France (S for [...] "soupapes", the French word for valves), and Clio 16V in export markets. It was the successor to the Renault 5 GT Turbo, which was discontinued that year as the R5 range was pruned back. As well as having a higher top speed than a regular Clio, the 16S sports wider plastic front wings, an offset bonnet vent, wider rear arches and uprated suspension and brakes, and colour-coded front mirrors and bumpers. The RSi side skirts were omitted, however. Inside, the 16V model has an extended instrument panel that houses dials for <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> pressure, <b>oil</b> <b>temperature,</b> and <b>oil</b> level (which only indicates on engine start). The seats are also more supportive to match the sporting nature of the model. The non-catalyzed versions, still available in some markets, offer [...] and marginally higher performance with top speeds up to [...] and the 0–100km/h time dropping from 8 to 7.8seconds.|$|R
