25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a <b>gauging</b> <b>stick</b> and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
50|$|Filet-work is {{the result}} of {{knotting}} a fabric of diagonal or square meshes to create an open fabric called Lace. The tool to make a Knotted Net Lace is a Shuttle-Needle and a <b>Gauge</b> <b>stick</b> for measure of the meshes.|$|R
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and levelled {{to get ready for the}} rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct <b>gauge</b> with <b>gauge</b> <b>sticks</b> and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.|$|R
5000|$|Treble jigs (also {{called the}} hard or heavy jig) are {{performed}} in hard shoes, {{and also to}} a [...] time metre. They are characterized by stomps, trebles, and clicks. Many set dances are performed in treble jig time, a few being Drunken <b>Gauger,</b> Blackthorn <b>Stick,</b> The Three Sea Captains, and St Patrick's Day. Two types of treble jigs are performed at feiseanna: the traditional and non-traditional (slow) treble jigs. Beginners will do a treble jig at traditional speed (92 bpm), while more advanced dancers will dance the non-traditional (slow) treble jig at 72 bpm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The strain {{measurement}} is a {{most important}} and absolutely necessary task on the probing into {{the constitution of the}} materials. The ways of strain measurement are theoretically divided as the mechanical type, vibrating-string type, inductive type and bonded resistance type, and the last one is widely used for its high precision and convenience. The geogrid, which has been widespread in the reinforcement structures, is more and more popular for its high strength, good toughness, corrosion resistant, anti-fatigue and effective interaction with soil. The geogrid is made of polymer, its ultimate strain can reach above 10 %, and it is sensitive to the time, furthermore it usually has significant relative displacement with soil in the tests. Then some measures have to be taken to make the measuring range wider and make the all gauges achieving synchronization, measures also should be conducted to prevent the strain gauges separated from the geogrid when it has slightly bending, prevent the wires break when the gauges going forward and reduce the influences from the forward preventing measures. Some researchers have showed their techniques to avoiding part of the above problems. Based on a series of pullout tests of geogrid, this paper gives the contrast and analysis on those techniques above, and lists the relative measures that used in these tests, especially for the <b>gauge</b> <b>sticking</b> techniques and preventive measures...|$|R
50|$|The Kelantan Department of Drainage and Irrigation {{has since}} {{replaced}} the <b>stick</b> <b>gauges</b> with metric plates. This facilitates {{the prediction of}} flood levels and lead-times in villages {{all the way from}} Kuala Krai to the river estuary. The steps, and the floodwater level, can be seen on the Kuala Krai Flood Webcam.|$|R
50|$|The {{pointing}} stick senses {{applied force}} by using {{two pairs of}} resistive strain <b>gauges.</b> A pointing <b>stick</b> {{can be used by}} pushing with the fingers in the general direction the user wants the cursor to move. The velocity of the pointer depends on the applied force so increasing pressure causes faster movement. The relation between pressure and cursor or pointer speed can be adjusted, similar to the way the mouse speed is adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|Rain gauges {{have their}} limitations. Attempting to collect rain {{data in a}} {{hurricane}} can be nearly impossible and unreliable (even if the equipment survives) due to wind extremes. Also, rain gauges only indicate rainfall in a localized area. For virtually any <b>gauge,</b> drops will <b>stick</b> to the sides or funnel of the collecting device, such that amounts are very slightly underestimated, and those of [...]01 inches or [...]25 mm may be recorded as a trace.|$|R
50|$|To avoid hauling a long {{length of}} loose twine through each knot, the twine is wound up on a netting shuttle or netting needle. This {{must be done}} {{correctly}} to prevent twisting as it is used, but makes net production much faster. A <b>gauge</b> (a smooth <b>stick)</b> is used to keep the loops {{the same size and}} the mesh even. The first and last rows are generally done with a half-size gauge, so that the edges of the net will be smooth.|$|R
50|$|Just {{upstream}} {{from the town}} is {{the confluence of the}} Lebir and Galas rivers to become the Kelantan river, and it became clear that an elevated river level at the Bradley Steps was a good predictor of imminent flooding in the cultivated and populated river basin further downstream. Consequently, <b>stick</b> <b>gauges</b> were placed by the steps so that the river level could be read and monitored by the local police, who transmitted the rainfall and water level information via VHF sets to the Flood Warning and Relief Committee in Kota Bharu.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flexible polymer {{heart valves}} are {{promising}} clinical prostheses for replacement of diseased or malfunctioned natural heart valves. However, the flexible polymer leaflets {{are prone to}} fatigue fracture, which hinders their practicality in clinical applications. In this study, micro strain sensor (gauge) for strain measurement is designed in the polyurethane (PU) thin film to measure the stress/strain in situ. In our design, the strain gauge is embedded in PU which is different to the commercial strain <b>gauge</b> of <b>sticking</b> to the sample. The metal layer of strain gauge {{used in this study}} is gold. The overall size of the designed strain gauge is 1 mm x 1 mm x 0. 1 μm and the resistance value was measured to be 200 ± 30 Ω. The static test of strain gauge without damp proof shows that gauge sensitivity G was measured to be 4 and 1. 8 when strain range is less than 1 % and between 1 - 1. 5 %, respectively. While, the static test of strain gauge with damp proof shows that gauge sensitivity G was measured to be 2. 6 when strain range is less than 1. 2 %. Dynamic test of strain gauge was also applied in this study...|$|R
5000|$|The river has {{an average}} {{gradient}} of 178 feet per mile (33.7 m/km or 3%) {{with a half}} mile (800 m) section dropping roughly 342 ft and containing 11 major class IV+ to V+ rapids. Through this area the water often channels through extremely tight slots as narrow as 4 ft wide as the river funnels through a stunning gorge. The three major rapids on the river ("The Big Three") are called [...] "Go Left and Die", [...] "Gorilla" [...] and [...] "Sunshine". Gorilla is considered the most visually impressive rapid on the river. It consists of the river funneling into a 4 ft-wide slot ("The Notch") and is then immediately followed by an 18 ft waterfall ("the flume") and then another 10 ft waterfall ("Scream Machine"). Sunshine is considered the most difficult and dangerous rapid, and consists of a 14 ft waterfall landing on a jagged rock shelf below. The route through Sunshine is about 4 ft wide and mistakes here {{have been known to}} cause paralysis. The river gets considerably more difficult at higher water levels, however the Green has been run at up to 300% flows (over 30" [...] on the <b>stick</b> <b>gauge).</b>|$|R
