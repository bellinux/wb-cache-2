40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the direct spatial {{measurement}} of the two-dimensional <b>gain</b> <b>profiles</b> for the Ne-like Ge 196 Å laser line using a slab target illuminated by the multiple pulse technique. To understand the spatial dependence for Ge plasmas driven {{by a series of}} 100 ps pulses 400 ps apart we did a series of Nova experiments backlighting short Ge amplifiers. Two-dimensional, high-resolution, spatial images of the 196 Å laser emission from the output aperture of the amplifiers were measured to determine the spatial position of the gain. The amplifier lengths were chosen to be short enough to avoid the significant refraction effects which have dominated the analysis of previous near field imaging experiments. To assure good temporal overlap, the traveling wave geometry was used to illuminate both the amplifier and backlighter. The amplifier design included a wire fiducial that provided an absolute spatial reference and avoided the usual difficulty of determining the location of the target surface. We compare the measured spatial <b>gain</b> <b>profiles</b> with simulations done using LASNEX, which calculates the hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma, and XRASER, which uses the temperatures and densities from LASNEX to do the gain and kinetics calculations...|$|R

50|$|Complete single-shot {{spectral}} {{profiles of}} modulation instability and supercontinuum have been mapped into the time domain with the TS-DFT for capture at megahertz repetition rates. These experiments {{have been used}} to collect large volumes of spectra data very rapidly, permitting detailed statistical analyses of the underlying dynamics in ways that are exceedingly difficult or impossible to achieve with standard measurement techniques. Latent intrapulse correlations have been identified in modulation instability and supercontinuum spectra through such experiments. In particular, spectral measurements with the TS-DFT have been employed to reveal a number of key aspects of modulation instability in the pulsed (i.e., temporally-confined) scenario. Experimental data show that modulation instability amplifies discrete spectral modes, which exhibit mode asymmetry between Stokes and anti-Stokes wavelengths. Furthermore, the dynamics display prominent competition effects between these amplified modes, an interaction that favors domination of one mode over others. Such TS-DFT measurements have provided insights into the mechanism that often causes single patterns to dominate a given spatial or temporal region in the various contexts in which modulation instability appears. This type of exclusive mode growth is also influential in the initiation of optical rogue waves. Optically, these features become apparent in single-shot studies of pulse-driven modulation instability, but such effects are normally unrecognizable in time-averaged measurements due to inhomogeneous broadening of the modulation instability <b>gain</b> <b>profile.</b> The acquisition {{of a large number of}} such single-shot spectra also has a critical role in these analyses. This measurement technique has been used to measure supercontinuum spectra spanning an octave in bandwidth, and in such broadband measurements, rare rogue solitons have been observed at redshifted wavelengths. Single-shot spectral measurements with the TS-DFT have also recorded rogue-wave-like probability distributions caused by cascaded Raman dynamics in the process of intracavity Raman conversion in a partially mode-locked fiber laser.|$|E
50|$|TS-DFT {{is usually}} {{used in a}} two step process. In the first step, the {{spectrum}} of an optical broadband pulse is encoded by the information (e.g., temporal, spatial, or chemical information) to be captured. In the next step, the encoded spectrum is mapped by large group-velocity dispersion into a slowed down temporal waveform. At this point the waveform has been sufficiently slowed down {{so it can be}} digitized and processed in real-time. Without the time stretch, single shot waveforms will be too fast to be digitized by analog to digital converters. Implemented in the optical domain, this process performs a similar function as slow motion used to see fast events in videos. While video slow motion is a simple process of playing back an already recorded event, the TS-DFT performs slow motion {{at the speed of light}} and before the signal is captured. When needed, the waveform is simultaneously amplified in the dispersive fiber by the process of stimulated Raman scattering. This optical amplification overcomes the thermal noise which would otherwise limit the sensitivity in real-time detection. Subsequent optical pulses perform repetitive measurements at the frame rate of the pulsed laser. Consequently, single shot optical spectra, carrying information from fast dynamic processes, can be digitized and analyzed at high frame rates. The time-stretch dispersive Fourier transformer consists of a low-loss dispersive fiber that is also a Raman amplifier. To create Raman gain, pump lasers are coupled into the fiber by wavelength-division multiplexers, with wavelengths of pump lasers chosen to create a broadband and flat <b>gain</b> <b>profile</b> that covers the spectrum of the broadband optical pulse. Instead of Raman amplification, a discrete amplifier such as an erbium doped optical amplifier or a semiconductor optical amplifier can be placed before the dispersive fiber. However the distributed nature of Raman amplification provides superior signal to noise ratio. Dispersive Fourier Transform has proven to be an enabling technology for wideband A/D conversion (ultra wideband analog to digital converters) and has also been used for high-throughput real-time spectroscopy and imaging (serial time-encoded amplified microscopy (STEAM)).|$|E
40|$|The {{contrast}} sensitivity function (CSF), {{a measure of}} visual sensitivity {{to a wide range}} of spatial frequencies, has been widely used as the <b>gain</b> <b>profile</b> of the front-end filter of the visual system to predict how we perceive spatial patterns.

Here, we applied the external noise paradigm and the perceptual template model (PTM) to characterize several major properties of the visual system. With the external noise normalized <b>gain</b> <b>profile,</b> nonlinearity, and internal additive and multiplicative noises, the PTM accounted for 92. 8 % of the variance in the experiment data measured in a wide range of conditions and revealed the major processing components that determine the CSF.
