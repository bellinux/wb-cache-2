5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous <b>hemianopsia),</b> or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal <b>hemianopsia)</b> if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (<b>hemianopsia).</b> He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
25|$|Neglect {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with <b>hemianopsia.</b> <b>Hemianopsia</b> arises from damage to the primary visual pathways cutting off the input to the cerebral hemispheres from the retinas. Neglect is damage to the processing areas. The cerebral hemispheres receive the input, but there is an error in the processing that is not well understood.|$|E
50|$|Different {{neurological}} difficulties cause characteristic {{forms of}} visual disturbances, including <b>hemianopsias</b> (shown below without macular sparing), quadrantanopsia, and others.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} low-cos device has been {{realized}} {{in order to}} sample the visual field (VF) within 20 ° and easy get important neuroophthalmological informations about central perimetry. Some typical techniques of image processing have been applied to the sampled fields in order to extract the main scotoma's features {{in terms of their}} shapes, sizes, positions, ecc. Furthermore, we propose some parameters which will help the diagnosis of campimetric lesions such as <b>hemianopsias</b> and quadrantanopsias...|$|R
25|$|Compression of the {{ipsilateral}} posterior {{cerebral artery}} will result in ischemia of the ipsilateral primary visual cortex and contralateral visual field deficits in both eyes (contralateral homonymous <b>hemianopsia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with right}} {{hemisphere}} brain damage often display sensory deficits such as left neglect, {{in which they}} ignore everything in the left visual field. This neglect can be present throughout many daily activities including reading, writing and self-care activities. For example, individuals with left neglect typically leave out details on the neglected side of drawings or try to draw out all the details on the nonneglected side. Homonymous <b>hemianopsia</b> is another sensory deficit that is sometimes observed in this population.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can occur}} during the aura {{phase of a}} {{migraine}} attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. Micropsia, along with <b>hemianopsia,</b> quadrantopsia, scotoma, phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, diplopia, dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, {{is a type of}} aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache. The symptom usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the migraine headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with migraine headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as micropsia are most common in children with migraines.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{frequently}} underappreciated, unilateral neglect {{can have}} dramatic consequences. [...] It has more {{negative effect on}} functional ability, {{as measured by the}} Barthel ADL index, than age, sex, power, side of stroke, balance, proprioception, cognition, or premorbid ADL status. Its presence within the first 10 days of a stroke is a stronger predictor of poor functional recovery after one year than several other variables, including hemiparesis, <b>hemianopsia,</b> age, visual memory, verbal memory, or visuoconstructional ability. [...] Neglect is likely among the reasons that patients with right hemisphere damage {{are twice as likely to}} fall as those with left brain damage. Patients with neglect rehabilitate longer and make less daily progress than other patients with similar functional status. [...] And patients with neglect are less likely to live independently than even patients who have both severe aphasia and right hemiparesis.|$|E

5000|$|Homonymous <b>hemianopsia</b> {{secondary}} to {{posterior cerebral artery}} occlusion [...] - [...] may result in syndromes of memory impairment, opposite visual field loss (homonymous <b>hemianopsia),</b> and sometimes hemisensory deficits. The PCA supplies the occipital lobe and the medial portion of the temporal lobe.|$|E
5000|$|Lesions in {{the optic}} tract {{correspond}} to visual field loss {{on the left}} or right half of the vertical midline, also known as homonymous <b>hemianopsia.</b> A lesion in the left optic tract will cause right-sided homonymous <b>hemianopsia,</b> while a lesion in the right optic tract will cause left-sided homonymous <b>hemianopsia.</b> Stroke, congenital defects, tumors, infection, and surgery are all possible causes of optic tract damage. Peripheral prism expanders and vision restitution therapy are often employed in patients with visual field loss resultant of permanent optic tract damage.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hemianopsia</b> or {{hemianopia}} is {{a visual}} field loss {{on the left}} or right side of the vertical midline. It can affect one eye but usually affects both eyes. Homonymous <b>hemianopsia,</b> or homonymous hemianopia, is hemianopic visual field loss {{on the same side of}} both eyes. Homonymous <b>hemianopsia</b> occurs because the right half of the brain has visual pathways for the left hemifield of both eyes, and the left half of the brain has visual pathways for the right hemifield of both eyes. When one of these pathways is damaged, the corresponding visual field is lost.|$|E

50|$|In bi{{temporal}} <b>hemianopsia</b> {{vision is}} missing in the outer (temporal or lateral) half of both {{the right and left}} visual fields. Information from the temporal visual field falls on the nasal (medial) retina. The nasal retina is responsible for carrying the information along the optic nerve, and crosses to the other side at the optic chiasm. When there is compression at optic chiasm the visual impulse from both nasal retina are affected, leading to inability to view the temporal, or peripheral, vision. This phenomenon is known as bitemporal <b>hemianopsia.</b> Knowing the neurocircuitry of visual signal flow through the optic tract is very important in understanding bitemporal <b>hemianopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Visual neglect (also called hemispatial neglect or {{unilateral}} spatial neglect) {{differs from}} <b>hemianopsia</b> {{in that it}} is a perceptual deficit rather than a visual one. Unlike patients with <b>hemianopsia</b> who actually don't see, those with visual neglect have no trouble seeing but are impaired in attending to and processing the visual information they receive. Whereas <b>hemianopsia</b> can be assuaged by allowing patients to move their eyes around a visual scene (ensuring that the entire scene makes it into their intact visual field), neglect cannot. Neglect can also apply to auditory or tactile stimuli and can even leave a patient unaware of one side {{of his or her own}} body.|$|E
50|$|The {{absence of}} vision in {{half of a}} visual field is {{described}} as <b>hemianopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transient homonymous <b>hemianopsia</b> {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mean stroke. For instance, it can constitute the aura phase of migraine. Concomitant presence of a moving scintillating scotoma is suggestive of migraine, but has been seen in cerebral cancer as well. Computed tomography (CT scan) or MRI can be used to investigate if stroke, tumor, structural lesion, or demyelination is the cause of homonymous <b>hemianopsia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{different}} types of treatments are available to patients with <b>hemianopsia,</b> depending on patient preference, age, type of <b>hemianopsia,</b> and how long they have been diagnosed. Some of these treatments include Audiovisual Stimulation Training, Explorative Saccade Training, Optical Visual Span Expanders, and Visual Restoration Therapy. None of these treatments will cure <b>hemianopsia,</b> but they will allow patients to have better perception {{of the world around}} them. Most doctors recommend the uses of a combination of these treatments, after a complete vision examination (Koons et al., 2010). Research is still being done on which of these treatments is most effective, and which patients will benefit the most from different combinations of treatments. The Department of Veteran Affairs medical center currently uses Explorative Saccade Training as their ‘go to’ form of treatment for patients with <b>hemianopsia</b> (Koons et al., 2010). Also, a treatment outcome model has been developed for Visual Restoration Therapy in order to better understand which patients this specific therapy will help (Guenther et al., 2009). More studies need to be done in order to develop a similar model for more of the <b>hemianopsia</b> treatments and different combinations of them. Currently, advantages and disadvantages are known for most treatments, which is discussed below along with descriptions of each treatment.|$|E

50|$|Vascular and {{neoplastic}} (malignant or benign tumours) lesions {{from the}} optic tract, to visual cortex {{can cause a}} contralateral homonymous <b>hemianopsia.</b> Injury {{to the right side}} of the brain will affect the left visual fields of each eye. The more posterior the cerebral lesion, the more symmetric (congruous) the homonymous <b>hemianopsia</b> will be. For example, a person who has a lesion of the right optic tract will no longer see objects on his left side. Similarly, a person who has a stroke to the right occipital lobe will have the same visual field defect, usually more congruent between the two eyes, and there may be macular sparing.A stroke on {{the right side of the}} brain (especially parietal lobe), in addition to producing a homonymous <b>hemianopsia,</b> may also lead to the syndrome of hemispatial neglect.|$|E
