5|$|The {{thioredoxin}} system {{contains the}} 12-kDa protein thioredoxin and its companion thioredoxin reductase. Proteins related to thioredoxin {{are present in}} all sequenced organisms. Plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of thioredoxin consists of two neighboring cysteines, {{as part of a}} highly conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active <b>dithiol</b> form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E
5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a <b>dithiol</b> that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis of}} dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the <b>dithiol</b> groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.|$|E
40|$|Most pharmaceutically {{relevant}} {{proteins and}} many extracellular proteins contain disulfide bonds. Formation {{of the correct}} disulfide bonds is essential for stability in almost all cases. Disulfide containing proteins can be rapidly and inexpensively overexpressed in bacteria. However, the overexpressed proteins usually form aggregates inside the bacteria, called inclusion bodies, which contains inactive and non-native protein. To obtain native protein, inclusion bodies need to be isolated and resolubilized, and then the resulting protein refolded in vitro. In vitro protein folding is aided {{by the addition of}} a redox buffer, which is composed of a small molecule disulfide and/or a small molecule thiol. The most commonly used redox buffer contains reduced and oxidized glutathione. Recently, aliphatic <b>dithiols</b> and aromatic monothiols have been employed as redox buffers. Aliphatic <b>dithiols</b> improved the yield of native protein as compared to the aliphatic thiol, glutathione. <b>Dithiols</b> mimic the in vivo protein folding catalyst, protein disulfide isomerase, which has two thiols per active site. Furthermore, aromatic monothiols increased the folding rate and yield of lysozyme and RNase A relative to glutathione. By combining the beneficial properties of aliphatic <b>dithiols</b> and aromatic monothiols, aromatic <b>dithiols</b> were designed and were expected to increase in vitro protein folding rates and yields. ^ Aromatic monothiols (1 - 4) and their corresponding disulfides (5 - 8), two series of ortho- and para-substituted ethylene glycol <b>dithiols</b> (9 - 15), and a series of aromatic quaternary ammonium salt <b>dithiols</b> (16 - 17) were synthesized on a multigram scale. Monothiols and disulfides (1 - 8) were utilized to fold lysozyme and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. <b>Dithiols</b> (11 - 17) were tested for their ability to fold lysozyme. At pH 7. 0 and pH 8. 0, and high protein concentration (1 mg/mL), aromatic <b>dithiols</b> (16, 17) and a monothiol (3) significantly enhanced the in vitro folding rate and yield of lysozyme relative to the aliphatic thiol, glutathione. Additionally, aromatic <b>dithiols</b> (16, 17) significantly enhance the folding yield as compared to the corresponding aromatic monothiol (3). Thus, the folding rate and yield enhancements achieved in in vitro protein folding at high protein concentration will decrease the volume of renaturation solution required for large scale processes and consequently reduce processing time and cost. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{mechanism of}} linear aliphatic α,ω-dithiols with chain lengths of 6, 8 and 10 carbon atoms on {{silver and gold}} nanoparticles has been studied by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. SERS spectra provided the structural marker bands of these compounds and they were employed to obtain information about the adsorption and coordination mechanism, the orientation, conformational order, and packing of the aliphatic chains of <b>dithiols</b> on the metal nanoparticle surface. The effect {{of the type of}} metal (silver or gold) and the extent of surface coverage on all the above mentioned properties is discussed. It was found that the adsorption of <b>dithiols</b> on Au nanoparticles leads to a more disordered structure of the aliphatic chains of <b>dithiols</b> in comparison with the adsorption on Ag nanoparticles. The interaction through both thiol groups makes the adsorption of <b>dithiols</b> on metal surfaces substantially different from that of monothiols; in particular, the orientation of <b>dithiols</b> is perpendicular, while monothiols adopt a tilted orientation. <b>Dithiols</b> may act as linkers between metal nanoparticles and induce the formation of nanogaps with a controllable interparticle distance. The nanogaps thus formed are able to produce hot spots exhibiting a large intensification of electromagnetic field in these points which has been proved by the observation of intense SERS spectra of <b>dithiols</b> until a concentration of 10 - 8 M, corresponding to a large Raman enhancement factor of 5 × 106. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

2500|$|Metal {{substrates}} {{for use in}} SAMs can {{be produced}} through physical vapor deposition techniques, electrodeposition or electroless deposition. Thiol or selenium SAMs produced by adsorption from solution are typically made by immersing a substrate into a dilute solution of alkane thiol in ethanol, though many different solvents can be used besides use of pure liquids. While SAMs are often allowed to form over 12 to 72 hours at room temperature, SAMs of alkanethiolates form within minutes. Special attention is essential in some cases, {{such as that of}} <b>dithiol</b> SAMs to avoid problems due to oxidation or photoinduced processes, which can affect terminal groups and lead to disorder and multilayer formation. In this case appropriate choice of solvents, their degassing by inert gasses and preparation in the absence of light is crucial and allows formation of [...] "standing up" [...] SAMs with free –SH groups. Self-assembled monolayers can also be adsorbed from the vapor phase. In some cases when obtaining an ordered assembly is difficult or when different density phases need to be obtained substitutional self-assembly is used. Here one first forms the SAM of a given type of molecules, which give rise to ordered assembly and then a second assembly phase is performed (e.g. by immersion into a different solution). This method has also been used to give information on relative binding strengths of SAMs with different head groups and more generally on self-assembly characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Selecting {{the type}} of head group depends on the {{application}} of the SAM. Typically, head groups are connected to a molecular chain in which the terminal end can be functionalized (i.e. adding –OH, –NH2, –COOH, or –SH groups) to vary the wetting and interfacial properties. An appropriate substrate is chosen to react with the head group. Substrates can be planar surfaces, such as silicon and metals, or curved surfaces, such as nanoparticles. Alkanethiols are the most commonly used molecules for SAMs. Alkanethiols are molecules with an alkyl chain, (C-C)ⁿ chain, as the back bone, a tail group, and a S-H head group. Other types of interesting molecules include aromatic thiols, of interest in molecular electronics, in which the alkane chain is (partly) replaced by aromatic rings. An example is the <b>dithiol</b> 1,4-Benzenedimethanethiol (SHCH2C6H4CH2SH)). Interest in such dithiols stems from the possibility of linking the two sulfur ends to metallic contacts, which was first used in molecular conduction measurements. Thiols are frequently used on noble metal substrates because of the strong affinity of sulfur for these metals. The sulfur gold interaction is semi-covalent and has a strength of approximately 45kcal/mol. [...] In addition, gold is an inert and biocompatible material that is easy to acquire. It is also easy to pattern via lithography, a useful feature for applications in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). Additionally, it can withstand harsh chemical cleaning treatments. Recently other chalcogenide SAMs: selenides and tellurides have attracted attention in a search for different bonding characteristics to substrates affecting the SAM characteristics and which could be of interest in some applications such as molecular electronics. Silanes are generally used on nonmetallic oxide surfaces; however monolayers formed from covalent bonds between silicon and carbon or oxygen cannot be considered self assembled because they do not form reversibly. Self-assembled monolayers of thiolates on noble metals are a special case because the metal-metal bonds become reversible after the formation of the thiolate-metal complex. This reversibility is what gives rise to vacancy islands and it is why SAMs of alkanethiolates can be thermally desorbed and undergo exchange with free thiols.|$|E

The interest of these gaps resides in the well-known fact that when plasmonic surfaces are within a close distance, their plasmon modes couple. This event affects the electromagnetic field distribution in a manner that a drastic enhancement occurs in the gaps leading to the creation of hot spots.

In this work we present a study of the formation and the characterization of the gaps formed by using <b>dithiols</b> of different lengths, where both thiol groups are connected by a linear aliphatic chain with 6, 8 and 10 CH 2 groups.

Their optical properties were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. Their self-assembled monolayer films on gold surfaces were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, grazing incidence Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (GI-FTIR), and contact angle and ellipsometry measurements. Increasing the chain length from two to four phenyl rings showed a more than linear increase of the intensity of the aromatic C=C ring stretch modes in GI-FTIR, indicating that the longer p-phenylene system is oriented toward the surface normal. Similar to oligophenylenes, when the number of repeat units for oligothiophene is increased, a more than linear increase of the intensity of the C=C stretch and C-H bend modes implies that the longest oligothiophenedithiol molecule is oriented close to the surface normal. Ellipsometry showed a smaller deviation from the calculated monolayer thickness with increasing number of thiophene or phenylene rings, corroborating the GI-FTIR data.
