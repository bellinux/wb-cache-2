5|$|The trunk railway {{lines of}} Victoria are <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> some built as such, and others {{duplicated}} later on. Early {{sections of the}} suburban network were <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> with later additions being single track that were later duplicated.|$|E
5|$|Work {{commenced}} {{again in}} 1933 {{and the line}} opened on 10 October 1934. At first the line was built with <b>double</b> <b>track</b> from Frøen to Østhorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was converted to <b>double</b> <b>track.</b> The construction spurred a massive residential construction along the line giving a good foundation for ridership.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 and 1904, the Trunk Line was {{upgraded}} to <b>double</b> <b>track.</b> The section from Drammen to Kongsberg was converted to standard gauge on 1 November 1909. Between 1917 and 1920, dual gauge was laid between OsloV and Drammen, and from 13 November 1922, the Drammen Line was entirely operated with standard gauge. The first electrification of NSB's lines {{was put into}} service on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line between OsloV and Brakerøya. The section from OsloV to Sandvika was {{upgraded to}} <b>double</b> <b>track</b> on 26 November 1922. From 1922, NSB introduced El 1-hauled passenger trains on the Drammen Line, and later other lines.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the branch}} lines {{constructed}} in the colonial era has been lifted up or abandoned in the 1980s. No major railway construction has since taken place, however, many of the busiest lines have been <b>double</b> <b>tracked.</b> The northern coast area of Java would be <b>double</b> <b>tracked</b> in May 2014 after completion of 68 kilometres Babat-Kandangan-Pasar Turi double trackage from 727 kilometres of Jakarta-Surabaya <b>double</b> <b>tracked,</b> followed by the proposed completion of a 1000 km <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> project on the south coast by 2015. On 8 June 2015 Duri-Tangerang <b>double</b> <b>tracks</b> is formally used for KA Commuter Jabodetabek, {{but it can be}} also used for airport trains.|$|R
25|$|Track works {{would include}} new layouts at Addington and Rolleston, {{as well as}} the <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> of the Main South Line out to Rolleston and the <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> of the Main North Line out to Rangiora.|$|R
5|$|On 15 June 1953, the Trunk Line from Lillestrøm to Eidsvoll took {{electrification}} into use. Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing <b>double</b> <b>track</b> {{were put}} into service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Between 1953 and 1955, NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units. While visually similar to Class 65, they had improved technology and reliability. On 1 February 1961, the Gjøvik Line from OsloØ to Tøyen was put into service with <b>double</b> <b>track</b> and the line from OsloØ to Jaren put into service as electrified. <b>Double</b> <b>track</b> from Tøyen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gjøvik was electrified in 1963.|$|E
5|$|On a <b>double</b> <b>track</b> line, {{a station}} may have one center island {{platform}} used for trains in both directions, or 2 side platforms, {{one for a}} train in each direction.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration has {{developed}} a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> taking back into use the Ålgård Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, {{which may or may}} not be built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing <b>double</b> <b>track</b> between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
50|$|The station {{building}} and platforms was renovated in 1975 (as Pio Del Pilar) following the <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> {{of the line}} from Paco up to this station. The <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> of Main Line South was further extended, reaching Sucat by 1978.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} reopened and {{electrified}} in March 2007 {{as part of}} the <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> project between Rawang and Ipoh. At one end of this station, there is a freight yard. It was made prior to the Rawang-Ipoh Electrified <b>Double</b> <b>Tracking</b> Project.|$|R
50|$|The line became <b>double</b> <b>tracked</b> 2010-2013.|$|R
5|$|GPK trains {{used the}} Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line {{as far as}} Paisley; it was joint with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. The line between Shields Junction and Paisley was quadrupled in 1880s. It was reduced again to <b>double</b> <b>track</b> during the mid 1960s. A third track was added once more in early 2012.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg station {{opened on}} 10 October 1934 as a {{station on the}} Sognsvann Line. The line was built by the municipally owned company Akersbanerne. The line was double-tracked from Majorstuen to Korsvoll, and single-tracked from there to Sognsvann. In 1939, the section Korsvoll–Sognsvann was {{upgraded}} to <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> and the station Korsvoll had its name changed to Østhorn.|$|E
5|$|The station {{received}} a major overhaul after the Østfold Line {{was extended to}} <b>double</b> <b>track</b> in the 1990s. The station was redesigned in the same architectural style as the preceding station Ås, with a modern walkway over the tracks. The walkway is built in gluelam, and shapes together with the stairways down to the platforms one minimalistic construction.|$|E

5000|$|The new station {{opened in}} June 2013. In August 2014, with the <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> nearly complete, all South Acton short turns were {{extended}} to Littleton. The <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> work, including 8 grade crossing replacements {{and a new}} interlocking just east of Littleton station, was completed in November 2014.|$|R
5|$|Ulriken Tunnel {{represents}} the largest bottleneck on the Bergen Line, {{due to the}} commuter trains to Arna. Building <b>double</b> <b>track</b> on the westernmost part of Bergensbanen would free up capacity not only of {{that part of the}} line, but the whole line across the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Upgrades on {{the southernmost}} {{part of the}} line will take place during 2014 that will shorten journey times. The single track bridge between Sæter and Ljabru over Nordstrandveien will be {{demolished}} and replaced with a new <b>double</b> <b>track</b> bridge. In addition, two curves on the line will be straightened out.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} {{plans for the}} Dovre Line involved completion in 1916, {{it was not until}} 1921 the first train could travel from Oslo to Trondheim via Dovre, mostly due to the First World War. The new depot opened in 1916, and in 1917 the <b>double</b> <b>track</b> and dual gauge to Marienborg as well as the new freight terminal was finished. Instead of using one track for each direction on the <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> the Dovre Line would use the one line while the other would be used for transport from the station to the depot. Skansen Bridge opened on 22 March 1918. In 1922, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a kiosk, and on 1 October 1925, they took over the station restaurant.|$|E
5000|$|Townsend's process {{succeeded in}} {{simulating}} manual <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> quite effectively; however, attentive listeners can often {{tell the difference}} between ADT and [...] "real" [...] <b>double</b> <b>tracking,</b> with the former having a synthetic quality to it and having none of the audible differences between the vocal tracks frequently present in the latter. Over the years, many artists, including the Beatles, continued to use both manual <b>double</b> <b>tracking,</b> ADT, or a combination of both in different circumstances depending on the effects they wished to achieve, with each technique thought to have certain unique qualities of its own.|$|R

5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The line was built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the line was rebuilt to <b>double</b> <b>track.</b> From 19 December 1939, the line was extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with <b>double</b> <b>track.</b> In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not all at the same time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, limited through {{services}} to the City restarted. Baker Street station was rebuilt with four tracks and two island platforms in 1912. To cope with the rise in traffic the line south of Harrow was quadrupled, in 1913 from Finchley Road to Kilburn, in 1915 to Wembley Park; the line from Finchley Road to Baker Street remained <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> causing a bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, a {{team from}} the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} a study in a short, <b>double</b> <b>track</b> section of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated almost two metres beneath. The study is to establish how the original cast-iron lining sections, which {{are similar to those}} used for many miles of railway under London, resist possible deformation and soil movement caused by the developments.|$|E

5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel-electric multiple units built to the line's loading gauge. Diesel locomotives handled freight, also built to fit the loading gauge. The diesel-electric multiple units served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from <b>double</b> <b>track</b> to single.|$|E
5|$|The Bendigo and Geelong–Ballarat mainlines {{were both}} built as <b>double</b> <b>track</b> in the 1860s, but were singled in the 1930s and {{first decade of}} the 21st century respectively. The {{north-east}} line to Seymour was duplicated in the mid-1880s and remains so today, the Gippsland line to Moe was duplicated in the 1950s in conjunction with increased briquette traffic, and the busiest country line in the state to Geelong was progressively duplicated from 1959 to 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} constructed as <b>double</b> <b>track</b> between Illawarra Junction and Hurstville with single track thereafter; however, its rising use {{meant that the}} line required duplication soon afterwards. The line was duplicated between Hurstville and Loftus Station (with {{the exception of the}} Como bridge over the Georges River) in April 1890, then southward to Waterfall by 12 December 1890. The section of track between Illawarra Junction and Hurstville was quadruplicated between 1913 and 1925.|$|E
