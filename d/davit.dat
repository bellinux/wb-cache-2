50|$|Normally British {{converted}} LSIs were {{fitted with}} heavy-duty power-operated <b>davits.</b> Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin <b>davits</b> - these being generally {{in use in}} the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats. As the weight of LCAs increased through the war (eventually approaching 14 tons) heavier <b>davits</b> were required. Later LSIs and those being refitted were provisioned with luffing <b>davits</b> of a crossbeam type. The <b>davits</b> themselves provided a demarcation between {{the responsibilities of the}} LSI crew (either Royal Navy or Merchant Navy) {{and the members of the}} LCA flotilla.|$|R
50|$|The story's {{two main}} protagonists are Jean Luharich and Carlton <b>Davits.</b> Luharich is a {{successful}} businesswoman and media celebrity who is financing, and commanding, an expedition to capture an Ikky. <b>Davits</b> is a work-for-hire seaman {{who has been on}} the crew of several earlier attempts. Indeed, <b>Davits</b> was injured in an attempt that nearly succeeded and has since been blaming himself for that expedition's failure. <b>Davits</b> and Luharich were previously involved in a brief romantic relationship, but that relationship ended years before the story begins.|$|R

At once. Limit the number of people by the boats you can handle. That's honesty. And then you may go on fumbling for years about these precious <b>davits</b> which are such a stumbling-block to your humanity. These fascinating patent <b>davits.</b> These <b>davits</b> that refuse to do three times as much work as they were meant to do. Oh! The wickedness of these <b>davits!</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from davits supplied by the Welin <b>Davit</b> & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were slung from the davits, ready to be launched. The davits were of a highly efficient double-acting quadrant design, capable of being slung inboard (hanging over the deck) as well as outboard (hanging over the side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The davits aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the davits. Each <b>davit</b> was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each <b>davit</b> to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken across the deck so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and <b>davit.</b> They had to be lowered by hand, ideally by a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Davit</b> is {{the only}} member of his branch who retains Georgian {{citizenship}} and residence since the death of his father, Prince George Bagration-Mukhraneli in 2008. Aside from his unmarried elder brother Irakli, <b>Davit</b> is the heir male of the Bagrationi family, while the bride's father is the most senior descendant of the last Bagrationi to reign over the united kingdom of eastern Georgia. The marriage between Nugzar Gruzinsky's heiress and the Mukhrani heir may resolve their rivalry for the claim to the throne.|$|E

25|$|A {{more obvious}} {{external}} change was the fitting of large crane-like <b>davits,</b> each powered by {{an electric motor}} and capable of launching six lifeboats which were housed in gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry <b>davits</b> but only five were actually installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually-operated Welin-type <b>davits</b> as on Titanic and Olympic.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{increase}} in the number of accidents on Ships globally caused by improper maintenance of Lifeboats and <b>Davits</b> (Launching Appliances), The International Maritime Organisation in May 2006 regulated the servicing and testing of the Lifeboats, On-Load Release Gears, Rescue Boats and <b>Davits</b> stipulating them to be carried out only by the Original Equipment Manufacturer or their authorised service providers.

5000|$|After the First World War {{and until}} the mid-1930s, {{appropriations}} for the United States Navy were small. Ships fitted as troop transports were not priorities for the Navy in fact or in theory, so as a stop-gap measure the responsibility fell to battleships and cruisers to lift Marine landing forces. As {{a consequence of the}} standard <b>davits</b> on Navy ships, a length of 30’, the spacing of the <b>davits</b> fitted to these ships, and a weight of 5 tons (the maximum capacity of the <b>davits)</b> were imposed as basic requirements for all new landing craft ...|$|R

25|$|Harland and Wolff {{put their}} leading {{designers}} to work designing the Olympic-class vessels. It was overseen by Lord Pirrie, {{a director of}} both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager. Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat <b>davit</b> design.|$|E
25|$|Both cutters {{were kept}} swung out, {{hanging from the}} <b>davits,</b> ready for {{immediate}} use, while collapsible lifeboatsC and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to <b>davits)</b> immediately inboard of boats1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters, on either side of number1 funnel. There were no <b>davits</b> to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand. Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.|$|R

25|$|In larger {{operations}} such as Jubilee, Torch, Husky, and Overlord, LCAs {{were carried}} to invasion areas by Landing Ship Infantry (LSI). The location {{chosen for the}} LSI to stop and lower the LCA was a designated point inside the 'Transport Area' when the LSI was operating with a US Navy Task Force, or the 'Lowering Position' when with a Royal Navy Task Force. The transport area or lowering position was approximately 6–11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer shore). Normally landing ships were fitted with heavy-duty power-operated <b>davits.</b> Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin <b>davits</b> – these being generally in use in the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats.

25|$|Boarding {{operations}} are performed by two , waterjet propelled rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIB), which carry ten people (a fully equipped, eight-strong boarding party, and two boat crew). The RHIBs are {{larger and more}} powerful than the single RHIB aboard a Fremantle, are capable of operating independently of their mothership, and carry their own communications, navigation, and safety equipment. Each RHIB has a dedicated cradle and <b>davit,</b> the boats can be launched and recovered easily, and a centralised 'dressing room' incorporated into the ship's design has streamlined the deployment and return of personnel.|$|E

25|$|The White Rock Boat Club {{was formed}} in 1961 as the brainchild of {{three members of the}} Corinthian Sailing Club. CSC was having a problem with {{tracking}} <b>davit</b> ownership and the price of davits escalated due to demand since the club had no control over prices. Two of the founders, the Oetkings, had also developed a fine catamaran called the Hellcat and had gone into production with growing sales, but they couldn't find davits at CSC. WRBC was constructed not only to supply reasonably priced davits, but to help sell Hellcats. The club sold davits {{to help pay for the}} construction of the club, with the provision that the club could buy the <b>davit</b> back if the owner left the club. The club has exercised this right and now owns and leases most of its davits. The club was constructed with a few differences from its present configuration as can be seen in the 1968 photo above. In order to promote organized class sailing, WRBC at one time limited the type of boats kept at the club to racing classes. In the 1970s, the following classes of sailboats were eligible for membership: Butterfly, Coronado 15, Flying Scot, Harpoon, Lido, Lone Star 13, MC Scow, M16 Scow, M20 Scow and Rebel. The club remains active on the lake today.|$|E

25|$|The frigates {{closed in}} to pistol range without opening fire. As they passed each other, Aréthuse came about and fired her {{broadside}} at Amelia that cut the braces of her topsail; Amelia answered in kind, and then veered and abruptly decreased her speed, her <b>davit</b> touching Aréthuse at starboard. Aréthuse fired another broadside at point-blank range, {{and for the}} following hour and a half, the two frigates remained entangled, exchanging volleys, gunners from both sides snatching the ramrods of their opponents and duelling with sabres from one gunport and the other, but neither side attempting to board the other.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Israel and Georgia remain excellent. Georgia's {{former defense}} {{minister}} from 2006 to 2008, <b>Davit</b> Kezerashvili, had previously lived in Israel. Israel {{has been selling}} weapons to Georgia for seven years financed by grants from the USA Included in these weapons are Israeli-built spy drones provided through {{the former mayor of}} Tel Aviv, Roni Milo. Israeli advisors, estimated to number between 100 and 1,000, have trained the Georgian military for some time. The two nations also maintain a visa free policy where Georgian and Israeli officials signed an agreement to lift visa requirements for Georgian citizens traveling to Israel, reciprocating Georgia's visa-free policy for Israelis in place since mid-2005.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Erekle in 1798, his son and successor, King George XII, renewed a request for {{protection}} from Emperor Paul I of Russia, and urged him {{to intervene in the}} bitter dynastic feud among the numerous sons and grandsons of the late Erekle. Paul offered to incorporate the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti into the Russian Empire, while reserving to its native dynasty a degree of internal autonomy – essentially, mediatisation, and in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi. Negotiations of terms were still in process, when Paul signed a manifesto on December 18, 1800, unilaterally declaring the annexation of Kartli-Kakheti to the Russian Empire. This proclamation was kept secret until {{the death of}} King George on December 28. His eldest son, the Tsarevich <b>Davit,</b> had been formally acknowledged as heir apparent by Emperor Paul on 18 April 1799, but his accession as king after his father's death was not recognized.|$|E
