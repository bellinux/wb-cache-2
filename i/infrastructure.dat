40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of critical <b>infrastructures</b> facing hazards is a burning issue for urban risks management. In this context, developing methodologies for analysing {{the causes and}} consequences of critical <b>infrastructures</b> vulnerability appears necessary for improving the proper functioning of cities that strongly depend on such <b>infrastructures.</b> The critical <b>infrastructures</b> are complex socio-technical systems in which the components are particularly interdependent. Interdependencies also exist between critical <b>infrastructures.</b> All these interactions may imply many failures caused by cascade effect {{in a context of}} risks. After a review of existing methodologies for assessing the interdependencies within and between critical <b>infrastructures,</b> the paper develops a global methodology based on dependability methods in order to automatically produce the scenarios of failures caused by cascade effect within a rail transport system, as an example of critical <b>infrastructures,</b> facing a flood hazard, as an example of urban risks.
