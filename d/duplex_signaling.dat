50|$|Simplex {{signaling}} (SX) is signaling {{in which}} two conductors are used for a single channel, and a center-tapped coil, or its equivalent, is used to split the signaling current equally between the two conductors. The return path for the current is through ground. It is distinct from a phantom circuit in which the return current path for power or signaling is provided through different signal conductors.SX signaling may be one-way, for intra-central-office use, or the simplex legs may be connected to form full <b>duplex</b> <b>signaling</b> circuits that function like composite (CX) signaling circuits with E&M lead control.|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{spectrum}} is increasingly fragmented {{due to the}} growing proliferation of unlicensed wireless devices and piecemeal licensed spectrum allocations. Current radios are ill-equipped to exploit such fragmented spectrum since they expect large contiguous chunks of spectrum to operate on. In this paper we argue that future radios should provide full <b>duplex</b> <b>signal</b> shaping to the higher layers to systematically exploit fragmented spectrum. Such an architectural design would allow the radio to decouple the use of different spcetrum fragments. We present the design and implementation of Picasso, a system that provides such a general signal shaping abstraction. Picasso has two novel components: a self-interference cancellation technique and a programmable filter engine that enables it to simultaneously send and receive over different spectrum fragments. We provide an initial design and empirically evaluate the feasibility of both components. 1...|$|R

50|$|Although most of Queensland's railway {{signalling}} {{is controlled}} by computers, the interlocking system at Charters Towers is still controlled from a McKenzie and Holland low-level <b>duplex</b> tappet <b>signal</b> frame, numbered 21, which was manufactured in Melbourne. Its underfloor mechanism uses the duplex tappet system, with 5 inches between levers, similar to the frame at Ascot railway station in Brisbane, whereas the frame at the Kuranda Railway Station uses t-bar interlocking. The current 20-lever signal frame manipulates the points and signals of the station. Warning bells sound as a train approaches the station, and staff set the required levers to guide a train through the station or into a siding. The levers operate the points either manually, by long metal pull rods, or by activating an electric motor to change the points, while the semaphore signals are controlled by wires connected to the signal frame. Electric light signals and crossing lights are also operated from the signal frame.|$|R

40|$|Radio over fibre (RoF) {{has long}} been {{proposed}} as a suitable alternative technology for distributed antenna systems (DAS). In this thesis the concept of optical DAS is extended and improved {{to the idea of}} an optical distributed antenna network (DAN) to meet future requirements. Active RoF link solutions are also demonstrated to improve link performance and simplify design. It is shown that modern communication signals can be multicast simultaneously from a number of low power antennas in a DAN to expand the area of coverage without causing “black-spots”. The required output power at each antenna is reduced by 15 dB by using 3 distributed antennas instead of 1. As a result of this finding, it becomes desirable to use many more antenna units in the DAN, and the cost of installation must be considered. Current systems generally use separate antennas for the uplink and downlink to provide isolation. A new active solution to provide isolation requiring only a single antenna when time division <b>duplexed</b> <b>signals</b> are used, based on switching of the downlink laser bias current, is proposed and demonstrated. It is shown to have no negative impact on the throughput of IEEE 802. 11 g signals while increasing the uplink dynamic range by 10 dB. To meet future inbuilding wireless service requirements, DAN will have to support sensing functions as well as communications. It is shown that RFID signals can be carried on RoF without effecting the RFID performance. A low cost electronic predistortion scheme is demonstrated to allow simultaneous delivery of IEEE 802. 11 g with an EVM of 3. 1 % at + 15 dBm and RFID signals at + 28 dBm over a single RoF link while meeting spurious emissions limits. More advanced network functions such as the ability to dynamically route RF signals will become a key requirement in more complex DANs. Previously semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have been demonstrated as switching elements in small RoF switches using a single SOA in each path, limiting the number of ports which could be supported. A new switch architecture is investigated using cascaded SOAs. A testbed is demonstrated using 3 cascaded SOAs to simulate part of a 32 x 32 switch. It is shown that the switch can carry IEEE 802. 11 g signals with an output EVM of 4 % indicating that two such switches could be cascaded achieving a 1024 x 1024 switch while maintaining an EVM below 5. 6 %.

30|$|Multiplex DNA-based assays {{targeting}} specific mutations {{related to}} ESBL-production phenotype {{are expected to}} circumvent {{at least part of}} these difficulties. Whereas molecular methods are usually considered as exquisitely sensitive and specific for rapidly and directly assessing the ESBL-production status in bacterial isolates, {{it should be pointed out}} that few of them have, up to now, convincingly demonstrated their capacity to be usefully translated into the routine practice of clinical microbiology. Consequently, the main goal was to develop a multiplex DNA-based assay which could easily be implemented in a clinical setting, while swiftly delivering a reliable ESBL-status for Enterobacteriaceae isolates. In that respect, qPCR amplification, multiplex pyrosequencing, and signal analysis were combined in order to develop a quick and reliable assay. The signal analysis algorithm was implemented in a new web interactive application that allowed to correctly decomposing triplex and <b>duplex</b> pyrosequencing <b>signals.</b> While a concomitant presence of chromosomal and plasmid β-lactamase variants within the same isolate does not preclude determining its ESBL phenotype, it may affect the pyrosequencing result of ESBL genes located on the plasmid (Haanperä et al. 2008; Jones et al. 2009). Consequently, the new algorithm was designed to correctly deciphering multiplex pyrosequencing signals generated from samples including two distinct sequences (i.e., plasmid and chromosomal) for each genomic region, as illustrated in Fig.  1.|$|R

40|$|In {{full-duplex}} wireless communications, {{transmission and}} reception of signals occur simultaneously {{on the same}} center carrier frequency. It is one technique to increase limited wireless capacity, and particularly the spectral efficiency. The challenge of full-duplex tehnique is to separate the weak received signal from the transmitted signal, which can be even 120 dB stronger signal. This is called self-interference. Current duplexing techniques used in existing two-way communication systems are either time or frequency division <b>duplexing,</b> where <b>signals</b> received and transmitted utilizes different carrier frequencies, or transmission and reception are done in different time slots. The usage of full-duplex communications may, in theory, double the spectral efficiency of a wireless link and thereon the corresponding wireless system. To cancel the self-interference, and to recover the received signal, the self-interference has to be modelled accurately. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} model the nonlinear nature of the self-interference, that is caused by power amplifiers. In this Master’s Thesis work, one recenty developed nonlinear self-interference model and corresponding nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation technique is explored. Specifically, a real-time FPGA implementation is pursued and developed for 20 MHz LTE-like channel bandwidth. This real-time Labview FPGA solution of digital self-interference canceller can, of the overall three-phase self-interference suppression solution, provide measured cancellation at maximum of about 34 dB. The other self-interference cancellation or isolation methods used in measurements are a passive circulator with 20 dB attenuation, and an active RF-canceller, that at measurements provided about 43 dB cancellation. Thus the total real-time cancellation of the self-interference in the overall demonstration system is maximally nearly 100 dB. The developed real-time FPGA implementation could possibly be used as a base for an ASIC circuit development. The resources available in the FPGA used, affected essentially into the structure of the canceller and to the performance of the cancellation...|$|R
40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{applications}} of short oligonucleotide-based microarrays {{is how to}} design specific probes with high sensitivity. Some details of the factors affecting microarray hybridization remain unclear, hampering a reliable quantification of target nucleic acids. We have evaluated {{the effect of the}} position of the fluorescent label [position of label (POL) ] relative to the probe-target <b>duplex</b> on the <b>signal</b> output of oligonucleotide microarrays. End-labelled single-stranded DNA targets of different lengths were used for hybridization with perfect-match oligonucleotide probe sets targeting different positions of the same molecule. Hybridization results illustrated that probes targeting the labelled terminus of the target showed significantly higher signals than probes targeting other regions. This effect was independent of the target gene, the fluorophore and the slide surface chemistry. Comparison of microarray signal patterns of fluorescently end-labelled, fluorescently internally random-labelled and radioactively end-labelled target-DNAs with the same set of oligonucleotide probes identified POL as a critical factor affecting signal intensity rather than binding efficiency. Our observations define a novel determinant for large differences of signal intensities. Application of the POL effect may contribute to better probe design and data interpretation in microarray applications...|$|R

Tethered, intercalated MB′ is reduced through DNA-mediated charge transport; {{the incorporation of}} a single base mismatch at position 3, 10, or 14 of a 17 -mer causes an attenuation of the signal to 62 ± 3 % of the well-matched DNA, irrespective of position in the <b>duplex.</b> The redox <b>signal</b> intensity for MB′–DNA {{is found to be}} least 3 -fold larger than that of Nile blue (NB) –DNA, indicating that MB′ is even more strongly coupled to the π-stack. The signal attenuation due to an intervening mismatch does, however, depend on DNA film density and the backfilling agent used to passivate the surface. These results highlight two mechanisms for reduction of MB′ on the DNA-modified electrode: reduction mediated by the DNA base pair stack and direct surface reduction of MB′ at the electrode. These two mechanisms are distinguished by their rates of electron transfer that differ by 20 -fold. The extent of direct reduction at the surface can be controlled by assembly and buffer conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel calibration method that equalizes the impulse responses {{of all the}} Radio Frequency (RF) modules of an antenna array system operating in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) evolved NodeB (eNB).

A sandwich-type approach, which involves hybridization of a target probe hybridized with the preimmobilized thiolated capture probe attached to a gold electrode, is employed to fabricate a DNA <b>duplex</b> layer. Electrochemical <b>signals</b> are generated by voltammetric interrogation of a Fc bearing Zn−cyclen complexes that selectively and quantitatively binds to the duplex layers through strong chelation between the cyclen complexes and particular nucleobases within the DNA sequence.
