500|$|However, Blackley instead {{proposed}} an aerobatics training simulation, {{which he had}} conceived while reading an aerobatics magazine on a Lexington, Massachusetts bus. Collaborating with Ultima Underworld II programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the [...] "yummy, visceral, fluid <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get when flying a real airplane". He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a playground than to a video game, and he sought to give it simple controls and realistic terrain to decrease the learning curve for beginners. Blackley {{assumed the role of}} project leader and then engaged the team in [...] "flaming sessions" [...] to generate ideas. According to programmer Doug Church, Blackley's concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March.|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you had the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E

500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{said the}} film was [...] "the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all". Richard Corliss of Time and David Ansen of Newsweek praised it, as did Vincent Canby of The New York Times. [...] "Though {{it seems to have}} the manner of some magically reconstituted B-movie of an earlier era, The Last Crusade is an endearing original," [...] Canby wrote, deeming the revelation Indiana had a father who was not proud of him to be a [...] "comic surprise". Canby {{believed}} that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing, it still had [...] "hilariously off-the-wall sequences" [...] such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father–son relationship, a call echoed by McBride in Variety. Roger Ebert praised the scene depicting Indiana as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado; he compared it to the [...] "style of illustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s", saying that Spielberg [...] "must have been paging through his old issues of Boys' Life magazine... the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop. Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines." [...] The Hollywood Reporter felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
2500|$|Dubbed [...] "The Giant Bloody War Game", initial inspirations were {{films such}} as Mel Gibson's Braveheart and {{literature}} such as Glen Cook's The Black Company. Doug Zartman, Bungie's director of public relations {{and one of the}} game's writers, explained [...] "we wanted to capture the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get watching large groups of people clashing on the open field."

2500|$|The song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind" [...] {{was written}} in {{reflection}} upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performs the lyrics with a slight change now: the line [...] "I'm just {{trying to understand the}} <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> lack" [...] is altered to [...] "I'm just trying to understand the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> we lack."

2500|$|Similarly, {{programmer}} Jason Regier explains {{they wanted}} to set the game in [...] "a dark, amoral world where opposing sides are equally brutal and their unity is torn by power struggles within the ranks.

[...] Zartman further states [...] "we wanted to capture the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get watching large groups of people clashing on the open field.

2500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed response upon its original release, but {{has earned a}} better reception in later years, becoming a favorite with fans of Henson and fantasy. It currently holds a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times negatively reviewed the film, describing it as a [...] "watered down J. R. R. Tolkien ... without charm as well as interest." [...] Kevin Thomas gave it a more positive assessment in the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Unlike many screen fantasies, The Dark Crystal casts its spell from its very first frames and proceeds so briskly that it's over before you realize it. You're left with the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have just awakened from a dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, {{warned that}} {{what he called a}} [...] "tsunami of antisemitism" [...] was {{spreading}} globally. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Sacks said: [...] "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lightfoot has cited {{his divorce}} for inspiring the lyrics, saying {{they came to}} him as he was sitting in a vacant Toronto house one summer.

2500|$|SputnikMusic {{rated the}} album 4 out of 5, commenting, “Ulver {{have taken a}} decidedly more subtle {{approach}} to songwriting and the mood they’re attempting to create, but what a mood it is. The <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get while listening to this album could best be summed up by the word “serenity”. Granted, it is a somber form of serenity, but the word still fits perfectly.” Adding, “If there are any problems that some may have with this new album {{it is going to}} be the same thing that is going to make others love this album, and that is its subtlety. Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don’t give it the awareness it deserves.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Both sides accuse {{each other}} of using underhanded tactics {{to pack the}} {{commission}} with countries sympathetic to their position. Edwin Snagg, the IWC commissioner for St Vincent and the Grenadines stated, [...] "It's a question of respect,....Because you are small and because you are underdeveloped there is this view and there is this <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can easily be bought and you can easily be sold. We in the Caribbean feel highly offended." [...] Moreover, there are no developing countries who support an anti-whaling stance. The BBC reported that [...] "Some countries recently admitted to the European Union have been advised by a [...] "word in the ear" [...] {{that it would be}} [...] "a good idea" [...] for them to join the IWC. Some activists believe that Britain and its fellow EU old-timers such as France and Germany should recruit all member states into the Commission." [...] In Australia, National Nine News reported that [...] "New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid." [...] It is expected that more countries in the future will join IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are 8 landlocked IWC members. Mali and Mongolia voted with other pro-whaling countries. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland and San Marino voted with other anti-whaling countries.|$|E

In 2011, Stone described to GQ Australia his relationship with big supermarkets: [...] "I never even thought about working for a supermarket.

40|$|Based on the {{importance}} of teaching content related to the landscape that can be seen, we propose a reflection through the use of mental maps for the perception of landscape experienced by students. This claim will be defended through a case study in public schools in Barbalha in southern Ceará (Brazil). Based on the reflections of Deleuze and Guattari, we want to expose that the map is not an illustrative tracing in class, but multiple, singular, rhizomatic.

[...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief.

She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are.
