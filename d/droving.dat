5|$|A <b>droving</b> dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its <b>droving</b> ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|A 1928 Royal Commission {{into the}} price of beef in Western Australia led to the repair of the wells and the {{re-opening}} of the stock route. Around 20 droves took place between 1931 and 1959 when the final <b>droving</b> run was completed.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Kelpie, {{or simply}} Kelpie, is an Australian sheep dog {{successful}} at mustering and <b>droving</b> {{with little or}} no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats.|$|E
25|$|The Canning Stock Route has {{a strong}} {{connection}} {{to the story of}} Aboriginal art in the Western Desert. When <b>droving</b> along the stock route led to many family groups dispersing to the edges of the desert, communities were established in missions, towns, stations and settlements, and it was here that contemporary painting movements flourished.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{was born}} in Rockingham, Western Australia, one of eight {{children}} born to William Beattie Gordon, a farmer {{who served as a}} state parliamentarian between 1901 and 1911, and his wife Harriet Ann Scott. Growing up on farming properties near Moora and in Gingin, Western Australia, after completing his schooling, Gordon undertook various laboring jobs including <b>droving,</b> farming and working on the goldfields.|$|E
25|$|Canning was {{appointed}} to lead a construction party and between March 1908 and April 1910, 48 wells were completed along the route. Commercial <b>droving</b> began in 1910, but the stock route did not prove popular and was rarely used for the next twenty years. The wells {{made it difficult for}} Aboriginal people to access water and in reprisal they vandalised or dismantled many of the wells.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, where ranches {{are known}} as stations, cowboys {{are known as}} stockmen and ringers, (jackaroos and jillaroos who also do {{stockwork}} are trainee overseers and property managers). The Australian <b>droving</b> tradition was influenced by Americans in the 19th century, and as well as practices imported directly from Spain. The adaptation of both of these traditions to local needs created a unique Australian tradition, which also was strongly influenced by Australian indigenous people, whose knowledge {{played a key role}} in the success of cattle ranching in Australia's climate.|$|E

25|$|Cholesbury {{stands at}} the {{crossroads}} of several <b>droving</b> routes, the Commons providing a safe place to rest their animals. In turn this regular traffic supported local trades and several alehouses over the years. By 1753 The Castle, the Maidenhead (later the Bricklayers Arms), next door to it the Queen's Head and The Slip Inn were operating for at least a period. They were able to flourish due to the boost in trade between the 18th and {{the early part of the}} 20th centuries when they were also frequented by the growing numbers of brickyard and agricultural labourers. None of these public houses has survived to the present day.|$|E
25|$|Highlanders {{had been}} <b>droving</b> {{cattle on the hoof}} to the Lowlands {{since at least}} the sixteenth century. By the 1680s the trade had {{expanded}} to the larger English markets. Cattle were crossed with larger Irish breeds and large parks were constructed by Galloway landholders to hold and fatten cattle. By {{the end of the century}} the drovers roads had become established, stretching down from the Highlands through south-west Scotland to north-east England. From there some were driven to Norfolk to be fattened before being slaughtered in Smithfield for the London population. Specialisation continued, with the increasing commercialisation of sheep farming in the Borders as English markets opened up after the Union of Crowns in 1603 and dairy becoming a feature of farming in the western Lowlands.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{neighbouring}} village of Cholesbury, Hawridge with its extensive commons {{was on an}} important <b>droving</b> route. There were once several alehouses located close to the Common. They were able to flourish due to this boost in trade between the 18th and later on when up until {{the early part of}} the 20th centuries they were also frequented by the growing numbers of brickyard and agricultural labourers. The Full Moon Pub, which is closest to the parish boundary with Cholesbury, is recorded as having its first licensed keeper in 1766 although as an unlicensed alehouse it may date back to 1693. Further along the Common is the Rose and Crown, first licensed in 1753. Down Hawridge Vale is the oldest of the three, the Black Horse, which first opened in the mid-17th century. Other alehouses such as the Mermaid, across the road from the 'Moon', came and went but these three have survived to the present day.|$|E

50|$|Galton's {{map shows}} three <b>droves</b> running {{parallel}} to the canal. To the west is Parson's <b>Drove,</b> and to the east are London <b>Drove</b> and Dagg's Lane <b>Drove.</b> The area between London <b>Drove</b> and Dagg's Lane <b>Drove</b> was subsequently used for peat digging, and more recently has become the Westhay Moor National Nature Reserve. It is managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust, and as well as open water and reedbeds, it contains a fragment of acid mire, the largest to have survived in the south west of England. The reserve covers 261 acre and provides habitat for many varieties of birds, which includes millions of starlings between November and January.|$|R

25|$|The {{school was}} built on the site of Westfield. Between the 9th and 20th centuries, Westfield was a set of three fields {{arranged}} and used as an existing medieval agricultural three-field system, which was a form of crop rotation in use from the Middle Ages. It is this site which accounts for the name of the school. The site is close to and associated with Car Dyke, and this may imply a connection between the three-field system and the dyke, involving drainage, irrigation and transport of crops and materials. The historical association between Westfield and Car Dyke for crop and materials transport is a strong probability because <b>droving</b> roads and the later turnpikes were less viable than waterways until the A151 road was built. In the tradition of UK primary schools, the pupils are taught geography and history {{in the context of the}} school's site environment as well as contemporary and worldwide context. That is to say, the school's site and environment directly affects the education of the pupils.|$|E
500|$|During medieval times, an {{important}} east-west <b>droving</b> route used to move sheep between winter pastures around Fountains Abbey and summer pastures around Malham, crossed the Hebden Beck at Hebden. It broadly followed {{the line of}} the North Craven Fault avoiding the moorland peat bogs, and [...] became a busy packhorse route for traders.|$|E
500|$|The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), {{or simply}} Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog {{originally}} developed in Australia for <b>droving</b> cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog {{that occurs in}} two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives {{the appearance of a}} [...] "red" [...] or [...] "blue" [...] dog. It {{should not be confused with}} the Australian Shepherd, a similarly named but totally different breed.|$|E

500|$|The Way ascends {{through a}} gap between Ballygobban and Shielstown Hills, {{yielding}} views stretching from Lugnaquilla to Keadeen Mountain and beyond to Eagle Hill and the Castlecomer Plateau. The hills ahead mark {{the edge of the}} granite backbone of the Wicklow Mountains; in the distance they gradually merge with the Blackstairs Mountains, which can be seen on the skyline. The trail follows the road passing close to the village of Moyne before joining a boreen. Along this boreen are the remains of a holy well dedicated to Saint Colmcille. The trail contours around Ballycumber Hill and then continues along the eastern slopes of Garryhoe Hill, passing the remains of a ringfort, approximately [...] in diameter. Further along is a memorial to a Dr James McNamara who was killed in a shooting accident in 1916. Passing through a series of gates along the way, the trail follows Coolafunshoge Lane, an old <b>droving</b> path with extensive views of south Wicklow. The lane emerges onto the road, crossing a bridge over the River Derry to reach the R747 road close to Tinahely.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{were likely}} {{confined}} {{primarily to the}} Sydney region until the early 19th century, when settlers first crossed the Blue Mountains and opened expansion inland. Horses were required for travel, and for cattle and sheep <b>droving</b> as the pastoral industry grew. The first report of an escaped horse is in 1804, and by the 1840s some horses had escaped from settled regions of Australia. It is likely that some escaped because fences were not properly installed, when fences existed at all, but {{it is believed that}} most Australian horses became feral because they were released into the wild and left to fend for themselves. [...] This may have been the result of pastoralists abandoning their settlements, and thus their horses, due to the arid conditions and unfamiliar land that combined to make farming in Australia especially difficult. [...] After World War I, the demand for horses by defence forces declined with the growth in mechanization, which led to a {{growth in the number of}} unwanted animals that were often set free. Throughout the 20th century, the replacement of horses with machines in farming led to further reductions in demand, and may have also contributed to increases in feral populations.|$|E
500|$|The trail follows {{an ancient}} cattle <b>droving</b> path around Muskeagh Hill before joining {{a series of}} country roads. 63% of this final stretch is on roads. These pass through the village of Mullinacuff whose neo-Gothic church and cottages are built from local granite. At Stranakelly Crossroads, the Way passes Tallon's pub, {{better known as the}} [...] "Dying Cow" [...] from a story that, when visited by police late one night, the landlady argued that she wasn't serving drink after hours but {{providing}} refreshments to neighbours who helped her with a dying cow. Circling Cronlea Hill, which is topped with a windfarm, and passing near the village of Kilquiggan, the Way crosses the R725 road near Shillelagh. The trail enters forestry at Raheenakit before joining an old drovers' road, once used to herd sheep to market in Shillelagh. The Blackstairs Mountains, whose main peak, Mount Leinster, is distinguished by the television mast on its summit, begin to dominate the horizon. The trail meanders along forestry tracks around Moylisha and Urelands Hills. Urelands Hill is littered with hornblende-rich schist, a legacy of a chain of long-extinct volcanic islands that existed 450–500 million years ago when this part of Ireland lay under the primeval Iapetus Ocean. Joining the road for the final stretch into Clonegal, the Way leaves County Wicklow and enters County Carlow at Wicklow Bridge, about [...] from the end. The Wicklow Way ends in the village green of Clonegal where a stone bench and a map board, displaying the entire route from Marlay Park, may be found.|$|E
