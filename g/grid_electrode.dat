50|$|A triode is an {{electronic}} amplifying vacuum tube (or valve in British English) consisting of three electrodes inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated filament or cathode, a grid, {{and a plate}} (anode).

Triodes were widely used in consumer electronics devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when transistors replaced them.

This study {{is part of}} a research project on the influence of the variability of 12 -lead electrocardiograms on computer interpretation due to small electrode position changes. Interpolated BSPMs can be used to simulate this variability. The set of BSPMs studied, derived from a 117 -electrode grid with relatively many electrodes on the left precordial part of the thorax, consisted of 232 cases without abnormalities, 277 with infarction, and 237 with left ventricular hypertrophy. The interpolation methods used were fast Fourier transforms, Chebyshev polynomials, linear functions, and cubic splines (CS). In the horizontal plane, a reference signal was first interpolated and, thereafter, resampled using 11 different sets of electrodes with the number of electrodes ranging from 18 down to 8. In the vertical direction, five <b>grids</b> with <b>electrodes</b> only {{on the front of the}} thorax and nine <b>grids</b> with <b>electrodes</b> on the front and the back were examined. As a performance measure for interpolation, mean absolute error (MAE) was used: the absolute differences between the reference signal and the interpolated signal, averaged over the QRS on all maps. All methods showed deteriorating performance for decreasing grid density. In the horizontal direction, CS proved to be slightly superior to other methods for the left precordial electrodes for all but the densest grid (eg, MAE = 22. 8 μV vs MAE 〉 24. 8 μV for a 12 -electrode <b>grid).</b> For <b>electrodes</b> not in that area, CS performed the best as well (MAE = 16. 1 μV for the same grid), with differences with the other methods being small (MAE 〉 16. 4 μV). In the vertical direction, CS showed the best results on the front, both for the dense nonperiodic (MAE = 19. 1 μV vs MAE 〉 26. 6 μV for a 6 -electrode grid) and periodic grids (MAE = 25. 1 μV vs MAE 〉 26. 6 μV for a 12 -electrode grid). Linear functions performed best for sparse nonperiodic grids and sparse periodic <b>grids</b> for <b>electrodes</b> on the back, with the difference with CS for the last case being small. The method CS performed best overall, and is recommended for interpolating BSPMs. © 1995, Churchill Livingstone Inc. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
