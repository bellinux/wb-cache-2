When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst for advice. At the suggestion of Dunst, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.|$|E

It features an A–B pitch change which increases harmonic momentum for the second verse by implying {{a return to the}} cadential D chord in the chorus, instead of a continuation of the tonic E. The second verse is shorter than the first. A dubstep breakdown occurs after the second chorus during which the group chant the lyric [...] "hey" [...] repeatedly {{at the end of each}} line in a call and response.

2500|$|Some argued Merezhkovsky's stance was {{inconsistent}} {{with his own}} ideas of some five years ago. After all, the Vekhi authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and – following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-Vekhi tirade, his social status, too. Shied by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book Sick Russia [...] was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a [...] "decadent pariah" [...] any-more, suddenly turned a [...] "well-established Russian novelist" [...] and the [...] "pride of the European literature."

In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe <b>in</b> <b>yourself</b> and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs!

2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence.

2500|$|Hogan {{soon became}} {{embroiled in a}} heated feud with the 468-pound Earthquake, who had crushed Hogan's ribs in a sneak attack on The Brother Love Show in May 1990. On television, announcers {{explained}} that Hogan's injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior both took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit {{that he wanted to}} retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a [...] "thank you"). Hogan returned by SummerSlam, and he for several months dominated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country. His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe caused Hogan to add a fourth demandment – believing <b>in</b> <b>yourself,</b> and he also became known as [...] "The Immortal" [...] Hulk Hogan. Hogan became the first wrestler to win two Royal Rumble matches in a row, as he won the 1991 Royal Rumble match. At WrestleMania VII, Hogan stood up for the United States against Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him for his third WWF Championship, and then defeating him again in the rematch at United Kingdom-only pay-per-vew UK Rampage at London Arena. In the fall of 1991, Hogan was challenged by Ric Flair, the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who recently arrived in the WWF. The feud remained unresolved, as Hogan lost the WWF Championship to The Undertaker at Survivor Series, and he won it back at This Tuesday in Texas six days later. Flair had interfered in both matches and due to the resulting controversy, the title was again declared vacant. The WWF Championship was decided at the 1992 Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match, but Hogan failed to regain the championship as he was eliminated by friend Sid Justice and in turn caused Sid to be eliminated, leaving Flair the winner and new champion. Hogan and Sid patched things up and teamed together on the February 8 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event against Flair and Undertaker, but during the match Sid abandoned Hogan, starting their feud. At WrestleMania VIII, Hogan defeated Sid via disqualification due to interference by Sid's manager Harvey Wippleman. Hogan was then attacked by Papa Shango and was saved by the returning Ultimate Warrior.|$|E
