5|$|The German <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, {{composed}} of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight {{early on the}} morning of 31May in an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet. The <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet.|$|E

5|$|An {{hour and}} a half later, the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet under the command of Admiral Scheer left the Jade; the force was {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts. The <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers , , , , and , and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser Rostock. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 05:00.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, {{the entire}} <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, {{including}} Bayern and Baden, left harbor {{with the intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served during World War I. Moltke {{participated in}} several major battles {{with the rest}} of the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, {{including}} the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea, and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea. At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 to prevent their seizure by the Allies.|$|E

5|$|Following Jutland, Barham {{was under}} repair until 5 July 1916. On {{the evening of}} 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers while the Germans mustered 18 dreadnoughts and 2 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where they expected to encounter the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, the British turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats unless the odds of defeating the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet in a decisive engagement were favourable.|$|E

Most of the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet's ships, including Karlsruhe, Emden, and Nürnberg, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Königsberg instead remained in Germany.|$|E
