5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{it is more likely that}} the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better {{address the problem of}} feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's {{interest}} in skepticism derives {{in part from}} her concern about how fake mediums and psychics exploit gullible or vulnerable people. She has criticized television shows which present mediums and psychics as a fact, which <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> could undermine the understanding of science among teenagers. Kelly also considers that {{a belief in the}} supernatural prevents people from appreciating science and the real wonders of the world, and causes unnecessary fear in young people.|$|E
25|$|Käßmann {{promotes}} larger {{emphasis on}} Christianity in the Protestant church, compared to past decades; for example, she is {{concerned by the}} fact that lessons for confirmation candidates focus more on cults and drugs than on the Bible. She argues for a clearer spiritual profile in church-run facilities, for example, more Bible stories being told in Protestant kindergartens rather than only secular songs being sung. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> children and adults should pray more, and churches should look like churches and not like noncommittal community centers.|$|E
25|$|The 1890s were Cassatt's busiest {{and most}} {{creative}} time.

Among them was Lucy A. Bacon, whom Cassatt introduced to Camille Pissarro.

25|$|Gordon, who {{was from}} the {{southern}} state of Louisiana, supported women's suffrage but opposed {{the idea of a}} federal suffrage amendment, charging that it would violate states' rights. She said that empowering federal authorities to enforce a constitutional right for women to vote in the South could lead to similar enforcement of the constitutional right of African Americans to vote there, a right that was being evaded, and, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> rightly so. Her committee was too small to seriously affect the NAWSA's direction, but her public condemnation of the proposed amendment, expressed in terms of vehement racism, deepened fissures within the organization.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} holding of the Court {{found that the}} crèche display violated the Establishment Clause while the menorah did not. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> Justice O'Connor explained the slightly different reasons why she also supports Justice Blackmun's holding. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Stevens and Marshall, joined parts III-A, IV, and V of Blackmun's opinion. However, Brennan disagreed with Blackmun and O'Connor's respective opinions by stating that the menorah and Christmas tree are also violations of the Establishment Clause. Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Scalia, disagreed with Blackmun's reasoning in part VI and agreed with the previous judgment of the district court. Justice Stevens, in his own opinion, stated that the appeals court was correct in its ruling. He believed that the menorah display, together with the Christmas tree, signified a double violation of the establishment clause. Since the menorah is a religious symbol, he felt that Judaism and Christianity were being endorsed {{by the government to}} the exclusion of all other religions.|$|E

[...] The show, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> suggests that changes should be carefully examined and adopted only if beneficial to the society.
