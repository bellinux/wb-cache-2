The struggle to remove him from power began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well. Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.|$|E

Barletta was highly regarded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration,</b> and his removal brought a downturn in the relations between the U.S. and Noriega. The U.S. response included reducing economic assistance and pressuring Panama to reform its banking secrecy laws, crack down on narcotics trafficking, investigate the murder of Spadafora, and reduce the FDP's role in the government.|$|E

500|$|Noriega had {{a working}} {{relationship}} with U.S. Colonel Oliver North by 1985. Noriega offered to help North assassinate or sabotage Sandinista leaders in return for North helping Noriega improve his image with the U.S. government. In June 1985 Noriega agreed to train soldiers in Panama for an invasion of Nicaragua in 1986. Noriega {{has been reported to}} {{have played a role in}} the Iran–Contra affair in the mid-1980s, in which the proceeds of arms sales to Iran were smuggled to support the Contras. At Noriega's trial in 1991–92, the U.S. government stipulated that it had paid $322,000 to Noriega. Journalists and historians have suggested the figure was much higher: Kempe suggested $110,000 annually, while others have posited $200,000 per year. Kempe suggested that the budget provided to Noriega for his intelligence activities totaled $200,000 every year. These payments included $76,039 as [...] "gifts and incentives" [...] from the CIA. CIA director William Webster would nonetheless describe Noriega as an ally in the U.S. government's war on drugs. Officials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>administration</b> stated that Noriega's drug-related activities had been overlooked because he was an ally of the U.S. in the conflicts in Central America.
