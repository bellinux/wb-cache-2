25|$|Commercial {{bank money}} or demand {{deposits}} are claims against financial institutions {{that can be}} used for the purchase of goods and services. A <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). <b>Demand</b> <b>deposit</b> withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online banking.|$|E

Thus, money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts.|$|E
25|$|Banks have demand {{deposits}} {{in the nature}} of loans to the bank and investment deposits. Some offer guaranteed savings accounts with permission to use the funds and a discretionary reward to the depositor {{as in the case of}} the Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad. Initially, <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> accounts were more common, but over time, most accounts are now investment accounts, which reflects the confidence of depositors in the ability of banks to generate a return. Islamic banking operations are successfully operating in many Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Iran, Sudan, Turkey and Bahrain.|$|E

The model uses Samuelson's pure consumption-loans model. The case for <b>demand</b> <b>deposits,</b> reserves, and deposit insurance rests on costs of iUiquidity and incomplete information. The effect of deposit insurance depends upon how, and at what cost, the government meets its insurer's obligation [...] something which is not specified in practice.

25|$|This 1863 act {{required}} nationally chartered {{banks to}} hold {{one third of}} the capital of the bank in US Treasury bonds. It allowed them in return to issue a uniform bank note backed by the bonds. The amount of the notes not to exceed 90 percent {{of the value of the}} bonds. It was intended to make banking safer and guarantee the value of bank notes to in effect create a nationwide currency. In 1865 the U.S. Congress enacted a 10 percent tax on any bank or individual using state bank notes. As a result, a number of banks converted to national charters, but many simply stopped issuing notes. Instead, they began to issue <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> money—checking accounts. There was no state-banking act in Oregon until 1907 so other banks at the time (like the Ladd and Tilton) were strictly private proprietorships, without a board, taking deposits and lending money without regulation. The First National Bank in Portland was the exception.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased. Banknotes were originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin if presented, they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the [...] "money" [...] that people think that they have as <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> bank accounts and electronic payments have negated the need to carry notes and coins.|$|E

L. 111-203, Section 627). The repeal took effect on July 21, 2011.

50|$|When a {{commercial}} bank loan is extended, new commercial bank money is created if the loan proceeds are issued {{in the form}} of an increase in a customer's <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> account (that is, an increase in the bank's <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> liability owed to the customer). As a loan is paid back through reductions in the <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> liabilities the bank owes to a customer, that commercial bank money disappears from existence. Because loans are continually being issued in a normally functioning economy, the amount of broad money in the economy remains relatively stable. Because of this money creation process by the commercial banks, the money supply of a country is usually a multiple larger than the money issued by the central bank; that multiple was traditionally determined by the reserve requirements and now essentially by other financial ratios (primarily the capital adequacy ratio that limits the overall credit creation of a bank) set by the relevant banking regulators in the jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|At {{first the}} general level of {{interest}} rates was low, and so the ban on <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> interest prevented only {{what would have been}} small interest payments, and there was no significant attempt at avoiding the ban. But starting in the 1950s, interest rates became higher and banks began to feel greater incentive to get around the ban. Non-pecuniary avoidance efforts included increased offering of convenience features such as large numbers of branch offices and giveaways of consumer goods to new customers. Pecuniary avoidance of the ban, known as implicit interest, included preferred loan rates (often tied explicitly to the customer's <b>demand</b> <b>deposit</b> balances) and below-cost service charges for services such as check-clearing.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the impact of Federal Reserve membership on the price of bank services, mainly average loan rates service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> and average deposit rates. In addition, this research investigated the influence of the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market on member banks pricing policies. ^ The research design involved the formulation of a system of equations incorporating bank inputs, output and the pricing of bank services. The system was estimated for all the sampled states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska) as a group and for individual states (after the necessary modifications) using Three Stage Least Squares. ^ The data were secured from three sources: First, the balance sheets and income statements for insured commercial banks in the four sampled states from 1972 - 1977 were obtained from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Second: total population, retail sales, effective buying income and median household effective buying income were obtained from various issues of Sales and Marketing Management magazine. Finally, the adjusted monetary base (seasonally adjusted) figures were obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ^ Within the context of the theoretical framework that bank input, output, and the pricing decisions are simultaneously determined, the statistical results indicated that, on the average, member banks in the four states as a whole, had charged their customers lower average rates on loans, and lower service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits.</b> In addition, the findings suggested that the higher the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market, the higher the service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> and the lower average rates on time and savings deposits. However, the statistical results indicated that the effect of FRS was contingent on the state where member banks were located. For individual state, the findings were as follows: (1) Illinois member banks charged their customers higher average rates on loans and lower service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> than nonmember banks. (2) Iowa member banks charged their customers higher average rates on loans, higher service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the higher the average loan rate and the service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits.</b> (3) Kansas member banks charged their customers higher service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the concentration ratio of member banks in the market the lower the service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> and average deposits rate. (4) Nebraska member banks charged their customers lower average rates on loans, lower service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the lower the service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits.</b> ^ Including the interaction term between FRS membership and the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market yielded no statistically significant results for the sample as a whole. However, it was found that member banks in markets dominated by member banks charged their customers higher service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> (in the state of Illinois), lower service charges on <b>demand</b> <b>deposits</b> (in the state of Kansas) and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits (in the state of Nebraska). ...|$|R
