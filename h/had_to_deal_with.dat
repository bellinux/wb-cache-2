While playing in Greece, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> a culture of water polo that tolerated biting of other players during games. She left Greece to concentrate on making Australia's national team for the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions. The inventories of gifts presented to deities from the royal palace indicate that Qatna used the sexagesimal numeral system.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision {{to take time off}} work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many parts}} of South Africa, {{conflict}} was an element largely absent from Jan Smuts's early life. Whether conflict between Briton and Boer, or conflict between Black and White — it had been many years since the farmers of the Swartland had <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> turmoil on their doorsteps. The absence of conflict, along with its inevitable counterpart, development of prejudice, had its effect upon Smuts.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{successful}} Bulgarian actions the Byzantines were no longer capable of taking the city with a direct assault. They also could not exhaust the defenders with hunger because, after their supplies were cut, the Byzantines themselves <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> that problem. In addition, an army led by Samuil marched into the mountains at the Byzantines' rear. In the meantime, instead of securing the way for retreat, Leon Melissenos pulled back to Plovdiv. That action was an additional reason for Basil II to lift the siege. The commander of the Western armies, Kontostephanos, persuaded him that Melissenos had set off to Constantinople to take his throne.|$|E
5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett {{has pointed}} out {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal {{that resulted in a}} $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E
5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E

5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, {{to the effect}} that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E
5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm. The main complaint raised {{was related to the}} delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage. In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency Preparedness and Response Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor to be the worst disaster they have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with.</b> Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E
5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening {{only a few years}} after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1278 Ivaylo entered Tarnovo in triumph, married Maria and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria. However, since he was inexperienced in state affairs, Ivaylo failed to {{consolidate}} his authority over the nobility in the capital, who were concerned for their own influence, and often quarrelled with Maria. He still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> overwhelming challenges— the Byzantines dispatched many troops {{under the command of}} Michael Glabas in support of Ivan Asen III and incited the Mongols to attack from the north to open war on two fronts. Yet Ivaylo vigorously prepared his forces to counter the adversaries and managed to gain support among many nobles.|$|E
5|$|Lacker was {{instrumental}} in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer Chips Moman and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented {{a significant departure from}} the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He {{was on the verge of}} quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices and the quality of the recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E
5|$|Meredith <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> {{extremely}} physical defences, and {{was often}} boxed {{into the corner}} of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E

5|$|Osorkon ruled {{during one}} of the most chaotic and {{politically}} fragmented periods of ancient Egypt, in which the Nile Delta was dotted with small Libyan kingdoms and principalities and Meshwesh dominions; as the last heir of the Tanite rulers, he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms, the most involved in all the political and military upheavals that soon would afflict the Near East. During his reign, he had to face the power, and ultimately submit himself—to the Kushite King Piye during Piye's conquest of Egypt. Osorkon IV also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the threatening Neo-Assyrian Empire outside his eastern borders.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Boston (April 19, 1775 – March 17, 1776) was {{the opening}} {{phase of the}} American Revolutionary War. New England militiamen {{prevented}} the movement by land of the British Army garrisoned {{in what was then}} the peninsular city of Boston, Massachusetts. Both sides <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> resource supply and personnel issues {{over the course of the}} siege. British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access. After eleven months of the siege, the British abandoned Boston by sailing to Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty {{had one of}} {{the most}} prosperous and {{advanced}} economies in the medieval world. Song Chinese invested their funds in joint stock companies and in multiple sailing vessels at a time when monetary gain was assured from the vigorous overseas trade and domestic trade along the Grand Canal and Yangtze River. Prominent merchant families and private businesses were allowed to occupy industries that were not already government-operated monopolies. Both private and government-controlled industries met the needs of a growing Chinese population in the Song. Artisans and merchants formed guilds that the state <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> when assessing taxes, requisitioning goods, and setting standard workers' wages and prices on goods.|$|E
