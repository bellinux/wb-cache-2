40|$|A new {{technique}} is described for high-speed measurement of striation spacing of single skinned muscle fibres. A galvanometer mirror directs helium-neon laser light {{on to the}} muscle fibre at a variable angle. Light diffracted by the cross-striations is collected by a position-sensitive photodetector. The incident angle necessary to centre the diffracted light beam on to the photodetector is related to sarcomere length. The instrument was tested by comparison with measurements obtained with a compound microscope. Discrepancies of several nanometers per half sarcomere were observed between these two methods. When the incident angle of the laser beam was varied sinusoidally about its mean position {{the magnitude of the}} discrepancy was reduced. During steady passive shortening of the muscle fibres the output of the diffraction instrument often <b>displayed</b> <b>pauses</b> and brief periods of rapid shortening. These irregularities were eliminated by averaging the sarcomere length output over a range of illumination angles by oscillating the incident angle of the laser beam. The results suggest that at the spatial resolution of several nanometers per half sarcomere, volume diffraction effects can cause the apparent sarcomere length measured from the angle of coherent light diffraction to differ from the mean striation spacing. With incident-angle oscillation the time and spatial resolution of the equipment were satisfactory for the sarcomere length signal to be fed back to a length controller for a 'sarcomere length clamp'. In active contractions, stiffness was closely related to steady developed tension at sub-saturating calcium concentrations. Skinned fibres are less stiff than intact fibres at a given level of developed tension...|$|R
40|$|By using single-molecule measurements, we {{demonstrate}} that the elongation kinetics of individual Escherichia coli RNA polymerase molecules are remarkably homogeneous. We find no evidence of distinct elongation states among RNA polymerases. Instead, the observed heterogeneity in transcription rates results from statistical variation in the frequency and duration of pausing. When transcribing a gene without strong pause sites, RNA polymerase molecules <b>display</b> transient <b>pauses</b> that are distributed randomly in both time and distance. Transitions between the active elongation mode and the paused state are instantaneous within the resolution of our measurements (< 1 s). This elongation behavior is {{compared with that of}} a mutant RNA polymerase that pauses more frequently and elongates more slowly than wild type...|$|R

40|$|To {{study how}} retinal {{ganglion}} cell axons diverge in the optic chiasm, {{the behavior of}} dye-labeled fibers was monitored in real time with video microscopy in an isolated preparation of embryonic mouse brain, {{with a focus on}} embryonic day 15 -l 6. These real-time studies have revealed the dynamics of the growth of individual retinal axons, especially the tempo of extension and growth cone behaviors during divergence in the chiasm, a model for “decision ” regions in developing pathways. Within the chiasm, retinal growth cones extend by saltatory growth, consisting of bursts of rapid advance alternating with pauses in extension. During pauses, growth cone appendages remain motile, and develop asymmetries prior to a change in the axis of growth. In a zone straddling the midline, retinal fibers, irrespective of destination, <b>display</b> long <b>pauses</b> for up to several hours...|$|R
40|$|The dwarf scorpionfish Scorpaena papillosa {{detected}} the hydrodynamic signals produced by prey with the mechanosensory lateral line. This species <b>displayed</b> a <b>pause</b> and move search pattern {{that is consistent}} with a saltatory search. The pause phase of the search cycle was probably used to detect prey because pauses often ended early in order to initiate an approach at prey and prey were detected throughout the search space. The move phase of the search cycle repositioned the fish so that it moved approximately a third of the reactive distance. Move distance was found {{to be the most important}} factor in gaining novel search space. Turning was shown to be relatively unimportant in gaining novel search space with a high frequency of low turn angles made by the fish. The dwarf scorpionfish, however, exhibited a spiralling or looping pattern over a search path exhibiting a turn bias towards either the left or right. The dwarf scorpionfish adopted a search behaviour {{that is consistent with}} a saltatory search and efficient for lateral line predation...|$|R
40|$|Human {{subjects}} {{played a}} videogame {{to earn money}} on multiple and mixed fixed-ratio schedules. In both conditions, a "pause" screen appeared between ratios, requiring an additional response to move onto the next ratio. On the multiple schedule, a discriminative stimulus signifying which ratio was upcoming (hard or normal) <b>displayed</b> on the <b>pause</b> screen. Results showed {{no significant differences in}} pausing on the mixed and multiple schedules between the long and short ratios. One consistent finding was higher pausing {{in the first half of}} the session, with decreases in pause length as the end of the experiment approached. Results indicate that between-ratio pausing may be not occur due to an increasingly salient escape contingency and a lack of immediate reinforcement...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 <b>displays</b> the <b>pause</b> {{duration}} {{corresponding to}} the prediction targets for (a) bPC, (b) iPCst, and (c) iPCef in different levels of PC values. Figure  7 a illustrates that the average pause duration increases as bPC for MPM—that is, φt, k(X)—for the prediction target y 1 increases, whereas bPC for y 0 exhibits a contrary trend. Long pause durations were found for the prediction targets of “E 1 ” and “S” for the high and median levels of iPCst. We may conclude from these observations that higher bPC or iPCst results in longer pause durations for the predicted MPM locations. The pause duration trend in Fig.  7 c for the prediction targets of the second sentence-like unit {{is similar to the}} trend of pause durations in Fig.  7 b. The prediction target “E 1 ” for the first sentence-like unit only displays a slightly longer pause duration compared with the nearby targets. The pause durations for “E 1 ” are at the same level as the pause durations for the prediction targets that represent intermediate locations in a long sentence-like unit, that is, “B 4,” “M,” and “m.” This result indicates that the iPCef features cannot be used as salient cues for pause duration prediction, unlike the iPCst features. The objective evaluations of the prosody generation experiment presented in Section 5.3 partially confirmed this indication.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{phosphorylation}} of the KIF 5 anterograde motor {{is associated}} with impaired axonal transport and neurodegeneration, but paradoxically also with normal transport, though the details are not fully defined. JNK phosphorylates KIF 5 C on S 176 in the motor domain; a site that we show is phosphorylated in brain. Microtubule pelleting assays demonstrate that phosphomimetic KIF 5 C(1 - 560) (S 176 D) associates weakly with microtubules compared to KIF 5 C(1 - 560) (WT). Consistent with this, 50 % of KIF 5 C(1 - 560) (S 176 D) shows diffuse movement in neurons. However, the remaining 50 % remains microtubule bound and <b>displays</b> decreased <b>pausing</b> and increased bidirectional movement. The same directionality switching is observed with KIF 5 C(1 - 560) (WT) {{in the presence of}} an active JNK chimera, MKK 7 -JNK. Yet, in cargo trafficking assays where peroxisome cargo is bound, KIF 5 C(1 - 560) (S 176 D) -GFP-FRB transports normally to microtubule plus ends. We also find that JNK increases the ATP hydrolysis of KIF 5 C in vitro. These data suggest that phosphorylation of KIF 5 C-S 176 primes the motor to either disengage entirely from microtubule tracks as previously observed in response to stress, or to display improved efficiency. The final outcome may depend on cargo load and motor ensembles...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) has {{received}} much attention in linguistics and pedagogy. Based {{on a single}} case analysis, it will be shown how a detailed sequential analysis of video-recordings of naturally occurring classroom interaction enables us to understand how an explanation can be accomplished collaboratively by participants in a specific language-learning environment like CLIL. Drawing upon Conversation Analysis (CA), Interactional Linguistics (IL), and Multimodal Analysis, the questions addressed are a) what verbal, para-verbal, and non-verbal resources {{can be used by}} students to carry out the interactional activity of ‘explaining’? and b) how is the activity sequentially organized and collaboratively achieved by all participants? It will be shown that a sequential, multimodal approach is useful in revealing the subtle resources students deploy to construct meaning, in collaboration with the teacher and fellow students, in the course of an ‘explaining’. It is the cooperation between all participants which helps students accomplish the activity, where language and content problems are <b>displayed</b> through <b>pauses,</b> facial expression, pointing, and gesture, and resolved by fellow students through prompts and additional comments. Taking such findings into account, CLIL teachers should be encouraged to create opportunities for students to make use of various semiotic resources, allowing for the explainer and for the class to collaboratively negotiate subject-related content as well as linguistic form...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed at}} {{locating}} Udmurt {{culture in the}} continuum of high- and low-context cultures using the parameter of time-patterning to analyse radio dialogues. The results were compared {{with the findings of}} research on the communicative behaviour of Estonians and Finns (Pajupuu, 1995 a). In theoretical works on inter-cultural communica-tion low-context communication compared to high-context communication is claimed to show no long pauses, a higher speech tempo and frequent interruptions of interlocutors. Characteristics of Estonian and Finnish dialogues allow referring Estonian culture to low-context and Finnish – to high-context cultures. Udmurt culture with respect to the low rate of interruptions of interlocutors found in the study could be referred to high-context cultures; however, the dialogues <b>displayed</b> very short <b>pauses.</b> Analysis of other types of dialogue, in addition to radio dialogues, is necessary to obtain more data on the communicative behaviour of Udmurts...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMajor {{features}} of transcription by human RNA polymerase II (Pol II) remain poorly defined {{due to a}} lack of quantitative approaches for visualizing Pol II progress at nucleotide resolution. We developed a simple and powerful approach for performing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in human cells that globally maps strand-specific Pol II density at nucleotide resolution. NET-seq exposes a mode of antisense transcription that originates downstream and converges on transcription from the canonical promoter. Convergent transcription is associated with a distinctive chromatin configuration and is characteristic of lower-expressed genes. Integration of NET-seq with genomic footprinting data reveals stereotypic Pol II pausing coincident with transcription factor occupancy. Finally, exons retained in mature transcripts <b>display</b> Pol II <b>pausing</b> signatures that differ markedly from skipped exons, indicating an intrinsic capacity for Pol II to recognize exons with different processing fates. Together, human NET-seq exposes the topography and regulatory complexity of human gene expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{progressive}} ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement {{is widely used}} to assess rein-forcement strength. Rats typically complete higher ratio requirements for more pal-atable food. This effect is well characterized by the Mathematical Principles of Rein-forcement (MPR). In this experiment, either standard food pellets or amaranth grain were delivered according to PR schedules, with requirements increasing in steps of 1 (PR 1) or 3 (PR 3). Rats completed higher ratio requirements and <b>displayed</b> shorter pre-ratio <b>pauses</b> for pellets than for amaranth. Nevertheless, run-rates were similar across reinforcers. In terms of the theoretical parameters of MPR, similar values in a parameter (which indices incentive value) were obtained for amaranth and pellet reinforcers. This finding suggests that, although amaranth engenders less responding than pellets, amaranth grain is a reliable reinforcer for operant procedures. The MPR model accounted for the differences in quality of food. Key words: MPR model; {{progressive ratio}} schedules; food textures; amaranth; food pellets; rats...|$|R
40|$|This paper traces 9 non-English major EFL {{students}} and collects their oral productions in 4 successive oral exams in 2 years. The canonical correlation analysis approach of SPSS is adopted {{to study the}} disfluencies developmental traits {{under the influence of}} language acquisition development. We find that as language acquisition develops, the total production of difluenices does not decrease correspondingly as we thought, but keeps constant for a period of time. While the proportions of specific disfluencies phenomena change significantly, which features the decrease of pauses and the increase self-repairs. Besides, the grammatical accuracy and language complexity have opposite effects on disfluencies traits. In the first year, disfluencies were <b>displayed</b> mainly as <b>pauses</b> and repetitions since EFL students paid more attention to grammatical accuracy; in the second year, disfluencies featured more self-repairs and less pauses because EFL students transferred their attention to language complexity. We also find language acquisition can only account for partial developmental traits of disfluencies despite of the strong correlations between them, and other factors, such as psychological or social elements, may also take effects. </p...|$|R
40|$|Within the striatum, {{cholinergic}} interneurons, electrophysiologically {{identified as}} tonically active neurons (TANs), represent a relatively homogeneous group {{in terms of}} their functional properties. They <b>display</b> typical <b>pause</b> in tonic firing in response to rewarding events which are of crucial importance for reinforcement learning. These responses are uniformly distributed throughout the dorsal striatum (i. e., motor and associative striatum), but it is unknown, at least in monkeys, whether differences in the modulation of TAN activity exist in the ventral striatum (i. e., limbic striatum), a region specialized for processing of motivational information. To address this issue, we examined the activity of dorsal and ventral TANs in two monkeys trained on a Pavlovian conditioning task in which a visual stimulus preceded the delivery of liquid reward by a fixed time interval. We found that the proportion of TANs responding to the stimulus predictive of reward did not vary significantly across regions (58 %– 80 %), whereas the fraction of TANs responding to reward was higher in the limbic striatum (100 %) compared to the motor (65 %) and associative striatum (52 %). By examining TAN modulation at the level of both the population and the individual neurons, we showed that the duration of pause responses to the stimulus and reward was longer in the ventral than in the dorsal striatal regions. Also, the magnitude of the pause was greater in ventral than dorsal striatum for the stimulus predictive of reward but not for the reward itself. We found similar region-specific differences in pause response duration to the stimulus when the timing of reward was less predictable (fixed replaced by variable time interval). Regional variations in the duration and magnitude of the pause response were transferred from the stimulus to reward when reward was delivered {{in the absence of any}} predictive stimulus. It therefore appears that ventral TANs exhibit stronger responses to rewarding stimuli, compared to dorsal TANs. The high proportion of responsive neurons, combined with particular response features, support the notion that the ventral TAN system can be driven by specific synaptic inputs arising from afferent sources distinct from those targeting the dorsal TAN system...|$|R
