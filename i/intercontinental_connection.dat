A total of 98 documents covering from 1982 to 2010 were found and 95 % had their full contents accessed. Seventy documents were on line scientific abstracts from the Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The occurrence of marine debris in the Antarctic environment, fur seals entanglement in marine debris, interactions between seabirds and marine debris and long range transport of benthos on floating plastics were the main issues discussed.

40|$|The {{osteology}} of the Hadrosauridae dinosaurs from Argentina was {{studied in}} detail and their phylogeny was analyzed within a cladistic framework. The species "Kritosaurus" australis Bonaparte et al., Secernosaurus koerneri Brett-Surman, {{and a new}} genus and species from the Allen Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian) of the La Pampa Province are diagnosed by the identification of several autopomorphies. A new generic combination for "Kritosaurus" australis is proposed because {{of the absence of}} derived common features with Kritosaurus Brown. Remains from the Allen Formation of the Río Negro Province previously assigned to Lambeosaurinae are preliminarily discussed and included as a terminal taxon in the phylogenetic analysis. The cladistic analysis was made scoring 125 cranial, dental and postcranial characters distributed among 26 taxa of ornithischian dinosaurs. The reduced strict consensus shows to "Kritosaurus" australis and the Lambeosaurinae indet. from Río Negro as a monophyletic sister taxon of the group formed by Parasaurolophus + (Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus) by equivocally sharing the presence of a blunt and dorsoventrally low maxillary ascending process. Secernosaurus, the new genus and species from La Pampa Province, and the Hadrosauridae indet. from the Coli Toro Formation are placed within Euhadrosauria more derived than Telmatosaurus although their phylogenetic relationships within the clade remain unsolved. The Hadrosauridae record from Argentina is interpreted as a geodispersal event of North American lambeosaurines, which reached South America through land-bridge connections during the Campanian-Maastrichtian and not as vicariant forms of basal Hadrosauridae present in South America before such <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connection.</b> Sesiones libre...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline the most recent {{advances}} in the knowledge of paleobiogeography and paleoecology of the South American continental mammals during the late Cretaceous-Paleocene span. Two basic parameters were considered: (1) taxonomic richness; and (2) trophic diversity. The genera recorded in the four &# 194;&# 171;land-mammal Ages&# 194;&# 187; (SALMAs) that represent the late Cretaceous-Paleocene span, i. e., Alamitian (late Cretaceous), Tiupampian (early Paleocene), Itaboraian (middle Paleocene), and Riochican (late Paleocene), were used as analytical units. As conclusion, is possible to point out that: 1) During the Alamitian SALMA the faunistic composition of South America was markedly different of that of the holarctic continents, due to the exclusive presence of pre-tribosphenic taxa of pangeic jurassic ancestry, although mostly showing a marked degree of endemism. 2) The tiupampian fauna was basically characterized by the absence of most of the alamitian pre-tribosphenic groups (except the gondwanatherian &# 194;&# 171;multituberculates&# 194;&# 187;) and by the presence of a &# 194;&# 171;mix&# 194;&# 187; of taxa with narrow relationships with North America (e. g., pantodonts) in association with other proper of South America but with holarctic (e. g., marsupial s) or eastern gondwanic ancestry (i. e., monotremes). 3) The most marked compositional change in the South American mammal fauna was recorded between the Alamitian and Tiupampian SALMAs. 4) Beginning to the Itaboraian SALMA, the South American mammal fauna newly shows a marked endemic character that will distinguish all the continental mammal faunas throughout the rest of the Cenozoico 5) The absence of xenarthrans in the pre-itaboraian mammal- bearing sediments is particularly surprising. 6) The diversity of trophic types increases from Alamitian to Riochican SALMAs, because of the progressive occupation of the empty adaptive zones after the dinosaurs extinction, and the opening of new ones. 7) The &# 194;&# 171;cast- of the trophic types observed in South America beginning with the Tiupampian SALMA is radically different to that recorded in the holarctic continents. The placental are restricted to the herbivorous adaptive zones, while marsupial s successfully fill those of the carnivorous, insectivorous, and rodentiform ones. This South American distribution of trophic types would be related with the peculiar physical history of the continent, characterized by vast intervals of isolation with North America, sporadically interrupted by short lapses of <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connection.</b> El objetivo de este trabajo es rese&# 241;ar los &# 250;ltimos avances en el conocimiento de la paleobiogeograf&# 237;a y la paleoecolog&# 237;a los mam&# 237;feros sudamericanos durante el intervalo Cret&# 225;cico tard&# 237;o-Paleoceno. Para ello se tomaron en cuenta dos par&# 225;metros b&# 225;sicos: 1) riqueza taxon&# 243;mica; y 2) diversidad tr&# 243;fica, en ambos casos utilizando como unidades de an&# 225;lisis los g&# 233;neros registrados en las cuatro &# 194;&# 171;Edades-mam&# 237;fero&# 194;&# 187; (SALMAs) que representan dicho lapso, i. e., Alamitense (Cret&# 225;cico tard&# 237;o), Tiupampense (Paleoceno temprano), Itaboraiense (Paleoceno medio) y Riochiquense (Paleoceno tard&# 237;o). A modo de conclusi&# 243;n, cabe destacar que: 1) Durante la SALMA Alamitense la composici&# 243;n faun&# 237;stica de Am&# 233;rica del Sur fue marcadamente diferente al de los continentes hol&# 225;rticos, debido a la presencia de una fauna compuesta exclusivamente por taxones pretribosf&# 233;nicos de abolengo jur&# 225;sico pangeico, aunque presentando en la mayor&# 237;a de los casos un marcado grado de endemismo. 2) La fauna la SALMA Tiupampense se caracteriz&# 243; b&# 225;sicamente por la ausencia de la casi totalidad de los grupos pretribosf&# 233;nicos alamitenses (con la excepci&# 243;n de los &# 194;&# 171;multituberculados&# 194;&# 187; gondwanaterios) y la presencia de una &# 194;&# 171;mezcla&# 194;&# 187; de formas estrechamente vinculadas con Am&# 233;rica del Norte (e. g., pantodontes) junto con otras propias de Am&# 233;rica del Sur pero de abolengo hol&# 225;rtico (e. g., marsupiales) o gondw&# 225;nico oriental (i. e., monotremas). 3) El mayor cambio composicional en la fauna de mam&# 237;feros de Am&# 233;rica del Sur se registr&# 243; entre las SALMAs Alamitense y Tiupampense. 4) A partir de la SALMA Itaboraiense la fauna sudamericana muestra nuevamente un car&# 225;cter francamente end&# 233;mico, particularidad que distinguir&# 225; a las faunas continentales de mam&# 237;feros sudamericanos durante la mayor parte del resto del Cenozoico. 5) Es especialmente llamativa la ausencia de xenartros en los sedimentos mamal&# 237;feros pre-itaboraienses. 6) El espectro de tipos tr&# 243;ficos se increment&# 243; desde la SALMA Alamitense a la Riochiquense, como consecuencia de la paulatina ocupaci&# 243;n de las zonas vacantes luego de la extinci&# 243;n de los dinosaurios y de la aparici&# 243;n de otras nuevas. 7) El &# 194;&# 171;reparto&# 194;&# 187; de los tipos tr&# 243;ficos observado en Am&# 233;rica del Sur a partir de la SALMA Tiupampense es radicalmente distinto al de los continentes hol&# 225;rticos, ya que los placentarios estuvieron restringidos a las zonas de los herb&# 237;voros, en tanto que los marsupiales cubrieron exitosamente aquellas de los carn&# 237;voros, insect&# 237;voros y rodentiformes.

40|$|A biogeographic {{analysis}} is presented for the Holarctic Nephrotoma dorsalis-group {{in relation to}} the palaeogeographic, climatic and floristic history of the Holarctic region in the Cenozoic. Holarctic <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connections</b> across the Atlantic and by way of Beringia are discussed as well as the biogeographic developments in both the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions. Much attention is paid to a comparison with other insect groups.

The early Tertiary origin of the group is located in the eastern Palaearctic, and its members are supposed to have reached Europe not prior to the late Miocene. It is concluded that exchange between the Palaearctic and Nearctic was entirely by way of Beringia where two vicariance events are postulated, namely in the Oligocene and in the late Pliocene. Other vicariances within the dorsalis-group could be correlated with the formation of the Japanese Sea (Miocene), the Himalayan Orogeny (middle Miocene), the development of boreal habitats (middle to late Miocene), the separation of eastern and western North America by climatic and orogenic factors (middle to late Miocene) and the Pleistocene glaciations.

Despite the existence of several published strains, very {{little is known about the}} distribution, host species, and transmission of APMV- 4 strains. To better understand the relationships among these factors, we conducted an APMV- 4 surveillance of wild birds and domestic poultry in six provinces of China suspected of being intercontinental flyways and sites of interspecies transmission. APMV- 4 surveillance was conducted in 9, 160 wild birds representing seven species, and 1, 461 domestic poultry in live bird markets (LMBs) from December 2013 to June 2016. The rate of APMV- 4 isolation was 0. 10 % (11 / 10, 621), and viruses were isolated from swan geese, bean geese, cormorants, mallards, and chickens. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the 11 isolated viruses indicated that all the isolates belonging to genotype I were epidemiologically connected with wild bird-origin viruses from the Ukraine and Italy. Moreover, chicken-origin APMV- 4 strains isolated from the LBMs were highly similar to wild bird-origin viruses from nearby lakes with free-living wild birds. In additional, a hemagglutination-negative APMV- 4 virus was identified. These findings, together with recent APMV- 4 studies, suggest potential virus interspecies transmission between wild birds and domestic poultry, and reveal possible epidemiological <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connections</b> between APMV- 4 transmission by wild birds...|$|R

40|$|Today scientific, {{technological}} and cultural knowledge is shared worldwide. The {{extent to which}} globalized knowledge also existed {{in the past is}} an open question and, moreover, a question that is important for understanding present processes of globalization. This book, the first volume of the series "Studies" of the "Max Planck Research Library for the History and Development of Knowledge," the result of an interdisciplinary cooperation launched in 2007 by a Dahlem Conference, offers surprising answers to this question. Long-distance and <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connections</b> with an attendant spread of knowledge are as old as Homo sapiens themselves. Since its inception, the globalization of knowledge has been a process with its own dynamics, interfering significantly with other processes of intercultural transmission. The four parts of this volume address historical phases in which the production, transmission and transformation of knowledge were crucial for advancing these processes. Part 1 investigates a series of processes in the very early phases of globalization, from the transmission of practical knowledge to the emergence of science. Part 2 explores how knowledge was disseminated {{as a consequence of the}} spread of power and belief structures. Part 3 deals with the encounters between culturally specific knowledge and globalized knowledge. Part 4 is dedicated to the globalization of modern science and to the great challenges, such as energy supply and climate change, that humanity faces when dealing with knowledge todayThe 97 th Dahlem Workshop:The present volume is based on the 97 th Dahlem Workshop on Globalization of Knowledge and its Consequences, Berlin, 18 – 23 November 2007, coordinated by Katharina Ochse.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the energy demand has resulted in searching for new energy sources. Due to the increased prices of fossil fuels and the environmental issues, renewable energy sources has become popular in Europe. Renewable energy generation such as wind, solar and wave has point-to-point connections with the main grid. In order to minimize the disadvantages of renewable energy sources like energy fluctuations, multi-terminal systems are favoured interconnecting energy generation stations among them with the main grid. The long distance interconnection especially for offshore wind farms and <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connections</b> is not possible with traditional alternating current (AC) technology because of the limited power transfer. Therefore, high voltage direct current (HVDC) technology is considered as the main element for the future multi-terminal grid. The conversion between AC and DC is preferred via voltage source converters (VSC) as they offer more flexible power control compared to traditional current source converters in other words line commutated converters (LCC). HVDC power transmission schemes have been constructed depending on the technology of the time, which {{means that there is}} no standardization in voltage levels and configurations of the HVDC schemes. Therefore, the connection of such systems operating at different voltage levels and/or in different schemes such as monopole and bipolar systems for the future multi-terminal DC grids requires DC/DC converters. Although the voltage level and the configurations are the same for both DC systems, DC/DC converter may be required for the power flow control in multi-terminal DC grid. The modular multilevel converter (MMC) seems as the most suitable converter in this application due to its advantages such as low switching losses, high scalability and modularity. MMC control structures are introduced and front-to-front connection of two MMC forming a DC/AC/DC converter is modelled and simulated for different applications such as interconnecting systems with same voltage levels, different voltage levels or different configurations in this study. The passive element sizes of MMC submodules are also compared for different AC side frequency as the component sizes can be decreased thanks to the {{increase in}} the AC frequency which has a disadvantage of higher switching losses. Moreover, the designed converters are tested in multi-terminal DC grids to check their performance and functionality.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} roles of buildings in urban social life. Buildings, as both a methodological tool and a research site, are valuable for understanding society. As a method, buildings allow access to various urban contexts. As a research site, the material and the social are integrated, where buildings and society are shown in continual construction. The overarching case shows how a new building type is born in a society and what buildings do, as both materiality and meaning, to help bring about outcomes. The study follows a single building type through history and analytical levels {{in the city of}} Santiago, Chile where three empirical studies emerge. The first traces a process of late 19 th century urbanization to show the entrance of new residential building types into a city and how the physical and social landscape is reshaped in the process, emphasizing how one urban form emerges and is defined. <b>Intercontinental</b> <b>connections</b> bring new architecture and new language, stabilizing the link between form and name in the city. The resulting spectrum of buildings within the type shows how the diversity of residents shapes material outcomes. As the new buildings become fixed in the urban landscape, so too do social categories. How buildings change definitions both between and within societies, as well as start to take on meanings, is explored. Once definitions and form are established, the following studies explore {{the roles of}} the buildings in contemporary urban life. Photos analysis is employed to examine uses of shared space (a patio) in a residential building where buildings are theorized as material structures that contribute to patterned activities. It addresses how the building creates opportunities for observed everyday uses of private collective space. Using published comparison cases demonstrates that practices appear to differ between buildings of the same type when income of residents differs. It is hypothesized that opportunity is created not by the existence of the space per se, but by its gated enclosure, which separates the public street from the private space. The building is understood as a bound that simultaneously fosters interaction and exclusion. In addition, activities in these spaces, over time, contribute to new cultural understandings of the building type, showing how use can generate meaning. The last empirical study examines the reuse of residential buildings for commercial purposes in one neighborhood. The goal is to illuminate roles buildings play in contemporary neighborhood transformations. Rather than understanding transformation through reuse itself, modes of material conversions are examined. The differences between older conversions and newer ones in the area highlight the role of visible characteristics in the newly reused buildings. The material maintenance of residential facades on new conversions locks in the visual of a residential neighborhood, where intended function is built into form, even under commercial reuse. This is valuable in line with a constructed narrative about the place that focuses on the past. The building type under investigation is further redefined as reused buildings take on visual and spatial similarities to housing models from a past era that were not involved in changes in the neighborhood, but appear as if they were. This study relies on participant observation and analysis of marketing materials, as well as other documentary sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Cattle {{domestication}} {{started in}} the 9 th millennium BC in Southwest Asia. Domesticated cattle were then introduced into Europe during the Neolithic transition. However, the scarcity of palaeogenetic data from the first European domesticated cattle still inhibits the accurate reconstruction of their early demography. In this study, mitochondrial DNA from 193 ancient and 597 modern domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) from sites across Europe, Western Anatolia and Iran were analysed to {{provide insight into the}} Neolithic dispersal process {{and the role of the}} local European aurochs population during cattle domestication. Results Using descriptive summary statistics and serial coalescent simulations paired with approximate Bayesian computation we find: (i) decreasing genetic diversity in a southeast to northwest direction, (ii) strong correlation of genetic and geographical distances, iii) an estimated effective size of the Near Eastern female founder population of 81, iv) that the expansion of cattle from the Near East and Anatolia into Europe does not appear to constitute a significant bottleneck, and that v) there is evidence for gene-flow between the Near Eastern/Anatolian and European cattle populations in the early phases of the European Neolithic, but that it is restricted after 5, 000 BCE. Conclusions The most plausible scenario to explain these results is a single and regionally restricted domestication process of cattle in the Near East with subsequent migration into Europe during the Neolithic transition without significant maternal interbreeding with the endogenous wild stock. Evidence for gene-flow between cattle populations from Southwestern Asia and Europe during the earlier phases of the European Neolithic points towards <b>intercontinental</b> trade <b>connections</b> between Neolithic farmers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUrban {{transportation}} problem -a {{major issue}} for all metropolises- must be mitigated using “sustainable” solutions, {{and to this}} end, new methods must be developed via “Transportation Demand Management Systems”. In this context, «effective management of transport demands and efficient use of the existing transport infrastructure » has been established as a strategy that envisages a change of understanding and approach to sort out Istanbul's transport problem. The rapidly growing rate of private car ownership {{is one of the}} main reasons for the transportation problems in our city. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, around 25 % of all cars in the country are registered in Istanbul. In addition, data from Energy Market Regulatory Authority of Turkey (EPDK) suggest that around 18 % of total fuel consumption in our country takes place in Istanbul. Such high prevalence of vehicle ownership has major social and economic implications while elevated levels of fuel consumption and the associated emissions make dire impacts on the environment. The foregoing study examines the practices that could be introduced to remedy the problem of intensive traffic which has enormous implications not only worldwide but particularly in Istanbul -our largest metropolis- by using urban solutions, congestion charges applied in most European countries as a means for effective management of traffic, and the practice of low emission zones which prioritizes environmental consciousness. In this context, it presents a number of comparative analyses on the practices in various countries. After reviewing these analyses in terms of the specific needs of Istanbul, the study provides a recommendation for a hybrid model involving “Low Emission Based Congestion Charging” which brings together congestion charges and environmental restrictions of the traffic demand management system planned to be implemented. What's more, traffic congestion in Istanbul is most severely experienced on the bridges which function as <b>intercontinental</b> <b>connections.</b> The main reason for that is –once again- the high rate of private vehicle ownership and inefficient use of vehicles. As a solution to this problem, introduction of a “high occupancy vehicle” practice is recommended to ensure transportation of more people rather than more vehicles in the traffic. In this framework, the study presents a recommendation for new tariff system for traffic density management based on the results of a density analysis over bridge crossings, and it provides and innovative and hybrid method for demand management with “high occupancy vehicles practice to be implemented along with alternative fares charged for bridge crossings”. Introduction of these practices would ensure effective traffic management, and provide for a reduction on emission levels by supporting the elevation of occupancy rates of private vehicles, which is expected to eventually decrease the number of vehicles in traffic. Furthermore, it is anticipated that public transport would be encouraged by ensuring public transport prioritization in the fares; and enhanced punctuality of public transport vehicles would make a major contribution for sustainable transport. The study also explores the political and legal implications associated with the implementation of the recommended practices. Last but not least, introduction of such practices in cities must be promoted through “Basic Principles of the European Union's Environmental Policy” and “Air Quality Framework Directive”. All these practices would provide for an environmentalist outlook on behalf of our country, and as the prerequisites of a livable city, these practices would facilitate the harmonization of our country with the relevant standards as part of the process of joining the European Union...|$|R

With a reflection on the practice of 'writing cities' from two leading urbanists and a focus throughout the volume on empirical work driving theoretical elaboration, this book will be essential reading for those interested in the politics of social science method, transnational urbanism, affective practices and new perspectives on power relations in neoliberal times. The international range of linked case studies presented here will be a valuable resource for students and scholars in sociology, anthropology, urban studies, cultural studies and contemporary history, and for urban policy makers interested in innovative perspectives on social relations and urban form. </p...|$|R
