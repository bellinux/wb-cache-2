5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} do {{not consider}} the story to be describing a <b>historical</b> <b>event</b> but a pious fiction created {{by the author of}} the Gospel of Matthew.|$|E
5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, and I could not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and <b>historical</b> <b>event.</b> Nothing could ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
5|$|Two {{approaches}} have dominated {{explanations of the}} story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account of a <b>historical</b> <b>event.</b> The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read in his English Prose Style, published in 1931. It provided the inspiration for his only novel, The Green Child, written in 1934.|$|E
50|$|The novel first {{introduces}} {{with what}} actual <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> happened in our timeline and then {{tells of the}} point of divergence of <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> before it begins its story.|$|R
50|$|The {{plot of the}} play, {{while making}} {{reference}} to the actual 12th century <b>historical</b> <b>events,</b> and {{to a number of}} other narratives in the Yoshitsune sekai, also parallels in many ways aspects of the <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> of the siege of Osaka.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{traditional}} cultures limited mythical {{events to}} the beginning of time, and saw important <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> as repetitions of those mythical events. According to Mircea Eliade, the Hebrew prophets [...] "valorized" [...] history, seeing <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> as episodes in a continual divine revelation. This doesn't mean that all <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> have significance in Judaism; however, in Jewish mythology, significant events happen throughout history, and they are not merely repetitions of each other; each significant event is a new act of God: ...|$|R
5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a <b>historical</b> <b>event</b> might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a <b>historical</b> <b>event</b> and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the <b>historical</b> <b>event</b> include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
