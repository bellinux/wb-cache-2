25|$|After major {{modifications}} and upgrades, including {{installation of a}} two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status {{in the summer of}} 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major Level 2 performance milestones within NASA's ERAST program: to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely piloted aircraft for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum <b>density</b> <b>altitude</b> of 57,300 feet during the mission.|$|E
500|$|On July 9, 2009, the NTSB {{declared}} the probable {{cause of the}} crash as [...] "the pilot's inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane.

The J170 features a strut-braced high-wing with winglets, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing and welded 4130 steel tubing. Its two-bladed rotor has a diameter of 25 ft and may use either manufactured metal blades or homemade Gyrotor wooden blades. The prototype was originally flown with wooden blades of 8 ft each, with a 5 ft hub bar, for a diameter of 21 ft. In this configuration the aircraft flew acceptably, but did not climb well on hot days at higher <b>density</b> <b>altitudes.</b> The minimum control speed is 10 mph ...|$|R
500|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the probable cause of the accident was Reid's [...] "improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions (including turbulence, gusty winds, and an advancing thunderstorm and associated precipitation) when the airplane was overweight and when the <b>density</b> <b>altitude</b> was higher than he was accustomed to, resulting in a stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed." [...] The NTSB further determined that [...] "contributing to the pilot in command's decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary, in part, because of media commitments." ...|$|E

The NTSB report says that [...] "a meteorologist from Salinas provided a numerical simulation of the conditions in the accident area using the WRF-ARW (Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model. At 0930 [...] the model displayed downdrafts in that area of approximately 300 feet per minute." [...] There was no evidence of equipment failure. The report stated that a postmortem examination of the skeletal fragments had been performed {{under the auspices of the}} Madera County Sheriff's Department. The cause of death was determined to be multiple traumatic injuries. The ELT was destroyed by the crash.|$|E

2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} pilot in command (PIC) allowing the aircraft to be loaded beyond its operating limitations. The required pre-flight weight and balance computations would have shown it was dangerously overloaded and also outside its weight and balance operating envelope, but in this instance the pilot in command, as a former military pilot, was neither accustomed to nor responsible for computing weight and balance computations during his military career, as this was the responsibility of the military loadmaster, and thus it is believed he may have by force of habit overlooked this responsibility as a civilian pilot is required to do. Don Alan Burmeister was a former United States Marine Corps aviator, but FAA records show he had very limited experience / training in flying conventional (vs. centerline thrust) twin engine aircraft. [...] Records show it was only a short time prior to the accident (6/9/82) that he completed a check-ride to remove the [...] "centerline thrust" [...] restriction from his pilot's certificate. This check-ride should have fully evaluated his ability to fly a conventional multi-engine aircraft throughout its designed range of operations, but the flight examiner was decertified the next month (7/10/82) by the FAA due to a [...] "history of incomplete or substandard check-rides". Additionally, the insurance carrier (Ideal Mutual Insurance Co.) required Burmeister to log 1,045 hrs of flying time, attend a Cessna ground and flight training course, as well as log 15 hours in a Cessna 414 (C-414) prior to acting as the PIC of the leased aircraft. The NTSB record shows he failed to accomplish all of these requirements, with disastrous results. With pilot and eleven passengers, the aircraft was overloaded by an estimated , and the location of the center of gravity was found to be [...] beyond the maximum aft limit. Combined with an air temperature of , creating a condition known as [...] "hot and high" [...] (high <b>density</b> <b>altitude,</b> producing a lower climb rate on takeoff and greater danger of stalling), the C-414 could do little but struggle into the air within ground effect, and once airborne was left virtually uncontrollable. These factors prevented the aircraft from ever attaining sufficient altitude, and it crashed into trees {{less than a mile from}} the airport.|$|E
50|$|<b>Density</b> <b>{{altitude}}</b> is {{the altitude}} corrected for non-ISA International Standard Atmosphere atmospheric conditions. Aircraft performance depends on <b>density</b> <b>altitude,</b> which {{is affected by}} barometric pressure, humidity and temperature. On a very hot day, <b>density</b> <b>altitude</b> at an airport (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high as to preclude takeoff, particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft.|$|E

This includes capture into Earth orbit from, for example, Lunar-return or Mars-return orbit.

These destinations fall into two groups: (1) The rocky planets, which have warm surface temperatures (approx. 200 to 750 K) and rapid decrease of <b>density</b> with <b>altitude,</b> and (2) the gas giants and Titan, which have cold temperatures (approx. 70 to 170 K) at the surface or 1 -bar pressure level, and slow rate of decrease of <b>density</b> with <b>altitude.</b> The height variation of average <b>density</b> with <b>altitude</b> above 1 -bar pressure level for the gas giant planets is shown.
