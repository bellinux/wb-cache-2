The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life both {{in and around the}} river. However, the development of the river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation. The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty-five percent of Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as <b>diadromous</b> fish.|$|E

5000|$|To better {{understand}} {{the life cycle of}} the Smelt the population must first be broken down into two groups: lacustrine/reservoir and <b>diadromous</b> populations. Lacustrine or reservoir referring to lake and artificially created water bodies and <b>diadromous</b> referring to fish that spend their life partially in freshwater, partially in saltwater. <b>Diadromous</b> Smelt spend the first life stage in the sea, estuary or lower parts of rivers. In the mature stage, during spring, adults migrate upstream into lakes through river access. The fish populations then feed throughout Summer and early Autumn, spawning in late Autumn on sand bars. Lacustrine and reservoir Smelt do not migrate, but rather feed and reproduce inside their habitats. The Smelt is a semelparous species, meaning that adults usually die after spawning, at around one year of age. While not much is known about Smelt breeding habits, it has been theorised that Smelt may spawn several times per breeding season, but not over more than one season. The preferred conditions for spawning are: clean sand in water 0.5 to 2.5 metres deep in slow moving or “slack” waters. The required period for egg incubation decreases as water temperature increases, with optimal temperatures between 14 and 18 degrees Celsius. The fastest incubation times observed were found in lacustrine rather than <b>diadromous</b> Smelt, with 8 - 10 days for lacustrine fish as compared to 10 - 18 days for the <b>diadromous</b> populations. Once the larvae have hatched they disperse through the water column at depths up to 40 metres. Larvae size ranges from 4 millimetres to approximately 30 millimetres. Once larvae have exceeded the 25mm mark they are classed as juveniles. During this stage their behaviour changes from “planktonic” to surface orientated. They begin to form schools and their depth range reduces to just 20 metres. Smelt are naturally a shoaling species, which means they prefer to swim near the surface in schools rather than resting or hiding in the aquatic substrate/. [...] At 30 mm long, the Smelt can migrate and by 50 mm of length they are classed as adults, where their depth range is much larger - anywhere between 20 and 70 metres deep.|$|E
5000|$|The {{climbing}} galaxias {{is unlikely}} {{to be confused with the}} other <b>diadromous</b> whitebait species because of its shape. It is elongated and slender, shaped almost like a tube. The sides and back are covered in a variable pattern of golden blotches and bands that gleam and glitter in the sun, making the climbing galaxias an attractive fish.|$|E
50|$|In May 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Massachusetts Riverways Program, {{and volunteers}} from the Sudbury Valley Trustees (SVT) {{released}} 7,000 adult alewife (river herring) into the Concord River. They were transferred from the Nemasket River {{so that they could}} lay their eggs and spawn upstream. This imprinted the young alewives with the Concord as their new home river. The experiment did not succeed, as too few fish returned {{to the base of the}} first dam on the Concord River. A feasibility study published in 2016 is again exploring steps necessary for returning <b>diadromous</b> fish to the Concord River, and farther upstream, to the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers. Anadromous describes species that live in salt water but lay eggs in fresh water - such as alewives and shad; <b>diadromous</b> is a larger grouping which includes species that mature in fresh water but return to salt water to lay eggs - such as eels.|$|E
50|$|According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a {{total of}} 156.2 million tons of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other aquatic animals were {{captured}} in 2011.

50|$|The giant bully (Gobiomorphus gobioides) is {{a species}} of sleeper goby endemic to New Zealand. This is the largest species of bully and it can reach more than 25 cm in length, but most are 12 - 15 cm. Adults are {{generally}} found near the coast in freshwater, tidal or estuarine habitats. The breeding behavior is poorly known, but the species is considered <b>diadromous</b> and it is suspected that the larvae spend time in the sea.|$|E
50|$|Galaxiids are coolwater species, {{with many}} wholly {{freshwater}} species specialising in high-altitude upland streams (including very small streams), rivers, and lakes. Some galaxiids include a marine stage in their lifecycles where larvae are washed {{out to sea}} to develop, and return to rivers as juveniles. This type of <b>diadromous</b> fish migration is known as amphidromy. These species are consequently also found in low-altitude habitats, but frequently migrate to high-altitude reaches of river systems in their adult stage.|$|E
50|$|A fish ladder, {{also known}} as a fishway, fish pass or fish steps, is a {{structure}} on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as dams, locks and waterfalls) to facilitate <b>diadromous</b> fishes' natural migration. Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term ladder) into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.|$|E

50|$|No agamas or iguanas are {{recorded}} from New Zealand; lizards {{are represented by}} geckos and skinks, which arrived multiple times. The fossil record shows a highly diverse herpetofauna during the Miocene, with a mekosuchine crocodile and meiolaniid and pleurodire turtles being known from the Saint Bathans Fauna. The tuatara, reaching 60 cm (23.6 inches), is New Zealand's largest living reptile, a last remnant from the once diverse clade that was Sphenodontia. Frogs, which because of their intolerance for saltwater are assumed to have descended from ancestors that broke off from Gondwana, {{are one of the}} few exceptions to the rule that amphibians are never found on oceanic islands (another being the frogs of Fiji).

50|$|Fresh water {{creates a}} {{hypotonic}} environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney. Although most aquatic organisms {{have a limited}} ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, <b>diadromous</b> fish {{have the ability to}} migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) uses the hormone prolactin, while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.|$|E

40|$|Southern smelts (Retropinna spp.) {{in coastal}} rivers of Australia are facultatively <b>diadromous,</b> with populations {{potentially}} containing individuals with <b>diadromous</b> or wholly freshwater life histories. The presence of <b>diadromous</b> individuals {{is expected to}} reduce genetic structuring between river basins due to larval dispersal via the sea. We use otolith chemistry to distinguish between <b>diadromous</b> and nondiadromous life histories and population genetics to examine interbasin connectivity resulting from diadromy. Otolith strontium isotope (87 Sr: 86 Sr) transects identified three main life history patterns: amphidromy, freshwater residency and estuarine/marine residency. Despite the potential for interbasin connectivity via larval mixing in the marine environment, we found unprecedented levels of genetic structure for an amphidromous species. Strong hierarchical structure along putative taxonomic boundaries was detected, along with highly structured populations within groups using microsatellites (FST = 0. 046 – 0. 181), and mtDNA (ΦST = 0. 498 – 0. 816). The presence of strong genetic subdivision, {{despite the fact that}} many individuals reside in saline water during their early life history, appears incongruous. However, analysis of multielemental signatures in the otolith cores of <b>diadromous</b> fish revealed strong discrimination between river basins, suggesting that <b>diadromous</b> fish spend their early lives within chemically distinct estuaries rather than the more homogenous marine environment, thus avoiding dispersal and maintaining genetic structure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diadromous</b> fishes are a {{frequent}} but poorly understood component of coastal riverine fish communities in Australia. Many of Australia’s coastal riverine fish, including <b>diadromous</b> species, have undergone declines in abundance and distribution since European settlement. Fish {{that were once}} plentiful are now generally rare or appear to be extinct in some catchments or parts of their range. However, as a group, <b>diadromous</b> fish species have complex lifecycles, the details of which have not been well investigated. The various environments and habitats used by <b>diadromous</b> fish are also under threat, through poor land practices, land reclamation and river regulation. The current study aimed to fulfil a number of gaps in the current knowledge of <b>diadromous</b> fishes in Australia. The primary objective {{was to examine the}} current distribution, abundance and biology of <b>diadromous</b> fish species of south eastern Australia. As information on <b>diadromous</b> fishes in Australia was limited, an extensive review of the literature has been conducted as a basis for identifying knowledge gaps. From this review, it was estimated that 33 Australian fish species display <b>diadromous</b> lifecycles, of which only seven have information available for most life stages (Lates calcarifer, Macquaria novemaculeata, Galaxias maculatus, G. brevipinnis, G. truttaceus, Geotria australis and Mordacia mordax). Diadromy in Australian fish species is dominated by amphidromy (45. 5 %) and catadromy (42. 4 %), with only a small proportion of the <b>diadromous</b> species anadromous (12. 1 %). The geographical distribution of diadromy in Australia showed that the highest species richness occurred in the north east and south east of the continent, with lowest species richness in the south west. Latitudinally, northern latitudes of Australia are dominated by amphidromy, the central latitudes by catadromy and the southern latitudes have relatively even numbers of all three <b>diadromous</b> types. The lack of information on <b>diadromous</b> fishes and the high level of environmental degradation and river regulation in south eastern Australia highlight the urgent need for further research on <b>diadromous</b> species in this region. <b>Diadromous</b> fishes use a range of marine and freshwater environments at different life history stages. As a result, a variety of fish sampling methods were trialled and their efficiency in catching a wide range of species and fish sizes in marine and freshwater environments was assessed. The examined methods included: seine net, scoop net, fyke net, plankton nets, light traps and fish traps. Each method proved useful for capturing certain fish species and fish sizes. Overall, the seine net caught the greatest number of individuals and species, and this method was also time efficient for catching and sorting the catch. As a result, seine nets were adopted for all of the larger scale studies that were conducted in the current research. The broadscale study (Chapter 4) conducted over a large spatial scale also incorporated scoop nets, bait traps and multi panel gill nets, as these provided a range of active and passive methods which allowed rapid assessment of fish at each site. The more detailed study (Chapter 5) aimed to examine a wide range of fish sizes and life stages over larger temporal scales, and used all the methods that were trialled in the pilot study, as the use of these methods ensured that the entire lifecycle of <b>diadromous</b> species could be sampled. The distribution and abundance patterns of <b>diadromous</b> and riverine fishes were investigated over large spatial scales, by sampling at 47 sites in 17 catchments between 2004 and 2005. A total of 13 269 fish from 31 species were recorded and these were dominated in number by native freshwater fishes (10 252 fish, 8 species), when compared with introduced freshwater fishes (1 570 fish, 3 species), marine fishes (777 fish, 10 species) and <b>diadromous</b> fishes (670 fish, 10 species). Although <b>diadromous</b> fish were only recorded in limited abundance, they were important in that they constituted: a large number of species to the assemblages; larger sized fish to the community; and, key species to reproductive, trophic and behavioural guilds. In particular, <b>diadromous</b> fish made up the majority of carnivorous species which feed on allochthonous inputs and they also contributed to herbivorous and omnivorous guilds. Multivariate analyses (MDS and ANOSIM) significantly delineated fish assemblages based on marine and coastal bioregions, river size, estuary type and river reach. SIMPER revealed that a range of freshwater, introduced, marine and <b>diadromous</b> fish contributed to these differences in the fish communities. Galaxias maculatus, Gobiomorphus australis, Potamalosa richmondia and M. novemaculeata were the <b>diadromous</b> species which most often contributed to these differences. The temporal and spatial variability of <b>diadromous</b> fish assemblages were examined in more detail in the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers. Differences in fish assemblages were influenced spatially by the longitudinal gradients throughout the catchment and by the migrational patterns and recruitment of <b>diadromous</b> fishes. Temporal variation in <b>diadromous</b> fish assemblages were also complicated by the lifecycle of <b>diadromous</b> fishes as many species have migrating larvae, juveniles and/ or adults which mean they can be present in the stream throughout all seasons but in different life stages. As a result, <b>diadromous</b> fish assemblages in the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers exhibited complex spatial and temporal patterns which reflected their lifecycles and migratory requirements. Longitudinal changes in <b>diadromous</b> fish assemblages in the Shoalhaven River were also influenced by the presence of Tallowa Dam. Fish communities below this structure were more similar to those further downstream, but <b>diadromous</b> fishes were also affected by cold water pollution below this structure. The abundance of <b>diadromous</b> fish were also negatively correlated with distance from the tidal limit, but were generally positively correlated with instream habitats such as woody debris and undercut bank. The migratory history of five species were examined through otolith microchemistry. In order to ensure that otolith Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca values in wild fish were the result of ambient salinities, a manipulative experiment was conducted. Fish were held in various salinities and temperatures for a period of up to 62 days. The resulting Sr:Ca values showed patterns which reflected that of the salinity regime. However, for some species the Ba:Ca values did not appear to reflect changes in salinity. Transects across otoliths from wild caught fish also revealed distinct variations in otolith Sr:Ca values, with patterns that indicated a <b>diadromous</b> lifecycle in freshwater mullet (Myxus petardi) and striped gudgeon (Gobiomorphus australis). Freshwater herring (Potamalosa richmondia), Cox’s gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii) and bullrout (Notesthes robusta) displayed less obvious patterns in Sr:Ca values, perhaps reflecting more complex patterns of movement between marine and freshwater environments. Although, some of these species were previously thought to be <b>diadromous,</b> the current study suggested that, for some species, the type of diadromy (or range of movements) may differ from those previously documented. The most important finding was the apparent amphidromous lifecycle of M. petardi, in at least for these populations from the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers. This research provided new information on the biology and status of a number of <b>diadromous</b> fish species of south eastern Australia. Of particular importance was the collection of new information about M. petardi and P. richmondia, including the capture of larvae and juveniles from brackish water. These data supported the <b>diadromous</b> lifecycles, which were indicated by otolith microchemistry. Age estimates confirmed longevity in P. richmondia (~ 10 years) and M. petardi (~ 5 years) and from the specimens of N. robusta that were examined it appears that they have longevity in excess of five years. This study also highlighted an apparent decline in distribution and abundance of Prototroctes maraena and Pseudaphritis urvillii on the NSW south coast, which may be a cause for concern. More research is required to determine the status and threats for these species, in particular. The current study has provided important new information about the distribution and abundance patterns, as well as the biology, for a number of <b>diadromous</b> species in this region. It has also highlighted the need for further research and management of this important group of fish...|$|E

Long-term trends in oxic conditions show the river is undergoing a natural recovery process, nevertheless five of ten <b>diadromous</b> species recorded were still restricted to the brackish part of the estuary. Despite poor conditions, five species reached the upper freshwater part of the estuary. Erratic free-flowing conditions at the tidal weir offered limited opportunities for some <b>diadromous</b> species to migrate into the non-tidal part of the river. Upstream migration over the second barrier is almost completely blocked. Rehabilitation schemes to restore self-sustaining populations of <b>diadromous</b> fish in the cross-border River Scheldt need to include the building of fish bypasses and improved wastewater treatment and habitat restoration programmes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diadromous</b> fishes are a {{frequent}} but poorly understood component of coastal riverine fish communities in Australia. There are ∼ 33 <b>diadromous</b> fishes found in Australian waters, mainly catadromous and amphidromous species. An extensive {{review of the}} literature identified major information gaps about the lifecycles and ecology of many of these species, with information on facultative diadromy, navigation, marine and early life stages being particularly limited. In many cases, this lack of information has led to poor management decisions and consequently many of the Australian <b>diadromous</b> species are under increasing threat from a range of environmental impacts. Much of the required information is difficult to obtain with traditional field surveys and, as a result, new and improved research tools and technologies, including telemetry, otolith chemistry, stable-isotope analysis (SIA) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are increasingly being applied. Key areas for research on Australian <b>diadromous</b> fishes should involve: (1) use of telemetry and otolith chemistry to determine the level of facultative diadromy and variation in <b>diadromous</b> movements across a species range; (2) use of otolith chemistry and SIA to gain a greater understanding of larval and juvenile marine life stages of catadromous and amphidromous species; and (3) use of fMRI or traditional techniques such as electroolfactogram (EOG) to determine the role of olfaction in spawning and migration, and the impact of impoundments and agricultural run-off on these critical life history stages...|$|E
