25|$|Block I AGC {{memory was}} {{organized}} into 1 <b>kiloword</b> banks. The lowest bank (bank 0) was erasable memory (RAM). All banks above bank 0 were fixed memory (ROM). Each AGC instruction had a 12-bit address field. The lower bits (1-10) addressed the memory inside each bank. Bits 11 and 12 selected the bank: 00 selected the erasable memory bank; 01 selected the lowest bank (bank 1) of fixed memory; 10 selected {{the next one}} (bank 2); and 11 selected the Bank register {{that could be used}} to select any bank above 2. Banks 1 and 2 were called fixed-fixed memory, because they were always available, regardless of the contents of the Bank register. Banks 3 and above were called fixed-switchable because the selected bank was determined by the bank register.|$|E
50|$|It was an 18-bit, {{fixed point}} {{architecture}} with multiply and divide. Memory was modularized into 8 <b>kiloword</b> modules, {{with a maximum}} of 64 kilo-words.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, {{the price}} of a 16 kW (<b>kiloword,</b> {{equivalent}} to 32 kB) core memory board that fitted into a DEC Q-bus computer was around [...] At that time, core array and supporting electronics fit on a single printed circuit board about 25 × 20 cm in size, the core array was mounted a few mm above the PCB and was protected with a metal or plastic plate.|$|E
25|$|The Block I AGC {{initially}} had 12 <b>kilowords</b> {{of fixed}} memory, {{but this was}} later increased to 24 <b>kilowords.</b> Block II had 32 <b>kilowords</b> of fixed memory and 4 <b>kilowords</b> of erasable memory.|$|R

50|$|The code of {{the system}} was written in {{assembly}} language for the Dutch Electrologica X8 computer. This computer had a word size of 27 bits, 32 <b>kilowords</b> of core memory, 512 <b>kilowords</b> of drum memory providing backing store for the LRU cache algorithm, paper tape readers, paper tape punches, plotters, and printers.|$|R
50|$|The Q-31s were {{equipped}} with four 16 <b>kiloword</b> memory banks. The memory bank was {{oil and water}} cooled. Also considered {{as part of the}} memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were four 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a plugboard, similar to the one used in IBM unit record equipment, that had the capacity of 32 words, so longer bootstrap or diagnostic programs could be installed in plug panels which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used. This served as a primitive ROM.|$|E
5000|$|Later, the [...] "Model B" [...] {{version of}} the 2060 {{processors}} removed the 256 <b>kiloword</b> limitation on the virtual address space, by allowing the use of up to 32 [...] "sections" [...] of up to 256 kilowords each, along with substantial changes to the instruction set. [...] "Model A" [...] and [...] "Model B" [...] KL10 processors {{can be thought of}} as being different CPUs. The first operating system that took advantage of the Model B's capabilities was TOPS-20 release 3, and user mode extended addressing was offered in TOPS-20 release 4. TOPS-20 versions after release 4.1 would only run on a Model B.|$|E

40|$|American daily {{newspapers}} present millions of punctuated sentences to the public, yet [...] after an extensive search of literature for similar studies [...] no {{comprehensive study of}} punctuation frequency {{seems to have been}} made before this study. It is hypothesized (1) that punctuation appears at predictable rates in the main news section of American {{daily newspapers}}, (2) that statistically significant differences exist in punctuation frequency between each of five selected newspapers and [...] by group [...] between those of large and small cities, and (3) that statistically significant differences exist in punctuation frequency between 1976, 1966, 1956 and 1946. Five newspapers were selected for the study: The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, and The Denver Post. The sample dates are February 29, 1976 [...] the first Sunday following the approval of this study [...] , and the three decades preceeding it, viz., February 27, 1966, February 26, 1956, and March 3, 1946. Samples included the first page of the main news section of each paper. After preliminary studies to determine an appropriate sample size, it was decided to use all words appearing on the first page of each of the twenty newspapers. Twelve marks of punctuation and twenty-three subcategories of use were enumerated as they occurred for each of the 52, 184 words which appear on the first page of the twenty newspapers. These include two uses of the apostrophe, colons, eight uses of the comma, dashes, ellipses, terminal and other use of the exclamation point, three uses of the hyphen, parentheses, three uses of the period, terminal and other use of the question mark, two uses of the quotation mark, and three uses of the semicolon. Frequencies were found within all twenty cells which ranged from no occurrences to 111 commas per <b>kiloword.</b> Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated for each use in each cell. These ranged from ± 12. 41 % to ± 196 %. Using the summary data for all punctuation for each of the cells, mean punctuation frequencies and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for (a) each cell, (b) for each newspaper, (c) for large and small cities, (d) for each decade, and (e) for all data. These means and confidence intervals were found for terminal marks and for intrasentence marks as well as all marks. It was found that all punctuation occurred at the rate of 199 marks per <b>kiloword</b> ± 1. 9 %, that there were 24 words per sentence ± 4. 1 %, and that intrasentence punctuation occurred at the rate of 156 marks per <b>kiloword</b> ± 2. 3 %. Analyses of variance were conducted to determine if any of the differences across cells were statistically significant. The number of words per sentence was significantly different by both decade and newspaper at a probability level of 99 %. The frequency of all punctuation, and the frequency of intrasentence punctuation did not change by either decade or newspaper...|$|E

25|$|A Block II {{version of}} the AGC was {{designed}} in 1966. It retained the basic Block I architecture, but increased erasable memory from 1 to 2 <b>kilowords.</b> Fixed memory was expanded from 24 to 36 <b>kilowords.</b> Instructions were expanded from 11 to 34 and I/O channels were implemented to replace the I/O registers on Block I. The Block II version {{is the one that}} actually flew to the moon. Block I was used during the unmanned Apollo 4 and 6 flights, and was on board the ill-fated Apollo I.|$|R
50|$|The Sigma 5 {{sold for}} US$300,000 with 16 <b>kilowords</b> of random-access magnetic-core memory, with an {{optional}} memory upgrade to 32 kW {{for an additional}} $50,000. The hard disk drive had a capacity of 3 megabytes.|$|R
25|$|The {{computer}} had 2048 {{words of}} erasable magnetic core memory and 36 <b>kilowords</b> of read-only core rope memory. Both had cycle times of 11.72microseconds. The memory word length was 16 bits: 15 bits {{of data and}} one odd-parity bit. The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 bits of data, one overflow bit, and one sign bit (ones' complement representation).|$|R
5000|$|The {{permanently}} {{resident kernel}} of this powerful multiprocessor mainframe computing utility, much derided in its day {{as being too}} large and complex, was only 135 KiB of code. In comparison, a Linux system in 2007 might have occupied 18 MiB. [...] The first MIT GE-645 had 512 <b>kilowords</b> of memory (2 MiB), a truly enormous amount at the time, and the kernel used only a moderate portion of Multics main memory.|$|R
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to expand the}} memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed {{at any given time}} was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 <b>kilowords,</b> so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 <b>kilowords.</b> All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.|$|R
50|$|Call Stores {{were the}} system's read/write memory, {{containing}} {{the data for}} calls in progress and other temporary data. They had a 24-bit word, of which one bit was for parity check. They operated similar to magnetic core memory, except that the ferrite was in sheets with a hole for each bit, and the coincident current address and readout wires passed through that hole. The first Call Stores held 8 <b>Kilowords,</b> in a frame approximately a meter wide and two meters tall.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Sequential {{introduced}} {{a follow-up to}} the Prophet 2000, the Studio 440. Instead of a keyboard, the Studio 440 used a drum machine format and included a sequencer. The 440 also {{made it easier to}} access the full 512 <b>kilowords</b> of available memory by allowing the creation of samples as long as 12 seconds. Like the Prophet 3000, the Studio 440—and many of Sequential's products—lost sales due to the brand loyalty demanded by its competitors, including Akai Professional, Roland Corporation, and Korg.|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{of this was}} {{that the size of}} segments was limited to 256 <b>kilowords,</b> just over 1 MiB. This was due to the particular hardware architecture of the machines on which Multics ran, having a 36-bit word size and index registers (used to address within segments) of half that size (18 bits). Extra code had to be used to work on files larger than this, called multisegment files. In the days when one megabyte of memory was prohibitively expensive, and before large databases and later huge bitmap graphics, this limit was rarely encountered.|$|R
5000|$|Like most {{systems of}} the era, the machine was built with a bank of core memory as the primary storage, {{allowing}} between 16 and 64 <b>kilowords.</b> Words were 24 bits plus a parity bit. [...] This was backed up {{by a variety of}} secondary storage devices, including a 1376 kWord drum in Genie, or hard disks in the SDS models {{in the form of a}} drum-like 2097 kWord ‘fixed head’ disk or a 16 384 kWord traditional ‘floating head’ model. The SDS machines also included a paper tape punch and reader, line printer, and a real-time clock. They bootstrapped from paper tape.|$|R
5000|$|Intended to {{represent}} Sequential's first {{entry into the}} low-cost digital sampler market, the Prophet 2000 was equipped with 256 <b>kilowords</b> of sample memory (word length of 12 bits = 1 sample), and sampling rates of 16, 32, and 42 kHz at 12-bit audio resolution. External storage was available through 3.5" [...] diskettes. The Prophet 2000 featured MIDI (in, out, and thru), 8-voice polyphony, up to 8 layers, and an arpeggiator. Despite their technological limitations, early digital samplers like the Prophet 2000 are noted for their warm audio quality {{as a result of}} using analog VCFs and VCAs.|$|R
5000|$|... 1AESS used memory with 26-bit words, {{of which}} two were for parity checking. The initial version had 32 <b>Kilowords</b> of core mats. Later {{versions}} used semiconductor memory. Program stores were arranged to feed two words (52 bits) {{at a time}} to the CPU via the Program Store Bus, while Call Stores only gave one word at a time via the Call Store Bus. 1A Program Stores were writable and not fully duplicated but were backed up by the File Stores. They were provided in multiplicity of N+2, i.e. as many as were needed for the size of the office, plus two hot standby units to be loaded from disk as needed.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Prophet 2000, Sequential {{introduced}} a rack-mounted version of the Prophet 2000 a few months after its initial release. The Prophet 2002 expanded the 2000s memory to 512 <b>kilowords.</b> At the time, this memory capacity was remarkable, although it would soon be matched by other products. The 2002 also added some features to make the unit more responsive and accessible. One year later, Sequential increased the Prophet sampler's bit depth to 16 with the rack-mounted Prophet 3000. However, the 3000 was only manufactured in limited quantities as its release coincided with the gradual collapse of Sequential Circuits. It is estimated that approximately 250 were produced before Yamaha's acquisition of Sequential.|$|R
50|$|The KA10 has {{a maximum}} main memory {{capacity}} (both virtual and physical) of 256 <b>kilowords</b> (equivalent to 1152 kilobytes). As supplied by DEC, {{it did not}} include paging hardware; memory management consisted of two sets of protection and relocation registers, called base and bounds registers. This allows each half of a user's address space {{to be limited to}} a set section of main memory, designated by the base physical address and size. This allows the model of separate read-only shareable code segment (normally the high segment) and read-write data/stack segment (normally the low segment) used by TOPS-10 and later adopted by Unix. Some KA10 machines, first at MIT, and later at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), were modified to add virtual memory and support for demand paging, as well as more physical memory.|$|R
