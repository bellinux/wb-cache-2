5|$|During {{the year}} the North Vietnamese transported or stored 60,000 tons of {{supplies}} with a net loss rate of 2.07 percent. During the same period, 195,000 PAVN replacements moved through the system to the southern battlefields. As <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> PAVN continued to expand the system. By the end of May the North Vietnamese had occupied Muong Phalane, Ban Houei Sai, and Paksong. They also retook Attopeu, Saravane, and Ban Thateng, cementing their hold on the strategic Bolovens Plateau of south central Laos. Commando Hunt VI, launched during the wet season, was hampered by heavy rain {{and the arrival of}} two typhoons which threw off both the PAVN logistical effort and U.S. attempts to interdict it.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{considerable}} losses, {{in early}} 1942 Germany {{and its allies}} stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b> In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.|$|E
5|$|On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma {{produced}} sustained {{winds of}} 155km/h (95mph) and {{a gust of}} 178km/h (111mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7m (12ft), reportedly as high as 6.1m (20ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which moved about 305m (1,000ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800homes. Damage was estimated at $100million (2005USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, {{the majority of the}} island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern end of the island reported little, or no, damage. Over 7,000people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane, many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few seasons Gilbert was not as {{successful}} with the bat; in 1877 he failed to exceed 47 in any innings, he scored about half the number of runs that he had <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> and his average dropped to 15.70. His average remained below 20 {{in four of the}} next five seasons and never passed 23. In six seasons, he scored only six fifties. On the other hand, he took 56 wickets in both 1877 and 1878, averaging under 17 with the ball. He achieved some notable performances as a bowler, including bowling unchanged throughout a game in partnership with W. G. Grace. But from 1879 he bowled less frequently, and never passed 23 wickets in a season again. Even so, Gilbert represented the Gentlemen against the Players twice in 1877, his final appearances in the fixture; in four games, he scored just 43 runs and took 16 wickets.|$|E

5|$|In 1779, the {{congregation}} of Hanley Wesleyan Chapel were {{expelled from the}} chapel for supporting Alexander Kilham. Kilham denounced the Methodist conference for giving too much power to church ministers, at the expensive of the laity; his disagreements led to a schism in the Methodist church and his founding of the Methodist New Connexion. In Hanley, the New Connexion congregation, foremost led by William Smith, Job Meigh and George and John Ridgway, initially met {{in the house of}} one of its prominent members, and then acquired a coach-house at the corner of Albion Street that was converted into a meeting house. During the following year the first chapel was built on the site with seating for 600people. It was formally opened by Wiliam Thom, the first president of the New Connexion, and Alexander Kilham, its secretary. This chapel {{was the head of the}} Hanley Circuit, and by 1812 this Circuit was the strongest in the New Connexion. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> the chapel had been expanded to seat 1,000. It was still too small for the size of {{the congregation}} and was demolished and replaced by the present chapel in 1819.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and transport hub were proposed to alleviate traffic at the airport, since <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year,</b> all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large transport hub in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with {{the municipalities of}} Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans {{for the establishment of}} a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year.</b> During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused by the emergence of El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.|$|E

5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E
