5000|$|Standing Figure: <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> is {{a bronze}} {{sculpture}} by the English artist Henry Moore. It {{was cast in}} two full-size versions: Standing Figure: <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> (LH 482) in 1961, and a larger Large Standing Figure: <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> (LH 482a) in 1976. The sculpture also is sometimes known as Standing Figure (Bone) or Winged Figure.|$|R

50|$|The {{most famous}} {{hike to the}} summit goes along <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge,</b> which {{traverses}} the ridge between Pamola Peak and Baxter Peak. The mountain has claimed 23 lives since 1963, mostly from exposure in bad weather and falls from the <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge.</b> For about 3/10 of a mile the trail is 3 feet wide, with a drop off on either side. The <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> is closed during periods of high wind.|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray collimators {{in nuclear}} waste {{scanners}} {{are used for}} selecting a narrow vertical segment in activity measurements of waste vessels. The system {{that is used by}} NRG uses tapered slit collimators of both the single and double <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> type. The properties of these collimators were investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We found that single <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> collimators are highly preferable for a conservative estimate of the activity of the waste vessels. These collimators show much less dependence on the angle of incidence of the radiation than double <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> collimators. This conclusion also applies to cylindrical collimators of the single <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> type, that are generally used in medical imaging spectroscopy...|$|R
50|$|If {{large parts}} of copper are to be fitted to glass like the water cooled copper anode of a high power radio {{transmitter}} tube or an x-ray tube historically the Houskeeper <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> seal is used. Here {{the end of a}} copper tube is machined to a sharp <b>knife</b> <b>edge,</b> invented by O. Kruh in 1917. In the method described by W.G. Houskeeper the outside or the inside of thecopper tube right to the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> is wetted with glass and connected to the glass tube. In later descriptions the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> is just wetted several millimeters deep with glass, usually deeper on the inside, and then connected to the glass tube.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} carried out to address {{issues related to the}} observed cracking of the titanium <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> on the labyrinth seals of the high pressure fuel pump (HPFP) in the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Thermal shock experiments were carried out using a jet specimen with geometry similar to the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> geometry. These tests demonstrate that cracking of the titanium alloy is possible in a situation involving repeated thermal cycles over a wide temperature range, as might be realized during a rub in the liquid hydrogen fuel pump. High speed rub interaction tests were conducted using a representative <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> and seal geometry over a broad range of interaction rates. Alternative materials were also experimentally evaluated. These tests provide information which can be used to design improved labyrinth seals for the HPFP of the SSME. In particular, plasma-sprayed aluminum-graphite was found to be significantly better than aluminum alloy seals used at present from the standpoint of rub performance. Ion nitriding of the titanium alloy <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> was also found to improve rub performance compared with the untreated baseline <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> material...|$|R

50|$|In a {{traditional}} Floyd Rose (and vintage tremolo), the pivot is a <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> against the pivot post; when sharpened, the pivot provides zero rotational friction.

In the ZR tremolo, the pivot is a ball-bearing based joint, which provides greater stability over time.|$|R

50|$|Larger air horns used {{on ships}} and foghorns {{function}} similarly to a whistle; {{instead of a}} diaphragm the air escapes from a closed cylindrical resonator chamber through a precisely shaped slit directed against a <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> (fipple). The air blowing past the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> oscillates, creating sound waves. The oscillations excite standing waves in the resonator chamber, so {{the length of the}} chamber determines the pitch of the note produced.|$|R

50|$|In the mid 20th century, R.A. Burton {{developed}} an alternative form of schlieren photography {{which is now}} usually called focusing schlieren or lens and grid schlieren, based on a suggestion by Hubert Schardin. Focusing schlieren systems generally retain the characteristic <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> to produce contrast, but instead of using collimated light and a single <b>knife</b> <b>edge,</b> they use an illumination pattern of repeated edges with a focusing imaging system.|$|R

40|$|Measurements {{of system}} optical {{modulation}} functions (MTF, SWR) may be distorted by time-dependent environmental effects (thermal, vibration, flexure) and by electronics drift. Fast data collection may therefore be advantageous by minimizing drift time. The problem of fast data collection is accentuated when modulation data {{must be taken}} on {{a large number of}} detectors in a focal plane array. A method has been developed for the generation and storage of <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> data from focal plane arrays, where data collection time per detector is in the submillisecond range. Once <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> collects are completed, MTF response is found using conventional convolution techniques. SWR is obtained directly from <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> response using a computerized simulation algorithm which bypasses use of MTF harmonics. Requirements for detector electronics speed, damping, and dynamic range are considered...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation to determine the critical compression load for a universal testing machine are presented for specimens loaded through <b>knife</b> <b>edges.</b> The critical load for the testing machine is the load at {{which one of the}} loading heads becomes laterally instable in relation to the other. For very short specimens the critical load was found to be less than the rated capacity given by the manufacturer for the machine. A load-length diagram is proposed for defining the safe limits of the test region for the machine. Although this report is particularly concerned with a universal testing machine of a certain type, the basic theory which led to the derivation of the general equation for the critical load, P (sub cr) = alpha L can be applied to any testing machine operated in compression where the specimen is loaded through <b>knife</b> <b>edges.</b> In this equation, L is the length of the specimen between <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> and alpha is the force necessary to displace {{the upper end of the}} specimen unit horizontal distance relative to the lower end of the specimen in a direction normal to the <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> through which the specimen is loaded...|$|R
