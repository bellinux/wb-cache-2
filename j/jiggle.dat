500|$|A {{large part}} of the surface area of the world's deserts {{consists}} of flat, stone-covered plains dominated by wind erosion. In [...] "eolian deflation", the wind continually removes fine-grained material, which becomes wind-blown sand. This exposes coarser-grained material, mainly pebbles with some larger stones or cobbles, leaving a desert pavement, an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a tessellated mosaic. Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed. It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones <b>jiggle</b> themselves into place; alternatively, stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface. Very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement, and the ground becomes stable. Evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated, binding particles together to form a desert conglomerate. In time, bacteria that live {{on the surface of the}} stones accumulate a film of minerals and clay particles, forming a shiny brown coating known as desert varnish.|$|E
500|$|Rufus has {{received}} mixed to positive reception since his debut. GameDaily named Rufus the strangest {{of the new}} characters introduced in Street Fighter IV, placing him 12th on their [...] "Most Bizarre Fighting Characters" [...] list and noting his high attack speed despite his weight. IGN described Rufus {{as one of the}} most interesting new characters introduced in the title, due to the [...] "juxtaposition between his comical size and impressive speed" [...] and added that his attack set [...] "shows that if you can get past Rufus' comical exterior, a capable fighter hides within." [...] IGN AU stated that while they felt the character was the ugliest in the game, they enjoyed his unpredictability and acrobatics, as well as his attitude. 1UP.com called Rufus a worthy addition to the series, [...] "despite...outward, me-too appearances". Anime News Network described Rufus as well-designed and engaging, despite initial reservations regarding the character. VideoGamer.com praised Rufus as one of the game's better new characters in the title, in heavy contrast to other additions such as Crimson Viper. GameTrailers praised the character and noted he [...] "definitely offered something different", adding [...] "You may not have expected a game's most obvious <b>jiggle</b> physics to apply to a male character." [...] Stars and Stripes noted the level of detail in Rufus's animations and movements, describing his mobility as [...] "weirdly awesome".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire is staring at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts <b>jiggle.</b> This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E

Mira was designed to continue the series tradition of having a [...] "sexy femme fatale" [...] character in each game: she was given an open track jacket and a bikini-like top to show off her cleavage, and a <b>jiggle</b> effect was added to her 3D model. Eric's design and 3D modelling went smoothly, with Chime saying that some faces are easier to model than others. Tomono wanted him to specifically have a Caucasian chin and brow, but noted {{that they had to}} be careful to not go too far with it, to avoid a too realistic look. Diana's design was difficult to recreate in 3D, with the initial model having [...] "really chubby chipmunk cheeks", but was worked on until it matched the design. She was also difficult to animate, due to her long skirt. Phi {{was originally}} shorter and had bigger eyes, but after she was given glasses, it was decided that she should look more like a model to match the stylish look of her short hair and glasses. Parts of Sigma's design from Virtue's Last Reward were incorporated into his new one, in the form of embroidery on his polo shirt.|$|E

In 2012, Zachary Miller of Nintendo World Report ranked Kasumi as the second [...] "top chesty heroine" [...] on Nintendo systems solely for her appearance in Dimensions for the Nintendo 3DS, noting that [...] "Tina and Kasumi are the only ladies with bikini costumes, and they both display the usual DoA <b>jiggle</b> more than the other ladies."
