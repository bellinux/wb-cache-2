25|$|Although a {{strengthened}} public-health {{system has}} accelerated the national tuberculosis control effort, progress in tuberculosis control has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national tuberculosis control program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies {{based on the}} DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same <b>implementation</b> <b>framework.</b> Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one financing plan with clear funding needs and gaps—another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past—when tuberculosis services were not free—and the success in tuberculosis control {{over the past few}} years—when tuberculosis services have been free—have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS—e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs—are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the tuberculosis control program {{is one of the best}} examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.|$|E

40|$|Surrounded by an {{assortment}} of intelligent, adaptive and efficient search entities, the Low-Level Hybridization(LLH) for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are {{proven to be a}} comprehensive tool for solving different kinds of optimization problems due to their contradictive behaviour. In addition, the two algorithms have achieved a remarkable improvement from the adaptation of dynamic parameterization. However, in many cases, implementing the suitable hybrid algorithms for a given optimization problem is a considerably difficult, which in most cases, is time consuming. In addition, research has identified that the existing tools are not adequately designed to enable users to easily develop the LLH algorithms with the dynamic parameterization. In responding to this problem, this research investigates rapid mechanisms for the LLH design and development with easy, flexible and concise programming. The research has proposed new <b>implementation</b> <b>frameworks</b> and new scripting language with the dynamic parameterization. In addition, the research conducts a comprehensive evaluation for the scripting language that covers the easiness, conciseness and flexibility. Based on the implementation reviews from the existing LLHs that combine PSO with GA, the <b>implementation</b> <b>frameworks</b> with a sequential global (SG) scheme, are found to be widely used in practice. The scheme consists of three implementation frameworks: the SG with mutation (SGMutation), the SG with crossover (SGCrossover) and the SG with both crossover and mutation (SGCrossMutation). The scripting language is designed and developed based on the algorithm structure that is defined in the proposed <b>implementation</b> <b>frameworks</b> with the dynamic parameterization. Evaluations of four different sets of applications that used the proposed <b>implementation</b> <b>frameworks</b> with dynamic parameterization have indicated the effectiveness of each tested algorithm in comparison to the single PSO and constant parameterization. In the scripting language evaluation, nine LLHs and three single PSO algorithms have been successfully created using the scripting languages. The codes of the scripting language are shown to easily use, concisely describe the algorithm in a directly publishable form and flexible for new problem creations. This work is the first exposition of scripting language for the LLH of PSO-GA embedded with dynamic parameterization, which paves the way for further research possibilities in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) involves special concerns, such as interaction, adaptation, autonomy, among others. Many {{of these concerns}} are overlapping, crosscut {{each other and the}} agent’s basic functionality. Over the last few years, several methodologies and <b>implementation</b> <b>frameworks</b> have been proposed to support agent-oriented software engineering. Although these approaches have brought some benefits to improve the productivity and quality on the MAS development, they present some restrictions. First, agent-oriented methodologies are too high level and do not indicate how to master the complexity of MAS concerns based on the object-oriented abstractions. Second, <b>implementation</b> <b>frameworks</b> provide object-oriented APIs for MAS development without providing guidelines for the modularization of agent concerns. Moreover, neither of the proposed agent oriented-approaches deals with the modeling and implementation of agent crosscutting concerns. This paper presents a generative approach for the {{development of}} MASs that addresses these restrictions. The proposed approach explores the MAS domain to enable the code generation of heterogeneous agent architectures. Aspect-oriented techniques are used to allow the modeling of crosscutting agent features. The generative approach brings several benefits to the code generation and modeling of agent crosscutting features since early development stages. ...|$|R
