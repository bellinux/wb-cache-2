5|$|By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was {{a leading}} {{international}} music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun {{to appear in the}} relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £100,000 during the war without the permission of the <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, {{to the point that the}} company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.|$|E

For five {{years prior to the}} removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> and five years following their removal, we use impulse responses and variance decompositions from vector autoregressions to illustrate that European equity markets have become substantially more integrated after the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> We undertake further tests that demonstrate that, even if we allow for parallel macroeconomic harmonization, the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> has been a major cause of increased equity market integration within Europe...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact that the {{relaxation}} of UK <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> in October 1979, had on the transmission of equity market volatility from the UK to other major equity markets. It is suggested {{that the existence of}} <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> in the UK was an important source of market segmentation which disturbed the transmission of shocks from one country to another, even when shocks contained global information. It is found that when a spillover GARCH(1, 1) model is estimated for the five years before and after the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> volatility shocks spill over from the UK to other markets much more strongly after the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> This appears to suggest that volatility as well as returns have become more closely related since the UK removed <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> ...|$|R

The Recovery of Public Property (Special Military Tribunals) Decree permitted the government to investigate the assets of public officials linked with corruption and constitute a military tribunal to try such persons. The <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control</b> (Anti-Sabotage) Decree stated penalties for violators of foreign exchange laws.|$|E
25|$|Bredenkamp became {{something}} of a power behind the scenes in the ruling ZANU-PF party. It is claimed that he sought to facilitate the early retirement of President Mugabe in 2004 and his replacement by Emmerson Mnangagwa, former Security Minister and Speaker of Parliament. This displeased rival factions in ZANU-PF, and government investigations were started into the affairs of Bredenkamp's Breco trading company concerning tax evasion and <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> violations. The matters under investigation were transactions between Breco in Zimbabwe and offshore companies controlled by Bredenkamp.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the impact of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> on economic performance of emerging economies and South Africa in particular. Amidst South Africa’s newly established stable political environment and its reintroduction to the global economy, a fierce debate exists on whether some measure of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> are necessary or whether they should be abolished altogether. The debate also extends {{to the nature of}} the economic liberalisation process in the removal of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> either in an instantaneous “big bang” approach or in a gradual manner. The research describes arguments for both the support of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> and their abolition. This includes a description of the path South Africa has adopted and an assessment of the merits of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls.</b> Experience from other emerging economies is investigated and correlated with the South African experience. Results indicated that a gradual approach in the relaxation of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> is recommended and that domestic monetary and fiscal policy and trade reforms first before liberating the capital account. It was found that the intensive use of <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> as a means of capital account restriction appears to hinder good economic performance; instead it is recommended to create and maintain an institutional environment in which the investment process can occur and where policy-makers can stimulate investment activity with a consequential elimination of capital flight.

25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} and reserves were controlled {{in the mid-1980s}} by the State Administration of <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control</b> under the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control.</b> The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all foreign exchange transactions in 1984 when the Agricultural Bank, People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as loan syndication and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and long-term loans from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E
25|$|Through the new Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945, {{the board}} was {{replaced}} by a six-member council, consisting of bank and treasury officials. It additionally formalised the bank's administrative powers of monetary and banking policy and <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> and also stated the governor was responsible for managing the bank. Highly debated legislation in 1945 caused high amounts of regulation on private banks, which later-Governor H.C. Coombs was opposed to, along with his opposition to bank nationalisation in 1947. When he became governor in 1949, he allowed private banks to have more control over their liquidity and attempted to introduce market-based monetary policy. He also warned of the possibility of stagflation in 1959.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1960s, {{monetary}} authorities accepted Coombs' conclusions and allowed a flexible interest rate, {{making it easier}} for the bank to rely on open market operations. The <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control</b> was abolished after the float of the Australian dollar occurred in 1983. In the five years after the Campbell Committee probe, 1979–1984, the financial system in Australia became deregulated. Another probe was the Wallis Committee in 1996, which took effect in 1998. The effects were the transfer of overseeing the banks from the RBA to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the creation of the Payments System Board (PSB), which would attempt to maintain the safety and performance of the payments system. The bank was given powers within the PSB through additional legislation in 1998.|$|E

25|$|British Eagle and {{its sister}} {{companies}} ceased trading at midnight on 6 November 1968 due to growing financial problems {{and went into}} voluntary liquidation two days later. The airline's last-ever aircraft movement was {{the arrival of a}} Bristol Britannia from Rotterdam at Heathrow the following day. The financial crisis leading to the collapse of Britain's second-largest contemporary independent airline had been triggered by the devaluation of sterling and the tightening of the existing <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> regime, which limited the amount of foreign exchange British holidaymakers were allowed to take out of the country {{as well as by the}} loss of the company's Caribbean licence. Poor decisions at senior and executive level, the end of the trooping and migrant contracts and economic difficulties had made British Eagle an increasingly unviable business.|$|E
25|$|In a 2015 study, BDSM {{relationships}} were suggested {{to have a}} higher level of connection, intimacy, trust and communication compared to individuals who do not practice BDSM. The study suggests that dominants and submissives <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need.

It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. Their findings suggest that submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. BDSM was also suggested to improve personal growth, romantic relationships, their sense of community, their sense of self, the dominants confidence, and help an individual cope with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.|$|E
25|$|First, {{citizens}} must {{support the}} Government's policy, thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion {{and the target}} whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences. For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange {{in violation of the}} country's <b>Exchange</b> <b>Control</b> rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance.|$|E

500|$|Early Peronism was {{a period}} of {{macroeconomic}} shocks during which a strategy of import substitution industrialization was put into practice. Bilateral trade, <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> and multiple exchange rates were its most important characteristics. Beginning in 1947, Perón took a leftward shift after breaking up with the [...] "Catholic nationalism" [...] movement, which led to gradual state control of the economy, reflected in the increase in state-owned property, interventionism (including control of rents and prices) and higher levels of public inversion, mainly financed by the inflationary tax. The expansive macroeconomic policy, which aimed at the redistribution of wealth and the increase of spending to finance populist policies, led to inflation.|$|E
