5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech, {{in which}} he {{described}} his goal of accomplishing a manned space <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon {{by the end of}} the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast. With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10, 1963, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for promising space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 19 June, Chief of Staff al-Hariri led a {{high-ranking}} delegation that included Prime Minister al-Bitar, Aflaq and Education Minister Sami Droubi to Algeria {{for a state}} visit. While al-Hariri was away, the Committee used the opportunity to undertake a purge of about 30 elite officers—mostly political independents—under al-Hariri's command. Al-Hariri was ordered to take a direct <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Syrian embassy in the United States, where he was reassigned as the embassy's military attache. Instead, he returned to Syria via a flight to Beirut on 23 June to protest the Committee's move against him. Unsuccessful, he left the country for France in a self-imposed exile on 8 July. The Committee's virtual ousting of al-Hariri was {{to the chagrin of}} al-Bitar, who viewed al-Hariri as the last military counterweight able to check the Committee's domination over his government.|$|E

5|$|Mist is {{responsible}} for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like recording devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1944, VMF-214 {{was among}} 75 U.S. {{aircraft}} raiding near Rabaul {{when they were}} surprised by 300 Japanese aircraft.

Despite hazy weather {{and the need to}} take an indirect route to avoid Japanese radar, Bolt managed to lead the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area where the battle had taken place the day before. Although they did not spot Boyington, they discovered and engaged a flotilla of Japanese barges, destroying six of them.

5|$|The first {{aircraft}} of {{the second}} wave took to the air at 5:25 am. One of 829 Squadron's Barracudas crashed shortly after take-off, resulting {{in the deaths of}} its crew of three, and another aircraft from this squadron was not launched due to engine problems. Only two of the Barracudas in this wave were armed with 1,600-pound bombs. As with the first strike, 40 fighters accompanied the torpedo bombers; these comprised 10 Corsairs from 1834 and 1836 Naval Air Squadrons, all of the 20 Wildcats assigned to 896 and 898 Naval Air Squadrons and 10 Hellcats from 804 Naval Air Squadron. All aircraft were launched by 5:37 am, and the force had an uneventful <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kaafjord area. While the German defences were now alert, the artificial smoke screen being generated around Kaafjord was not yet sufficient to hide Tirpitz from view.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Braathens SAFE {{had sold}} all its DC-4s, and had {{purchased}} eight F-27s. The DC-6s were used exclusively for charter, with all domestic flights being flown with the F-27s. The same year, the booking system was centralized {{and moved to}} offices in Oslo. The company established sales offices in Bodø and Tromsø on 1 March 1967. A new cargo department was opened at Oslo Airport on 29 September. Braathens SAFE applied in {{a joint venture with}} the Norwegian America Line to start a cargo <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States and the Far East, but this was declined by the ministry. From 1967, also DC-6s were used on domestic routes. In August, it was announced that Braathens SAFE would replace the F-27s with six new Fokker F-28, and that the F-27s would be sold to the manufacturer. Later, the number of orders of 737s was reduced to two, and of F-28s to five. The Fellowships cost NOK40 million each.|$|E

5|$|Hart's duties at Sling Camp {{ended in}} July, {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to France to take over command of the 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. He led the brigade through the Hundred Days Offensive, which included an action during the Second Battle of Bapaume that impressed his commanding officer, Russell. During the battle, Hart's headquarters was again shelled with mustard gas. After his previous experience of being gassed, Hart found the shelling 'annoying'. The brigade also participated in the capture of Le Quesnoy in November 1918. This was a difficult assignment {{for the presence of}} civilians in the walled town meant that artillery could not support the attack. Instead a small party was able to scale the walls and put <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans defending that section. This allowed the remainder of the attacking force to enter the town, which quickly surrendered. A few days later, the mayor of Le Quesnoy presented Hart with the French flag that was raised over the town on the day it was captured from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a forward air controller, he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his dive bombing run, he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and even at a distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed {{what appeared to be the}} standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle in what appeared to be a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E
5|$|Of all Brandenburg-Prussian territories, the Electorate of Brandenburg {{was among}} the most devastated {{at the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. Already before the war, the {{population}} density and wealth in the electorate had been low compared to other territories of the empire, and the war had destroyed 60 towns, 48 castles and about 5,000 villages. An average of 50% of the population was dead, in some regions only 10% survived. The rural population, due to deaths and <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> towns, had dropped from 300,000 before the war to 75,000 thereafter. In the important towns of Berlin-Cölln and Frankfurt an der Oder, the population drop was one third and two third, respectively. Some of the territories gained after the war were likewise devastated: in Pomerania, only one third of the population survived, and Magdeburg, once among the wealthiest cities of the empire, was burned down with most of the population slain. Least hit were the Duchy of Prussia, which was only peripherally involved in the war, and Minden.|$|E

5|$|Season five began airing on January 21, 2009, {{and ended}} on May 13, 2009, {{featuring}} seventeen episodes. A clip show recapping {{the first four}} seasons preceded the premiere. Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island, where the remaining survivors begin to erratically jump forward and backward through time, following the island being moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead up to Locke stopping the time jumps and leaving the Island. The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six {{and return to the}} island with Locke's dead body. The second part of the season starts after the time jumps end and the Oceanic Six return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316. The show continues to follow two time lines, both of which take place on the island. The first takes place in 1977 when the survivors who had been left behind are stranded after jumping around in time. It is also where some of the Oceanic Six are transported during the return <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island. The second takes place in late 2007 after Flight 316 is forced to crash land on the island.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore.

However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight and connection options for travellers. Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the main terminal building as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days coming in and out of Penticton.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{accounts of}} Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus. According {{to the first}} account, Thomas first appeared in 803 accompanying general Bardanes Tourkos, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered {{the service of a}} man with the high court rank of patrikios. Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished. Classical and Byzantine scholar J.B. Bury tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's <b>flight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803, while the Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must be discounted entirely. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of George the Monk and the Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of Lesbos. Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival Michael II to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the first account alone. Most modern scholars follow him in this interpretation.|$|E
