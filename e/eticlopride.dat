40|$|The {{influence}} of the DA D- 2 antagonist (-) <b>eticlopride</b> on cocaine- and DA D- 2 agonist-induced behavioral effects was investigated by means of two series of experiments, in rats. In the first 10 -day series, coadministration of (-) <b>eticlopride</b> (10 and 50 mu g/kg, SC) always potently inhibited cocaine (15 mg/kg, IP) -induced hypermotility but did not modify the penile erection (PE) -enhancement produced by the drug at the first injection; it actually counteracted the inhibitory effect of subchronic cocaine on PE. In the second series, (-) <b>eticlopride,</b> at the same doses, antagonized PE elicited by various DA D- 2 agonists at nonstereotyping doses; when, along with PE, stereotyped behavior was induced, only the latter was inhibited by (-) <b>eticlopride,</b> which even increased PE...|$|E
40|$|Nucleus accumbens {{dopamine}} (DA) is {{an important}} regulator of locomotion. The neuromodulator adenosine also has a role in regulating locomotion. The adenosine A 2 A receptor subtype is colocalized with DA D 2 receptors on medium spiny neurons in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Interactions between adenosine A 2 A and DA D 2 receptor antagonists are significant for regulating various aspects of motor and motivational function. The adenosine A 2 A antagonist MSX- 3 {{has been shown to}} reverse the suppression of locomotion induced by the DA D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride.</b> The structure of MSX- 3 was modified to produce the prodrug MSX- 4 which has high oral bioavailability. The present studies sought to elucidate the interactions between <b>eticlopride</b> and MSX- 4 by determining if MSX- 4 could reverse eticlopride-induced locomotion suppression. Moreover, the induction of anxiety was measured by recording the relative amount of activity in the inner portion of the open field arena. Rats were injected with <b>eticlopride,</b> MSX- 4, saline, or both drugs. The animal’s locomotion and anxiety-like behaviors were measured. To provide a neural marker of the interaction between <b>eticlopride</b> and MSX- 4, histological studies measured the expression of c-Fos. <b>Eticlopride</b> significantly suppressed locomotion and increased c-Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens as compared to vehicle animals. MSX- 4 reversed the locomotion suppression induced by <b>eticlopride,</b> and decreased the eticlopride-induced expression of c-Fos in the nucleus accumbens. MSX- 4 produced no significant increase in the anxiety index. MSX- 4 fits the general antiparkinsonian profile of adenosine A 2 A antagonists.

To characterize these events in detail, quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to assess the temporal effects of acute dopamine receptor blockade with <b>eticlopride,</b> a dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist, on the messenger RNA expression of the immediate early genes and neurotransmitters/receptors in the caudate-putamen and ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta of the rat. Groups of rats were injected with a single dose of either isotonic saline or <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) and killed at various time intervals ranging from 5 min to 24 h and frozen brain sections processed by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Using computerized image analysis, the changes in messenger RNA expression for c-fos, c-jun, jun B, jun D, nerve growth factor I-A and nerve growth factor I-B and for neurotensin, glutamate decarboxylase, proenkephalin, the dopamine D 1 receptor and the short and long isoforms of the D 2 receptor were examined in the caudate-putamen. In the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta, the messenger RNA expression of the above early response genes and that for neurotensin, tyrosine hydroxylase, cholecystokinin and the D 2 receptor isoforms were also examined. In the neostriatum, <b>eticlopride</b> caused a rapid increase in c-fos messenger RNA with significantly increased levels at 10 min (P < 0. 01). The levels peaked at 30 min and thereafter declined to control levels. A similar profile was observed for jun B messenger RNA, although levels were still significantly (P < 0. 01) elevated at 1 h and declined to basal levels thereafter.

In this task a trial is initiated after a rat pushes a panel. Rats have to wait (0. 5 - 1. 5 s) until a tone is presented before making a response. The number of premature responses, releasing the panel before tone was switched on, was taken as a measure of motor impulsivity. A group of 10 Lewis rats was tested in the RT task after treatment with different doses of drugs which have been shown previously to affect impulsive responding: DOI (0. 1, 0. 2 mg/kg), 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 1, 0. 3 mg/kg), <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 01, 0. 03 mg/kg) and D-amphetamine (0. 3, 1 mg/kg).

40|$|Rationale. ± 3, 4 -methelynedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is {{the primary}} psychoactive {{ingredient}} of the increasingly popular recreational street drug, ecstasy. As with other drugs of abuse, repeated intermitted exposure to MDMA can {{lead to an increase}} in the subsequent behavioural effects of the drug. This phenomenon, termed behavioural sensitisation, has been attributed to sensitisation of central DAergic mechanisms considered to underlie several aspects of addiction. Objectives. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the role of DA D₂ receptor mechanisms in the development of MDMA sensitisation and the acquisition of MDMA self-administration in rats. Methods. Rats received daily i. p. injections of the selective D₂ antagonist, <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 0, 0. 05, 0. 3 mg/kg), prior to injections of MDMA (0. 0, 10. 0 mg/kg) for five days. Two days following the final pre-treatment session, the locomotor activating effects of MDMA (5 mg/kg, i. p.) were determined. Another group of rats were surgically implanted with i. v. jugular catheters before undergoing the same pre-treatment regimen. Two days following the final pre-treatment session, these rats were subsequently tested for acquisition of MDMA self-administration. The locomotor activating effects of MDMA (5 mg/kg i. p.) were determined two days following the last self-administration session. Results. Pre-treatment with MDMA enhanced the locomotor activating effects of MDMA and facilitated the acquisition of MDMA self-administration, as evidenced by an increased likelihood to meet an acquisition criterion. Co-administration of <b>eticlopride</b> during pre-treatment completely blocked the development of sensitisation to MDMA-produced hyperactivity but failed to significantly attenuate the facilitation of MDMA self-administration. Interestingly, pre-treatment with <b>eticlopride</b> alone also facilitated the acquisition of self-administration. MDMA self-administration failed to alter MDMA-produced locomotor hyperactivity. Conclusions. These findings suggest that repeated activation of DA D₂ receptors is required for the development of sensitisation to MDMA-produced hyperactivity but not for the development of sensitisation to MDMA-produced reinforcement. D₂ receptor mechanisms evidently play some role, however, because repeated exposure to <b>eticlopride</b> also facilitated MDMA self-administration. It is suggested that both sensitised DAergic mechanisms and desensitised 5 -HTergic mechanisms contribute to the acquisition of MDMA self-administration...|$|E

Their dysfunction can lead to serious disorders of movement and motivation, such as Tourette’s syndrome and Parkinson’s disease.

No effects, however, were observed on freezing that emerged during acquisition. Furthermore, these effects were not attributable to state-dependent learning effects or alterations in baseline activity or shock reactivity. In conclusion, these results suggest that amygdaioid dopamine transmission at D 2 receptors contributes to the formation and/or consolidation of fear memories. The extant literature strongly suggests that the amygdala is a critical component of the neural circuitry essential for fear conditioning.

40|$|International audienceEfferent {{feedback}} systems {{provide a}} means for modulating the input to the central nervous system. The lateral olivocochlear efferents modulate auditory nerve activity via synapses with afferent dendrites below sensory inner hair cells. We {{examined the effects of}} dopamine, one of the lateral olivocochlear neurotransmitters, by recording compound and single unit activity from the auditory nerve in adult guinea pigs. Intracochlear application of dopamine reduced the compound action potential (CAP) of the auditory nerve, increased the thresholds and decreased the spontaneous and driven discharge rates of the single unit fibres without changing their frequency-tuning properties. Surprisingly, dopamine antagonists SCH- 23390 and <b>eticlopride</b> decreased CAP amplitude as did dopamine. In some units, both SCH- 23390 and <b>eticlopride</b> increased the basal activity of auditory nerve fibres leading to an improvement of threshold sensitivity and a decrease of the maximum driven discharge rates to sound. In other units, the increase in firing rate was immediately followed by a marked reduction to values below predrug rates. Because CAP reflects the summed activity of auditory nerve fibres discharging in synchrony, both the decrease in sound-driven discharge rate and the postexcitatory reduction account for the reduction in CAP. Ultrastructural examination of the cochleas perfused with <b>eticlopride</b> showed that some of the afferent dendrites were swollen, suggesting that the marked reduction in firing rate may reflect early signs of excitotoxicity. Results suggest that dopamine may exert a tonic inhibition of the auditory nerve activity. Removal of this tonic inhibition results in the development of early signs of excitotoxicity...|$|E

First, we evaluated the combined effects of SCH 23390 —a D 1 receptor antagonist with a D 2 receptor antagonist (<b>eticlopride)</b> on laryngeal neurophysiology, and then tested the separate effects of selective receptor antagonists. Thyroarytenoid (TA) and gastrocnemius (GN) muscle activity was measured at rest and while stimulating the internal branch of superior laryngeal nerve to elicit the laryngeal adductor response (LAR) in alpha-chloralose–anesthetized rats. Paired stimuli at different interstimulus intervals between 250 and 5, 000 ms measured central conditioning of the LAR. Changes in resting muscle activity, response latency, amplitude, and LAR conditioning after each drug were compared with the saline control. SCH 23390 alone increased the resting TA muscle activity (P < 0. 05). With the combined SCH 23390 + <b>eticlopride</b> or SCH 23390 alone, response latency decreased (P < 0. 01), amplitude increased (P < 0. 01), and the test LAR was reduced at 2, 000 -ms ISI (P < 0. 01). No LAR changes occurred when <b>eticlopride</b> was administered alone at a low dose and only a tendency to suppress responses was found at a high dose.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of dopamine (DA) in partner preference (PP) formation in female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). The nonspecific DA antagonist haloperidol blocked mating-induced PP, whereas the nonspecific DA agonist apomorphine induced PP without mating. The D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride,</b> but not the Dl antagonist SCH 23390, blocked PP, whereas the D 2 agonist quinpirole, but not the Dl agonist SKF 38393, induced PP without mating. Injections of <b>eticlopride</b> before or immediately after mating, but not 24 hr after mating, impaired PP, indicating that DA's effects were not due to an interference with mating or sensory recognition. Finally, intracerebroventricular injections of <b>eticlopride</b> diminished PP. Together, {{these data suggest that}} mating-induced PP requires activation of D 2 receptors and that social experience may activate dopaminergic pathways, with enduring effects on behavior. Recent studies have begun to explore the neural mechanisms underlying complex social behaviors such as pair bonding (Young, Wang, & Insel, 1997). Pair bonds are long-term, selective social attachments that are characteristic of social organization in human and other primate societies. Pair bonds can also be studied in monogamous, nonprimate species. Monogamous mammals, by definition, form long-term, selective attachments. Several recent studies have demonstrated that pair bond formation can be operationally defined and rigorously measured in the laboratory. One of the earliest and most important measures of the pair bond is the formation of a partner preference, a simple test of whether the individual chooses to affiliate with a partner more than a stranger (Carter & Getz, 1993).

40|$|Methamphetamine (METH) {{abuse is}} a serious public health issue. Of {{particular}} concern are findings that repeated high-dose administrations of METH cause persistent dopaminergic deficits in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Previous studies have also revealed that METH treatment causes alterations in the dopamine transporter (DAT), including the formation of higher molecular mass DAT-associated complexes. The current study extends these findings by examining mechanisms underlying DAT complex formation. The association among DAT complex formation and other METH-induced phenomena, including alterations in vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT 2) immunoreactivity, astrocytic activation [as assessed by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity], and persistent dopaminergic deficits was also explored. Results revealed that METH-induced DAT complex formation and reductions in VMAT 2 immunoreactivity precede increases in GFAP immunoreactivity. Furthermore, and as reported previously for DAT complexes, pretreatment with the D 2 receptor antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> [S-(−) - 3 -chloro- 5 -ethyl-N-[(1 -ethyl- 2 -pyrrolidinyl) methyl]- 6 -hydroxy- 2 -methoxybenzamide hydrochloride] attenuated the decrease in VMAT 2 immunoreactivity as assessed 24 h after METH treatment. DAT complexes distinct from those present 24 h after METH treatment, decreases in VMAT 2 immunoreactivity, and increased GFAP immunoreactivity were present 48 to 72 h after METH treatment. Pretreatment with <b>eticlopride</b> attenuated each of these phenomena. Finally, DAT complexes were present 7 days after METH treatment, a time point at which VMAT 2 and DAT monomer immunoreactivity were also reduced. <b>Eticlopride</b> pretreatment attenuated each of these phenomena.

In the present study, we have evaluated the role of dopamine receptors on spontaneous locomotor activity and the enhanced locomotor response to dopaminergic agonists after the administration of PTX into the VTA. PTX {{injected into}} the VTA of rats produced a delayed increase in spontaneous locomotor activity with a latency of 4 d. This activity was markedly increased by day 6 and remained elevated for at least 28 d after PTX treatment. This increased spontaneous locomotor activity of PTX-treated animals was antagonized by {{the administration of the}} D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0. 03 and 0. 1 mg/kg sc), but not by the D 2 receptor antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 1 and 0. 3 mg/kg sc). After adaptation to the locomotor cages, the animals showed a markedly enhanced motor response to amphetamine (0. 5 mg/kg ip) and apomorphine (5 mg/kg sc). The heightened locomotor responses to these dopaminergic agonists could be elicited for at least 2 mo after PTX administration. The enhanced response to amphetamine was antagonized by the administration of SCH 23390 (0. 03 and 0. 1 mg/kg sc), but not by <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 1 mg/kg). The increased response to apomorphine in PTX-treated animals was inhibited by SCH 23390 (0. 1 mg/kg sc) and partially inhibited by <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 1 mg/kg sc). Both of these antagonists inhibited the spontaneous and the drug-induced locomotor responses in vehicle-treated control animals.

The present experiments were performed to characterize the effects of MSX- 4, which is an amino acid ester prodrug of the potent and selective adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonist MSX- 2, by assessing its ability to reverse pharmacologically induced motivational and motor impairments. In the first group of studies, MSX- 4 reversed the effects of the D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> on a concurrent lever pressing/chow feeding task that is used as a measure of effort-related choice behavior. MSX- 4 was less potent after intraperitoneal administration than the comparison compound, MSX- 3, though both were equally efficacious. With this task, MSX- 4 was orally active in the same dose range as MSX- 3. MSX- 4 also reversed the locomotor suppression induced by <b>eticlopride</b> in the open field, but did not induce anxiogenic effects as measured by the relative amount of interior activity. Behaviorally active doses of MSX- 4 also attenuated the increase in c-Fos and pDARPP- 32 (Thr 34) expression in nucleus accumbens core that was induced by injections of <b>eticlopride.</b> In addition, MSX- 4 suppressed the oral tremor induced by the anticholinesterase galantamine, which is consistent with an antiparkinsonian profile.

In a {{clinical}} context, however, this phenomenon mediates the relationship between diminished control over gambling and the adverse socioeconomic consequences of gambling problems. Modeling loss-chasing through analogous behaviors in rats could facilitate its pharmacological investigation as a potential therapeutic target. Here, rats were trained to make operant responses that produced both food rewards, and unpredictably, imminent time-out periods in which rewards would be unavailable. At these decision points, rats were offered choices between waiting for these time-out periods to elapse before resuming responding for rewards ('quit' responses), or selecting risky options with a 0. 5 probability of avoiding the time-outs altogether and a 0. 5 probability of time-out periods {{twice as long as}} signaled originally ('chase' responses). Chasing behavior, and the latencies to chase or quit, during sequences of unfavorable outcomes were tested following systemic administration of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, 8 -OH-DPAT, the D 2 receptor antagonist, <b>eticlopride,</b> and the D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390. 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>eticlopride</b> significantly reduced the proportion of chase responses, and the mean number of consecutive chase responses, in a dose-dependent manner. 8 -OH-DPAT also increased latencies to chase. Increasing doses of <b>eticlopride</b> first speeded, then slowed, latencies to quit while SCH 23390 had no significant effects on any measure.

Turning induced by 0. 1 mg/kg of rotigotine was reduced by pretreatment with the D 1 antagonist SCH 39166 and the D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride.</b> In drug-naive rats, rotigotine was less effective in eliciting turning but SCH 39166 still reduced turning induced by rotigotine (0. 35 mg/kg).

Rotigotine induced Fos expression in the caudate-putamen and SCH 39166 completely blocked it. Pramipexole failed to induce Fos. These results indicate that rotigotine acts in vivo as an agonist of D 1 and D 2 receptors while pramipexole is devoid of D 1 activity in vivo. Given their differing DA receptor profiles, rotigotine and pramipexole might differ in their spectrum of application to the therapy of Parkinson's diseas...|$|E
40|$|Nucleus accumbens {{dopamine}} (DA) is {{a critical}} component of the brain circuitry regulating work output in reinforcement-seeking behavior and effort-related choice behavior. Moreover, there is evidence of an interaction between DA D 2 and adenosine A 2 A receptor function. Systemic administration of adenosine A 2 A antagonists reverses the effects of D 2 antagonists on tasks that assess effort related choice. The present experiments were conducted to determine if nucleus accumbens is a brain locus at which adenosine A 2 A and DA D 2 antagonists interact to regulate effort-related choice behavior. A concurrent fixed ratio 5 (FR 5) /chow feeding procedure was used; with this procedure, rats can choose between completing an FR 5 lever-pressing requirement for a preferred food (i. e., high carbohydrate operant pellets) or approaching and consuming a freely available food (i. e., standard rodent chow). Rats trained with this procedure {{spend most of their time}} pressing the lever for the preferred food, and eat very little of the concurrently available chow. Intracranial injections of the selective DA D 2 receptor antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> (1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 μg) into nucleus accumbens core, but not a dorsal control site, suppressed FR 5 lever-pressing and increased consumption of freely available chow. Either systemic or intra-accumbens injections of the adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonist MSX- 3 reversed these effects of <b>eticlopride</b> on effort-related choice. Intra-accumbens injections of <b>eticlopride</b> also increased local expression of c-Fos immunoreactivity, and this effect was attenuated by co-administration of MSX- 3. Adenosine and DA systems interact to regulate instrumental behavior and effort-related processes, and nucleus accumbens is an important locus for this interaction. These findings may have implications for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms such as psychomotor slowing, anergia and fatigue...|$|E
40|$|Graft-induced {{dyskinesia}} (GID) is {{a serious}} complication induced by dopamine (DA) cell transplantation in parkinsonian patients. We have recently shown that DA D 2 receptor blockade produces sticking blockade of dyskinesia induced by amphetamine in grafted 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats, a model of GID. This {{study was designed to}} investigate whether blockade of DA D 1 receptors could produce similar outcome, and to see whether the effect of these treatments in grafted rats was specific for dyskinesia induced by amphetamine, or could also influence L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). L-DOPA-primed rats received transplants of fetal DA neurons into the DA-denervated striatum. Beginning at 20 weeks after transplantation rats were subjected to pharmacological treatments with either L-DOPA (6 mg/kg) or amphetamine (1. 5 mg/kg) alone, or in combination with the D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, the D 2 receptor antagonist <b>eticlopride,</b> and the 5 -HT 1 A agonist/D 2 receptor antagonist buspirone. Grafted rats developed severe GID, while LID was reduced. Both <b>eticlopride</b> and SCH 23390 produced near-complete suppression of GID already at very low doses (0. 015 and 0. 1 mg/kg, respectively). Buspirone induced similar suppression at a dose as low as 0. 3 mg/kg, which is far lower than the dose known to affect LID in non-grafted dyskinetic rats. In agreement with our previous results, the effect of buspirone was independent from 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation, as it was not counteracted by the selective 5 -HT 1 A antagonist WAY 100635, but likely due to D 2 receptor blockade. Most interestingly, the same doses of <b>eticlopride,</b> SCH 23390 and buspirone were found to suppress LID in grafted but not in control dyskinetic rats. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the DA cell grafts strikingly exacerbate the effect of DA D 1 and D 2 receptor blockade against both GID and LID, and suggest that the anti-GID effect of buspirone seen in patients may also be due to blockade of DA D 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Elevated impulsivity {{is often}} {{observed}} {{in patients with}} depression. We recently found that milnacipran, an antidepressant and a serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, could enhance impulse control in rats. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of milnacipran on impulsive action remain unclear. Milnacipran increases not only extracellular serotonin and noradrenaline but also dopamine specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex, {{which is one of}} brain regions responsible for impulsive action. Objectives: Our goal was to identify whether D 1 -like and/or D 2 -like receptors in the infralimbic cortex (IL), the ventral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex, mediates the milnacipran-enhanced impulse control in a three-choice serial reaction time task. Methods: The rats were bilaterally injected with SCH 23390, a selective D 1 -like receptor antagonist (0. 3 or 3 ng/side) or <b>eticlopride,</b> a selective D 2 -like receptor antagonist (0. 3 or 1 μg/side) into the IL after acute intraperitoneal administration of milnacipran (10 mg/kg). Results: Intra-IL SCH 23390 injections reversed the milnacipran-enhanced impulse control, whereas injections of <b>eticlopride</b> into the IL failed to block the effects of milnacipran on impulsive action. Conclusions: This is the first report that demonstrates a critical role for D 1 -like receptors of the IL in milnacipran-enhanced control of impulsive action...|$|E

"lodo-pride " (Ko 0. 88 nM), an iodine substituted benzamide struc-turally related to sulpiride, displayed a maximal stria-tum:cerebellar uptake ratio of 7. 6. Demonstration of satura-tion of the receptor with [12 Sl]iodopride in striatum required uptake in frontal cortex to be used, rather than cerebellar uptake, to define nonspecific binding. Two other ligands struc-turally related to <b>eticlopride,</b> "iclopride " (KD 0. 23 riM) and "itopride " (Ko 0. 16 nM), displayed maximal striatal:cerebellar uptake ratios of 9. 8 and 3. 3, respectively. The most potent ligands, "epidepride " (KD 0. 057 nM) and "ioxipride " (KD 0. 070 nM) showed striatal:cerebellar uptake ratios of 234 and 65, respectively.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cocaine (7. 5, 15 and 30 mg/kg) {{administered}} in acute or subchronic mode, on the mating behaviour of sexually active male rats varied in a dose- and mode-dependent manner. Regardless of mode of treatment, 30 mg/kg markedly impaired the rats´ copulatory ability and impairment continued {{for a week}} after suspension of subchronic treatment. An acute dose of 15 mg/kg reduced intromission frequency, while in subchronic mode it also reduced ejaculation latency. Mount frequency was increased by 7. 5 and 15 mg/kg, but only on first injection. In the case of sexually-naive male rats, acute administration of cocaine (3 - 30 mg/kg) stimulated penile erections at 7. 5 mg/kg and motor hyperactivity at all doses. (-) <b>Eticlopride</b> (0. 025 and 0. 05 mg/kg), a DA D- 2 antagonist, counteracted cocaine-induced motor hyperactivity but not penile erection, which it enhanced. (-) <b>Eticlopride</b> at the same doses also antagonized cocaine potentiation of lisuride (0. 2 mg/kg) -induced behavioural effects. When male rats treated with subchronic cocaine (15 mg/kg) were injected with the DA D- 2 agonist SND 919 (0. 1 mg/kg), they displayed a more marked stretching-yawning behaviour than control animals receiving SND 919 at the same dose.

40|$|A {{recently}} characterized {{class of}} compounds, dopamine partial agonists, {{have been suggested}} as potential therapeutic candidates for pharmacological intervention in psychostimulant addiction. These drugs bind to dopamine receptors with high affinity and low intrinsic activity and are thought to behave as functional antagonists in conditions of high dopaminergic tone, and as agonists in conditions of low receptor occupancy by dopamine. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterize the effects of terguride, a partial dopamine agonist at the D 2 receptor subtype, on intravenous self-administration of amphetamine in a progressive ratio schedule and to compare it with the effects produced by the dopamine D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> and the dopamine D 2 full agonist quinpirole. Terguride at the doses of 0. 2 and 0. 4 mg/kg ip significantly decreased the maximum number of responses delivered for a single injection of amphetamine ("breaking point"), an effect similar to that produced by the antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 01 - 0. 1 mg/kg sc). In contrast, administration of quinpirole (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg sc) did not significantly modify the breaking point for amphetamine responding. Also, terguride dose-dependently increased responding for amphetamine self-administration on a continuous reinforcement schedule. These data further confirm the effects of terguride on psychostimulant self-administration and indicate that under these conditions partial dopamine agonists act as functional dopamine receptor antagonists. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to the psychostimulant amphetamine {{has been shown to}} disrupt goal-directed instrumental actions and promote the early and abnormal development of goal-insensitive habitual responding (Nelson and Killcross, 2006). To investigate the neuropharmacological specificity of this effect as well as restore goal-directed responding in animals with pre-training amphetamine exposure, animals were treated with the non-selective dopamine antagonist α-flupenthixol, the selective D 1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the selective D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride,</b> prior to instrumental training (3 sessions). Subsequently, the reinforcer was paired with LiCL-induced gastric-malaise and animals were given a test of goal-sensitivity both in extinction and reacquisition. The effect of these dopaminergic antagonists on the sensitivity of lever press performance to outcome devaluation was assessed in animals with pre-training {{exposure to}} amphetamine (Experiments 1 a- 1 c) or in non-sensitized animals (Experiment 2). Both α-flupenthixol and SCH 23390 reversed accelerated habit formation following amphetamine sensitization. However, <b>eticlopride</b> appeared to enhance this effect and render instrumental performance compulsive as these animals were unable to inhibit responding both in extinction and reacquisition, even though a consumption test confirmed they had acquired an aversion to the reinforcer. These findings demonstrate that amphetamine induced-disruption of goal-directed behaviour is mediated by activity at distinct dopamine receptor subtypes and may represent a putative model of the neurochemical processes involved in the loss of voluntary control over behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Psychomotor stimulants and typical {{antipsychotic}} {{drugs have}} powerful but opposite effects on mood and behavior, largely through alterations in striatal dopamine signaling. Exactly how these drug actions lead to behavioral {{change is not}} well understood, as previous electrophysiological studies have found highly heterogeneous changes in striatal neuron firing. In this study, we examined whether part of this heterogeneity reflects the mixture of distinct cell types present in the striatum, by distinguishing between medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) and presumed fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), in freely moving rats. The response of MSNs to both the stimulant amphetamine (0. 5 or 2. 5 [*]mg/kg) and the antipsychotic <b>eticlopride</b> (0. 2 or 1. 0 [*]mg/kg) remained highly heterogeneous, with each drug causing both increases and decreases in the firing rate of many MSNs. By contrast, FSIs showed a far more uniform, dose-dependent response to both drugs. All FSIs had decreased firing rate after high <b>eticlopride.</b> After high amphetamine most FSIs increased firing rate, and none decreased. In addition, {{the activity of the}} FSI population was positively correlated with locomotor activity, whereas the MSN population showed no consistent response. Our results show a direct relationship between the psychomotor effects of dopaminergic drugs and the firing rate of a specific striatal cell population.

40|$|To {{examine the}} role of {{dopamine}} receptor subtypes mediating analgesic and motor responses to opioids, rats were pretreated with either saline or a selective D- 1 or D- 2 dopamine receptor antagonist 10 min prior to morphine (12 mg/kg IP). Analgesic response latency was determined using the hot plate test (52. 5 [deg]C and 55 [deg]C), and catalepsy was assessed using the abnormal posture test. Morphine increased analgesic response latency to 44. 5 +/- 7. 9 % of the maximum possible response, but had no cataleptic effect in the abnormal posture test. Pretreatment with either the D- 1 antagonist, SCH 23390 (50 - 100 [mu]g/kg), or the D- 2 antagonist, <b>eticlopride</b> (20 - 150 [mu]g/kg), potently enhanced morphine analgesia as measured on the 52. 5 [deg]C hot plate. Peak analgesic responses to morphine increased to 100 +/- 0 % and 91. 9 +/- 7. 5 % of maximum with the highest doses of SCH 23390 and <b>eticlopride,</b> respectively. These treatments also produced catalepsy. Increasing the hot plate temperature to 55 [deg]C reduced response latency in groups treated with either dopamine receptor antagonist plus morphine. This indicates that the animals were capable of responding at a shorter latency and demonstrates that motor impairment cannot account for potentiation of morphine analgesia by D- 1 and D- 2 antagonists at 52. 5 [deg]C.

40|$|Impulsivity is a {{pathological}} feature of drug addiction. Amphetamine {{is a highly}} addictive drug that is amongst the most harmful recreational drugs abused within the UK (Nutt, King, & Phillips, 2010). Interestingly, however, amphetamine has a paradoxical relationship with impulsivity and can both alleviate and induce impulsive behaviour depending on pre-baseline levels of impulsivity and the dimension of impulsivity that is being measured. The current thesis sought to investigate the relationship between different patterns of amphetamine administration and impulsivity {{in the form of}} behavioural inhibition, and the neural substrates of amphetamine induced behavioural disinhibition, using the symmetrically reinforced Go/No-go task in rats (Harrison, Everitt, & Robbins, 1999). To assess the effects of different patterns of amphetamine administration on behavioural inhibition, separate groups of rats were treated with subchronic (4 -day) and chronic (11 -day) amphetamine and were tested on the Go/No-go task during drug treatment and drug withdrawal. Following two weeks of drug withdrawal, sensitivity to the acute effects of amphetamine in rats was tested with acute drug challenges. To assess the role of nucleus accumbens core D 2 and GABAA receptors in the mediation of behavioural inhibition and amphetamine-induced behavioural disinhibition, separate groups of rats were also treated with intra-nucleus accumbens core infusions of the D 2 antagonist <b>eticlopride</b> and GABAA agonist muscimol. Results revealed that short duration and high frequency binge-like amphetamine administration produced longer term increases in behavioural disinhibition than longer term and less frequent but overall higher dosing of amphetamine in rats. However, neither the binge-like (4 -day) or longer term amphetamine regimes (11 -day) caused any enduring changes in sensitivity to the acute disinhibitory effects of amphetamine in rats. Infusions of either <b>eticlopride</b> or muscimol into the NAcb core had no effect on behavioural inhibition assessed under baseline conditions, however, <b>eticlopride</b> infusions produced full behavioural reversal of amphetamine induced behavioural disinhibition and muscimol infusions produced partial reversal of amphetamine induced behavioural disinhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that different patterns of amphetamine administration produce different effects on the duration of behavioural disinhibition in rats, and further, that amphetamine induced activation of the D 2 receptors within the nucleus accumbens core mediates amphetamine induced behavioural disinhibition on the symmetrically reinforced Go/No-go task. Results additionally support the possibility of dopamine-GABA interactions in the mediation of amphetamine induced behavioural disinhibition on the symmetrically reinforced Go/No-go task in rats...|$|E

Since dopamine D 2 -like receptors are known to modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons, I examined the effects of dopamine D 2 -like receptor antagonists on the light responses of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the P 23 H rat model of retinitis pig-mentosa. Extracellular electrical recordings were made from RGCs in isolated transgenic P 23 H rat retinas and wild-type Sprague-Dawley rat retinas. Intensity-response curves to flashes of light were evaluated prior to and during bath application of a dopamine D 2 -like receptor antagonist. The dopamine D 2 /D 3 receptor antagonists sulpiride and <b>eticlopride</b> and the D 4 receptor antagonist L- 745, 870 increased light sensitivity of P 23 H rat RGCs but decreased light sensitivity in Sprague-Dawley rat RGCs. In addition, L- 745, 870, but not sul-piride or <b>eticlopride,</b> reduced the maximum peak responses of Sprague-Dawley rat RGCs. I describe for the first time ON-center RGCs in P 23 H rats that exhibit an abnormally long-latency (> 200 ms) response to the onset of a small spot of light. Both sulpiride and eticlo-pride, but not L- 745, 870, reduced this ON response and brought out a short-latency OFF response, suggesting that these cells are in actuality OFF-center cells. Overall, the results show that the altered dopaminergic system in degenerate retinas contributes to the deterio-rated light responses of RGCs...|$|E

The present study extends these findings by demonstrating the regional selectivity of DAT complex formation and monomer loss because these changes in DAT immunoreactivity were not observed in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, DAT complex formation was not a consequence limited to METH treatment because it was also caused by intrastriatal administration of 6 -hydroxydopamine. Pretreatment with the D 2 receptor antagonist, <b>eticlopride</b> [S-(-) - 3 -chloro- 5 -ethyl-N-[(1 -ethyl- 2 -pyrrolidinyl) methyl]- 6 -hydroxy- 2 -methoxybenzamide hydrochloride], but not the D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 [R(+) - 7 -chloro- 8 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 1 -phenyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro- 1 H- 3 -benzazepine hydrochloride], attenuated METH-induced DAT complex formation. <b>Eticlopride</b> pretreatment also attenuated METH-induced DAT monomer loss and decreases in DAT function; however, the attenuation was much less pronounced than the effect on DAT complex formation. Finally, results also revealed a negative correlation between METH-induced DAT complex formation and DAT activity. Taken together, these data further elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the functional consequences of repeated administrations of METH on the DAT protein. Furthermore, these data suggest a multifaceted role for D 2 receptors in mediating METH-induced alterations of the DAT and its function...|$|E
