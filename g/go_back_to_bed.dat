After hearing from Wright {{that he would not}} call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago.

In the epilogue of the story, Marci implores Monk to promise her that he will never change the theme music if he ever gets his own show. When Monk agrees to the promise (only so he can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed),</b> the original music is heard as the scene fades to credits, and it plays through the credits.|$|E

6000|$|... "And I," [...] she said, with an {{approving}} nod, [...] "shall <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> again. These {{days are}} too strenuous for me. Won't you stay {{and take your}} coffee with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{flattering}} {{observations were}} {{by no means}} displeasing to the princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings she merely said, [...] "You are all a set of chatterboxes; <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and let me sleep." ...|$|E

60|$|Jimmy {{looked at}} Ann. They were alone. Mr. Pett had <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> Mrs. Crocker <b>to</b> her hotel. Mr. Crocker was {{removing}} his make-up in his room. A silence had followed their departure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} have done it,' {{answered}} Amy, in a quiet tone of sincere congratulation. 'You will be better now it is off your mind. But how tired you are. You must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Shall I call Arnaud?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] murmured {{the young}} lady, [...] "so long for now; and do <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> It's only about five." [...] And waving {{the tips of}} those fingers, she ran lightly up the garden-path and {{disappeared}} into her house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll {{know what}} {{to be thankful for}} one of these days, my poor lad,' said his mother, sighing; then yawning, she said, 'I must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Mind you call out, Alfred, if you hear {{anything}} like a noise in the farm- yard.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{disappeared}} into the bathroom, and Jacob, reassured but a little bewildered, <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>To</b> all appearance, Felixstowe was perfectly sober. Nevertheless, when breakfast was served the next morning, Jacob found himself alone.|$|R

60|$|THE CONDUCTOR (silently taking THE CALIFORNIAN'S {{measure with}} his eye, {{as he stands}} six fret in his stockings). If I did, I'd get the biggest {{brakeman}} I could find {{to do it for}} me. I've got nothing to say except that I think you'd better all <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{what should}} I do? To {{try to reach}} Leo was useless, for she had locked {{the door with the}} key she held. <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed?</b> No, I would follow her, and if we met would make the same excuse. Thus I might get some tidings, or perhaps--a dagger thrust.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, Hicks," [...] said Staniford, {{choosing}} {{to make friends}} with the mammon of unrighteousness, if any good end might be gained by it. [...] "You know you're drunk, and you're not fit to be about. <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> that's a good fellow; and come out again, when you're all right. You don't want to do anything you'll be sorry for." ...|$|E

60|$|Carrie {{seemed to}} rouse herself, {{and with some}} {{difficulty}} led her protesting husband away.

Grier sat down with a little smile, and Carrie looked at him warningly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{he went on}} to {{say that}} he would like to leave, that no wages were good enough to be shot at, and plainly hinted that he thought your father ought to be locked up.

60|$|Carl, it appeared, had a sore throat, {{induced by}} getting wet in the Rainbow Valley marsh the {{previous}} evening while pursuing dragon-flies.

Thinking it might be a family argument, and being sleepy, he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and slumbered uneasily. He {{seemed to}} be awake in his room, in broad light, and to hear a slow drip, drip, on the floor.

60|$|Peter Lamb was {{a little}} man and no good as a fighter, but {{the things he said}} to Joe Barlcomb as he leaned out o' the winder and shook 'is fist at him was 'arder to bear than blows.
