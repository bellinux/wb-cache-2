Mark Edward Nero of About.com said Round 2 is a well-sung, well-written, well-produced album, but the one negative is that its a little bland and leans too much on love songs. Slavik Nathan of DJBooth.net stated Round 2 finds <b>Holiday</b> <b>shifting</b> away from Lac’s harder-edged image in favor of a smoother sound, resulting in a well-crafted album that shows that while Holiday’s got a ways to go before he reaches elite status, no one {{will ever be able to}} call him a one-hit wonder again.|$|R
50|$|With {{physicians}} and nurses leaving en masse for greater financial promise abroad, {{the ratio of}} nurses to patients in the Philippines has worsened from 1 nurse per 15-20 patients in 1990 to 1 nurse per 40-60 patients in 2007. Additionally, the increase in private institution recruitment has evaded government oversight, and arguably has led to lower standards and working conditions for nurses actually working abroad. Once abroad, Filipino nurses have identified discriminatory workplace practices, receiving more night and <b>holiday</b> <b>shifts,</b> {{as well as more}} mundane tasks than non-Filipino counterparts. Nurses also discuss the lack of opportunity to train and learn new skills, an enticement that is advertised by the Filipino export labour migration system. Homesickness and lack of community integration can also cause great emotional duress on migrants, and with the majority of migrants female, family separation can cause negative impacts on both the migrants and their families.|$|R

40|$|There are {{currently}} over two million Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan, 370, 000 of whom reside in refugee camps. Due to conflict-affiliated disease outbreaks among {{children in the}} region, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has identified incomplete vaccination as a critical public health issue and has invested {{in the development and}} implementation of a text message reminder service for preventing loss-to-follow-up. Childhood immunization rates in UNRWA catchment regions are generally high, yet little is known about risk factors for missed appointments, which impose a substantial administrative burden due to the need to contact patients for rescheduling. Stronger user characterization is necessary for improved targeting and minimized cost as we develop a more robust SMS system capable of scaling across all health facilities. This mixed-methods study prospectively recorded 6 months of immunization history among a cohort of children born in June 2014 at Taybeh Health Center in Amman. Demographic information was collected at the time of birth, and caregivers of cohort members were invited to participate in interviews that assessed immunization knowledge, preferences, decision-making, and experience with the SMS reminder system. Patients were more likely to significantly delay appointments during the Ramadan holiday and for doses further from the child date of birth. Future policies that might bridge these gaps include targeting pre-appointment SMS reminders to high-risk patients, implementing <b>holiday</b> <b>shifts</b> in clinic hours, and regularly updating patient contact information.

40|$|While {{there has}} been much {{research}} on the study of global virtual teams and global software teams, {{there has been}} practically no research on the nuances of time separation. We present three converging perspectives on this topic: (a) a view from practices and tactics of global teams; (b) a theoretical view from coordination theories; and (c) a view from our prior research in which we modeled coordination costs for time-separated dyads. Practice suggests that time separation arises not only from time-zone differences but also from factors such as nonoverlapping weekend days and <b>holidays,</b> <b>shifts,</b> and different working schedules. It also suggests that teams employ various coping tactics when faced with time separation – synchronous, asynchronous, and education. Theory suggests that communication is necessary to coordinate and that effectiveness of communication is hampered, both in quality and timeliness, when teams are separated by time. Our model, based on coordination theory, suggests that coordination costs contain four main components – communication, clarification, delay, and rework – and that the various aspects of time-separated work have different effects on each of these components. Our convergent view from these three perspectives shows that distance separation is symmetric – i. e. distance (A,B) = distance (B,A) – while time separation is asymmetric, which affects the planning of team interactions; that the timing of activities matters in time-separated contexts but not in contexts with only distance separation; and that vulnerability costs (i. e. resolving misunderstandings and rework) increase with time separation.

50|$|Public {{holidays}} in the United States {{are largely}} controlled by private sector employers, who employ approximately 62% {{of the total}} U.S. population who are given paid time off. A typical work week is generally 40 hours a week with a Saturday-Sunday weekend. Public holidays with paid time off is generally defined to occur on a day that is within the employee's work week. When a holiday occurs on Saturday or Sunday, that <b>holiday</b> is <b>shifted</b> to either Friday or Monday. Most employers follow a holiday schedule similar to the federal holidays of the United States, with exceptions or additions. The federal holiday schedule mainly benefits employees of government and government regulated businesses. However, this sector only comprises 15% of the working population. At {{the discretion of the}} employer, other non-federal holidays such as Christmas Eve and the Day after Thanksgiving are common additions to the list of paid holidays while Columbus Day and Veterans Day are common omissions. Besides paid holidays are festival and food holidays that also have wide acceptance based on sales of goods and services that are typically associated with that holiday. Halloween and Valentine's Day are such examples of widely celebrated uncompensated holidays.|$|R

The {{aim of the research}} is to provide evidence of the effect national holiday on the daily manufacture stock return in Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSE). First is to examine the effect of national holiday to stock return on trading days before and after national holiday. Second is to examine the effect of national holiday on stock return on trading days before and after <b>holiday,</b> which are <b>shifted</b> to weekend. Third, to examine which national holidays have effects on stock returns before and after the holiday. This research is using Composite Stock Price Index of manufacture in JSE from 1996 to 2003 as the sample. Dependent variable used is manufacture stock return and independent variable are stock trading day from Monday until Friday. National holiday in this research is the holiday determined by the government except Saturday and Sunday holidays. Hypotheses are tested using ARIMA. The result of this research proved that there is no effect of stock return on trading day before the national holiday. But, there is a negative effect of return stock on trading day after the national holiday.

40|$|Background: The Trauma Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital is a mature, tertiary, {{high-volume}} trauma referral centre. The {{number of}} patients being treated in the unit {{at any given time}} can vary greatly. There is evidence to suggest that these fluctuations may be related to external and environmental factors, such as time of the day, week and month, local weather and significant home-team sport matches. Objective: The objective of this audit was to determine the relationship between volumes of patients in the unit, and environmental factors. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether the numbers of patients presenting after motor vehicle collisions and interpersonal violence was related in any way to temporal factors (time of day, week and month), weather variables (temperature and precipitation), and whether or not major or home-team soccer matches were being played. Methods: Trauma Unit admission records were examined retrospectively, and the numbers of patients presenting to the unit per shift for a total of 17 months was recorded. Patients were grouped according to their presenting complaints. Weather data, Premier Soccer League and Bafana Bafana match locations and results, and information regarding public holidays and long weekends were obtained for the relevant shifts. Average daily attendances for interpersonal violence (IPV) -related injuries and motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) were compared across the various external factors described. Poisson regression models were fitted using Stata 13 (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). and used to express the relative incidence of attendances. These results were expressed using incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Results: In total, 16 706 attendances were recorded over 1 074 shifts. Of these, 7 350 (44 %) attendances were due to injuries sustained as a result of interpersonal violence (IPV), and 3 188 (19 %) were due to MVCs. Predictors of increased attendances due to MVC-related injuries were week day shifts, and night shifts on long weekends, and on weekends that fell {{on the last day of}} the month. Weekend nights shifts were busier than week night shifts from this perspective. Public <b>holiday</b> <b>shifts</b> were shown to have less MVC-related attendances than an ordinary week day. The presence of precipitation was also shown to increase the number of MVC-related attendances. IPV-related attendances were always increased on night shifts compared to day shifts, except on public holidays, long weekends, and on weekends that fell on the last day of the month. All weekend shifts were busier than their corresponding week day shifts from an IPV-related perspective, and this effect was enhanced on weekends that fell on the last day of the month. Long weekends showed very similar trends to ordinary weekends, and public holidays showed similar trends to ordinary week days. Increasing temperatures are associated with increased attendances due to IPV. Soccer matches and their outcomes have no significant effect on attendances due to IPV. Conclusions: Temporal and weather factors can be used to predict which trauma unit shifts will be busiest...|$|R

Generalised patterns of workforce allocation are used {{to build up a}} schedule that is then adjusted to remove any problems. Because some constraint elements are incorporated in the case-base, the global problem search space is reduced. The case-base can be maintained either automatically, by generalisation of solutions or by theoretical analysis of case efficiency, or manually, by storage of generalised patterns of allocation preference. In line with the background cognitive theory behind case-based reasoning, the methods of arrival at solutions are very similar to the methods used by manual schedulers. 1.
