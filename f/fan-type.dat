Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output.

50|$|The {{next step}} in the snowmaking process is to add air using an air plant. This plant is often a {{building}} which contains electric or diesel industrial air compressors the size of a van or truck. However, in some instances air compression is provided using diesel-powered, portable trailer-mounted compressors which can be added to the system. Many <b>fan-type</b> snow guns have on-board electric air compressors, which allows for cheaper, and more compact operation. A ski area may have the required high-output water pumps, but not an air pump. Onboard compressors are cheaper and easier than having a dedicated pumping house. The air is generally cooled and excess moisture is removed before it is sent out of the plant. Some systems even cool the water before it enters the system. This improves the snowmaking process as the less heat in the air and water, the less heat must be dissipated to the atmosphere to freeze the water. From this plant the air travels up a separate pipeline following the same path as the water pipeline.|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{skeletal}} and dental effects of <b>fan-type</b> rapid maxillary expansion (RME) appliance and Hyrax RME appliance on the craniofacial structures. Materials and Methods: The sample of the study included 12 patients with constricted maxillary arches. Acrylic bonded type of attachment was used for both groups. Changes in sagittal, vertical, and transverse relationship were assessed with lateral and frontal cephalograms, respectively. Intercanine and intermolar widths were measured with stone models. Pre- and immediate post-treatment records were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The differences between the groups were evaluated using Mann–Whitney U-test. Since the data pertaining to intercanine width and intermolar width were normally distributed, parametric test of signifi cance (unpaired t-test) was used to compare them. Results: Results showed that Hyrax presented with signifi cantly greater increments for both nasal cavity width and maxillary width when compared to <b>fan-type</b> RME. Both groups had retroclination of incisors. The increase in the intercanine width was almost similar in both groups. Conclusion: <b>Fan-type</b> RME caused only minimal expansion of the intermolar width when compared to the Hyrax. The ratio between the intercanine and intermolar width expansion was nearly 4 : 1 in the <b>fan-type</b> RME and 0. 75 : 1 in Hyrax...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new design method {{for a class}} of 2 D IIR <b>fan-type</b> filters based on {{spectral}} transformations is proposed. The design starts from an analog prototype filter with specified parameters and whose transfer function is factorized into biquads. Applying an appropriate frequency transformation to the 1 D transfer function, the desired 2 D filter is directly obtained in a factorized form as well. The approach is mainly analytical but also uses numerical approximations and is simple, efficient and versatile. These <b>fan-type</b> filters can also be regarded as components of directional filter banks. Using the determined frequency transformation, two-directional selective filters are obtained as well. Design examples are provided and simulation results are shown, for an application in medical image processing, namely the detection of blood vessels with a specified orientation from angiography images. For two-directional filters, an example is given of extracting lines with two different orientations from a test image.

The fan structure appears slightly below the phase boundary of the continuous transition of instability-type. In this region, there are no solutions containing any types of isolated solitons to the mean field equations. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
