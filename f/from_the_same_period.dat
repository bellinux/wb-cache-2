5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Quiriguá was occupied {{as early as the}} Late Preclassic (400BC AD200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic artifacts have been recovered, including 63figurines and a chert blade. Early Classic ceramics from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, while jade hunchback figurines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands.

5|$|A fossil {{discovered}} in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be C.dirus; if so, this fossil {{is one of the}} earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as Canis cf. C.dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 yearsYBP and the Canis cf. dirus specimen was assumed to be <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period.</b> C.armbrusteri and C.dirus share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that imply the latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests C.dirus originated around 250,000YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor C.armbrusteri. The first appearance of C.dirus would therefore be 250,000YBP in California and Nebraska, and later {{in the rest of the}} United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the changes in the tax rules that went into force at the {{beginning}} of 2016, plug-in electric car sales declined significantly.

5|$|Fossil {{records of}} Myxogastria are {{extremely}} rare. Due to their short lifespan and the fragile {{structures of the}} plasmodia and the fruit body, fossilisation and similar processes are not possible. Only their spores can be mineralised. The few known examples of fossilised living states are preserved in amber. Up to 2010, three fruit bodies, two spores and one plasmodium have been described. Two older taxaCharles Eugène Bertrand's Myxomycetes mangini and Bretonia hardingheni from 1892are now considered dubious and are today often disregarded. Friedrich Walter Domke described in 1952 a 35 to 40million year old find in Baltic amber of Stemonitis splendens, an extant species. The state and completeness of the fruit bodies are remarkable, enabling accurate determination. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period,</b> location and material is an Arcyria sulcata, first described in 2003 by Heinrich Dörfelt and Alexander Schmidt, a species very similar to today's Arcyria denudata.

5|$|Fossils of Protragoceros labidotus and Sivoreas eremita {{dating back}} to the late Miocene have been {{discovered}} in the Ngorora formation (Kenya). fossils <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> have also been excavated in the eastern Mediterranean region. Other Miocene fossils of boselaphines discovered are of Miotragocerus, Tragocerus and Tragoportax. Fossils of Miotragoceros are not apparent in Africa (only M. cyrenaicus has been reported from the continent), but have significant presence in the Shiwalik Hills in India and Pakistan, as do several Tragoportax species. A 2005 study suggested the migration of Miotragoceros to eastern Asia around 8 Mya. Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum reported the presence of another boselaphine, Mesembriportax, from Langebaanweg (South Africa).|$|E

5|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, Paris has been {{famous for its}} {{restaurants}} and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period.</b> The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Epoque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.|$|E
5|$|When consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, {{the cathedral}} still was not complete. It was {{dedicated}} to Saint Lawrence, highly cherished in all of Sweden at that time; Saint Eric, {{the patron saint of}} Sweden (though never canonised by the Roman Catholic Church); and Saint Olaf, the patron saint of Norway. It was completed over the following decades. Although there are no documentary records of the consecration, there are several references <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> to the cathedral's chapels, including their altars which were dedicated to the Holy Cross, to the Virgin Mary or to other saints. The last main component of the cathedral, the towers, were built between 1470 and 1489. The cathedral was damaged by fire on several occasions, especially during the great fire of 1702 which destroyed much of the city. Restoration work was not completed until the middle of the century.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{car sales}} in March 2016 {{achieved}} the best monthly plug-in sales volume on record ever, with 7,144 grant eligible cars registered.

During the first three quarters of 2016 a total of 29,185 plug-in electric vehicles were registered, of which, 28,035 cars were eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant. Registrations consisted of 8,107 all-electric cars, up 16.6% year-on-year, and 21,078 plug-in hybrids, up 46.3% year-on-year. During this period, sales of plug-in hybrids oversold pure electric cars, with the latter more than doubling sales of battery electric models. During the first nine months of 2016 the plug-in car segment's market share reached 1.36% of new car sales.

5|$|Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought {{guinea pigs}} to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among {{the upper classes}} and royalty, {{including}} Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in {{a description of the}} animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers. However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal must have been introduced by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC, and it was present in the Ostionoid period, for example, on Puerto Rico, long before the advent of the Spaniards. The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus' specific conferral (1758). The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting (artist unknown) {{in the collection of the}} National Portrait Gallery in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell guinea pig in her hands; she is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird. The picture dates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England, which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall, an Elizabethan manor house in Essex, and dated to around 1575.|$|E
5|$|The Opel/Vauxhall Ampera was Europe's top selling plug-in {{electric}} car in 2012 with 5,268 units and captured a 21.5% {{market share of}} the region's plug-in electric passenger car segment. , the Ampera held a market share of almost 10% of European registration of plug-in {{electric car}}s since 2011. The market share in the Netherlands was 40% and 10% in Germany. Ampera sales fell 40% in 2013 to 3,184 cars, and within the plug-in hybrid segment, the Ampera was surpassed in 2013 by the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (8,197), Volvo V60 plug-in (7,437), and the Prius plug-in (4,314). In 2013 the Ampera ranked eighth among Europe's top selling plug-in electric vehicles, and its market share fell to about 5%. During {{the first five months}} of 2014, only 332 units had been sold, down 67% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> in 2013. In July 2014, Opel announced that due to the slowdown in sales, the Ampera will be discontinued after the launch of second generation Volt, and between 2014 and 2018, Opel plans to introduce in Europe a successor product in the electric vehicle segment.

After the departure of the Romans it is generally presumed that Christianity would have survived among the Bythonic enclaves such as Strathclyde, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced, with their gods Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated for the spring festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife. However, despite growing evidence of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at Dalmeny in East Lothian.|$|E
