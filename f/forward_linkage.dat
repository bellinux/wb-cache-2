50|$|Hirschman {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} backward and forward linkages. A <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> is created when investment in a particular project encourages investment in subsequent stages of production. A backward linkage is created when a project encourages investment in facilities that enable the project to succeed. Normally, projects create both forward and backward linkages. Investment should be made in those projects that have the greatest total number of linkages. Projects with many linkages will vary from country to country; knowledge about project linkages can be obtained through input and output studies.|$|E

30|$|These tables clearly {{suggest that}} many pairs of sectors are {{statistically}} different in innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> In particular, innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> of the chemical, primary metal, instrument, rubber, and transportation sectors are {{significantly different from}} those of many other sectors. These sectors also exert strong innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> in Table  3. Thus, sectors with significant innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> tend to be differentiated from many other sectors in the pairwise difference of innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b>|$|R

These goods and services, if supplied by the local community, represent <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> of FDI in tourism. We investigate the multinational’s incentives to promote, reduce or eliminate these <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> and the effectiveness of some policy instruments available to a local government to leverage on the presence of FDI and to stimulate domestic entrepreneurship...|$|R
30|$|The {{remaining}} significant sectors are {{rubber and}} transportation, with both sectors having innovation backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> Particularly, the rubber sector has {{positive effects on}} both linkages, indicating that this sector {{is a key to}} innovation in our dataset. The transportation sector exerts positive innovation backward linkages, but its effects on innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> are negative. Because transportation requires a variety of technology components, the positive backward linkages are reasonable. However, its negative innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> imply that an improvement in transportation services exerts substitution effects on other sectors, {{at least in the short}} run. Therefore, facilitating innovation in this sector might cause a short-run productivity slowdown.|$|R
30|$|Conversely, the {{innovation}} <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> measures {{the effect of}} the productivity growth in the jth technology component on all sectors. In other words, {{the innovation}} <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> indicates the benefits provided by the jth technology component to all sectors. By definition, a sector with high innovation forward linkages does not necessarily enjoy higher productivity growth, although this sector contributes to productivity growth in other sectors.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the key productive sectors for the Namibian economy. The principal concern with a key sector analysis is the identification of economic activities that exhibit the largest amount of interdependence with the rest of the economy. Such interdependence is usually measured through either backward or <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> Backward linkages pertain to the dependence of a given economic activity on inputs produced from other activities, whilst <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> relate to a given economic sector’s role in supplying inputs to other sectors.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{accounts}} for the determinants of inward foreign direct investment in business services across the EU- 27 regions. Together with the traditional variables considered in the literature (market size, market quality, agglomeration economies, labour cost, technology, human capital), {{we focus on the}} role of <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> with manufacturing sectors and other service sectors as attractors of business services FDI at the regional level. This hypothesis is based on the evidence that the growth of business services is mostly due to increasing intermediate demand by other services industries and by manufacturing industries and on the importance of geographical proximity for <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> in services. To our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the role of <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> for the location of FDI. This paper aims therefore to fill this gap and add to the FDI literature by providing a picture of the specificities of the determinants of FDI in business services at the regional level. The empirical analysis draws upon the database fDi Markets, from which we selected projects having as a destination NUTS 2 European regions in the sectors of Business services over the period 2003 - 2008. Data on FDI have been matched with data drawn from the Eurostat Regio database. <b>Forward</b> <b>linkages</b> have been constructed using the OECD Input/Output database. By estimating a negative binomial model, we find that regions specialised in those (manufacturing) sectors that are high potential users of business services attract more FDI than other regions. This confirms the role of geographical proximity for <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> in services and shows the role played by the existing structure of domestic production for the localisation of business service FDI, particularly in the case of manufacturing...|$|R

30|$|The {{backward}} and <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> analysis was constructed {{to figure out}} the key sector in the economy. Industries have effects on the whole economy through their demand and supply relations with other industries. This demand and supply dependencies are called the {{backward and}} <b>forward</b> <b>linkage,</b> respectively. Generally, the backward linkage is derived from the Leontief model (Jones 1976; Cella 1984; Miller and Blair 2009). Leontief inverse matrix B shows the direct and indirect requirements of domestic output per unit of final demand in each sector, and it is also referred as the output multiplier. Output multiplier defines the total backward linkage as b_j^t = ∑_i = 1 ^nb_i,j. The superscript t refers to as the “total linkage” of each industry.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{note that}} the {{communication}} sector has no significant innovation backward or <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> However, in our alternative empirical analysis that used simple TFP growth data as explanatory variables, the communication sector generated positive innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> This result {{is consistent with the}} fact that the IT revolution contributed to positive economic growth (see, for example, Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996). The difference arises because the four sectors (i.e., petroleum, leather, transportation equipment, and transportation) do not invest in communication technology in our dataset. Therefore, Table  3 (a) does not take into account the effects of these sectors in the regression analysis. Non-adjusted data might be more realistic in evaluating innovation linkages in the sectors, because most of the sectors receive some spillover effects from communication technology, even although some of the sectors do not make R&D investments in communication technology. It is important to note this when interpreting the innovation linkage results. Although we cannot discuss this in detail because of space limitation, we show the alternative regression analysis results for innovation backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> in Table  3  (b).|$|R

30|$|The two indices: {{backward}} and <b>forward</b> <b>linkage,</b> {{are often used}} to screen key sectors based on the Leontief inverse (Rasmussen 1956; Hirschman 1958; Lenzen 2003; Humavindu and Stage 2013; Alatriste-Contreras 2015; Haque and Jahan 2016; Nagashima et al. 2017). Backward linkage represents the power of dispersion of a sector, i.e., {{the degree to which}} production is induced in the sector’s upstream supply chains per unit demand of the sector. It is quantified by dividing the column sums of the Leontief inverse by their average. <b>Forward</b> <b>linkage</b> indicates the sensitivity of dispersion of a sector, i.e., the degree to which unit production in the sector induces production in all the sectors in the downstream supply chain. It is measured by dividing the row sums of the Leontief inverse by their average. Sectors with {{backward and}} forward linkages greater than unity are recognized as key sectors. These two linkages can also be derived from the Ghosh model inverse matrices (Beyers 1976; Jones 1976; Dietzenbacher 1997).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{potential}} of the manufacturing and services sectors as drivers of economic growth in Namibia. The paper uses the intersectoral linkage analysis method to identify the industries with the greatest backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> The economy-wide impact of these industries is simulated further using a CGE model. The greatest backward linkages for manufacturing industries were found in meat processing, fish processing, grain milling, basic metals and construction. The greatest backward linkages for the tertiary industries were found in trade and repairs, hotels and restaurants, finance and insurance, and other private services. The greatest <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> for manufacturing industries were found in paper and printing, chemicals and rubber, fabricated metals and machinery, and electricity generation and distribution. The greatest <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> for tertiary industries were found in transport, communication, finance and insurance, and market real estate and business services.

40|$|The {{breadth and}} depth of <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> in the {{tropical}} timber industry of Gabon is a result of three inter-acting drivers: the nature of final markets, ownership of production, and sector-specific policy. The Forestry Code set explicit domestic processing targets built on the trajectory of French processors. Still, while this is theoretically in line with European market demands for wood products, the forced beneficiation resulted in Chinese, Malaysian, and Gabonese producers, whose prime activity is the exploitation of logs for processing industries in China, to limit their participation in <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> to the sawnwood sub-sector, characterised by low entry barriers and negative producer margins. Gabon's comparative advantage lies in the exploitation of its natural resource tropical timber for export markets. Logging is also a 'superior' technology allowing the appropriation of resource rents. These are largely diluted in processing due to production cost penalties such as high reservation wages, inadequate infrastructure, lack of skills, and the political economy of Gabon. The conflict between the envisaged <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> approach to industrialisation (in light of falling oil reserves), industry actors' market focuses, motivations, and capabilities, as well as conclusions drawn about comparative advantages and linkage-blockages, has significant consequences for industrial development. ...|$|R
