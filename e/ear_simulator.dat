40|$|This paper {{questions}} {{the necessity for}} two calibration devices to measure the acoustic output from different types of audiometric earphones. International standards give the audiometric zero for TDH 39 earphones on the IEC 60318 - 3 acoustic coupler; the IEC 60318 - 1 <b>ear</b> <b>simulator</b> is intended for other supra-aural earphone types. If hearing threshold samples from young, healthy ears {{were found to be}} more variable using TDH 39 earphones, then that earphone and its coupler might be taken out of service. The audiological literature yielded threshold survey results for over 5100 otologically normal ears of subjects aged 31 years or less. These independent samples showed smaller variation for TDH 39 samples than for samples using other earphones; this finding does not support abandoning the TDH 39 and its coupler. Nevertheless, benefits accrue from calibrating TDH 39 output to the audiometric zero as measured on the <b>ear</b> <b>simulator...</b>|$|E

For the physically measured RECD, the RECD was measured with real ear and coupler measurements for the <b>ear</b> <b>simulator</b> and HA 1 - and HA 2 2 -cc couplers. The psychophysically measured RECDs were derived from audiogram measures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{propagation}} of sound in the narrow pathways of an occluded-ear simulator typically used for the measurement of insert-type earphones. The simulator has a standardized frequency response conforming to the international standard (IEC 60318 - 4). In narrow pathways, the speed and phase of sound waves are modified by viscous air damping. In our previous paper, we proposed a new finite element method (FEM) to consider the effects of air viscosity {{in this type of}} audio equipment. In this study, we will compare the results from the <b>ear</b> <b>simulator</b> FEM model, and those from a three dimensional human ear canal FEM model made from computed tomography images, with the measured frequency response data from the ear canals of 18 people...|$|E
50|$|POLQA is the {{successor}} of PESQ (ITU-T Rec. P.862). POLQA avoids {{weaknesses of the}} current P.862 model and is extended towards handling of higher bandwidth audiosignals. Further improvements target the handling of time called signals and signals with many delay variations. Similarly to P.862, POLQA supports measurements in the common telephony band (300-3400 Hz), but in addition it has a second operational mode for assessing HD-Voice in wideband and super-wideband speech signals (50-14000 Hz). POLQA also targets the assessment of speech signals recorded acoustically by an artificial head with mouth and <b>ear</b> <b>simulators.</b>|$|R
40|$|Pure-tone air-conduction {{audiometry}} {{has become}} the foundation of hearing assessment. The audiometer, {{and in particular the}} earphones used with it, need to be calibrated to ensure measurement traceability. Hearing threshold measurements are then referred to established reference levels to then judge if any hearing loss is present. <b>Ear</b> <b>simulators</b> are used in this process to provide an objective means of determining the sound pressure level presented during a test. At present ISO 389 - 1 requires the IEC reference coupler to be used for the calibration of a limited number of supra aural earphone configurations and the IEC artificial ear to be used for all other types. In this part of a collaborative project with ISVR, this report suggests that the artificial ear be used universally and shows that users of these devices have responded positively to this recommendation. It thus goes on to propose to ISO that the sole use of the artificial ear and its RETSPL values be the basis for a revision of ISO 389 - 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} risk to hearing that mass-storage personal listening devices (PLDs) pose remains unclear. Previous {{research in this}} area has either focused on maximum outputs of these devices or on ear-canal measurements of listening levels that could not be compared to standards of occupational noise exposure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare two standard measurement protocols [ISO 11904 - 1 (2002), Switzerland; ISO 11904 - 2 (2004), Switzerland] for the measurement of preferred listening levels of PLD. Noise measurements, behavioral thresholds, and oral interviews were obtained from 30 (18 – 30 years) PLD users. Preferred listening levels for self-selected music were determined in quiet and background noise using a probe microphone, as well as in the DB- 100 <b>ear</b> <b>simulator</b> mounted in KEMAR. The ear-canal measurements were compensated for diffuse-field. Only one of the subjects was found to be listening at hazardous levels once their reported daily usage was accounted for using industrial workplace standards. The variance across subjects was the smallest in the ear-canal measurements that were compensated for diffuse-field equivalence [ISO 11904 - 1 (2002), Switzerland]. Seven subjects were found to be listening at levels above 85 dBA based on measurements obtained in the KEMAR and then compensated for diffuse-field equivalence...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the contribution of noise exposures from personal media player (PMP) use in the workplace to overall employee noise exposures at a Colorado manufacturing facility. A total of 24 workers’ PMP and background noise exposures were measured. Twelve PMP users worked in high-background-noise exposure (HBNE) areas and 12 employees worked in low-background-noise exposure (LBNE) areas. The self-selected PMP listening level of each worker was measured using an <b>ear</b> <b>simulator,</b> and the background noise of each employee workstation was measured using a sound level meter (SLM). The workers 2 ̆ 7 self-reported PMP duration of use, PMP listening exposure levels, and background noise levels, were used to estimate the daily occupational noise exposures. The measured background noise levels averaged 81 dBA for HBNE workers and 59 dBA for LBNE workers. The measured, free-field equivalent listening exposure levels were significantly greater for HBNE workers (85 dBA) as compared to LBNE workers (75 dBA) (p= 0. 0006). The estimated mean daily noise exposures for both groups were below the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value for noise of 85 dBA eight-hour time weighted average (TWA), specifically 84 dBA TWA for HBNE workers and 72 dBA TWA for LBNE workers. Three of 12 (25...|$|E
40|$|The earmould {{acoustics}} {{affect the}} amplification that {{the hearing aid}} is programmed to give to its user. It is therefore important that the choices made for the earmould are correctly done. One choice is regarding {{the shape of the}} soundbore that affects the frequency response of the hearing aid above a certain cut-off frequency. The purpose of this project was to measure the frequency response when altering the shape of the soundbore in the earmould. Additionally, the aim was to examine how the frequency response is affected when the shape of the soundbore is not set or is not possible to set in the software when programming the hearing aid. Finally, the author asked hearing aid developers about their views on earmold acoustics. To gauge the view of hearing aid developers on earmould acoustics, a questionnaire was sent out to selected companies. The other methods used in this project were acoustic measurements of earmoulds in an <b>Ear</b> <b>Simulator.</b> The results of these measurements show that the shape of the soundbore affects the frequency response of the hearing aid in a way that verifies previous studies made. The project also demonstrates the importance of verifying the hearing aid's frequency response since it became apparent from the results that changes made for the soundbore in the software sometimes had no effect on the amplification, or a different effect from the one specified by the softwar...|$|E

40|$|This work {{compares the}} results of {{laboratory}} experiments with numerical modelling using the finite element method {{in order to assess}} the attenuation of hearing protectors under conditions of high amplitude impulse noise. Comparative data for the finite element simulation was provided from a series of experiments using a shock tube, acoustic test fixture, <b>ear</b> canal <b>simulator</b> and partial head form. The numerical model comprised a finite element mesh of fluid and porous materials in order to model the earmuff hearing protector coupled to the auditory canal. The results show that a simple 2 -D finite element model is capable of making a reasonable prediction of the attenuation of an earmuff provided that headband force is also included in the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of noise exposure from communication headsets poses a methodological challenge. Although several standards describe methods for general noise measurements in occupational settings, these are not directly applicable to noise assessments under communication headsets. For measurements under occluded ears, specialized methods have been specified by the International Standards Organization (ISO 11904) such as the microphone in a real ear and manikin techniques. Simpler methods have also been proposed in some national standards {{such as the use}} of general purpose artificial <b>ears</b> and <b>simulators</b> in conjunction with single number corrections to convert measurements to the equivalent diffuse field. However, little is known about the measurement agreement between these various methods and the acoustic manikin technique. Twelve experts positioned circum-aural, supra-aural and insert communication headsets on four different measurement setups (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3. 3 artificial ears, and acoustic manikin). Fit-refit measurements of four audio communication signals were taken under quiet laboratory conditions. Data were transformed into equivalent diffuse-field sound levels using third-octave procedures. Results indicate that the Type 1 artificial ear is not suited for the {{measurement of}} sound exposure under communication headsets, while Type 2 and Type 3. 3 artificial ears are in good agreement with the acoustic manikin technique. Single number corrections were found to introduce a large measurement uncertainty, making the use of the third-octave transformation preferable...|$|R
40|$|Good {{acoustics}} {{in classrooms}} {{is necessary to}} guarantee appropriate teaching and learning practices. The majority of classrooms in Italy does not comply with national or international standards since they take place in historical buildings with big volumes and vaulted ceilings, generating unfavorable environments. In fact, long reverberation times and excessive noise levels have been proved to be factors that negatively influence the speech communication process. However, {{most of the past}} studies refer to laboratory conditions with artificial added reverberation and speech-shaped noise. This work focuses on investigating the influence of reverberation and noise in real classrooms on speech recognition. Speech recognition was measured adaptively converging to signal-to-noise ratio yielding 80 % correct recognition scores (SRT 80). Since the noise level was fixed at 60 dB SPL, the speech level can be estimated from the measured SRTs and linked to the vocal effort that a teacher would need to maintain to guarantee a good level of speech communication. Five experiments were designed based on realistic receiver positions in two representative Italian classrooms, one with an acoustical treatment and one without, where room impulse responses were measured at a head and torso <b>simulator</b> <b>ears.</b> Receiver positions in axis with a speech-source were two in the room with good acoustics, at 1. 5 m and at 4 m, and three in the room with bad acoustics, at 1. 5 m, 4 m and 6. 3 m. In each room noise-sources were placed at different distances and azimuths with respect to the receivers to account for binaural cues in the cocktail party phenomenon, namely at 0 °, 120 ° and 180 °. Babble noise was measured in real classrooms during a break between lessons, acquiring the noise produced by children moving and talking. The respective impulse responses were convolved with speech and noise signals of Italian matrix test. Preliminary results show that lower SRT 80 s were measured for good room acoustics, indicating the detrimental effect of reverberation on speech recognition. A major effect of the reflections was also evident in the increase in SRT 80 s when the distance between speech-source and receiver increased. The angular separation of the noise-source was evaluated as speech release from masking, resulting up to 4 dB when noise came from 120 ° instead of 0 ° or 180 ° in both room acoustics. Estimations of the speech level will be performed and compared to the indications of ISO 9921, since a high vocal effort can be a risk factor for vocal health...|$|R
