40|$|Abstract: As {{a central}} {{component}} of any existing AC substation, <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> {{are responsible for}} providing isolation between grid-connected and safely approachable sections of bus. Additionally, they can provide the capability of transferring load currents between different busses. Due to the excellent performance history in AC, possible challenges for <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> in future HVDC substations were identified by comparing computed effects of DC stress to the standardized capabilities of existing AC <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches.</b> It was found that pure, time-constant DC voltages and currents will not lead to excessive stress onto <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches.</b> However, voltage and current ripples present in real HVDC systems can give rise to considerably different results. Ripples exhibiting a 1 /f decay in magnitude up to the 30 th harmonic were utilized in calculations. Similarly to AC, switching of sections of bus can lead to multiple restrikes or prestrikes, potentially resulting in very fast transients. The maximum voltage collapse exhibits a strong dependence on {{the magnitude of the}} voltage ripple. Transferring load currents between different busses {{has been shown to be}} possible under DC conditions. However, the recovery voltage as well as the extinction process itself depend heavily on the current ripple. ...|$|R

40|$|Gas Insulated Substations (GIS) {{have found}} {{a broad range of}} {{applications}} in power systems because of their high reliability, easy maintenance, small ground space requirements etc. In a Gas insulated substations, the operation of <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> and circuit breakers can cause Very Fast Transient Overvoltages (VFTOs), which will bring an instantaneous change in voltage with a very short rise time and it is normally followed by oscillation having high frequencies. For designing the insulation level of a substation, it is essential to know the maximum value of VFTO. Fast operating <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> are usually used to reduce time of the breakdown; however, it cannot eliminate fully the effect of the VFTO. Very Fast Transient Overvoltages caused by <b>disconnector</b> <b>switch</b> operation of 1000 kv GIS is simulated and calculated in this paper using MATLAB.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model is proposed regarding the temperature rise estimation in components installed to electric power distribution networks (e. g. circuit breakers, automatic <b>switches,</b> <b>disconnectors,</b> <b>fuse</b> carriers), during short-circuit faults. The overall short-circuit current waveform and the components' mass and material are considered. The model was applied to a common disconnector of the network and characteristics of the results are plotted according to different forms of the asymmetric part of the short-circuit current waveform and the initial value of the short-circuit d. c. current component. The models' response is also investigated {{for a wide range}} of values of the crossing resistance and the component mass. It is convincingly shown that the short-circuit current waveform asymmetric part and component mass significantly affect temperature rise, and calculations of temperature rise which omit the above factors are questionable. An easy to use approximating equation is proposed, which could be considered in the mathematical approach of the phenomenon, according to international standards and facilitate the above components design.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{transfer}} load currents between parallel busbars {{is one of}} the main requirements for most <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> in gas insulated as well as air insulated substations today. As such, the capability limits and testing methods are internationally standardized in IEC 62271 - 102. The test circuit dictated in this standard is the Th√©venin equivalent of the high current, power frequency approximation of two parallel busbars supplied by an AC current source. This setup inevitably couples different factors influencing the bus-transfer switching process by directly specifying the pre-switching current through the <b>disconnector</b> <b>switch</b> and recovery voltage expected across it after successful switching. To facilitate a more detailed and direct investigation of bus-transfer switching processes, a different test method is suggested and consequently implemented as a proof of concept. The suggested method entails the use of an AC current source to drive a current through two parallel impedances representing different sections of a busbar. The <b>disconnector</b> <b>switch</b> under test is placed in series with one of the impedances. In order to analyze the feasibility of such a setup, a proof of concept current source along with two parallel impedances was built.
