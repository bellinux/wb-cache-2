25|$|Amtrak {{has argued}} {{that it needs to}} {{increase}} capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years. However, despite an initial request for more than $2.1 billion in funding for the year, the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations, dropping to under $1.4 billion {{for the first time in}} several years. Amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the Northeast Corridor included over 200 bridges, most dating to the 19th century, tunnels under Baltimore dating to the American Civil War Era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost $5.2 billion to repair (more than triple Amtrak's total annual budget). Amtrak's budget is only allocated on a yearly basis, and it has been argued by Joseph Vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>planning</b> difficult if not impossible.|$|E

Indeed, price determinacy requires non-Ricardian <b>fiscal</b> <b>plans</b> and a predetermined nominal debt of the government.

The difference between tax-based and spending-based adjustments appears not to be explained by accompanying policies, including monetary policy.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interdependence of}} fiscal policies, and in particular deficits, in the European Union using an empirical analysis based on real-time fiscal data. There are many potential reasons why fiscal policies could be interdependent, such as direct externalities due to cross-border public investments, yardstick competition, tax competition and peer pressure among governments. Real-time data allow us to investigate how available information is mapped into policymakers' plans, while revised data are generally affected by reactions to unexpected developments {{that have taken place}} after the plan was made. Controlling for a large set of relevant determinants of primary cyclically adjusted deficits, we find indeed evidence of fiscal policy interdependence. However, the interdependence is rather asymmetrically distributed: the <b>fiscal</b> <b>plans</b> of the large countries affect the <b>fiscal</b> <b>plans</b> of the small countries, but not vice versa.

40|$|This paper studies whether fiscal {{corrections}} cause large output losses. We {{find that}} it matters crucially how the fiscal correction occurs. Adjustments based upon spending cuts are much less costly in terms of output losses than tax-based ones. Spending-based adjustments {{have been associated with}} mild and short-lived recessions, in many cases with no recession at all. Tax-based adjustments have been associated with prolonged and deep recessions. The difference cannot be explained by different monetary policies during the two types of adjustments. Studying the effects of multi-year <b>fiscal</b> <b>plans</b> rather than individual shifts in fiscal variables we make progress on question of anticipated versus unanticipated policy shifts: we find that the correlation between unanticipated and anticipated shifts in taxes and spending is heterogenous across countries, suggesting that the degree of persistence of fiscal corrections varies [...] Estimating the effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>plans,</b> rather than individual fiscal shocks, we obtain much more precise estimates of tax and spending multipliers...|$|R
