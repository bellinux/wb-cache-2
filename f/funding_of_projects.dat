An STA spanning [...] was constructed in 2004, making it the largest manmade wetland in the world. Fifty-five percent of the land necessary to acquire for restoration has been purchased by the State of Florida, totaling [...] A plan to hasten the construction and <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> was put into place, named [...] "Acceler8", spurring the start of six of eight large construction projects, including that of three large reservoirs. However, federal funds have not been forthcoming; CERP was signed when the U.S. government had a budget surplus, but since then deficits have renewed, and two of CERP's major supporters in Congress retired. According to a story in The New York Times, state officials say the restoration is lost in a maze of [...] "federal bureaucracy, a victim of 'analysis paralysis'". CERP still remains controversial as the projects slated for Acceler8, environmental activists note, are those that benefit urban areas, and regions in the Everglades in desperate need of water are still being neglected, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment.|$|E

[...] The general plan of the Commonwealers, and similar groups around the country, was to travel to Washington, D.C. to protest, seeking government <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> that would produce jobs for the unemployed. [...] Trouble had come in various cities as the Commonwealers boarded trains without paying fares. [...] A large rally of the Commonwealers took place in Puyallup, Washington near the end of April, 1894. [...] No transport of troops from Vancouver Barracks was ordered however, and at 4:00p.m. on May 2, 1894, Harvest Queen was discharged from War Department service, and returned to Portland.|$|E
