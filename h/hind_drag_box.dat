50|$|The reboilering {{required}} extensive {{modifications to}} the frame under the firebox. The Beatty-designed bridle casting was removed and the bar frames extended backwards under the firebox to the rear <b>drag</b> <b>box.</b> This frame modification {{turned out to be}} a weak point in the more powerful rebuilt engine, with the result that she was never again favoured for road work and spent most of her later service life more or less permanently confined to the Culemborg carriage yard.|$|R
50|$|The hind end of {{the frame}} was {{redesigned}} and the bridle casting was removed and replaced by a frame plate, riveted to the main bar frame and carried through to the hind buffer beam. A new steel casting, extending across and over the main frame, added rigidity {{and served as a}} support for the boiler at the throat plate. A new design of <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> was installed. While the trailing Bissel truck remained unaltered, its side control was re-designed and a new compensating beam and support pivot was fitted.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the soil friction restraint on oblique pipelines in loose sand. A series of experimental tests are {{conducted in a}} prefabricated large-scale <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> with dimensions 1. 83 m x 1. 83 m x 1. 22 m. Model pipes 0. 61 m long with diameters of 152. 4, 228. 6, and 304. 8 mm are obliquely moved from an axial-longitudinal to lateral-transversal direction in the <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> to study the associated soil restraints of the oblique pipes with various shallow embedded depths. All the test results indicate that for the axial pipes, the longitudinal soil restraint could be estimated {{as the product of}} the average of the vertical and horizontal earth pressures at the centerline of the pipe and the tangent value of soil-pipe friction angle, whereas for the lateral pipes, the transversal soil restraint could be predicted by using the limit equilibrium model with the assumption of the planar sliding failure surface. The longitudinal and transversal, soil restraints of the oblique pipes could geometrically be obtained by multiplying the corresponding cosine and sine values of the oblique angle with the associated longitudinal soil restraint of axial pipe and the transversal soil restraint of the lateral pipe, respectively. The findings also indicate that the scale effects are not significant for the size of the pipes tested herein...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The game of Sokoban Sokoban is {{a popular}} puzzle game {{implemented}} on almost all computer system. It is a true part of computer gaming folklore. The aim {{of the game is}} to move a person (Jap. sokoban = pusher) around in a two-dimensional maze and to move a number of boxes into some designated storage positions. The pusher may only push one box at a time and he cannot <b>drag</b> <b>boxes.</b> If he manages to move each box to a target position (any box can move to any storage location) the game is solved. The main problem in solving a game is that wrong moves may place boxes in unrecoverable positions, eg. into a corner of the maze. The player then cannot move the box any further, because he cannot reach a position from where he can push the box. Since the player may only move one box at a time, boxes can also block each other, therefore the player has to consider the order in which he pushes the blocks. It has been shown that solving arbitrary puzzles is a PSPACE [...] complete prob...|$|R

40|$|The soil {{restraints}} to oblique {{movement of}} buried pipes in dense sand were investigated. Model pipes 0. 61 m long with diameters of 152. 4, 228. 6, and 304. 8 mm were obliquely moved from an axial-longitudinal to a lateral-transversal direction {{in a large}} scale <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> to study the associated longitudinal and transverse soil restraints on the pipes in the shallow buried depth. All the experimental results indicated that the longitudinal soil restraint to the axial movement of the pipes could be estimated as the product of the average of the vertical and horizontal earth pressures at the centerline of the pipe and the tangent value of the soil-pipe friction angle. For the lateral movement pipes, three different theoretical methods were used to analyze the transverse soil restraint. Among these, the modified Meyerhof approach with the assumption of a rupture surface of logarithmic spiral arc was closer to the experimental results compared to the planar sliding surface approach. For the oblique movement pipes, the longitudinal soil restraint decreases, whereas the transverse soil restraint increases with increasing oblique angle. Moreover, the longitudinal and transverse soil restraint of the oblique angle pipes could be obtained by multiplying the corresponding cosine and sine values of the oblique angle with the associated longitudinal soil restraint of the axial pipe and the transverse soil restraint of the lateral pipe, respectively. The findings also indicate that the scale effects are minor for sizes up to 304. 8 mm of the pipe diameter tested herein...|$|R

50|$|Among {{the notable}} {{features}} of Tiktaalik are {{the absence of}} bones covering the gills. These bones would otherwise connect the shoulder girdle with skull, making the shoulder girdle part of the skull. With {{the loss of the}} gill-covering bones, the shoulder girdle is separated from the skull, connected to the torso by muscle and other soft-tissue connections. The result is the appearance of the neck. With the exception of Tiktaalik, this feature is found only in tetrapods, not in tetrapodomorph fishes. Tiktaalik also had a pattern of bones in the skull roof (upper half of the skull) that bears similarity to the end-Devonian tetrapod Ichthyostega. The two also shared a semi-rigid ribcage of overlapping ribs, which may have substituted for a rigid spine. In conjunction with robust forelimbs and shoulder girdle, both Tiktaalik and Ichthyostega may have had the ability to locomote on land {{in the manner of a}} seal, with the forward portion of the torso elevated, the <b>hind</b> part <b>dragging</b> behind. And finally, the fin bones of Tiktaalik are somewhat similar to the limb bones of tetrapods.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in touch and display technologies are supporting a wide-spread use of touch-based direct manipulation techniques {{as well as}} 3 D displays that give a perspectively correct view. Both techniques have consistency constraints including the following: With direct manipulation, a dragged object should stick to the finger tip. With viewer centered projection, head movement should update the scene’s projection to preserve a sound 3 D impression, e. g., leaning around a house should reveal its backyard. Unfortunately, these two contradict each other, making a combination, e. g., moving the head while touching or dragging an object, non-trivial. We introduce a design space of perspectively adjusted methods for direct manipulation {{to cope with this}} limitation, select nine different strategies from it, and evaluate six of them in depth.

Thus he “started to <b>drag</b> the tape <b>boxes</b> downstairs” and play them for new audiences, who encouraged him to digitize his tapes and put them online. By the summer of 2014, the site had 12 mixtape genres, each of which contained more than twenty separate mixtapes, which were around 45-minutes in length. Users could select a genre, then a mixtape, and listen to a stream tape created by Pates; each mixtape included a track list and gave users the option to pause the tape.

40|$|The {{timing and}} neural {{processing}} of {{the understanding of}} social interactions was investigated by presenting scenes in which 2 people performed cooperative or affective actions. While {{the role of the}} human mirror neuron system (MNS) in understanding actions and intentions is widely accepted, {{little is known about the}} time course within which these aspects of visual information are automatically extracted. Event-Related Potentials were recorded in 35 university students perceiving 260 pictures of cooperative (e. g., 2 people <b>dragging</b> a <b>box)</b> or affective (e. g., 2 people smiling and holding hands) interactions. The action’s goal was automatically discriminated at about 150 – 170 ms, as reflected by occipito/temporal N 170 response. The swLORETA inverse solution revealed the strongest sources in the right posterior cingulate cortex (CC) for affective actions and in the right pSTS for cooperative actions. It was found a right hemispheric asymmetry that involved the fusiform gyrus (BA 37), the posterior CC, and the medial frontal gyrus (BA 10 / 11) for the processing of affective interactions, particularly in the 155 – 175 ms time window. In a later time window (200 – 250 ms) the processing of cooperative interactions activated the left post-central gyrus (BA 3), the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 10), as well as the right premotor cortex (BA 6). Women showed a greater response discriminative of the action’s goal compared to men at P 300 and anterior negativity level (220 – 500 ms). These findings might be related to a greater responsiveness of the female vs. male MNS. In addition, the discriminative effect was bilateral in women and was smalle...|$|R
