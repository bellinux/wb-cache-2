5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E
