5|$|There {{have been}} {{scattered}} complaints {{in some communities}} that the LinkNYC towers themselves are a nuisance. These complaints mainly {{have to do with}} loitering, browser access, and kiosk volume, the latter two of which the city has resolved. However, these nuisance complaints are rare citywide; of the 920 kiosks installed citywide by then, there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> one complaint relating to the kiosk design itself.|$|E
5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> a few new defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E

5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened to cruise past at speed. Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.|$|E

The two hull losses were a 1994 KLM Cityhopper crash that killed three in the Netherlands and a 1998 Formosa Airlines crash that killed 13 in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|When Pettigrew's troops {{approached}} Gettysburg on June 30, {{they noticed}} Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth {{what he had}} seen, neither general believed {{that there was a}} substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.|$|E

5|$|Abdül Kadir {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople in October 1892. By 1895, the steel frames for her hull had been erected, but work {{proceeded}} very slowly and frequently stopped, primarily due to the chronically tight Ottoman budget. In 1897, for instance, work had been halted for some time, and the contemporary journal Navy and Army Illustrated predicted that the ship would not be finished. Similar large-scale building projects during this period also fell apart {{due to lack of}} funds; a major construction program launched {{in the aftermath of the}} Ottoman Navy's poor performance in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 stalled after funds could not be appropriated for the new ships. By 1906, when work on Abdül Kadir stopped for the last time, the hull <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> partially plated. By this time, the blocks that supported the hull during construction had shifted, which destroyed the keel. As a result, the unfinished ship was broken up on the slipway in 1909.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|As the new decade began, KKR began {{restructuring}} RJR. In January 1990, it {{completed the}} sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution {{as part of the}} original leveraged buyout of RJR <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> $1.5 billion. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.|$|E

At the 2005 U.S. Championships, Lysacek won the bronze medal after receiving the only 6.0 of his career for his short program. He went on to win his first senior international title at the 2005 Four Continents. He competed next at the 2005 World Championships in Moscow. There, he won a surprising bronze medal at his first senior World Championships, a competition for which his goal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> to qualify for the free skate.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{was listed}} in the Kennel Club's first list of Vulnerable Native Breeds in 2006. This list is for those breeds which {{register}} less than 300 dogs in any one year; there had been 84 Cardigan Corgis registered in 2006. After an initial increase, this declined to 46 in 2010, but then rose to the highest numbers since the list began in 2015, {{with a total of}} 124 puppies registered. In 2013, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was also added, as there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> 241 puppies registered that year. While the Kennel Club blamed this on the importation of foreign dog breeds, The Daily Telegraph blamed the decline on the ban on tail docking introduced six years before. However, 2015 saw an increase of 34% in the number of Pembroke registrations; the popularity of Corgis on Instagram was credited for the change. Pembrokes were removed from the Vulnerable Native Breeds list in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{during the}} month of March are an unusual {{occurrence}} in Minnesota when compared {{to the rest of the}} spring and summer months.

Despite the historical significance of the outbreak, this was not the earliest calendar-year tornado to touch down in Minnesota; that record is held by three tornadoes that touched on March 6, 2017.|$|E
