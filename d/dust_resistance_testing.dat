40|$|Metal dusting is {{a catastrophic}} {{carburisation}} phenomenon that occurs at temperatures of 450 - 850 °C in atmospheres of high carbon activity. The resistance of alloys to corrosion, including metal dusting, {{relies on the}} formation of a dense, adherent oxide layer that separates the alloy from the corrosive environment. For such an oxide layer to be protective, it must achieve full surface coverage, be crack-free and be established before significant material degradation has occurred. Formation of a protective oxide scale can be enhanced by increasing the population of rapid diffusion paths for the protective elements (e. g. Cr and Al) to reach the alloy surface. In this work, laser surface melting has been used to improve the metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> of Alloy 800 H by creating a rapid solidification microstructure and, thereby, increasing the density of rapid diffusion paths. Oxidation during laser processing {{has been found to be}} detrimental to metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, it has been demonstrated that the resulting oxide can be removed without compromising metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance.</b> Results of exposure to a metal dusting atmosphere (20...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{guidelines}} for providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa's public sector programme call for switching patients from first-line to second-line treatment upon virologic failure {{as indicated by}} two consecutive viral loads above 5000 copies/ml, but without laboratory evidence of viral resistance. We modelled the net cost of adding <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> for patients with virological failure and retaining patients without resistance on first-line therapy, rather than switching all failures to second-line therapy. Methods Costs were estimated for three scenarios: routine maintenance (standard care without <b>resistance</b> <b>testing,</b> switch all failures to second line); <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> for patients with failure, switch those with resistance); and limited <b>testing</b> (<b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> for patients with failure {{in the first three}} years, switch those with resistance). A Markov model was used to estimate the cost of each arm over five years after first line initiation. Rates of treatment failure, viral resistance and treatment costs were estimated with primary data from a large HIV treatment cohort at a public facility in Johannesburg. Future costs were discounted at 3 %. Results Virological failure rates over five years were 19. 8 % in routine maintenance and 20. 2 % in <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> and limited testing; 16. 8 % and 11. 4 % of failures in routine and limited testing, respectively, did not have any resistance mutations, resulting in 3. 1 % and 2. 0 % fewer patients switching to second-line ART by the end of five years. Treatment costs were estimated at US$ 526 and $ 1268 per patient per year on first-line and second-line therapy, respectively; a <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> cost $ 242. The total average cost per patient over five years was $ 2780 in routine maintenance; $ 2775 in resistance testing; and $ 2763 in limited <b>testing.</b> Conclusions Incorporating <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> into treatment guidelines in South Africa is potentially cost-neutral and can identify other reasons for failure, conserve treatment options, and generate information about emerging resistance patterns. </p...|$|R

The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages.
