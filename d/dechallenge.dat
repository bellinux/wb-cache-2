40|$|Purpose To {{present a}} case series of {{haemorrhagic}} events associated with varenicline identified from the New Zealand (NZ) and Netherlands national pharmacovigilance centres and propose a possible mechanism for these adverse events. Methods Reports of epistaxis and other haemorrhagic events (in all system organ classes excluding gynaecological) associated with varenicline {{were identified and}} assessed in both the NZ Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMMP) and the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb (Lareb). Additional reports were identified from the World Health Organisation Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) datasets, and these also underwent causality assessment. Results A total of 30 reports of haemorrhagic events were identified by the NZ IMMP (16 reports) and Lareb (14 reports). Six cases of epistaxis were identified, and four patients had a positive <b>dechallenge</b> on withdrawal of varenicline, suggesting a causal association. Another five reports of gingival bleeding were identified, with three patients having a positive <b>dechallenge.</b> Another patient who experienced haemoptysis while taking varenicline had a positive <b>dechallenge</b> and a positive rechallenge. In the WHO datasets, a further 49 reports of epistaxis, 39 reports of haemoptysis and 21 reports of thrombocytopenia were identified. A plausible mechanism for haemorrhagic events associated with varenicline may {{be a result of}} interaction with the serotonin (5 -HT) receptor system and transporter. Conclusions This is the first specific investigation of haemorrhagic events associated with varenicline. The results of our assessment of reports identified by two national pharmacovigilance centres suggest that there may be causal relationship between varenicline and these adverse events...|$|E
40|$|Stevens Johnson’s {{syndrome}} {{is a life}} threatening drug induced hypersensitivity reaction. The drugs that cause SJS commonly are antibacterials (sulfonamides), anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (oxicam derivatives) and oxide inhibitors (allopurinol). Clinical symptoms are urticarial skin eruptions, arthralgia or arthritis, lymphadenopathy and fever. Treatment of Stevens Johnsons Syndrome includes systemic steroids, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin’s and supportive therapy. A male patient of 58 years was admitted in cardiology unit with chief complaints of skin reactions (Erythema andrashes) all over the body and oral erosions.

40|$|OBJETIVE: The {{present study}} aimed to analyze 219 {{notifications}} of suspected adverse reactions (AR) produced by psychoactive medicaments (ARPM), notified by Brazilian psychiatrists, during a 3 -month period (April 1999 up to September 2001). METHOD: A notifying card for adverse reactions possibly produced by psychoactive medications was quarterly sent to all psychiatrists affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Psychiatry. Once each notification, dully filled in, was received, the possible adverse reaction was analyzed {{in order to}} verify the causality RESULTS: The psychiatrists classified as severe 50 of the ARPMs; 150 others were not considered as severe. Among the severe ones there were 3 deaths, 12 life-threatening reactions, 26 ARPMs required or prolonged hospitalization and 9 notifications described temporary disability of the patients. Among the medications, antidepressants ranked first with 122 ARPMs being notified, followed by neuroleptics (46 ARPMs) and antiepiletic medicaments (25 ARPMs). The three main organs and systems affected by the ARs were the Central Nervous System with 102 ARs, skin and mucosa with 44 and gastrointestinal with 21 ARPMs. CONCLUSION: Considering causality, i. e., the association between the medication and the described AR, 24 cases were considered as Definite (with positive <b>dechallenge</b> and rechallenge, i. e., withdrawal and reintroduction of the medication) and 134 other ARPMs were classified as Probable (only <b>dechallenge</b> positive; only with medication withdrawal; rechallenge was not performed) ...|$|E

Furthermore, rechallenge as suggested by Karch and Lasagna is unethical, since ADE was the leading cause of admission. Nevertheless, applying these scales allowed some comparison with international studies. The third scale is better suited for ICU [27] but has only been used in French studies.

In both drug treatment periods, severe laboratory hyponatremia developed. After terlipressin discontinuation, mineral disbalance corrected rapidly. Positive <b>dechallenge</b> and rechallenge corresponding to the drug administration schedule confirms the causality between terlipressin administration and hyponatremia. Hyponatremia was preceded with substantial fluid retention in both episodes.

There was a suggestive time relationship with the use of gabapentin, with a time to onset of several days to weeks, and a positive <b>dechallenge</b> in the majority of the cases. Pharmacologically, gabapentin-induced hypoglycaemia could be related to its gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor affinity. Both the GABAA and GABAB receptor have a role in the secretion of insulin. Alternatively, direct binding of gabapentin to the specific subunits of the voltage-gated calcium channels could also affect insulin release. We recommend that patients, especially diabetics, starting gabapentin treatment should be monitored and informed about the risk of hypoglycaemia...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} current {{literature}} on suspected green tea-related hepatic reactions and to describe two new cases reported {{within the framework}} of the Italian surveillance system of natural health products. Results: A literature search of publication between 1999 and October 2008 retrieved 34 cases of hepatitis. Histological examination of the liver revealed inflammatory reactions, cholestasis, occasional steatosis, and necrosis. A positive <b>dechallenge</b> was reported in 29 cases. There was one reported death. A positive rechallenge occurred in seven cases (20 %). In the two new cases, the causality assessment was judged as "possible" according to the RUCAM score. Conclusions: Our analysis of the published case reports suggests a causal association between green tea and liver damage. The hepatotoxicity is probably due to (-) -epigallocatechin gallate or its metabolites which, under particular conditions related to the patient's metabolism, can induce oxidative stress in the liver. In a few cases, toxicity related to concomitant medications could also be involved. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{suggested}} an algorithm for the categorization of adverse reactions (AR) in large-scale clinical trials (Agents and Actions 1980; 7 fsuppl]: 318 - 322, Birkhiiuser Verlag.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{hepatotoxicity}} cases described in the literature, attributed to the consumption of Herbalife(r) products, and to determine whether a causal relationship exists between the reported cases of liver injury and the use of these products. A literature search was performed on the PubMed, LILACS and PAHO databases. Seven publications reporting a total of 53 cases of hepatotoxicity linked to the use of Herbalife(r) products were retrieved. All of the studies lacked sufficient information to some degree, whether related to patients' history, concomitant use of medication and/or other compounds (including alcohol), observations on interrupted use (<b>dechallenge),</b> results found with markers, viral serology and autoantibodies or observations concerning re-exposure to the products. In addition to these items, the lack of clear information on the type of products evaluated and their respective composition is an important factor to be considered. Furthermore, data quality was also questionable due to the presence of confounding factors, absence of proper exclusion of alternative explanations, and the use of questionable methods for attributing causality. Hence, an association between hepatotoxicity and consumption of these products cannot be proven based on the data collected and rigorous scientific analysis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an {{acquired}} autoimmune disease, with typical histology and immune pathological findings, {{which might be}} associated with drug therapy. The list of responsible drugs increases every year, but a current literature revision {{do not include the}} mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. By converse, bullous pemghigoid cases have been described in renal transplant recipients and associated with the allogenic graft itself, causing a cross reaction against the skin, or unbalancing the immune response, through a chronic cell-mediated suppression, non-specifically favouring the autoantibody production. OBJECT AND RESULTS: Two cases of BP occurred, respectively, 10 days to 2 months after the addition to their current regimen of everolimus in a 35 -year-old woman and sirolimus in a 65 -year-old man. The graft functionality was within normal range. General corticosteroids therapy resistance, immediate improvement after drug discontinuation (<b>dechallenge)</b> and relapse after re-exposure (rechallenge) were striking criteria supporting a causative role of the drugs, grouped in the mTOR inhibitors class. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of drug-induced events is crucial for early management, and particularly bullous eruptions affect patients' health and quality of life. Additional research is necessary to confirm the m-TOR inhibitors association, which exploit the possible mechanisms and eventually point out preventive measures...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} spontaneously {{reported cases}} of erectile dysfunction (ED) in association with angiotensin II type I blockers (ARB) and other antihypertensive drugs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All spontaneously {{reported cases of}} ED submitted to the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) between 1990 and 2006, where at least one antihypertensive drug was the suspected agent, were scrutinized. Patient demographics, drug treatment and adverse reactions were recorded. Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method, the information component (IC) was calculated. RESULTS: Among a total of 225 reports of ED, 59 involved antihypertensive drugs including ARB (9 cases) as suspected agents. A positive IC value was found indicating that ED was reported more often in association with antihypertensive drugs classes, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, compared with all other drugs in the database. Positive <b>dechallenge</b> was reported in 43 cases (72 %). DISCUSSION: All classes of major antihypertensive drugs including ARB were implicated as suspected agents in cases of ED. Few risk factors were identified. The relatively high reporting of ED in association with ARB is in contrast with previous studies, suggesting that ARB have neither a positive nor any effect on ED. This discrepancy suggests that further studies are warrnted on this potential adverse reaction to ARB...|$|E

Among the medications, antidepressants ranked first with 122 ARPMs being notified, followed by neuroleptics (46 ARPMs) and antiepiletic medicaments (25 ARPMs). The three main organs and systems affected by the ARs were the Central Nervous System with 102 ARs, skin and mucosa with 44 and gastrointestinal with 21 ARPMs. CONCLUSION: Considering causality, i. e., the association between the medication and the described AR, 24 cases were considered as Definite (with positive <b>dechallenge</b> and rechallenge, i. e., withdrawal and reintroduction of the medication) and 134 other ARPMs were classified as Probable (only <b>dechallenge</b> positive; only with medication withdrawal; rechallenge was not performed). OBJETIVO: O presente estudo visou analisar 219 notificações de suspeita de reações adversas (RA) produzidas por medicamentos psicoativos (RAMPs), preenchidas por médicos psiquiatras durante um período de três meses (abril de 1995 a setembro de 2001). MÉTODO: Uma ficha para notificação de reações adversas possivelmente produzidas por medicamentos psicoativos era enviada a cada três meses para todos os médicos psiquiatras filiados à Associação Brasileira de Psiquiatria. Uma vez recebida uma destas notificações, devidamente preenchida, a possível reação adversa era analisada para verificação da causalidade. RESULTADOS: Os psiquiatras classificaram como sérias 50 das RAMPs; 150 outras foram consideradas não-sérias. Entre as sérias houve três mortes, 12 relataram risco de vida, 26 RAMPs exigiram ou prolongaram hospitalização e nove notificações descreveram invalidez temporária dos pacientes. Entre os medicamentos, os antidepressivos ficaram em primeiro lugar, com 122 RAMPs notificadas, seguidos dos neurolépticos (46 RAMPs) e anticonvulsivantes (25 RAMPs).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} a long-standing {{controversy}} {{about the possibility that}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants might induce suicidality in some patients. METHODS: Starting from the clinical studies that gave rise to this issue, this paper reviews an unselected cohort of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), a series of meta-analyses undertaken to investigate aspects of the problem, studies in recurrent brief depressive disorders, epidemiological studies and healthy volunteer studies using SSRIs to shed light on this issue. RESULTS: The original clinical studies produced evidence of a dose-dependent link, present on a challenge, <b>dechallenge</b> and rechallenge basis, between SSRIs and both agitation and suicidality. Meta-analyses of RCTs conducted around this time indicate that SSRIs may reduce suicidal ideation in some patients. These same RCTs, however, yield an excess of suicides and suicide attempts on active treatments compared with placebos. This excess also appears in the best-controlled epidemiological studies. Finally, healthy volunteer studies give indications that SSRIs may induce agitation and suicidality in some individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The data reviewed here, which indicate a possible doubling of the relative risk of both suicides and suicide attempts on SSRIs compared with older antidepressants or non-treatment, make it difficult to sustain a null hypothesis, i. e. that SSRIs do not cause problems in some individuals to whom they are given. Further studies or further access to data are indicated to establish the magnitude of any risk and the characteristics of patients who may be most at risk...|$|E

RYR supplements contain monacolin K,which is chemically identical to lovastatin, a licensed drug with a wel l-known risk proﬁle. We aim to describe the safety proﬁle ofRYR by analysing spontaneous repor ts of suspected adverse reactions (ARs). METHODSWithin the Italian Surveillance System of Natural Heal th Products, suspected ARs were c ollected and evaluated by amultidisciplinary gr oup of experts to assess causality using the WHO-UMC system or the CIOMS/RUCAM score, for hepatic re-actions. The public version of the WHO-Vigibase was also queried. RESULTSFrom April 2002 to September 2015, out of 1261 total reports, 52 reports concerning 55 ARs to RYR diet ary suppleme nts werecollected. ARs consisted in myalgia and/or increase in creatine pho sphokinase (19), rhabdomyolysis (1), liver injury (10), gas-trointestinal reactions (12), cutan eous reactions (9) and other reactions (4). Women were involved in 70 % of cases.

40|$|Background: The identification, management, and {{reporting}} of adverse drug reactions are integral to clinical practice and education; however, undergraduate teaching related to adverse drug reactions may be inadequate for practice. Existing methods of causality assessment {{have a number}} of limitations in relation to clinical teaching, for example, they do not deal well with the concurrent use of other medications. Objective: To develop and pilot a teaching tool to guide students through the process of identifying and prioritizing potential causes of an adverse drug reaction. Setting: University-based School of Pharmacy, Australia: an undergraduate Quality Use of Medicines course. Method: A contrived acronym (mnemonic) was developed from causality assessments and discussions with practitioners. The acronym ATTEND DR (abnormality, taken, timeline, evidence, nothing else?, dose, <b>dechallenge,</b> and rechallenge) was piloted in workshops that focussed on adverse drug reactions and their management. Students’ responses to “What did you find most valuable about today’s workshop?” and “How could we improve?” were analyzed. Results: All attendees responded (65 / 65). Students indicated that the ATTEND DR acronym was easy to remember, and facilitated causality assessment in a clinical context, due to an easily followed, step-by-step, comprehensive process that was easy to remember. More practice case studies were requested. Conclusion: The ATTEND DR acronym was designed to address limitations of the existing methods of causality assessment in relation to clinical teaching and preparation of students for future clinical roles. Students responded favorably to its introduction, commenting that it was easily remembered and provided a comprehensive, clinically orientated, step-by-step process.

Subjects and methods: All spontaneously {{reported cases of}} ED submitted to the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) between 1990 and 2006, where at least one antihypertensive drug was the suspected agent, were scrutinized. Patient demographics, drug treatment and adverse reactions were recorded. Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method, the information component (IC) was calculated. Results: Among a total of 225 reports of ED, 59 involved antihypertensive drugs including ARB (9 cases) as suspected agents. A positive IC value was found indicating that ED was reported more often in association with antihypertensive drugs classes, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, compared with all other drugs in the database. Positive <b>dechallenge</b> was reported in 43 cases (72 %). Discussion: All classes of major antihypertensive drugs including ARB were implicated as suspected agents in cases of ED. Few risk factors were identified. The relatively high reporting of ED in association with ARB is in contrast with previous studies, suggesting that ARB have neither a positive nor any effect on ED. This discrepancy suggests that further studies are warrnted on this potential adverse reaction to ARB.

40|$|Many {{patients}} {{either do}} not adhere to, {{or fail to}} persist with, long-term lipid-lowering therapy. This unfavourable medication utilisation behaviour compromises potential treatment benefit. In retrospective studies, patients aged 50 - 65 had the highest adherence rates, while both younger and older patients had lower rates. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease adhere better than those in primary prevention. Financial barriers may impair adherence. At the individual patient level, health beliefs, perceptions of own cardiovascular risk and need for medication, concerns about side-effects and inconvenience of treatment may influence adherence. In clinical trials, regular reminders to patients {{have been shown to}} improve adherence, but each patient will require an individually tailored treatment strategy. Myopathy is the most common clinically relevant adverse effect of statins. The clinical severity of statin myopathy is highly variable, ranging from mild muscle ache to rare instances of rhabdomyolysis. Risk factors for statin myopathy include age, statin dose, hypothyroidism, medications that inhibit statin metabolism, combined statin and fibrate therapy, and renal impairment. Alternative causes of myopathy should be excluded before muscular symptoms are ascribed to statins. The management of statin myopathy is guided by the severity of symptoms and the creatine kinase level. Potential management strategies include statin <b>dechallenge</b> and rechallenge, statin dose reduction, statin switching, non-daily dosing and use of alternative lipid-lowering agents, such as ezetimibe. Statins rarely cause severe liver disease. Mild liver enzyme elevations are seen relatively frequently in patients starting statins, but are usually not clinically important. Patients with persistently elevated liver enzymes should be investigated to determine the cause of liver disease. Patients with stable, well-compensated liver disease can be prescribed statins, provided they are closely monitored...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) of {{the bones}} and joints is rampant in India with the dorsolumbar spine as the most common site of osseous involvement. For diagnosis, {{clinical}} suspicion needs to be confirmed through appropriate laboratory and imaging investigations, and increasingly nowadays, nucleic acid amplification techniques. Chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of management complemented by rest, nutritional support and splinting, as necessary. Operative intervention is required if response to chemotherapy is unsatisfactory and for spinal stabilization. The drugs and regimens are fundamentally similar to those for pulmonary TB. However, there is lack of consensus on the appropriate duration of treatment. The prevailing practice of extending treatment till radiological evidence of healing is complete, may be unnecessary in view of recent reports that 6 - 9 months of therapy is sufficient {{for the majority of}} cases. Relapse rates are not drastically improved by extending treatment to 12 months or even longer, except perhaps in pediatric cases. However, prolonged treatment may be required if surgical debridement is indicated but cannot be done. Multidrug-resistant TB should be suspected if disease activity shows no signs of abating after 4 - 6 months of uninterrupted therapy. These cases are therapeutically challenging and will require second line or experimental antiTB drugs, supported by resistance testing where feasible. Coexistent HIV/AIDS may also necessitate prolonged treatment. Interactions between first line antiTB drugs and antiretroviral medication can complicate matters. Close monitoring is essential in all cases, with <b>dechallenge</b> and cautious reinstitution of drugs in the event of toxicity. While awaiting the arrival of long overdue new antiTB medication, existing drugs and regimens must be used in an informed manner with emphasis on patient compliance...|$|E
40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} is {{a leading cause of}} {{mortality}} in psychiatric patients. Long QT (LQT) is common in this population and predisposes to Torsades-de-Pointes (TdP) and subsequent mortality. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of electrocardiographic screening to detect LQT in psychiatric inpatients. We built a decision analytic model based on a decision tree to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and utility of LQT screening from a health care perspective. LQT proportion parameters were derived from an in-hospital cross-sectional study. We performed experts' elicitation to estimate the risk of TdP, given extent of QT prolongation. A TdP reduction of 65 % after LQT detection was based on positive drug <b>dechallenge</b> rate and through adequate treatment and electrolyte adjustments. The base-case model uncertainty was assessed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, the TdP related mortality and TdP avoidance parameters were varied in a two-way sensitivity analysis to assess their effect on the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Costs, Quality Ajusted Life Year (QALY), ICER, and probability of cost effectiveness thresholds ($ 10, 000, $ 25, 000, and $ 50, 000 per QALY). In the base-case scenario, the numbers of patients needed to screen were 1128 and 2817 to avoid one TdP and one death, respectively. The ICER of systematic ECG screening was $ 8644 (95 %CI, 3144 - 82 498) per QALY. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 96 % at a willingness-to-pay of $ 50, 000 for one QALY. In sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to the case-fatality of TdP episodes and to the TdP reduction following the diagnosis of LQT. In psychiatric hospitals, performing systematic ECG screening at admission help reduce the number of sudden cardiac deaths in a cost-effective fashion...|$|E
40|$|Background: Treatment of {{patients}} with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) {{is one of the}} most complex and urgent problems of rheumatology. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab therapy combined with immunosuppressants in patients with JIA without systemic manifestations. Methods: A monocentre observational comparative study was held. We studied the results of treatment {{of patients}} with JIA being treated with adalimumab combined with immunosuppressants (n = 215) and methotrexate (n = 200). The efficacy of the therapy was evaluated using the paediatric criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACRpedi)  and remission criteria by C. Wallace during 5 years. Results: After 6 and 12 months the remission of articular syndrome was registered in 72 and 81 % of patients treated with adalimumab combined with immunosuppressants, and in 53 and 65 % treated with methotrexate. Laboratory indicators of the disease activity corresponded to the reference values after 6 months in 73 and 48 %, after  12 months — in 94 and 68 % of patients in the comparison groups, respectively. After 6 and 12 months of supervision the activity according to the CHAQ questionnaire was fully recovered in 63 and 79 %; 47 and 62 % of children. After 1 month the improvement according to the ACRpedi 30 / 50 / 70 criteria was registered in 87 / 54 / 25 % of the observed treated with adalimumab. After 6 months the ACRpedi 30 / 50 / 70 index was 93 / 89 / 76 % and 63 / 57 / 47 % for adalimumab therapy with immunosuppressants and methotrexate, respectively. Adalimumab combined with immunosuppressants more quickly than methotrexate induced the stage of inactive disease/remission — after 5 (3; 8) and 12 (6; 18) months, respectively (p < 0. 001). After 6 and 12 months of supervision the stage of inactive disease/remission was reported in 43 and 47 % of patients treated with adalimumab combined with immunosuppressants, and in 9 and 38 % of patients receiving the methotrexate therapy. Adalimumab and methotrexate were well tolerated by 58 and 73 % of patients with JIA without systemic manifestations. The adverse events were reported in 42 and 27 % of patients, but became the reason for drug <b>dechallenge</b> only in 6 and 10 % of patients. Conclusion: Adalimumab combination therapy combined with immunosuppressants has faster and more evident anti-inflammatory effect than the treatment with classical immunosuppressant methotrexate. </p...|$|E
