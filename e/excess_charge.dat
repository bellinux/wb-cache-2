25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and even see the spark as the <b>excess</b> <b>charge</b> is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an <b>excess</b> <b>charge</b> of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{concept for}} insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This {{is similar to}} the time constant τ (tau) within an RC circuit. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static dielectric constant divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/m has an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The <b>excess</b> <b>charge</b> in a fluid dissipates almost completely after four to five times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.|$|E

The copay for outpatient mental health, which started at 50%, is gradually decreasing over several years until it matches the 20% required for other services.

With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE.

25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's <b>excess</b> <b>charge</b> heat.|$|E

Measured streaming currents at high salt concentrations (up to 0. 5 M) varied nonmonotonically with the jet velocity and can be explained by a multipolar charge distribution at the nozzle-water interface. In the case of potassium fluoride no multipolar charge distribution is observed. Electrokinetic potentials were estimated from the streaming currents, under the assumption that all <b>excess</b> <b>charges</b> are confined within the liquid jet.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of charge ratio on the transient network formation of bridged polyelectrolyte complex micelles. The polyelectrolyte complex micelles are based on mixing an ABA triblock copolymer in which the A-blocks are positively charged and the B-block is neutral and hydrophilic, and a negatively charged homopolymer. We investigate the microstructure of our samples with (dynamic) light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, and the mechanical properties by rheometry. At charge stoichiometric conditions, we obtain flowerlike polyelectrolyte complex micelles. These micelles become interconnected at high concentrations, leading to a sample-spanning transient network. For <b>excess</b> negative <b>charge</b> conditions, we obtain so-called ‘soluble complexes’ which are small aggregates carrying the <b>excess</b> negative <b>charge</b> on the polyelectrolyte complex parts. For <b>excess</b> positive <b>charge</b> conditions, micelles stay intact, because the triblock copolymers can localize the <b>excess</b> positive <b>charge</b> at {{the periphery of the}} micellar corona.

50|$|When a gas is {{subjected}} to high voltage stress, the electric field is often quite non-uniform near one, or both, of the high voltage electrodes making up a spark gap. Breakdown initially begins {{with the formation of}} corona discharges near the electrode with the highest electrical stress. If the electrical field is further increased, longer length cold discharges (called streamers or burst corona) sporadically form near the stressed electrode. Streamers are electron avalanches, each one typically lasting only a few nanoseconds. Streamers redistribute charge within the surrounding gas, temporarily forming regions of <b>excess</b> <b>charge</b> (space charges) in the regions surrounding the discharges.|$|E
