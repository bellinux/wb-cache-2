2500|$|Danehill Dancer sired Ave (<b>Flower</b> <b>Bowl</b> Invitational Stakes), Again (Moyglare Stud Stakes and Irish 1,000 Guineas) and Mastercraftsman in 2006. Mastercraftsman won the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes and National Stakes in 2008, and {{was named}} European Champion Two-Year-Old Colt {{at the end of}} the season. After {{finishing}} fifth in the following year's English 2000 Guineas, he went on to win the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St. James's Palace Stakes before retiring to stud. He now stands at Coolmore for a stud fee of €35,000 and has made a good start to his stallion career, siring Kingston Hill and The Grey Gatsby in his first season. Mastercraftsman and Again's wins as three-year-olds helped Danehill Dancer become champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 2009. In 2007, by which time his fee had risen to €115,000, Danehill Dancer produced another five Group or Grade 1 winners with Alfred Nobel (Phoenix Stakes), Lillie Langtry (Coronation Stakes and Matron Stakes), Planteur (Prix Ganay), Steps in Time (Coolmore Classic) and Unaccompanied (Spring Juvenile Hurdle and Istabraq Festival Hurdle). Dancing Rain (foaled 2008) only raced once as two-year-old, but won her first race as a three-year-old, before going on to win the Oaks, Preis der Diana and British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes that season. She stayed in training as a four-year-old, but an injury prevented her from racing until late in the season, when she recorded a third-place finish in the Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes, before finishing eighth in the Hong Kong Vase. In 2010 Danehill Dancer was one of Europe's four most expensive sires. That year he produced Esoterique, who won the Prix Rothschild in 2014. His 2012 fee was €60,000 and his 2013 fee was reduced to €40,000. From 2010, Danehill Dancer's fertility began to decline. He did not get any mares in foal during 2014, and was subsequently retired from stud duty. Following his retirement Christy Grassick, a Coolmore manager, said: [...] "Starting out at a lowly fee he continually upgraded his mares and ultimately became a major force in European and Australian breeding." [...] As well as being champion sire in 2009, Danehill Dancer has also been the leading sire of two-year-olds on three occasions.|$|E
