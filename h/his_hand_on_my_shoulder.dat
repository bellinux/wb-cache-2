60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{just as he}} {{had done}} at Freeport.|$|E
60|$|He {{laughed and}} put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> as he bade me good night.|$|E
60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and gave}} me a slight turn, {{pointing}} with his other arm at the same time.|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Cuff {{stopped short}} in the dark, and laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|Waster Lunny {{pulled his}} chair nearer me and rested <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees.|$|R
60|$|Betteredge laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm, {{and stopped}} me before I could say any more.|$|R
60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I shuddered at {{the thought}} that for {{anything}} I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker {{rose to his}} feet. He put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He was {{the very}} {{prototype}} of the self-respecting, conscientious, prospective father- in-law.|$|E
6000|$|This {{state of}} happy {{unconsciousness}} had scarcely lasted--it seemed to me--two minutes, when I {{was awakened by}} Peterkin laying <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stood there}} fidgeting {{about for a}} bit, and then he puts <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he came to}} {{the library}} where I was moping, and laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|R
60|$|He {{shook out}} his pipe, and getting {{down from his}} high seat laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee.|$|R
6000|$|But {{he stole}} {{up to us}} again, and {{suddenly}} clapping <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Treated Duncan? Oh, pshaw! This is {{far more}} serious affair than a boy's quarrel. Don't let him escape, Parsons"-- the last to the constable, who had <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Indian stalked away as before, {{and when}} he was gone Jacob, who, with Sergeant Corney, had come up to hear what was being said, laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> affectionately.|$|E
60|$|Cavor {{came to my}} {{side and}} laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. <b>His</b> pale and terrified face was ghastly in the blue light.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, my dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, {{sticking}} {{his hair}} upright with both hands, and then putting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees, 'I am married!' ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked long at my boots--a pair of Russia leather, and {{his face}} seemed to regain steadiness. Putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> instep, he said: ...|$|R
60|$|He rose, declaring it {{was past}} his hour for bed, and added some kind things which I shall cherish in my memory. As he was leaving he laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|And then he bade {{them get}} the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch, with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> leaving {{them in a}} disarray, and silenced by his {{volubility}} rather than convinced.|$|E
6000|$|Our eyes met, but I {{could not}} stand his inquiring glance and looked down. He came to me, and sitting {{on the arm of}} my chair, put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and said affectionately,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|As I turned away, {{one of the}} gentlemen, a victim, {{noted for}} his {{sporting}} propensities, followed me, and laying <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, asked:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By the by, Wickfield,' he said, {{stopping}} in a passage with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder; 'you {{have not found}} any suitable provision for my wife's cousin yet?' ...|$|R
6000|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee; <b>his</b> wan kind eyes {{considered}} me, and I {{thought he}} was going to say “You’re very young!” But he only brought out: “You’ve got used to Europe anyway!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "Pye," [...] says he, [...] "there's worse {{men than}} you in loftier places. They shall 'ave it. None the less," [...] he remarks, [...] "the ice is undeniably packing." ...|$|E
60|$|Plain it {{was that}} my friend felt uncomfortable; he shifted {{from one foot to}} another, and a cloud darkened his brow. But his blue eyes burned with a warm light as he put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I was abashed by his [...] "bourdes," [...] {{and could}} say nought, for, being still very weak, the tears {{came into my}} eyes. Then he drew near me, limping, and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> but very gently, saying-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see where}} the joke comes in there either!" [...] I said, and I did not feel {{particularly}} pleased with him for saying such things. He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm, and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I put my broom agin the wall, and {{we walked}} round to the Bull’s Head like a couple o’ brothers. We ’ad two pints apiece, and then he put <b>his</b> <b>’and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} and talked as man to man.|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> friend laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee; {{he looked}} at me for some moments, and I {{thought he was going to}} say, [...] "You are very young!" [...] But he said presently, [...] "YOU have got used to Europe any way!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He evaded my proffered {{friendship}} with a blunt proposal {{to rejoin the}} mess; and yet a moment later contrived to alleviate the snub. For, as we entered the smoking-room, he laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> with a kind familiarity-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{she came}} near, my father stopped short, and laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{with such a}} grasp that I nearly cried out. I looked up in surprise, and never before saw such an {{expression}} of eager inquiry on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Assist him? What {{else have}} I done with every stroke of my pen? I've shouted my {{intention}} in his great blank face!" [...] At this, laughing out again, Vereker laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{to show the}} allusion wasn't to my personal appearance.|$|E
60|$|There were Raphaels there, {{which still}} {{disappointed}} me, because from Raphael I asked and expected more. I wished to feel <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> soul with a stronger grasp; these were too passionless in their serenity, and almost effeminate in their tenderness.|$|R
60|$|He listened gravely {{and made}} no answer. But when I opened to him my mind as to Mr. Burns he sat down by my side, and, laying <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee amicably, begged me to think what it was I was exposing myself to.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that at once. If true, it'll be terrible for Mercedes and me. But Rojas will never get <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> wife. If I can't kill him, I'll kill her!... Belding, this is tough on you--this risk we put upon your family. I regret--" ...|$|R
