40|$|A compact imaging detector, {{based on}} {{scintillation}} fiber optics, {{has been used}} for high resolution industrial radiography since 1996. This type of imaging detectors have proven to give superior performance compared to fine grained industrial x-ray film in terms of detection efficiency and spatial resolution. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show that the radiographic sensitivity can be improved even further. First, the detection process has been studied by Monte-Carlo simulations and the result shows that the radiation is detected in a very narrow range from the axis of the primary beam. Secondary, Monte-Carlo simulations shows that a bent fiber optic <b>image</b> <b>conduit</b> can eliminate radiation induced noise in the CCD almost completely and reduce the depth of the detector to less then 100 mm...|$|E
40|$|A spectrally {{selective}} {{imaging system}} has been developed to obtain a distribution of Hα emissions at the extraction region in a hydrogen negative ion source. The diagnostic system consisted of an aspherical lens, optical filters, a fiber <b>image</b> <b>conduit,</b> and a charge coupled device detector was installed on the 1 / 3 -scaled hydrogen negative ion source in the National Institute for Fusion Science. The center of sight line passes beside the plasma grid (PG) surface with the distance of 11 mm, and the viewing angle has coverage 35 mm from the PG surface. Two dimensional Hα distribution in the range {{up to 20 mm}} from the PG surface was clearly observed. The reduction area for Hα emission caused by beam extraction was widely distributed in the extraction region near the PG surface...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{recording}} of transmembrane voltage changes {{with the use}} of potentiometric dyes has opened the possibility of determining spatial patterns of electrical activity in excitable tissues. To follow such activation patterns on the cellular/subcellular level in heart cell cultures, a recording system was developed that features both high spatial resolution (4 - 200 microm) and high temporal resolution (uncertainty in the determination of delays between fast rising signals of +/- 1 micros). Central to the system is a fiber optic <b>image</b> <b>conduit</b> consisting of 379 individual optical fibers. At one end the fibers are fused to form an input window that matches the size of the field of view of the microscope. At the other end, the fibers are loose, permitting a selectable subset to be connected to 80 discrete photodetectors. This design allows the sensitive area of the imager to be adapted to regions of interest in a given preparation, thus making optimal use of the limited number of detectors. Furthermore, by using a second fiber optic imager, individual photodetectors can be assigned to different optical ports, thus providing the means for fast and simultaneous dual-emission wavelength measurements. This feature permitted the elimination of motion artifacts arising from the myocytes without the use of contraction-suppressing drugs...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal of volcano seismology is {{to understand}} the dynamics of active magmatic systems {{in order to assess}} eruptive behavior and the associated hazard. <b>Imaging</b> of magma <b>conduits,</b> quantification of magma transport and investigation of long-period seismic sources, together with their temporal variations, are crucial for the comprehension of eruption-triggering mechanisms. At Mt. Etna volcano, several intense episodes of tremor activity were recorded during 2007, in association with strombolian activity and/or intense fire fountaining episodes occurring from the South East Crater (SEC). The locations of the tremor sources and of the long-period seismic events are used here to constrain both the area and the depth range of magma degassing, highlighting the geometry of the shallow conduits feeding SEC. The <b>imaged</b> <b>conduits</b> consist of two connected resonating dike-like bodies, NNW-SSE and NW-SE oriented, extending from sea level to the surface. In addition, we show how tremor, long-period (LP) and very-long-period (VLP) event locations and signatures reflect pressure fluctuations in the plumbing system associated with the ascent/discharge of gas-rich magma linked to the lava fountains. The evidence here reported, also corroborated by ground deformation variations, can help develop a better prediction and early-warning system for those eruptions (effusive or explosive) that apparently manifest no clear precursors...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} optical changes {{associated with}} crustacean nerve stimulation using birefringent and large angle scattered light. Improved detection schemes disclosed high temporal {{structure of the}} optical signals and allowed further investigations of biophysical mechanisms responsible for such changes. Most studies of physiological activity in neuronal tissue use techniques that measure the electrical behavior or ionic permeability of the nerve, such as voltage or ion sensitive dyes injected into cells, or invasive electric recording apparatus. While these techniques provide high resolution, they are detrimental to tissue and do not easily lend themselves to clinical applications in humans. Electrical and chemical components of neural excitation evoke physical responses observed through changes in scattered and absorbed light. This method is suited for in-vivo applications. Intrinsic optical changes have shown themselves to be multifaceted in nature and point to several different physiological processes that occur with different time courses during neural excitation. Fast changes occur concomitantly with electrical events, and slow changes parallel metabolic events including changes in blood flow and oxygenation. Previous experiments with isolated crustacean nerves {{have been used to}} study the biophysical mechanisms of fast optical changes. However, they have been confounded by multiple superimposed action potentials which make it difficult to discriminate the temporal signatures of individual optical responses. Often many averages were needed to adequately resolve the signal. More recently, optical signals have been observed in single trials. Initially large angle scattering measurements were used to record these events with much of the signal coming from cellular swelling associated with water influx during activation. By exploiting the birefringent properties derived from the molecular stiucture of nerve membranes, signals appear larger with a greater contrast, but direct comparison of birefringent and 90 {sup o} scattering signals has not been reported. New developments in computer and optical technology allow optical recording with higher temporal resolution than could be achieved previously. This has led us to undertake more detailed studies of the biophysical mechanisms underlying these transient changes. Optimization of this technology in conjunction with other technical developments presents a path to noninvasive dynamic clinical observation of optical responses. To conduct these optical recordings, we placed dissected leg, claw and ventral cord nerves from crayfish and lobster in a recording chamber constructed from black Delrin. The chamber consisted of several wells situated perpendicularly to the long axis of the nerve that could beelectrically isolated for stimulating and recording electrical activation, and a window in the center for optical measurements. To measure the birefringence from the nerve, light from a 120 W halogen bulb was focused onto the nerve from below the window through a 10 X microscope objective and polarized at a 45 degree angle with respect to the long axis of the nerve bundle. A second polarizer turned 90 degrees with respect to the first polarizer was placed on top of the chamber and excluded direct source illumination, passing only birefringent light from the nerve. A large area photodiode placed directly on top of the polarizer detected the magnitude of the birefringent light. To measure light scattered 90 degrees by the nerve, a short length of <b>image</b> <b>conduit</b> placed perpendicularly to the nerve directed large angle scattered light from the nerve to a second photodiode. The output of each photodiode was amplified by a first stage amplifier which produced a DC level output, and was coupled to an AC amplifier (0. 3 Hz High Pass) with a gain of 1000 to optimally record changes across time...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} {{direction of}} the (mis) use of information technologies founded on the deceptively secular rationalised heritage of scientism, arguably spells the increasing proximity to a dystopian nightmare that is far from mere fiction and imbued with the eternal religious symbolic of the battle between good and evil, as depicted in the 2010 science fiction film Tron: Legacy. The historical contextualisation {{of events in the}} film reveals the promise of the unfolding of an advanced sensibility alongside these concerns, in which fantasy and science converge to liberate humanity from an increasingly limiting worldview, and information and <b>images</b> serve as <b>conduits</b> to the sacred. The critical role information stands to play in humanity’s conscious evolution is outlined in the proposed development of a “dream systems theory”, where dreams capes are defined as interconnected systems of imaginal data...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} S-velocity {{model of the}} North Atlantic region, revealing structural features in unprecedented detail down {{to a depth of}} 1300. km. The model is derived using full-waveform tomography. More specifically, we minimise the instantaneous phase misfit between synthetic and observed body- as well as surface-waveforms iteratively in a full three-dimensional, adjoint inversion. Highlights of the model in the upper mantle include a well-resolved Mid-Atlantic Ridge and two distinguishable strong low-velocity regions beneath Iceland and beneath the Kolbeinsey Ridge west of Jan Mayen. A sub-lithospheric low-velocity layer is imaged beneath much of the oceanic lithosphere, consistent with the long-wavelength bathymetric high of the North Atlantic. The low-velocity layer extends locally beneath the continental lithosphere of the southern Scandinavian Mountains, the Danish Basin, part of the British Isles and eastern Greenland. All these regions experienced post-rift uplift in Neogene times, for which the underlying mechanism is not well understood. The spatial correlation between the low-velocity layer and uplifted regions suggests dynamic support by low-density asthenosphere originating from the Iceland and Jan Mayen hotspots. Our model further suggests a lower-mantle source for the Iceland and Jan Mayen hotspots. Two distinguishable low-velocity <b>conduits</b> are <b>imaged,</b> connecting the upper-mantle anomalies beneath Iceland and Jan Mayen into the lower mantle. Both conduits are tilted to the South-East, reflecting the westward motion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The location of the <b>imaged</b> Iceland <b>conduit</b> is in agreement with the observation of a locally thinned transition zone south of Iceland from receiver function studies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Complete {{myocardial}} revascularization is {{the gold}} standard {{in the treatment of}} multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the success of this procedure is limited by low patency of venous grafts. Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) is the conduit with best patency and best clinical results. For this reason in the last years the use of arterial conduits as radial artery is increased. The aim {{of this study is to}} value patency of radial artery by-pass graft used in composite conduits at mid term follow up. Methods: 50 patients who underwent from January to March 2008 to surgical off pump revascularization with composite arterial conduits were studied with 64 -slices Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT). Mean number of grafts was 2. 5; Index of Completeness of Revascularization (ICOR) was 0. 95 %. We studied 104 conduits (49 LIMA; 52 R. A.; 3 RIMA), 50 composite grafts (4 K graft; 42 Y graft; 2 π graft; 2 I conduit), 94 distal anastomosis, 40 Safenous Vein Grafts (SVG). Results: <b>Images</b> of 2 <b>conduits</b> were not diagnostic and role out from the study (1. 8 %). 100 grafts (99. 9 %) were patent. Two graft were proximall...|$|R
40|$|In the CRIMEA project {{submarine}} gas emitting {{sites in}} the Black Sea are investigated in order to quantify methane transfer through the water column into the atmosphere. One target area is the Dvurechenskii mud volcano (DMV) in the Sorokin Trough south-east of the Crimea peninsula. The occurrence of gas hydrates and high methane concentrations in the sediment of this mud volcano are known. A seismic wide-angle experiment was performed at the DMV with twelve Ocean Bottom Hydrophones and Seismometers and a GI gun source with frequencies around 100 Hz. By using Kirchhoff depth migration the seismogram sections are transformed to images, which extent to 4 km laterally and 600 metres in depth. The <b>images</b> show the <b>conduit</b> of the DMVand the nearby sediment layers. The DMV has a diameter of 800 - 1000 m at the sea floor and its conduit has the same form and diameter up to 600 m depth. Several plane sediment layers are disrupted by the conduit, and strong reflectors are identified in 100 m and 400 m depth in the conduit. The lower bowl shaped reflectors are interpreted as collapsed parts of the disrupted sediment layers, which sunk in the lighter material of the conduit. This is also a {{possible explanation for the}} upper reflections. Compressional wave velocities are obtained from Kirchhoff migration, and the model is refined by using seismic ray tracing. Bulk density and shear wave velocity can also be obtained by analyzing the data. With the help of these elastic parameters and by using the Frenkel-Gassmann theory, the free gas saturation of the sediment pore space and the gas hydrate saturation can be quantified...|$|R
