Georgia {{was reported to}} have used cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing via the main <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> and admitted using cluster bombs against Russian troops and near the Roki Tunnel. Russia denied using cluster bombs.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{controversial}} incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari {{was unable to}} put up a challenge regularly to Senna's frontrunning McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the <b>escape</b> <b>road.</b> Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon recorded the fastest lap, ahead of Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe, the Andretti Autosport car of Tony Kanaan and Briscoe's teammate Will Power. Due to the slippery {{nature of the}} circuit, drivers were caught out and ended up inflicting damage to their cars. Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position. Other drivers to hit the wall included Romancini and Milka Duno. Incidents continued in the second practice session, with no less than five drivers spinning or making {{contact with the outside}} retaining walls. The session saw the same top four drivers as the first session.|$|E

50|$|Seeding of {{the grounds}} was {{unsatisfactory}} or had not been done, and dust enveloped everything and everyone. Earth embankments lined much of the course and several turns did not offer <b>escape</b> <b>roads.</b> The weekend was marred by a fatal accident during Race Three.|$|R
50|$|Of course, {{itinerary}} in {{the shape}} from 2003 to 2007 wouldn’t be enough to form the required at that time 340-380 km of special stages for WRC event, so the searching for new stages (with alternative and <b>escape</b> <b>roads)</b> was the main objective to the organizers, which FIA’s experts appointed.|$|R
5|$|DRS was enabled on lap 46, as Barrichello and Rosberg were contesting eighth position. Button {{had caught}} Maldonado and Alguersuari, and passed both cars for tenth place. Mark Webber {{was the first}} driver to switch to slick tyres, and was {{followed}} by Barrichello and Buemi. Kobayashi and Massa, fighting for second place, were both passed by Schumacher on lap 51; Massa then passed Kobayashi for third place. As the drivers pitted for slick tyres {{over the next three}} laps, Massa damaged his wing forcing him into another pitstop, while damage to Adrian Sutil's car led to his retirement. Button had risen from ninth after his pit-stop to fourth, and was catching the leading trio of Vettel, Schumacher and Webber. On lap 56 Heidfeld, while battling Kobayashi for fifth place, collided with the rear of the Sauber which damaged his front wing. The wing then detached and folded under the car, and Heidfeld after losing control of his car ran down an <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> on turn 3. The debris on-track from the accident called the sixth safety car period of the race.|$|E
5|$|The race ended after Paul di Resta {{crashed on}} the start/finish {{straight}} {{shortly before the}} end, bringing out the safety car once again until {{the conclusion of the}} race. Caterham's Vitaly Petrov took 11th position which meant his team overtook Marussia in the Constructors' Championship. Former world champion Kimi Räikkönen had an eventful race as well, almost crashing into Vettel after the start and later trying to use an <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> only to find it to be a dead end. He later stated the way had been open 11 years prior, having made the same manoeuver at the 2001 race. He also had a close contest with the retiring Michael Schumacher, who finished seventh after recovering from an early puncture, but gave up sixth to Vettel in order to help him extend his small point advantage over Fernando Alonso in the championship.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} hot and dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third session, setting a time of 1:20.762; Barrichello ended with the third quickest lap time. Häkkinen set a time one-tenth of a second slower than Michael Schumacher and was second fastest. Alesi continued to run quicker and was fourth fastest, faster than Coulthard and Frentzen. Irvine, Trulli, Fisichella and Johnny Herbert completed the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:20.405 though he ran down the <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> at Ste Devote and his engine subsequently stalled. Michael Schumacher was second fastest, nearly one-tenth slower than Coulthard. Fisichella opted to use a softer damper and set the third quickest lap, in front of Trulli and Häkkinen. Barrichello, Alesi, Wurz, Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten fastest drivers ahead of qualifying. A crash by Irvine at the swimming pool complex ended his session prematurely.|$|E

25|$|After pitting for repairs, Senna {{worked his}} way past both Williams and the Benettons to take a three-second victory. However, his altercation with Prost seven laps earlier meant he had missed the chicane and, {{according}} to FIA and FISA president Jean Marie Balestre, had not completed the lap. It {{is worth noting that}} many drivers in previous races had used the <b>escape</b> <b>roads</b> near chicanes after on-track incidents, as is customary, without receiving penalties. He was disqualified and Nannini revelled in his first grand prix victory. The new Williams FW13s finished second and third, putting them five points ahead of the Ferrari team in the race for second.|$|R
50|$|Valtteri Bottas set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} first half-hour free {{practice}} session that was held prior to the first qualifying session, but he and defending race-winner Edoardo Mortara were split by just 0.01 seconds. Mortara's team-mate Laurens Vanthoor completed the session in third place, marginally faster than Bottas' team-mate Roberto Merhi, with Carlos Huertas completing the top five, just over a second off the pace. Renger van der Zande rounded out the top six, in a crash-filled session with four drivers - Daniel Abt, Felix Rosenqvist, Rio Haryanto and Kimiya Sato - hitting the wall, with William Buller and Michael Ho also having excursions down <b>escape</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, {{more than a}} second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the <b>escape</b> <b>road,</b> and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E
5|$|On the {{division}} right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, {{on the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the <b>escape</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casino Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the <b>escape</b> <b>road.</b> Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{organizational}} problems, extra practice {{planned for}} Thursday was cancelled, {{and the first}} qualifying session on Friday had to be postponed. There was time for only a one-hour practice session on Friday, and so qualifying would take place on Saturday in two one-hour sessions, four hours apart. Saturday was cold and overcast with a very real threat of rain, and nearly all the drivers scrambled to get a time in on the dry track while they could, with lots of spins and trips down the <b>escape</b> <b>roads</b> of the unfamiliar circuit. The afternoon session was wet throughout, as expected, and the times from the morning session did indeed determine the grid.|$|R
50|$|Detroit {{got off to}} a bad {{start in}} 1982 due to {{organization}} problems. Practice planned for Thursday was cancelled, and the first qualifying session on Friday had to be postponed.

5|$|Minutes {{before the}} race start, reports of rain falling on the track caused the start to be delayed by around ten minutes. Race control {{eventually}} deemed the race to be dry enough {{to be called a}} dry race, thus the rain tyres were not necessary, but would be required later in the race. Dario Franchitti and Alex Tagliani led the field to the line, with the circuit still being dusty from the previous night's repair work. Dust clouds engulfed the start-finish straight, blinding many of the midfield runners. The top five runners managed to negotiate the first chicane cleanly, while behind, half a dozen cars were involved in a first-corner crash. Takuma Sato misjudged his braking into the first corner and clipped the rear of Will Power's Penske machine, which spun him into Scott Dixon. Hélio Castroneves could not avoid running into Dixon's stationary car at the first corner. After many drivers went down the <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> to avoid being involved in the crash, a separate accident took place between Marco Andretti and Mario Moraes. Moraes lost control of his KV Racing Technology car behind Ana Beatriz, hit Andretti and became airborne before coming to rest across the cockpit of Andretti's car. It took several minutes to extricate Andretti from his damaged machinery, but was uninjured and very critical of Moraes' driving. The crash resulted in a seven-lap caution period, and eliminated Sato, Moraes and Andretti from the race. Dixon and Castroneves both recovered to the pit lane to repair damage.|$|E
25|$|Sutil dived past Ericsson at the Loews hairpin to {{move into}} 16th on lap 13, as drivers {{struggled}} to keep heat in their tyres. The time deficit between Rosberg and Hamilton varied but held a larger advantage {{over the rest of}} the field. Sutil continued to move up the field after passing Chilton at the Novelle chicane to take over 15th on the 17th lap. Rosberg locked his tyres heavily driving into Mirabeau corner but the German driver avoided going into the turn's <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> on lap 18. Shortly afterwards, the stewards issued five-second stop-and-go penalties to Chilton, Ericsson and Gutiérrez for being out of position on the starting grid. Hamilton started to lap faster than teammate Rosberg before the latter responded by going two-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton to extend his lead. Ricciardo closed to within 1.1 seconds of Räikkönen by lap 22 upon going one second faster than Räikkönen. Cresting a rise leaving the tunnel on the 24th lap, Sutil's car became light under braking from , speared into the inside barrier, and slid down the <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> at the Novelle chicane. A marshal ducked under the barrier to avoid getting struck by debris. Sutil was unhurt but the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to remove debris from the track.|$|E
25|$|Katayama {{went out}} on lap 39 with gearbox failure and sixth place went to his {{teammate}} Mark Blundell. However, Blundell's engine failed two laps later, spreading oil across the track. Schumacher slid and nearly hit a wall while Berger went down an <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> and dropped behind Brundle. Fittipaldi retired on lap 48 with a gearbox failure. During the second stops, Andrea de Cesaris {{was able to get}} ahead of an exhausted Alesi who was struggling with neck pain. Schumacher won ahead of Brundle, Berger, de Cesaris, Alesi and Michele Alboreto.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was later}} added, in Nicephorus Phocas's {{military}} manual, that should the Saracen force only {{be caught up}} to {{by the time it}} was retreating laden with plunder then that the army's infantry should set upon them at night from three sides, leaving the only <b>escape</b> the <b>road</b> back to their land. It was deemed most likely that the startled Saracens would in all speed retreat rather than stay and fight to defend their plunder.|$|R
25|$|At the start, {{with the}} first two grid {{positions}} left empty and painted with the Brazilian and Austrian flags, {{out of respect for}} Senna and Ratzenberger (Williams and Simtek not fielding their second cars for the race), Hill got ahead of Berger and attacked Häkkinen into the first corner. There was contact and both spun off into the <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> and were out. Schumacher was leading ahead of Berger, Alesi, Fittipaldi, Brundle and Katayama. Schumacher pulled away while Brundle used a good strategy during the stops, pitting earlier than the others to get ahead of Fittipaldi and Alesi.|$|E
25|$|Alan Jones was duelling with Ronnie Peterson and Carlos Reutemann when he spun {{into the}} catch fencing. Reutemann {{suffered}} from tyre problems and lost a lap, whilst John Watson suffered excess power and {{took to the}} <b>escape</b> <b>road.</b> Vittorio Brambilla retired with a damper problem, Wilson Fittipaldi blew his engine, and Jacky Ickx, Mark Donohue and Carlos Pace all broke their driveshafts. Mass was in rapid pursuit of Hunt and Lauda – by the last lap he was only 2.4 seconds behind them. However, a superb lapping manoeuvre gave Hunt the space he needed. On the last corner, Lauda slid offline, but held on to win by 1.6 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Early on, as Senna {{was pulling}} away from Prost, Alesi got past Patrese for fourth. However, Patrese repassed him on lap 16 and closed up on Mansell. He {{attacked}} on lap 22 but shot into an <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> and rejoined behind Alesi and Berger. He quickly closed up on them with Berger attacking Alesi but unable to pass. Patrese passed Berger on lap 34. On the next lap, Mansell's gearbox failed and soon afterward, on lap 36, Berger had fuel pump trouble, which forced him to retire. Patrese then passed Alesi who pitted on lap 43. He closed in on Prost and the Ferrari pitted on lap 46, with right rear troubles putting him down to seventh.|$|E

25|$|Behind Senna, Patrese was {{involved}} in two successive three-way battles. First, after getting back by Alesi for fourth on lap 16, Patrese closed on Mansell who was immediately behind Prost. By lap 22, Patrese {{was close enough to}} attack his Williams team-mate but overshot onto the <b>escape</b> <b>road,</b> as Mansell swerved to avoid him. Upon rejoining, Patrese quickly latched onto Alesi and Berger, as the new three-car train now covered fourth through sixth places. Patrese had gotten past Berger when, suddenly, two of the top six runners retired on consecutive laps. On lap 35, Mansell pulled over when the Williams's new semi-automatic gearbox failed, and on the next time around, Berger's race ended as well.|$|E
25|$|Senna took pole, but Prost {{beat him}} away from the grid and led by 1.4seconds {{by the end of the}} first lap. By lap 15, however, Senna was all over the back of Prost's McLaren after moving through both Williams and Benettons. He whittled down Prost's 5 second lead to just under a second by lap 30, but the latter pulled a few seconds ahead by the 35th lap. By the end of lap 46, with 7 to go, the gap was just over a second. Senna, further back than he had been earlier in the race, made a move on Prost in the chicane before the start-finish straight. True to his word, Prost closed the gap and the two skidded into the <b>escape</b> <b>road</b> and both engines stalled. Prost jumped from his car. Senna, however, got a push from the marshals and {{returned}} to the track.|$|E
25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing {{what he had to do}} to keep his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa <b>escape</b> <b>road.</b> Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E

5000|$|A {{new rule}} change for 1998 allowed cars {{to return to}} the garage area to make repairs and {{subsequently}} re-enter the race. Previously, all repairs (whether major or minor) had {{to be done in the}} pit area only. Prior to 1998, any car that crossed the entrance to Gasoline Alley was ruled out of the race, regardless of its condition. Likewise, any stalled car towed back to the garage area through <b>escape</b> <b>roads</b> in the infield (instead of around the track itself) was ruled out of the race, even if the issue was something as harmless as running out of fuel (that aspect of the rule was the source of controversy in the 1972 race with Jim Hurtubise). The repair rule change was made at the request of teams, which considered it a safety measure, as well as a fair way to allow more cars to finish the race. Pit crew members working for extended periods of time on the actual pit lane felt exposed to injuries/accidents from other cars entering and exiting the pits literally inches away. It also allowed them access to necessary tools and allowed them to make major repairs. This new rule was similar in practice to the policy that NASCAR had, where cars are allowed to [...] "go behind the wall" [...] to make repairs and re-enter the competition. A limit was enforced, however, such that no car could make repairs and re-enter the race after the leaders completed 190 laps.|$|R
