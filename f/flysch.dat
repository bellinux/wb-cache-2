25|$|A third type of basin exists along {{convergent}} plate boundaries – {{places where}} one tectonic plate moves under another into the asthenosphere. The subducting plate bends and forms a fore-arc basin {{in front of}} the overriding plate—an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called <b>flysch.</b> When the convergent movement of the two plates results in continental collision, the basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland basin. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a mountain belt in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called molasse and has either a shallow marine or a continental facies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{developed}} a 3 -D structural {{model of a}} key area in the southwestern Alps, at {{the boundary between the}} external and internal zones. Six geological bodies are analyzed: internal and external basements, Briançonnais and Piemontais zones (internal sedimentary cover nappes), exotic <b>flyschs,</b> and external sedimentary cover. 3 D volumes of each geological body are modeled using the structural map of the area projected on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and 5 cross-sections. The global model is interpolated from the map, DEM, and cross sections, using the potential field method, and represented by a Voronoï diagram. The final 3 D-model is used as a structural frame to plot the earthquakes of the GéoFrance 3 D database, allowing to precisely and quantitatively investigate the relationships between crustal structures and current seismic activity of the belt. The boundary between external and internal zones corresponds to the so-called Crustal Penninic Thrust (CPT), which is a former Oligocene major thrust.

40|$|Abstract: Late Cretaceous mixed carbonate-siliciclastic, thin-bedded turbidites {{occur between}} the two great {{sandstone}} packages of theMauretanian Series (the Tisir~ne and the B 6 ni Ider sandstone <b>flyschs,</b> of early Cretaceous and late Oligocene-early Burdigalian age, respectively). The application of the facies tract-facies sequence model allows subdivision f the studied calciturbidites intofive distinct facies sequences (FS. 1 - 5), which equal five transgressive-regressive faci s cycles. These cycles mainly consist of thinning upward calciturbidites, which almost all start with coarse-grained carbonate breccias, and passing upward into a shale-dominated interval. Fe-stained discontinuities, together with sedimentological and ichnological ev dence, lead us to assign these two lithological components toa transgressive and a regressive trend, respectively. This result provides n w insights into the sequence-stratigraphic interpretation of turbiditic successions. Shallow-water-derived calciturbidites, which fringe carbonate platforms and pelagic seamounts, may record tectonic, eustatic and/or climatic events {{that occurred in the}} neighbouring source areas.

40|$|Available {{surface and}} {{industrial}} subsurface data {{provide the basis}} for a general balanced cross-section from the Sahara platform to the Mediterranean Sea in central Algeria. This section gives an overview of the whole Maghrebian orogen comprising from south to north the following structural domains: the intra-continental Atlas system; the External Tell system, deriving from the African palaeo-margin; the <b>Flyschs</b> domain, representing the cover of the former oceanic domain and, finally, the Kabylides domain of European affinities. Restoration of the southern segment of the section, comprising the Atlas and External Tell systems, yields a minimum value of 40 km (20 %) of horizontal shortening. For this part of the section, a four-step kinematic scenario, built using the THRUSTPACK software, illustrates the main stages of the deformation history: (1) Late Eocene 'Atlas' deformation pulse, (2) Early Miocene deposition of a thick flexural sequence, (3) Middle-Late Miocene emplacement of the Tell nappes and (4) Late Miocene to present out-of-sequence thrusting. On this basis, a conceptual geodynamic model is proposed for the whole Maghrebian orogen. After the Atlas event, which just preceded the roll-back of the Tethyan slab, the model emphasises the role of subduction responsible for: (1) flexuration of the subducting plate (slab pull effect), (2) development of both accretionary prism and back-arc basin, and (3) late uplift linked to slab break-off. © 2005 Académie des sciences.

40|$|Introduction Mineral {{composition}} of source rock {{is one of}} the most important factors for concentration and distribution of heavy metals in sediments. Therefore, study on distribution of these elements and the related minerals in sediments provides information about natural origin of elements. Moreover, the interpretation of origin and distribution of sandy sediments is considerably enhanced by mineralogical and geochemical studies of these sediments. The main objective of this research is to evaluate distribution of Zn, Cu, Sr, Cd, Fe and Mn in sand sediments of the Oman Sea, their relationship with mineral {{composition of}} the sediments and also determining their provenance. Materials and Methods Sampling of surface sediments of the Oman Sea was performed in 16 sampling stations. Heavy minerals and rock fragments of the sediments in fine and coarse sand sizes respectively were qualitatively and quantitatively studied by polarizing microscope (Folk, 1974; Pettijohn et al., 1981; Tucker, 1988). Concentration of the heavy metals were also analyzed by AAS method (Mico et al., 2008). Result Mineralogical composition of the studied sediments contain quartz, feldspars and heavy minerals in their order of abundances. The rock fragments consist of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic in their order of frequencies as well. The concentrations of the studied heavy metals (in ppm) in the sediments are Cd (1. 42), Cu (9. 99), Zn (36. 72), Sr (181. 18), Mn (377. 33) and Fe (20247. 55) in their order of abundances. Distribution of the Zn concentration generally shows decreasing trend from west of the study area to the Guatr Bay. The concentrations of Zn and Cu show close relationship with the frequencies of biotite and muscovite. The Cu concentration also shows positive correlation with the Zn and Fe concentrations. Distribution of the Sr and Cd concentrations is similar to variation of the calcium carbonate content. The Cd and Sr concentrations also show positive correlation with each other and the calcium carbonate content of the sediments. A close relationship is also observed between the concentrations of Fe and Mn elements and the total amount of heavy minerals. Among the heavy minerals existing in the samples, biotite has the closest relationship with Fe and Mn. Among the rock fragments existing in the sediments, the amount of granitic rock fragments also has a very similar trend to variation of these two elements especially Fe. Discussion According to presence of Fe and Mn in structure of many heavy minerals such as biotite (Mange and Wright, 2007; Bradl, 2005), their main provenance can be biotite-bearing granites of Ghalaman complex, granodiorites existing in the ophiolite-melanges and the gabbros located in north of the Fanuch area mostly transported to the Oman Sea via the Rabech and Bahookalat water drainage basins. The clastic carbonate grains were mostly transported to the Oman Sea by Rabech and Sergan-Mochgar watersheds to the Oman Sea. Biotite and muscovite could mainly originate from the granodiorite, granite, ophiolite-melange gabbro and the Eocene <b>flysches</b> of northeast of the region. The main provenance of Zn could be granodiorites and gabbros existing in the Iranshahr ophiolites and <b>flysches.</b> According to close relationship between Cu and muscovite, provenance of this element can be granites, pegmatites and schists existing in the ophiolites and <b>flysches</b> of the region. Therefore, Zn and Cu are mostly transported to the Oman Sea and Guatr Bay via Bahookalat River. Provenance of Sr and Cd are mainly the Fanuch and Chabahar carbonate formations. According to the enrichment factor (Sutherland, 2000) of the studied elements, the sediments are extra-highly to very highly enriched in Cd. The enrichment of Sr changes from medium to very high. Zn shows low to medium enrichment and the sediments are depleted in Fe, Cu and Mn.

40|$|International audienceWe compile {{field data}} {{collected}} {{along the eastern}} part of the North Pyrenean Zone (NPZ) to point to a tectonic evolution under peculiar thermal conditions applying to the basin sediments in relation with the opening of the Cretaceous Pyrenean rift. Based on this compilation, we show that when thinning of the continental crust increased, isotherms moved closer to the surface with the result that the brittle-ductile transition propagated upward and reached sediments deposited at the early stage of the basin opening. During the continental breakup, the pre-rift Mesozoic cover was efficiently decoupled from the Paleozoic basement along the Triassic evaporite level and underwent drastic ductile thinning and boudinage. We suggest that the upper Albian and upper Creta-ceous <b>flysches</b> acted as a blanket allowing temperature increase in the mobile pre-rift cover. Finally, we show that continuous spreading of the basin floor triggered the exhumation of the metamorphic, ductily sheared pre-rift cover, thus contributing to the progressive thinning of the sedimentary pile. In a second step, we investigate the detailed geological records of such a hot regime evolution along a reference-section of the eastern NPZ. We propose a balanced restoration from the Mouthoumet basement massif (north) to the Boucheville Albian basin (south). This section shows a north to south increase in the HT Pyrenean imprint from almost no metamorphic recrystallization to more than 600 °C in the pre-and syn-rift sediments. From this reconstruction, we propose a scenario of tectonic thinning involving the exhumation of the pre-rift cover by the activation of various detachment surfaces at different levels in the sedimentary pile. In a third step, examination of the architecture of current distal passive margin domains provides confident comparison between the Pyrenean case and modern analogs. Finally, we propose a general evolutionary model for the pre-rift sequence of the Northeastern Pyrenean rifted margin...|$|R

The rocks were formed as a thick series of carbonate sediments were deposited between the Norian and Late Cretaceous as the Adriatic Carbonate Platform, up to [...] deep. In the Eocene and early Oligocene, the Adriatic Plate moved north and north-east, contributing to the Alpine orogeny via the tectonic uplift of the Dinarides.

40|$|High rocky sea cliffs are landforms {{affected}} by abrupt and quick geomorphological changing. Their stability depends on many factors: the characteristics {{and strength of}} the rock mass, the presence and conditions of discontinuities, the geometric relationships between joints and slope, weathering, the sea wave action and human intervention. Their analysis is essential to evaluate the susceptibility to coastal instability. In this study we analyze the {{factors that contribute to}} the stability of rocky coasts and we propose a method to develop coastal hazard and risk maps. The existing geomechanical classifications are not complete to represent the dynamics of a sea cliff, as they do {{not take into account the}} action of the sea waves. Therefore a new classification, defined as Sea Cliff Mass Rating (SCMR), based on the index of Slope Mass Rating (SMR) by Romana, has been studied, introducing a new parameter that takes into account the sea wave action. Beside the quality of the rock and the condition of discontinuities, the new classification consider sea wave direction, wave length (L), wave height (H) and sea bottom depth, in order to evaluate breaking wave or broken wave and wave energy. Five classes of susceptibility of coastal instability have been identified for classifying the sea cliffs according to their quality and state of stability. This new rating has been tested along the coastal stretches between Genova and Chiavari (Eastern Liguria) and between Sanremo e Capo Mele (Western Liguria), both characterized by a marly limestones rock masses (Sanremo and Antola <b>Flysches).</b> These results were used to prepare a coastal geomorphological risk map, just considering the elements at risk present in a buffer zone of 30 m, starting from the edge of the sea cliff scarp. Crossing in a matrix the classes of susceptibility to coastal instability with those of the elements at risk, we have identified five classes of coastal risk (very high, high, medium, low and very low), which have showed to be consistent with what was observed on the field...|$|R
40|$|The E-W {{trending}} Tianshan range links Tarim and Junggar blocks. Its geodynamic {{development is}} clarified {{in the eastern}} Tianshan; new correlations with the western Tianshan and the continental nature of Junggar plate are documented. The eastern Tianshan resulted from a double stage Paleozoic northward accretion. A Middle Devonian suture zone runs in South Tianshan, north of Tarim passive margin, including Silurian <b>flyschs,</b> nappes of ophiolitic mélanges, dated as Silurian to Early-Midle Devonian, and ophiolitic bodies with a sole of amphibolites-granulites. The kinematic criteria yielded by metasedimentary greenschists indicate a northward thrusting prior to the Carboniferous intrusions. The Central Tianshan unit is composed of Ordovician island-arc volcanic rocks and a Silurian flych deposited on the Proterozoic substratum and Cambrian carbonates, and intruded by Carboniferous granites. Kinematic criteria indicate north-verging thrusting and folding, sealed by the unconformity of Lower Carboniferous conglomerates and limestones. North Tianshan is an Upper Devonian-Carboniferous continent-based island arc made of calc-alkaline basaltic and andesitic volcanics and volcaniclastics. It was affected during Late Carboniferous by northward thrusting and folding of thin-skinned tectonics style, sealed by the Middle Permian unconformity. The geodynamic evolution implies two stages. Firstly, after a southward oceanic subduction beneath the Ordovician Central Tianshan arc, the closure of South Tianshan back-arc basin led to the accretion of Tarim plate to the arc. Secondly, the continent-based North Tianshan volcanic arc built by southward subduction of the Junggar paleo-ocean collided during Late Carboniferous time with Junggar. The whole area was affected by two stages of post-collision strike-slip shearing. In the western Tianshan, new data suggest the following conclusions. The so-called "Yili block", between Yining and Narat, is actually the western extension of the North Tianshan Carboniferous island arc, diplaced by a huge late strike-slip motion, and not an independant plate nor the extension of Central Tianshan Ordovician-Silurian island arc, which is in fact located {{to the south of}} it. Its basement and the Junggar basin one, exposed in Bole area, are continental with a sedimentary sequence covering the Proterozoic.

40|$|Miocene {{igneous rocks}} (diorites, andesites, dacites, rhyolites and microgranites) of Chetaibi and Cap de Fer massif, NE Algeria, are high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic rocks. Fresh diorites have δ 34 S and δ 18 O values ranging between − 2. 5 ‰ and + 5. 9 ‰, + 6. 5 ‰ and + 6. 7 ‰ respectively, {{indicating}} a mantle origin. The relatively low δ 34 S values (− 5. 4 ‰ to − 12. 2 ‰) and high δ 18 O (+ 8. 3 ‰ to + 9. 0 ‰) of altered diorites indicate {{the input of}} a crustal component to the initial magma. The microgranites’ I-type signature is indicated by the geochemical data and the δ 34 S and δ 18 O values of − 1. 2 ‰ and − 3. 6 ‰, and + 7. 8 ‰ to + 10. 4 ‰ respectively. The andesites show a large variation of δ 34 S, between − 33. 2 ‰ and + 25. 7 ‰. Massive andesites with δ 34 S between + 6. 8 ‰ and + 7. 6 ‰ preserve a 34 S-enriched mantle signature. The δ 34 S of the lava flows between + 25. 7 ‰ and + 25. 8 ‰ are attributed to open system magma degassing, whereas the low δ 34 S of two andesitic dyke samples (− 13. 7 ‰ and − 33. 2 ‰) strongly suggest a crustal sulphur input. High δ 18 O (+ 9. 2 ‰ to + 15. 7 ‰) of andesites indicate post-magmatic alteration (mainly silicification); the <b>flyschs</b> with δ 18 O between of + 13. 3 ‰ and + 21. 7 ‰ are most likely the contaminant. Quartz veins within the andesites gave a δ 18 O value of + 23. 0 ‰ while silica-filling vesicles yielded a value of + 13. 8 ‰. Initial Sr-isotope data are rather high for all the rocks (diorites: 0. 707 – 0. 708, andesites: 0. 707 – 0. 710, and microgranites and rhyolites: 0. 717 – 0. 719), and because geochemical and stable isotope data do not indicate {{a substantial amount of}} crustal assimilation, an extensive enrichment of the mantle source by subducted sediments is called for.

A section of it was given, showing the reversed position of the Hippurite limestone in the summit and lower precipices. This limestone wave was shown {{to be one of}} a great series, running parallel with the Alps, and constituting an undulatory district, chiefly composed of chalk beds, separated from the higher limestone district of the Jura and Lias by a long trench or moat, filled with members of the tertiary series--chiefly nummulite limestones and <b>flysch.</b> This trench might be followed from Faverges, {{at the head of the}} lake of Annecy, across Savoy. It separated Mont Vergi from the Mont Dorons, and the Dent d'Oche from the Dent du Midi; then entered Switzerland, separating the Moleson from the Diablerets; passed on through the districts of Thun and Brientz, and, dividing itself into two, caused the zigzagged form of the lake of Lucerne. The principal branch then passed between the high Sentis and the Glarnisch, and broke into confusion in the Tyrol. On the north side of this trench the chalk beds were often vertical, or cast into repeated folds, of which the escarpments were mostly turned away from the Alps; but on the south side of the trench, the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous beds, though much distorted, showed a prevailing tendency to lean towards the Alps, and turn their escarpments to the central chain.|$|E
60|$|Now let us {{turn to our}} richest museums, {{and what}} a paltry display we behold! That our {{collections}} are imperfect is admitted by every one. The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, Edward Forbes, should never be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only {{a small portion of}} the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid. Some of the many kinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water mark seem to be rarely preserved. For instance, the several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period. Lastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their accumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our being able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is that of the <b>Flysch</b> formation, which consists of shale and sandstone, several thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness, and extending for at least 300 miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and although this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils, except a few vegetable remains, have been found.|$|E
60|$|Date of Last Glacial Epoch and its Bearing on the Measurement of Geological Time.--Directly we go {{back from}} this stable period we come upon changes both in the forms and in the {{distribution}} of species; and when we pass beyond the last glacial epoch into the Pliocene period we find ourselves in a comparatively new world, surrounded by a considerable number of species altogether different from any which now exist, together with many others which, though still living, now inhabit distant regions. It seems not improbable that what is termed the Pliocene period, was really the coming on of the glacial epoch, and this is the opinion of Professor Jules Marcou.[49] According to our views, a considerable amount of geographical change must have occurred at the change from the Miocene to the Pliocene, favouring the refrigeration of the northern hemisphere, and leading, in the way already pointed out, to the glacial epoch whenever a high degree of excentricity {123} prevailed. As many reasons combine to make us fix the height of the glacial epoch at the period of high excentricity which occurred 200,000 years back, and as the Pliocene period was probably not of long duration, we must suppose the next great phase of very high excentricity (850,000 years ago) to fall within the Miocene epoch. Dr. Croll believes that this must have produced a glacial period, but we have shown strong reasons for believing that, in concurrence with favourable geographical conditions, it led to uninterrupted warm climates in the temperate and northern zones. This, however, did not prevent the occurrence of local glaciation wherever other conditions led to its initiation, and the most powerful of such conditions is a great extent of high land. Now we know that the Alps acquired a considerable part of their elevation during {{the latter part of the}} Miocene period, since Miocene rocks occur at an elevation of over 6,000 feet, while Eocene beds occur at nearly 10,000 feet. But since that time there has been a vast amount of denudation, so that these rocks may have been at first raised much higher than we now find them, and thus a considerable portion of the Alps may have been more elevated than they are now. This would certainly lead to an enormous accumulation of snow, which would be increased when the excentricity reached a maximum, as already fully explained, and may then have caused glaciers to descend into the adjacent sea, carrying those enormous masses of rock which are buried in the Upper Miocene of the Superga in Northern Italy. An earlier epoch of great altitude in the Alps coinciding with the very high excentricity 2,500,000 years ago, may have caused the local glaciation of the Middle Eocene period when the enormous erratics of the <b>Flysch</b> conglomerate were deposited in the inland seas of Northern Switzerland, the Carpathians, and the Apennines. This is quite in harmony with the indications of an uninterrupted warm climate and rich vegetation during the very same period in the adjacent low countries, just as we find at the present day in New Zealand a delightful climate and a rich vegetation of Metrosideros, {124} fuchsias and tree-ferns on the very borders of huge glaciers, descending to within 700 feet of the sea-level. It is not pretended that these estimates of geological time have any more value than probable guesses; but it is certainly a curious coincidence that two remarkable periods of high excentricity should have occurred, at such periods and at such intervals apart, as very well accord with the comparative remoteness of the two deposits in which undoubted signs of ice-action have been found, and that both these are localised in the vicinity of mountains which are known to have acquired a considerable elevation at about the same period of time.|$|E
40|$|On the Adriatic {{side of the}} Northern Apennines, SE of the Sillaro Line, {{both the}} {{original}} extent/areal distribution and the stratigraphic composition of the Ligurian thrust-nappe are still unknown and represent a highly debated topic. Few contraints have been proposed in recent papers. Based {{on the presence of}} “Ligurian olistostromes” within the Tortonian Marnoso arenacea Fm and their absence, instead, within younger deposits, some workers have been suggested that to SE of the Sillaro Line (i. e., in the Romagna and Umbria Apennines) the Ligurian nappe was located in a more internal position. However, other workers claimed for a Ligurian thrust-sheet up to 5 km thick, partially or completely covering the internal Marnoso arenacea Fm of the Romagna Apennines. The latter hypothesis was based either on vitrinite reflectance data and apatite fission tracks data or on the composition of the Quaternary fluvial terraced deposits cropping out along the Romagna foothills. Following this latter hypothesis, the complete disappearance of the Ligurian nappe between the Sillaro Line and the Marecchia area, {{was the result of a}} differential widespread event of tectonic uplift since the Pliocene times enhancing subaerial erosion. Here we show that a re-examination and reinterpretation of the existing knowledge about the regional geology of the Northern Apennines is essential to solve this problem. In fact, in the External Ligurian Units cropping out in the south-eastern sector of the Emilia Apennines and in the Romagna Apennines (between the Enza and the Marecchia valleys) a particular distinct unit, variously named as Val Samoggia, Val Sillaro or Val Marecchia Varicoloured Shales - AVS - have been recently distinguished from the rest of the Ligurian Units. The AVS typically consist of green, black, red and grey shales with interbedded layers of predominantly limestones, marlstones, sandstones and manganese-rich thin layers ranging in age from the Early Cretaceous and the early Eocene. The AVS are stratigraphically inchoerent and pervasively deformed at all scales of observation, showing the typical characters of dismembered and broken formations. The AVS form the stratigraphic base of different early-middle Eocene <b>flysches</b> of the External Ligurian Units (i. e., Sporno, Savigno and M. Morello formations) and they share the same lithological, stratigraphical and structural character independent of the overlying formation. Interestingly, the AVS crop out also either in few scattered outcrops (klippens) in eastern Tuscany (Casentino and Pieve Santo Stefano areas) and Umbria (between Umbertide and Nocera Umbra) where they have been interpreted not as klippens but as “olistostromes” within the Marnoso arenacea Fm. In both latter areas the AVS are unconformably overlain by few scattered remnants of the late Oligocene to middle Miocene epi-Ligurian Antognola, Monte Fumaiolo or S. Marino formations. These data clearly imply that in the whole Romagna and Umbria Apennines on the internal Marnoso arenacea Fm a thin thrust sheet of Ligurian rocks exclusively formed of AVS and an uncomplete overlying epi-Ligurian succession, similar to that cropping out in the Val Marecchia area, was present at least up to the middle Miocene. Therefore, it follows that the thickness of the Ligurian nappe was not the same across the Sillaro Line, and that the thrust-front of the nappe to NW and SE of this tectonic lineament clearly had a quite different evolution. These findings again show that in the Northern Apennines the Sillaro Line played also an important role inside the evolution of the Ligurian nappe.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{main goal}} of this work {{is the study of}} the {{morphological}} and morphometrical features of the Southern Apennines thrust belt – foredeep system, carrying out both a large scale and a small scale analyses of areas of high relevance, with the aim to determine new morphological and morphometrical constraints to the reconstruction of the main morphotectonic events that have interested the chain. This type of research has been based on the idea to compare such data with new thermochronological data that have been produced {{in many areas of the}} chain (Aldega et al., 2003; Mazzoli et al., 2006; Mazzoli et al., 2008), which highlighted the role of the exhumation processes in the evolution of the thrust belt. The thermochronological data indicate that the exhumation processes started about 10 Ma and they have been active since recent time (in the last million years), resulting contemporary to the main morphogenetic events responsible of the actual morphostructural setting of the chain. The Southern Apennines chain formed has a consequence of the Neogene collision of the African (and in particular, the Adria microplate) and Euroasiatic plates, with the subduction of the Adria microplate beneath the Euroasiatic plate. The morphostructural setting of the Southern Apennines has been determined by its complex tectonic history (with the occurrence of both thrust faults and normal faults) and by the erosional processes that have sculptured the topography, also considering that the landforms are strongly influenced by the rock type too. In the last years the development of new techniques of analysis has provided new constraints useful to the reconstruction of the morphotectonic history of the Southern Apennines. This techniques are based on thermochronological analysis, and in particular on the Apatite Fission Tracks, the Ur-Th-He series, the Vitrinite Reflectance, the Clay Mineralogy and the Fluid Inclusions. These data, that have been extensively produced in the whole chain, have pointed out the attention on tectonic exhumation processes (we mean by rock exhumation a variation of the position of a rock in relation to the air-topograhy interface), which have determined rock uplift of thousands of meters in the last 2 - 3 Ma (Aldega et al., 2003; Mazzoli et al., 2006; Mazzoli et al., 2008). The individuation of so enhanced vertical and horizontal tectonic motions in recent times has expected to have interacted with the processes responsible of the exogenic modelling of the topography, and they have probably played an important role in the morphotectonic evolution of the chain, leaving their signature in the topography. The research has been based on large scale geomorphological and morphometrical techniques of analysis, that have been used with the aim to describe the main morphological and morphometrical features of the chain, to compare the features of the Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Ionian slopes of the Southern Apennines, and to relate these features with the proposed morphotectonic events. The large scale analysis has been accompanied by the small scale analysis of a selected transect namely the Noce-Sirino-Alpi-Sant’Arcangelo transect. This transect has been chosen because of the particular features that make this area one of the most relevant portion of the chain in order to reconstruct the morphotectonic evolution of the Southern Apennines, and in particular, to investigate the role played by the rock exhumation processes in the evolution of the relief. This transect assumes a high relevance because: -	it includes tectonic units which have been exhumed in recent times; -	it preserves a stratigraphical and morpho-stratigraphical record which is almost continuous both temporally (from the Middle Pliocene to the whole Quaternary) and spatially (from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic coasts); -	the topography, in this portion of the Southern Apennines, has been only slightly dismembered by the post-orogenic extensional tectonic, and may be considered resulting by the major geodynamic processes (shortening, thrusting, extension and exhumation). One of the main parameters that can influence the geomorphological and morphometrical features of a determined region is the lithology, or more correctly the bedrock resistance to erosion. In fact, parameters such as the elevation, local relief, steepness, presence of knickpoints are strongly controlled by bedrock erodibility. As a result, the first step in the analysis of the landscape is represented by a clear depiction of the space distribution of the rock types with different erodibility. For the above mentioned reason, a “Map of the Morphostructural Units of the Southern Apennines” has been created. This map is a simplification of the “Geological Map of the Southern Apennines” in scale 1 : 250000, in fact the 81 formations distinguished in the “Geological Map of the Southern Apennines” have been reduced into the 20 morphostructural units which have been grouped based on the estimation of erodibility of each rock type relative to other rock types. The erodibility degree was basically assigned by the observations of the features (e. g. steepness, degree of development of the upper convexity/basal concavity of hillslopes, average elevation, etc.) associated with the various bedrocks. As regards the Quaternary deposits, these were grouped based on different criteria. Taking into account the main {{goal of this}} study, which consists in the reconstruction of the Plio-Quaternary relative/absolute vertical motions of the Southern Apennines, the grouping of the different Quaternary stratigraphical units was based on the depositional environment (marine vs continental), degree of correlation of the different units with the original depositional environment (i. e. whether and to what degree they are displaced/dissected), and tectonic context (e. g. peri-tyrrhenian grabens, foredeep and intramontane basins deposits). The large scale geomorphological analysis of the Southern Apennines has been based on the determination of the following parameters: elevation map and the derived maximum, medium and minimum elevation maps, swath profiles and the derived relief curves, analysis of the river long profiles and the derived parameters (drainage area vs distance, Stream Gradient Index, steepness (ks) and concavity (Q) indexes, slope of the first order channels). This type of analysis enhance a series of particular feature of the Southern Apennines that can be summarized as follows: -	the minimum elevation map can be separated in two different sector, respectively located north and south of the hereinafter named “Sele-Ofanto line”: the north sector is characterized by the coincidence of the highest values with the apenninic divide, while the southern sector is characterized by the presence of a wide area with high values in the minimum elevations, which moves from the apenninic divide to the east, involving the foredeep (and the Lavello high) and the Murge-Salento area; -	this data regarding the minimum elevation map is very interesting in particular when compared with the “Map of the Morphostructural Units of the Southern Apennines”: this comparison show that the valleys on the Adriatic flank are higher than the valleys on the Tyrrhenian flank despite the Adriatic flank is characterized by the outcropping of very weak lithologies (external <b>flyschs</b> and Quaternary filling of the foredeep); -	the minimum elevation map could be so considered a good representation of the differential uplift at the orogen scale; this fact let the maximum elevation map to play a less relevant role when we want to interpret it in terms of uplift, and it can be more correctly considered as a good representation of the distribution of the tectonic Quaternary lows; -	the medium elevation map clearly enhance the presence of the hard carbonatic highs on the Tyrrhenian slope respect to more eroded surrounding areas where weaker lithologies crop out. This means that the Tyrrhenian slope has experienced a more intense erosion, or even that it is experiencing erosion since older times than the Adriatic flank (where the same weak lithologies crop out), and that the amount of eroded rock volumes is higher on the Tyrrhenian flank than on the Adriatic flank. If this two sectors were experiencing erosion since the same time, than we cannot explain why the external flank of the chain is higher than its inner flank despite this two sectors are characterized by the same rock-type; -	the analysis of the maximum, medium and minimum elevation maps suggests that the Adriatic flank of the Southern Apennines has experienced more enhanced uplift in recent times than the Tyrrhenian flank; -	the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic flanks of the chain have also other different morphological and morphometrical features, in particular the Tyrrhenian flank becomes steeper than the Adriatic flank as we move to the south, giving the typical asymmetrical feature to the Southern Apennine; -	this asymmetrical feature of the chain is clearly showed by the envelop of the minimum elevation line of the five swath profiles, which enhance the presence of a Tyrrhenian steep slope and of an Adriatic gentle slope; -	there is an important difference regarding the elevation of the valleys on Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic flanks, with a mean gradient that bring the valleys to reach elevations a. s. l. higher on both the flanks as we move to the south, but in general the valleys on the Tyrrhenian flank are always lower than the valleys on the Adriatica flank: such a difference suggest a more recent uplift on the Adriatic flank than on the Tyrrhenian one; The analysis of the river system shows how there is a spatial variations of the morphological and morphometrical features of the Southern Apennine rivers. If we consider the shape of the river long profiles we notice that the Tyrrhenian rivers have a clear concave-up shape with no important knickpoints, while the Adriatic|$|R
