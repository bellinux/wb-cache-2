25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library.

25|$|Annealing of the 3' {{end of one}} primer {{to itself}} or the second primer may cause primer extension, {{resulting}} {{in the formation of}} so-called primer dimers, visible as low-molecular-weight bands on PCR gels. Primer dimer formation often competes with formation of the <b>DNA</b> <b>fragment</b> of interest, and may be avoided using primers that are designed such that they lack complementarity—especially at the 3' ends—to itself or the other primer used in the reaction. If primer design is constrained by other factors and if primer-dimers do occur, methods to limit their formation may include optimisation of the MgCl2 concentration or increasing the annealing temperature in the PCR.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{pool for}} in vitro {{evolution}} {{can be derived}} from a narrowed subset of sequence space, such as a certain round of an in vitro selection experiment, which is sometimes also called in vitro reselection. The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through in vitro evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen <b>DNA</b> <b>fragment</b> derived from the mRNA transcript of bovine serum albumin was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through deep sequencing analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.|$|E

40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> {{containing}} mispaired {{and modified}} bases, bulges, lesions and specific sequences have altered conformation. Methods for separating complex samples of <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> based on conformation but independent of length have many applications, including (i) separation of mismatched or unmatched <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> from those perfectly matched; (ii) simultaneous, diagnostic, mismatch scanning of multiple fragments; (iii) isolation of damaged <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> from undamaged fragments; and (iv) estimation of reannealing efficiency of complex DNA samples. We developed a two-dimensional conformation-dependent electrophoresis (2 D-CDE) method for separating <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> based on length and conformation {{in the first}} dimension and only on length in the second dimension.

25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular <b>DNA</b> <b>fragment</b> (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E
25|$|Molecular cloning {{refers to}} the process of making {{multiple}} molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes, {{but it can also be}} used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters, non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in positional cloning. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication, which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised cloning vectors (small piece of DNA into which a foreign <b>DNA</b> <b>fragment</b> can be inserted) exist that allow protein production, affinity tagging, single stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.|$|E

The incorporation of labelled precursors occurs in the <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> containing single-stranded regions, presumably the replication forks. Prolongation of DNA synthesis leads to the accumulation of labelled <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> hat lack single-stranded sequences.

30|$|In this work, a novel agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} strategy has been developed for separation of <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> by doping graphene oxide (GO) into agarose gel.

The improved resolution of <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> in GO-doped agarose gel could be attributed to the successive adsorption-desorption processes between <b>DNA</b> <b>fragments</b> and GO sheets, while the elimination of the background noise could be attributed to the adsorption of the excessive EB dye on the surface of GO sheets and high fluorescence quenching efficiency of GO.

2500|$|Among {{the notable}} of the inventions from Hood's lab was the {{automated}} DNA sequencer. It made possible high-speed sequencing {{of the structure}} of DNA, including the human genome. It automated many of the tasks that researchers had previously done by hand. Researchers Jane Z. Sanders and Lloyd M. Smith developed a way to color code the basic nucleotide units of DNA with fluorescent tags, green for adenine (A), yellow-green for guanine (G), orange for cytosine (C) and red for thymine (T). Four differently colored fluorophores, each one specific to a reaction with one of the bases, are covalently attached to the oligonucleotide primer for the enzymatic DNA sequence analysis. [...] During the analysis, fragments are passed downwards through a gel tube, the smallest and lightest fragments passing through the gel tube first.

2500|$|In 1985, Thomas Kunkel {{introduced}} {{a technique that}} reduces the need to select for the mutants. The <b>DNA</b> <b>fragment</b> to be mutated is inserted into a phagemid such as M13mp18/19 and is then transformed into an E. coli strain deficient in two enzymes, dUTPase (dut) and uracil deglycosidase (ung). Both enzymes {{are part of a}} DNA repair pathway that protects the bacterial chromosome from mutations by the spontaneous deamination of dCTP to dUTP. The dUTPase deficiency prevents the breakdown of dUTP, resulting in a high level of dUTP in the cell. The uracil deglycosidase deficiency prevents the removal of uracil from newly synthesized DNA. As the double-mutant E. coli replicates the phage DNA, its enzymatic machinery may, therefore, misincorporate dUTP instead of dTTP, resulting in single-strand DNA that contains some uracils (ssUDNA). The ssUDNA is extracted from the bacteriophage that is released into the medium, and then used as template for mutagenesis. [...] An oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation is used for primer extension. The heteroduplex DNA, that forms, consists of one parental non-mutated strand containing dUTP and a mutated strand containing dTTP. [...] The DNA is then transformed into an E. coli strain carrying the wildtype dut and ung genes. Here, the uracil-containing parental DNA strand is degraded, so that nearly all of the resulting DNA consists of the mutated strand.|$|E
2500|$|Left handed DNA {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Robert Wells and colleagues, during their studies of a repeating polymer of inosine-cytosine. They observed a [...] "reverse" [...] circular dichroism spectrum for such DNAs, and interpreted this (correctly) {{to mean that}} the strands wrapped around {{one another in a}} left handed fashion. The relationship between Z-DNA and the more familiar B-DNA was indicated by the work of Pohl and Jovin, who showed that the ultraviolet circular dichroism of poly(dG-dC) was nearly inverted in 4 M sodium chloride solution. The suspicion that this {{was the result of a}} conversion from B-DNA to Z-DNA was confirmed by examining the raman spectra of these solutions and the Z-DNA crystals. Subsequently, a crystal structure of [...] "Z-DNA" [...] was published which turned out to be the first single-crystal X-ray structure of a <b>DNA</b> <b>fragment</b> (a self-complementary DNA hexamer d(CG)3). It was resolved as a left-handed double helix with two anti-parallel chains that were held together by Watson-Crick base pairs (see: x-ray crystallography). It was solved by Andrew Wang, Alexander Rich, and co-workers in 1979 at MIT. The crystallisation of a B- to Z-DNA junction in 2005 provided a better understanding of the potential role Z-DNA plays in cells. Whenever a segment of Z-DNA forms, there must be B-Z junctions at its two ends, interfacing it to the B-form of DNA found in the rest of the genome.|$|E
