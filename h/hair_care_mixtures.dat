50|$|While out of school, Annie grew so {{fascinated with}} <b>hair</b> and <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> that she often practiced {{hairdressing}} with her sister. With expertise in both chemistry and <b>hair</b> <b>care,</b> Turnbo {{began to develop}} her own <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> products. At the time, many women used goose fat, heavy oils, soap, or bacon grease to straighten their curls, which damaged both scalp and hair.|$|R
25|$|The Black <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> {{industry}} was initially dominated by White-owned businesses. In the late 19th century, African-American entrepreneurs such as Annie Turnbo Malone, Madam C. J. Walker, Madam Gold S.M. Young, Sara Spencer Washington and Garrett Augustus Morgan revolutionized <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> by inventing and marketing chemical (and heat-based) applications {{to alter the}} natural tightly curled texture. They rapidly became successful and dominated the Black <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> market. In 1898, Anthony Overton founded a <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> company that offered saponified coconut shampoo and AIDA hair pomade. Men began using pomades, among other products, to achieve the standard aesthetic look.|$|R

40|$|Academic {{historical}} research on hair has largely {{focused on the}} symbolic meanings of hairstyles, often overlooking the material impact of <b>hair</b> and <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> products on notions {{of what it is}} to have acceptable hair. This article traces the significance of the shininess of hair over time, a particular ‘state’ of hair that is not only discursively constructed but also physically experienced in everyday life. The significance of these sensual and physical interactions become apparent when investigating <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> as an area of ‘craft consumption’ where women ‘design’ their hair and, in the process, actively interact with a variety of <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> products. Drawing on an analysis of <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> adverts in the UK women’s magazine Women’s Weekly from 1911 – 1996, and an ethnography of women’s <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> routines at home, this article argues that material interactions with <b>hair</b> and <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> products play a key role when trying to create hair that looks and feels desirable. These interactions draw attention to the conflicting nature of achieving shiny hair, as it can be considered not only as ‘good’, but also as ‘bad’. Here, the shininess of hair is linked to notions of its health, manageability and cleanliness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> as {{a network}} of activities and routines which have consequences for environmental sustainability and which may be modified by design. It proposes that together with cultural knowledge, embodied skill and objects, these activities {{can be thought of}} as ‘practices’ that are reproduced and also change through time (Shove 2006). They consume resources and are therefore implicated in the issue of environmental sustainability. The paper draws on research into <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> practices conducted through in-depth interviews with female participants, as part of the first author’s PhD study. The discussion here however centres on historical work and Shove’s (2003) writing on bathing to explore the changing products and substances including ideas, technological and infrastructural aspects of cleansing and conditioning hair. Because these factors may determine when to wash or not to wash your hair they affect resource consumption. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for sustainable design that follow from the insights gained by investigating the history of <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> in relation to the data collected during in-depth interviews. It highlights, as outlined by Hand et al (2005), that the resources consumed through <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> are influenced by the integrative nature of <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> as a practice rather than by individuals being dedicated to sustainability. To concentrate on single products without taking into account that <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> is practiced in everyday life is not likely to provide opportunities for sustainable living. What is considered ‘normal’ standards of <b>hair</b> <b>care</b> and means to achieve them needs to be conceptualised to identify opportunities to modify what is considered ‘normal’ through design.
