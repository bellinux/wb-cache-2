5|$|With the {{creation}} of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> along with present-day Route 3, which itself {{was not included in the}} <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive to bring it up to <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> standards. However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> standards. Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> standards with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York's I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Because of the fact that New Jersey's I-495 would not be connected to New York's, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the decommissioning of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved the decommissioning of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was {{proposed in the}} 1950s. The 1955 Yellow Book, an early proposal for {{what would become the}} <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Flint area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 705 (I-705, Tacoma Spur) {{is a short}} <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> that is spur {{route of}} I-5 located entirely within Tacoma, Washington, United States.

5|$|The Kansas Turnpike {{was built}} from 1954 to 1956, predating the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System. While {{not part of}} the system's early plans, the turnpike was {{eventually}} incorporated into the Interstate system in late 1956, and is designated today as four different <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> routes: I-35, I-335, I-470, and I-70. The turnpike also carries a piece of U.S. Routes 24 and 40 in Kansas City.|$|E

5|$|The {{cost was}} $490 million (equivalent to $ million today) to build , 40 times {{the average cost}} per mile {{predicted}} by the planners of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> system. This figure exceeded that of Interstate 15 through the Virgin River Gorge, which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the United States. The construction of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for the Colorado Department of Transportation, including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers. At the dedication it was claimed that I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System to open to traffic. For this reason, the system was proclaimed to be complete. However, as of 2009, at least two sections of the original <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System have not been constructed: a section of Interstate 95 in central New Jersey, and a section of I-70 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed {{at least since the}} 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> standards.|$|E
5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System was in the {{planning}} stages, no paved road had yet entered the San Rafael Swell. The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the swell.|$|E

Situated along an integral point in the United States Interstate network, Oklahoma contains three <b>interstate</b> <b>highways</b> and four auxiliary <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highways.</b> In Oklahoma City, Interstate 35 intersects with Interstate 44 and Interstate 40, forming {{one of the most}} important intersections along the United States highway system.|$|R
5|$|I-470 {{is one of}} 13 {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highways in Ohio and {{the only}} auxiliary <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> in West Virginia. The Ohio Department of Transportation and West Virginia Division of Highways (ODOT and WVDOH) conduct surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is {{expressed in terms of}} average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. In 2012, they calculated that 26,500vehicles traveled along the highway at the eastern terminus in West Virginia, and 37,840vehicles used I-470 across the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge. As part of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System, the entire route is listed on the National Highway System—a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E
5|$|In late 1977, the CPO {{made plans}} to push for adding SR117 to the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System, to obtain {{additional}} federal funding. By 1979, both San Diego city and county had allocated $6million to construct a temporary way to access the border crossing along Otay Mesa and Harvest Roads. Two years later, the City of San Diego indicated that the upgrade of Otay Mesa Road to a four-lane road would be the preferred option; the state agreed to allocate $2million towards the $10million project, with the city contributing $6.4million and the county adding $2.3million. The Federal Highway Administration approved the continuous roadway via SR117 and SR125 from I-5 to the border at Otay Mesa as a non-chargeable (not eligible for federal <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> construction dollars) part of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System in October1984. The Otay Mesa border crossing opened on January 24, 1985. The route number was legislatively changed to 905 in 1986, and signs were updated in 1988. This change was to apply for other federal funding. The original piece of SR117, west of I-5, also became SR905 {{with the rest of}} SR117, but Caltrans has not constructed it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{numbering}} grid {{for the new}} <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System {{was established}} as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart {{in order to keep}} them from being confused with one another, and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially collide with US50 and US60. Both highway systems still number the routes ending in odd numbers north–south and the even-numbered highways run east–west, although the Interstate System labels its main north–south highways with numbers ending in 5, rather than 1.|$|E

5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System showed a highway in the corridor. The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System replaced much of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E

5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, and the {{building}} of the <b>Interstate</b> <b>Highway</b> System beginning in 1956, automobile ownership and travel became a preferred mode of travel in the United States.

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, New York state {{planners}} {{envisioned a}} system of arterial roads in Utica that would include connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81. Due to community opposition, only parts of the highway project were completed, including the North–South Arterial Highway running west of the city. Six New York State highways, one three-digit <b>interstate</b> <b>highway,</b> and one two-digit <b>interstate</b> <b>highway</b> pass through Utica. New York State Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus of each is in the city. New York State Route 5 and its alternate routes—State Route 5S and State Route 5A—are east–west roads and expressways that pass through Utica. The western terminus of Route 5S and the eastern terminus of Route 5A are both in the city. With Route 5 and Interstate 790 (an auxiliary highway of Interstate 90), New York State Route 12 and State Route 8 form the North–South Arterial Highway.|$|E
