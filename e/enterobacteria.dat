2500|$|<b>Enterobacteria</b> phage λ (lambda phage, {{coliphage}} λ) is {{a bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E
2500|$|Bubonic plague is {{a variant}} of the deadly flea-borne disease plague, which is caused by the <b>enterobacteria</b> Yersinia pestis, that devastated human populations {{beginning}} in the 14th century. [...] Bubonic plague is primarily spread by fleas that lived on the black rat, an animal that originated in south Asia and spread to Europe by the 6th century. [...] It became common to cities and villages, traveling by ship with explorers. [...] A human would become infected after being bitten by an infected flea. [...] The first sign of an infection of bubonic plague is swelling of the lymph nodes, and the formation of buboes. [...] These buboes would first appear in the groin or armpit area, and would often ooze pus or blood. [...] Eventually infected individuals would become covered with dark splotches caused by bleeding under the skin. [...] The symptoms would be accompanied by a high fever, and within four to seven days of infection, more than half the victims would die. During the 14th and 15th century, humans did not know that a bacterium was the cause of plague, and efforts to slow the spread of disease were futile.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most {{commonly}} {{applied to}} green olive preparation, around 60% {{of all the}} world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered [...] "treated" [...] when the lye has penetrated {{two-thirds of the way}} into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or [...] "Terroir" [...] of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative <b>enterobacteria</b> flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.|$|E

30|$|The Gammaproteobacteria {{sequences}} found {{could be}} classified as bacteria that are known members of the GI microbiota of many organisms including fish (Wu et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2009). Most Gammaproteobacteria (Additional file 1) found in carp belonged to the Aeromonas group. Members of the genus Aeromonas are mainly distributed in freshwater and sewage, often in association with aquatic animals (Cahill 1990; Sugita et al. 1995). They can cause a diverse spectrum of diseases in both warm- and cold-blooded animals but they also appear to be aquatic envrionments including in fish intestines (Sugita et al. 1995). Other abundantly present members among the Gammaproteobacterial sequences were the genera <b>Enterobacterium</b> and Vibrio. <b>Enterobacterium</b> spp. are widespread in GI tracts of various organisms (Wu et al. 2010), whereas Vibrio sp. are commonly found in aquaeous environments, aquaculture systems and in association with eukaryotes (Wu et al. 2010; Thompson et al. 2004). This phylum also contains Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter species that have been found in carp before (Sugita et al. 1991; Cahill 1990). Furthermore, the presence of high number Proteobacteria has also been shown for zebrafish, which is closely related to carp (Rawls et al. 2006). Also in other fish belonging to the Cyprinidae members of the Gammaproteobacteria (Enterobacter and Citrobacter species) were found (Ray et al. 2010). Enterobacter and Citrobacter species isolated from the GI tract of Indian carp (Cyprinidae) were shown to produce amylase, cellulase and protease (Ray et al. 2010), which indicates that these bacteria can be actively involved in the digestion of food in carp guts.|$|R
40|$|Random {{transposon}} mutagenesis {{is a powerful}} technique used to generate libraries of genetic insertions in many different bacterial strains. Here we develop a system facilitating random {{transposon mutagenesis}} {{in a range of}} different Gram-negative bacterial strains, including Pectobacterium atrosepticum, Citrobacter rodentium, Serratia sp. ATCC 39006, Serratia plymuthica, Dickeya dadantii and many more. Transposon mutagenesis was optimized in each of these strains and three studies are presented to show the efficacy of this system. Firstly, the important agricultural pathogen D. dadantii was mutagenized. Two mutants that showed reduced protease production and one mutant producing the previously cryptic pigment, indigoidine, were identified and characterized. Secondly, the <b>enterobacterium,</b> Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 was mutagenized and mutants incapable of producing gas vesicles, proteinaceous intracellular organelles, were identified. One of these contained a β-galactosidase transcriptional fusion within the gene gvpA 1, essential for gas vesicle production. Finally, the system was used to mutate the biosynthetic gene clusters of the antifungal, anti-oomycete and anticancer polyketide, oocydin A, in the plant-associated <b>enterobacterium,</b> Dickeya solani MK 10. The mutagenesis system was developed to allow easy identification of transposon insertion sites by sequencing, after facile generation of a replicon encompassing the transposon and adjacent DNA, post-excision. Furthermore, the system can also create transcriptional fusions with either β-galactosidase or β-glucuronidase as reporters, and exploits a variety of drug resistance markers so that multiple selectable fusions can be generated in a single strain. This system of various transposons has wide utility and can be combined in many different ways...|$|R
