40|$|A new {{electromechanical}} {{press for}} fuel pellet manufacturing was built {{last year in}} partnership between CEA-Marcoule and ChampalleAlcen. This press was developed to shape pellets in a hot cell via remote handling. It has been qualified to show its robustness and to optimize the compaction cycle, thus obtaining a better sintered pellet profile and limiting damage. We will show you how 400 annular pellets have been produced with good geometry's parameters, based on press settings management. These results are according to a good phenomenological pressing knowledge with Finite Element Modeling calculation. Therefore, during die pressing, a modification in the punch displacement sequence induces fluctuation in the axial distribution of frictional forces. The green pellet stress and density gradients are based on these frictional forces between powder and tool, and between grains in the powder, influencing {{the shape of the}} pellet after sintering. The pellet shape and <b>diameter</b> <b>tolerances</b> must be minimized to avoid the need for grinding operations. To find the best parameters for the press settings, which enable optimization, FEM calculations were used and different compaction models compared to give the best calculation/physical trial comparisons.

40|$|Optical fiber {{for data}} {{communication}} is manufactured by the draw process, which involves heating and pulling high purity glass cylinders to diameters of 125 μm. The {{diameter of the}} glass fiber and its light-guide core must remain constant to create a product capable of transmitting high-bandwidth optical data. The draw capstan design has {{a significant impact on}} the optical fiber quality. As the draw speed is used to control the fiber diameter, the ability of the draw capstan to follow velocity commands directly affects the resulting fiber diameter. To improve the control of the optical fiber diameter, the design of the overall system was revisited. A lumped-parameter model of the capstan drive was developed. It accounts for disturbances in the draw process that arise from sources such as the variation in the diameter of the input glass cylinder and the draw tension control, affecting the glass temperature and viscosity. The selection of the motor and the design of the speed controller in the optical fiber draw capstan pulley system were studied. Simulation studies over a range of parameters demonstrate that speed regulation, necessary to manufacture optical fiber within allowable <b>diameter</b> <b>tolerances,</b> can be achieved in the presence of estimated process disturbances without motor current saturation. The model predictions suggest that an effective draw capstan system can be synthesized and controlled. This case study has broad applications for the design of practical engineering systems that include control, electrical, and mechanical subsystems, typical in modern manufacturing.

The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed rivet head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of rivet head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of rivet head is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk rivet head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|E
40|$|Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a {{non-traditional}} {{machining process}} that uses {{hundreds of thousands}} of minute electrical sparks per second to machine any electrically conductive material, no matter the hardness or how delicate it is. EDM allows a much greater range of design possibilities, unconstrained from the traditional machining processes, in which material is removed mechanically by either rotating the cutting tool or the work piece. Shapes that were impossible to machine by any other method, such as deep, precision, square holes and slots with sharp inside corners, are readily produced. It provides accurate geometries in high- aspect ratio holes and slots, blind undercuts, small holes adjacent to deep sidewalls, and complex cuts in thin, fragile parts. Micro-EDM is a growing form of manufacturing and will continue to expand within various production fields. Micro-EDM is especially attractive for the applications where the cutting time is minimal, but precision and accuracy are maximized. Micro- EDM is a non-traditional cutting process, which consistently produces ultra-precise holes with fine surface finishes and better roundness, while holding extremely close <b>diameter</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The process could be an excellent problem-solving tool for configurations that are difficult or impossible to produce using conventional machining processes.

40|$|AbstractDimensional {{accuracy}} {{characterized by}} limit deviation in diameter {{is of great}} importance for the sized steel used for critical machine parts and tool production. Sized steel is manufactured by cold drawing with small single reductions. One {{of the ways to}} improve the dimensional accuracy is {{to take into account the}} recovery effect. As a result of the effect above the sized steel diameter after drawing is a bit larger than the die bearing diameter in the non-loaded condition. For some predetermined combinations of the drawing process factors the recovery value is quite comparable with the <b>diameter</b> <b>tolerance</b> limit determined by standards. It is especially characteristic for sized steel more than 10 mm in diameter with yield strength of more than 400 MPa. The study describes the investigation results of the drawing process factors influence the value of sized steel recovery. Using the finite elements method the authors carried out simulation of stress and strain state in the deformation zone during drawing. It was proved that there was a relationship between the radial stresses developed on the sized steel surface on the exit from the die bearing zone and the recovery value. The research group determined the dependence of recovery value on the degree of reduction, the coefficient of contact friction, the die semi-angle and the die bearing length, the bar yield strength and its diameter. The obtained results make it possible to determine the parameters of sized steel drawing with the preset diameter limit deviation taking into account the recovery effect within a wide deviation range of processing factors...|$|E

Such a case study {{on the development of}} a capstan drive with feedback control for use in optical fiber production is presented in this paper. Optical fiber is manufactured by the draw process, heating and pulling high purity glass cylinders to diameters smaller than human hair. Many process and product parameters are controlled during drawing of the fiber. Of critical concern is producing a constant diameter for the glass fiber and its light-guide core. Uniformity of fiber glass diameter within the necessary tolerances creates a product capable of high bandwidth optical data transmission as well as cost-effective production. The optical fiber draw capstan design has direct impact on the resulting fiber quality. A systems approach to the design of mechanical and control aspects is demonstrated through mechanical/electrical parametric evaluations and modeling {{as well as in the}} simulation of the capstan drive. Disturbances in the draw process arise from several sources including the starting glass diameter variation and the draw tension control which affects the glass temperature and viscosity.

40|$|Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) {{methods have}} shown {{significant}} potential to automatically detect worn tools without {{intervention in the}} machining process, thus decreasing machine downtime and improving reliability and part quality. Previous research on TCM systems have used {{a wide variety of}} time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from cutting force related parameters as well as mechanical and acoustical vibrations to infer the wear state of tools. This project concerns the process of drilling thousands of tight-tolerance holes on tubesheets and baffles of heat exchangers using large diameter indexable insert drills on a horizontal boring machine. To address the issues involved in the process, the aim of this research is to develop a non-intrusive, indirect, online TCM system on the horizontal boring machine to monitor the drill wear and hole quality while drilling. The specific objectives are to establish an indirect TCM system for the drilling process, to develop models to predict tool wear and the machining accuracy of the drilled holes, and to develop an optimum tool replacement strategy. The TCM system developed used two cutting-force related signals on the horizontal boring machine, namely the spindle motor current and the axial feed motor current. Features extracted from these data streams, as well as the machining parameters, the cutting speed and the feed rate, and the number of holes drilled with the current inserts, are the inputs to a series of models to predict the tool wear state and the hole diameter. The first model is an autoregressive model that allows the prediction of the extracted features for the next hole before it is drilled. As each hole is drilled, this model is updated with the most recent data to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The predicted values for the features are then used as inputs to the second and third models which are surface response models, one to estimate the tool wear state and one to estimate the hole diameter. A tool replacement strategy based on applying limits to the predicted hole diameter was also developed. Adjusting these limits allows the strategy to be tuned for either hole accuracy or tool life depending on the requirements of a specific application. Tuning the replacement strategy for tool life resulted in a significant 44 % increase in tool life and a non-trivial reduction in machine down time due to fewer tool changes while holding a hole <b>diameter</b> <b>tolerance</b> of ± 0. 1 mm. The TCM system ensured that not a single over tolerance hole would have been drilled which is critically important since over tolerance holes can result in a scrapped workpiece. The proposed 3 -model TCM system shows promise in being able to significantly reduce the risk of drilling out of tolerance holes {{while at the same time}} increasing tool life and correspondingly decreasing tool change time. The models are able to accurately predict the insert flank wear and as well as the actual hole diameter within acceptable error. The TCM system could be implemented in an industrial settingwith minimal revision and since it is an indirect system there would be no intrusion into the manufacturing operation. One limitation of the TCM system as proposed is that it is only capable of detecting gradual tool wear and not catastrophic tool failure, a limitation that was known from the outset but was not investigated as it was beyond the scope of this project. The proposed TCM system would allow the integration of additional functionality to instantaneously detect catastrophic tool failure. Finally, for use in a production environment, the developed models need to be implemented on a standalone device that requires essentially no operator input to monitor continuous drilling operations for tubesheet and baffle applications. This implementation could include automatic detection of the machining parameters using frequency analysis of the motor signals...|$|E
30|$|The {{possibility}} {{of controlling the}} band gap width is tremendously attractive for optoelectronics applications: not only SiNWs can have a direct band gap, which per se increases the optical efficiency, but its width can in principle be tuned. It {{is not difficult to}} imagine, however, that controlling the wire <b>diameter</b> with <b>tolerances</b> within 1 – 3 nm is a more than challenging task. A simpler route to band gap tuning is controlling the chemical composition and the coverage density of the wire surface. Halogens such as Cl, Br, and I can be used as surface passivation agents instead of H and, while not altering the semiconducting character of the wires, they result in a significant shrinking of band gap (Leu et al. 2006). The strongest reduction of the band gap is provided by I, followed by Br and Cl, in the opposite order of the bonding strength of these species and SiNWs. Interestingly, the surface coverage is a further degree of freedom and one can span all the band gap values between a H- and halogen-passivated wire by varying the H:halogen ratio. Also, increasing the halogen surface concentration the band edge states, concentrated in the wire core in presence of H-passivation, progressively spread to the surface.|$|R

The processing phase of composite manufacturing has a high added value to the processed laminate, so any damage during machining has a significant economical impact. However, the characteristic attributes like non-homogeneous structure, anisotropy and high abrasiveness of fibers coupled with non-optimized cutting parameters and tool wear can result in damage to the laminate. This experimental research involves quantifying the effect of processing parameters i. e. spindle speed, feed, and tool wear on hole quality during the drilling of a quasi-isotropic woven graphite fiber epoxy laminate. Drilling tests were conducted for wide range of spindle speeds (1, 500 rpm to 15, 000 rpm) and feed rates (20 μm/rev to 800 μm/rev) with a 5 mm diameter standard point tungsten carbide twist drill. This investigation extended the drilling approach to evaluate the benefits of high speed (12, 000 rpm and 15, 000 rpm) and high feed (600 - 800 μm/rev) regimes, which were not explored or reported in the open literature. Dependence of damage mechanisms; namely, delamination, fiber pull out, thermal damage, surface roughness deterioration, hole circularity and hole diameter errors, on cutting conditions was established. A strong correlation between different types of damages and cutting forces and temperature was also identified. High speed drilling approach produced contrasting results as spindle speed of 15, 000 rpm was found to reduce delamination damage and improve surface roughness but increase the hole circularity and diameter errors. Machinability maps were designed to illustrate the affect of cutting parameters on delamination damage, hole circularity, hole diameter error and hole surface roughness. The application of machinability maps as an aid for process engineers to avoid damage and optimize the process is demonstrated. Finally, {{it was concluded that}} the process could be controlled and delamination be eliminated by increasing the spindle speed up to 15, 000 rpm and feed rate up to 100 mum/rev. It results a higher productivity if a compromise on hole circularity and <b>diameter</b> <b>tolerances</b> is accepted. Having established the benefits of high speed and low feed drilling, tool wear was evaluated at 12, 000 rpm and 15, 000 rpm and optimal feed rate of 100 mum/rev. Chipping, abrasion and adhesion of carbon were found to be the main wear mechanisms. Abrasion at the flank face of the drills was identified to be the main wear process that controls the deterioration of the drill at high speeds. The three wear regimes i. e. primary, secondary, and tertiary, were found to strongly influence the thrust force, delamination damage, hole circularity, diameter error and hole surface roughness. Finally, the tool wear analysis revealed that a tool change strategy could be devised by monitoring the thrust force, rather than measuring the progression of flank wear...|$|R
