50|$|Protectionists {{were eager}} to {{distance}} themselves from the revenue issue - if revenues were adequate, they could hardly argue for an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>duties.</b> Manufacturers sought a new argument to support higher tariffs - economic distress due to the downturn. In reality, the Panic had benefited manufacturing by causing a drop in the price of raw materials; even as the retail sales of the cotton goods plummeted, so did the wholesale cost of raw cotton - textile producers could still turn a profit. The primary producers in the agricultural South, however, saw the value of their goods decline and sell at a loss.|$|E
50|$|In October 1885 {{parliament}} was dissolved, {{the government}} was reconstructed and George Dibbs became Premier of New South Wales. At the election Parkes stood against Dibbs at St Leonards, and defeated him by 476 votes. It was, however, pointed out that this success was due not a little to Parkes's advocacy of a bridge across the harbour, and a railway line going inland from North Shore. The ministry was defeated and was succeeded by a Robertson ministry which lasted only two months. The next ministry, under Sir Patrick Jennings, had a life of nine months but was defeated in January 1887. In the meantime Robertson had retired from politics and Parkes, {{as leader of the}} opposition, formed a ministry and obtained a dissolution. He fought a strenuous campaign pointing out that in the four years since he was last in office the public debt had more than doubled and the surplus of £2,000,000 had become a deficit of £2,500,000. He proposed {{to do away with the}} recent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>duties,</b> to bring in an amended land act, and to create a body to control the railways free of political influence. Parkes had made enemies in various directions, but generally his personal popularity was great. His speeches, not always free from personal attacks, were received with enthusiasm, and his party was returned with a two to one majority. When parliament met free trade was soon restored and there was a well-meant but abortive inquiry into the state of the civil service.|$|E

According to the Commission, the incorporation of the ten ACs into the EU {{will result in a}} decrease in average tariffs in the ACs from 9 % to 4 %.

In terms of enhancing trade opportunities there will be a range of agricultural products where accession to the EU will result in reduced duties, with some of these being of export interest to ACP countries (for example tobacco, groundnuts, grapefruit juice, dried fruits, dry beans, sweet corn into Hungary and wood products into the Czech Republic). However the limited marketing capacity of ACP enterprises could limit the value of these improved market opportunities. The application of stricter EU food-safety standards in ACs could equally reduce the value of any improvement in market access resulting from tariff reductions introduced as part of the enlargement process.

40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2000, {{increases}} {{in the price of}} petrol led to fuel protests across Britain. It was argued that high levels of indirect taxation on fuel, which had risen rapidly in each year from 1993 to 1999 (the "escalator", which saw duties on fuel increase by 3 percentage points above inflation between 1993 and 1997, and 6 points between 1997 and 1999), had provoked the protests. Since abandoning the escalator in the 1999 Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor has not increased fuel duties above inflation in any Budget. As has become customary in recent years, it was announced in the 2005 Budget that the planned <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>duties</b> in line with inflation that would normally come in from April 2005 had been postponed until September, when it would be reviewed in the light of oil prices. Despite the escalator being abandoned, petrol prices have risen once again and the threat of renewed protest has been debated. This Briefing Note updates earlier work (see asterisked footnote below) {{from the time of the}} last petrol crisis and considers the extent to which recent increases in prices can be attributed to government policy. It also considers whether there is a case for duties to be changed as a direct result of pump price changes, and examines evidence on the effects of fuel duty changes on different groups of the population. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the impact of}} major loss of telecommunications on general practice in a rural region of Australia. DESIGN: A multi-stage qualitative study. Purposively selected participants were invited to contribute to initial data collection using an online survey, followed by interviews with selected participants. Thematic {{analysis of the data}} was performed by both research team members. SETTING: South-western Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals from organisations involved in Telstra recovery efforts, disaster management, health care and general practice staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survey collected freeform responses from participants. Semi-structured interviews further explored a variety of experiences from purposively selected participants. RESULTS: Organisations and practices in the region were prepared for major disasters, but not for the unusual and 2 ̆ 7 limited 2 ̆ 7 disaster of losing telecommunications, including lack of Internet access and loss of telephone services. Although alternative measures were found for telecommunications, there was still a significant impact on many health-care-related activities and general practice functionality during the outage period. In particular, there was an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>duties</b> for administrative staff to compensate for loss of telecommunications. Patient traffic for many services decreased due to uncertainty about availability and continuation of business. CONCLUSIONS: The Warrnambool outage {{could be used as a}} case study illustrating the dramatic impact of communication loss. Major impacts include changes in patient traffic, increased administrative duties and slowing of patient care. When developing or assessing disaster management plans, general practices should consider the impact of telecommunication loss on functionality and prepare appropriate alternative, accessible and reliable measures...|$|E

40|$|In {{times of}} {{economic}} turmoil, countries {{might decide to}} increase current tariff rates to protect domestic industries or raise revenues in order to finance domestic programs. Using the highest applied or bound rate imposed by countries from 1995 to 2008 as an indicator, this study presents several scenarios regarding the economic costs of a failed Doha Round and a subsequent rush into protectionism. For example, in a scenario where the applied tariffs of major economies would {{go all the way}} up to currently bound tariff rates, world trade would decrease by 7. 7 percent. In a more modest scenario where countries would raise tariffs to maximum rates applied during the past 13 years, world trade would decrease by 3. 2 percent. These increases in duties would reduce world welfare by US$ 353 billion under the first scenario, and by US$ 134 billion under the more modest scenario. While such an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>duties</b> would particularly impact agricultural exports (– 6. 9 percent), especially in developing countries (– 11. 5 percent), exports of industrial goods could also face a substantial reduction: 2 percent in developed countries and 4. 8 percent in developing countries. This study concludes there would be a potential loss of US$ 1, 064 billion in world trade if world leaders were to fail to conclude the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations in the next few weeks and if countries were to implement subsequently protectionist policies, as occurred after the end of the Uruguay Round. The failure of the negotiations would prevent a US$ 336 billion increase in world trade that would have come from a reduction in tariffs and domestic support, while a worldwide resort to protectionism would contract world trade by US$ 728 billion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ventricular myosin (βMys) is {{the motor}} protein in cardiac muscle {{generating}} force using ATP hydrolysis free energy to translate actin.

In vitro βMys step-size, motility velocity, and actin-activated myosin ATPase were measured to determine <b>duty</b> cycle <b>in</b> the absence and presence of OM. A new parameter, the relative step-frequency, was introduced and measured to characterize βMys motility due to the involvement of its three unitary step-sizes.
