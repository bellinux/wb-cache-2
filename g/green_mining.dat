40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores {{the motivation for}} and trends in the adoption of green technology among multinational mining companies in Ghana. Multinational mining companies are noted as massive waste generators and energy consumers. As mining activities increase, the risk of greater environmental pollution and degradation also looms. However, a <b>green</b> <b>mining</b> technology across mine life cycles emphasizes the need for judicious utilization of resources and reduction in the effects of mining activities on communities. The adoption of green technology processes and procedures in mine work environments, constitute greater effort towards achieving a more sustainable and environmentally friendly mining practices. Drawing on a qualitative case study methodology, primary {{data were collected from}} selected officials of multinational mining companies in Ghana using in-depth interviews. The paper documents green technology awareness messages across various mines and explore the motivating factors for adoption of <b>green</b> <b>mining</b> technologies. The paper also provides an understanding of the fad of green technology adoptions among the multinational mines, which contributes to the reduction in the effects of mining operations on mine workers and local communities. The paper has practical implications on grounds of highlighting sustainable mining, a reduction in pollution and degradation of the environment, promoting awareness on safety and health among individual mine workers, and mining communities. The work recommends green technology adoption as a priority to leverage lean production across the multinational mines in Ghana. ...|$|E

40|$|Coal and gangue {{underground}} {{pneumatic separation}} is of key importance for <b>green</b> <b>mining.</b> Two kinds of arrangement schemes for high-pressure value used in pneumatic separation system are proposed in this study. Pneumatic separation effects are examined under different arrangement of high-pressure value.

In the following analysis, the effects of gangue diameter (d), conveyor velocity (v 0), and the height difference between conveyor belt and air nozzle (hp) are mainly considered. The numerical simulation and experimental results indicate that pneumatic separation effects under the condition of u and v 0 being in the opposite direction will be better than that of u and v 0 being in the same direction. The pneumatic separation distance ΔS shows a decreasing trend with the increasing of the three factors. The study also shows that gangue diameter has the most significant influence on separation distance, followed by conveyor velocity v 0 and height difference hp...|$|E
40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} {{acquisition of information}} about the dynamic characteristics of coalface overburden can provide an important theoretical basis for <b>green</b> <b>mining</b> in coal producing regions in western China. In this study, a novel method for comprehensively detecting the dynamic behavior of coalface overburden is proposed in order to address deficiencies of the existing detection methods. The new method combines surface radon measurement, overburden borehole imaging, and underground pressure observation into a comprehensive detection technology system, resulting in spatial and temporal integration of surface, overburden, and underground detection. To examine the feasibility of the proposed method, a field experiment was carried out at # 1103 coalface in the Suancigou Coal Mine, which is operated by the Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal Co. Ltd. The results of the three approaches are largely consistent and they complement one another. But it must be pointed out that this method needs to be further improved by more field experiments. Based on the experimental results, a technique for forced caving by presplit blasting of the overburden was developed and then implemented to # 1103 coalface. The practical use of the technique led to good results: it effectively prevented roof-associated accidents by controlling the first weighting step to about 82 m, contributing to safe {{and efficient}} mining; coal production was expected to increase about 126 kilotons...|$|E
