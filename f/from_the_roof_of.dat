5|$|During {{the parade}} {{for the new}} {{governor}} of Judea, Valerius Gratus, loose tiles fall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> Judah's house. Gratus is thrown from his spooked horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge.|$|E
5|$|Sestero recalls in {{his book}} The Disaster Artist that Wiseau {{intended}} for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, {{at the outset of}} production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. However, this scene did not end up being created for the film.|$|E
5|$|The office {{moved to}} the fourth floor of the U.S. Federal Building {{now known as the}} U.S. Public Building on March 16, 1905. The {{building}} was expanded in the late 1920s and the U.S. Weather Bureau {{moved to the}} fourth floor of the new annex on November 13, 1930. In additions to the regular surface observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, the office started taking PIBAL observations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the building.|$|E

60|$|Murder! that is {{what the}} cheiromantist had seen there. Murder! The very night seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear. The dark corners of the streets were full of it. It grinned at him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses.|$|R
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|Debby also dropped up to 12inches (30.5mm) of {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico {{in less than}} 48hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3inches (7.62mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63inches (32mm) in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16inches (31mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17inches (43mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5inches (127mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor car accidents. There were 406homes affected from the flooding, 5of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly {{responsible for the death}} of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a satellite dish <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> his home.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, and {{the siege}} of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael's Church was damaged whilst being used as an {{explosive}} store and lead was stripped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage {{to much of the}} town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of {{the siege of}} Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} rest for the besieged now. It was a {{constant}} duel between their rifles and the guns, varied by their occasionally turning their attention to men who climbed trees, or who, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> some buildings still standing, endeavored to keep down their fire.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly a great cry arose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temples; a cry {{of alarm}} and warning that, taken up from point to point, ran off {{to the east and}} to <b>the</b> west, <b>from</b> temple, court, and rampart, until it sounded as a dim echo in the distance.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 2008, Speight's {{body was}} {{discovered}} hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> MacMillan House, adjacent to London's Paddington Station, hidden from public view, six days after he died. The discovery was made by railway workers at 10:00am, and British Transport Police confirmed that the body was Speight's on 14 April 2008. An inquest into his death opened on 16 April 2008, and a post-mortem confirmed {{the cause of death}} as hanging. It was then adjourned until 20 May. The police said Speight may have used a sixth floor fire exit to get to the area where he was found.|$|E

5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons at it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> {{a house in the}} Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine gun on the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|The smooth, {{thick-walled}} elliptical spores typically measure 7.5–10 by 5–7µm. They have {{a narrow}} germ pore. The mushroom {{does not produce}} a spore print, but the spores are yellow-brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are hyaline (translucent), club-shaped, usually four-spored (some are two-spored), and measure 17–21 by 6–8.2µm. Pseudoparaphyses (cells that grow down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> locules, and often end up connecting the roof and {{the floor of the}} locule) are abundant in the gleba; they measure about 16 by 12.5µm. Cystidia are yellowish to brownish, thin-walled, with dimensions of 60–100 by 15–25µm. The peridium is made of two distinct tissue layers. The epicutis comprises narrow, gelatinous interwoven hyphae in a layer that is 15–50µm. Underneath the epicutis is the subcutis, which consists of thin-walled hyphae up to 12µm in diameter. All hyphae are inamyloid, and all have clamp connections.|$|E
50|$|Hurricane Alicia was {{notable for}} the delayed post storm {{evacuation}} of Galveston Island (since {{the eye of}} the storm traveled the evacuation route up Interstate 45 from Galveston to Houston). The hurricane was also notable for the shattering of many windows in downtown Houston by loose gravel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> new skyscrapers and by other debris, prompting changes to rooftop construction codes.|$|R
50|$|The cloister {{was built}} {{to the south of}} the church. It was meant to {{reinforce}} the walls of the first four bays of the church, but these bays were never built. It is rectangular, 27 meters long and 24 meters wide. In the center is a cistern which collected rainwater through pipes and channels <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastery buildings.|$|R
50|$|The race {{attracted}} {{an estimated}} 60,000 fans, {{half of those}} watched for free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> surrounding buildings and by breaking down barriers. After a five-hour delay due to insurance issues with the safety barriers around the course, only 39 of the scheduled 73 laps took place due to darkness. Only 16 of the 29 cars entered, completed the race.|$|R
5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters {{on the roof of}} tower blocks.|$|E
