40|$|The common aim of {{the long}} and triple jumps is to attain maximum {{horizontal}} distance {{from the front of}} the take-off board. This is achieved by converting some of the horizontal velocity developed in the approach run into vertical velocity at take-off. The aim of this thesis was to examine a theoretical model and to identify kinematic and kinetic factors that facilitate the generation of vertical velocity in the long and triple <b>jump</b> <b>take-offs.</b> A pivot mechanism was defined to act between touch-down and the instant the centre of mass was directly above the toe of the support foot. This mechanism was found to be the largest contributor to the gain in vertical velocity in all take-offs, accounting for 83. 0 % in the long jump and 63. 7 %, 69. 8 % and 70. 7 % in the hop, step and <b>jump</b> <b>take-offs.</b> The contribution of the pivot to the gain in vertical velocity at take-off in the long jump was significantly greater than in each of the triple <b>jump</b> <b>take-offs,</b> (all P< 0. 002). A relative momentum approach was used to determine the contribution of the free limbs to the generation of vertical velocity. In the long jump, the free limbs made a 10. 8 % contribution to the gain in vertical velocity, compared to 12. 2 %, 19. 0 % and 19. 0 % in the triple <b>jump</b> <b>take-offs.</b> Multiple regressiona nalysesw ere used to identify factors relating to the generationo f vertical velocity in the long jump (n= 14). The greatestg ains in vertical velocity were associatedw ith techniquest hat emphasiseda low centre of mass and extended knee joint at touch-down and the ability to resist knee flexion in the compression phase, R 2 = 72. 7 %. The greatest losses in horizontal velocity were associated with excessiveh ip adduction, less hip extensiona nd greater increasesin height from touchdown to take-ofll R 2 = 84. 5 %. Ground reaction forces and net joint moments were measured during short approach running jump tests. Peak vertical impact forces were greater in simulated `drop' take-offs, 5080 N, compared to those experienced in `flat' approach take-offs, 3250 N, (P=O. 002). Peak horizontal braking forces were 1800 N in both types of take-off. However, the peak net joint moments about the ankle, (403 N. m and 387 N. m), knee (233 N. m and 296 N. m) and hip (292 N. m and 249 N. m) were similar between the `flat' and `drop' take-offs. This suggests that athletes adapt their technique in the `drop' take-off to distribute the larger forces effectively and to keep the net joint moments within controllable limits. Results indicated that strength about the ankle joint was particularly important in both types of take-off, but depending on the athlete's technique strength about the knee and hip are also vital. Greater flexion of the knee joint at touch-down and maximum knee flexion were found to be associated with greater average knee moments, R 2 = 30. 8 % and 75. 5 % respectively, and greater angles of leg placement were moderately associated with greater average hip moments, R 2 = 23. 5 %. In conclusion, this thesis has provided a greater insight into the kinetics and kinematics of jumping for distance. It has quantified the contribution made by the pivot mechanism and the free limbs to the generation of vertical velocity, and has assessetdh e demandso n the musculoskeletal system in terms of ground reaction forces and net joint moments. The results indicate that elite performers cannot rely on speed alone, and that strength and technique are major factors of successful performance...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the jumpingmechanisms and strategies of adult caddis flies, leg morphology and movements were analysed in three species with mean masses of 3. 9 to 38 mg. Two distinct jumping strategies were found. First (67 % of 90 <b>jumps),</b> <b>take-off</b> was propelled solely {{by the middle}} and hind legs while the wings remained closed. Second (33 % of jumps), the same leg movements were combined with wing movements before take-off. The hind legs were 70 % and the middle legs were 50 % longer than the front legs and represented 105 % and 88 %, respectively, of body length. Both hind and middle trochantera were depressed together, approximately 15 ms before take-off. The front legs apparently did not contribute to thrust in either strategy and {{were the first to}} be lifted from the ground. The hind legswere the next to lose contact, so that the middle legs alone provided the final thrust before <b>take-off.</b> <b>Jumping</b> performance did not differ significantly in the two jumping strategies or between species, in acceleration times (range of means for the three species 14. 5 – 15. 4 ms), take-off velocities (range 0. 7 – 1 m s− 1) and trajectory angles. A significant difference in jumps propelled only by the legswas the lowerangle (9. 3 ± 1. 9 deg) of the body relative to the horizontal at <b>take-off</b> compared with <b>jumps</b> involvingwingmovements (35. 3 ± 2. 5 deg).

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the biarticular long head and monoarticular lateral {{head of the}} triceps brachii function in goats (Capra hircus) during jumping and landing. Elbow moment and work were measured from high-speed video and ground reaction force (GRF) recordings. Muscle activation and strain were measured via electromyography and sonomicrometry, and muscle stress was estimated from elbow moment and by partitioning stress based on its relative strain rate. Elbow joint and muscle function were compared among three types of limb usage: <b>jump</b> <b>take-off</b> (lead limb), the step prior to <b>jump</b> <b>take-off</b> (lag limb), and landing. We predicted that the strain and work patterns in the monoarticular lateral head would follow the kinematics and work of the elbow more closely than would those of the biarticular long head. In general this prediction was supported. For instance, the lateral head stretched (5 ± 2 %; mean ± SE) in the lead and lag limbs to absorb work during elbow flexion and joint work absorption, while the long head shortened (− 7 ± 1 %) to produce work. During elbow extension, both muscles shortened by similar amounts (− 10 ± 2 % long; − 13 ± 4 % lateral) in the lead limb to produce work. Both triceps heads functioned similarly in landing, stretching (13 ± 3 % in the long head and 19 ± 5 % in the lateral) to absorb energy. In general, the long head functioned to produce power at the shoulder and elbow, while the lateral head functioned to resist elbow flexion and absorb work, demonstrating that functional diversification can arise between mono- and biarticular muscle agonists operating at the same joint...|$|E

Each athlete performed five different take-off movements (running, acceleration running - second step, long <b>jump</b> <b>take-off,</b> high <b>jump</b> <b>take-off</b> and take-off to the hurdle). System Qualisys was used to analyze the kinematics of the support limb. Dynamics of the support phase was monitored via force plate.

Results: Dynamic characteristic showed significant differences in take-off (p&#x 202 F;<&#x 202 F;. 001). This variability is caused by differences in kinematic parameters at the instant of touch-down, minimum joint angles and take-off. The most important finding was different variability in range of motion in eccentric or concentric phases of each jump. Vertically orientated jumps are terminated in a higher degree of extension. Horizontal take-off types are characterized by the highest ranges of motion especially in the ankle joint.

The physiological tests included: 1 RM squat, squat jump with weight equal to 40 % of their 1 RM squat weight, unweighted squat jump, countermovement jumps, countermovement jumps with arm swing, chin-ups, brutal bench and a modified sit and reach test. Results While performing the 720 ° rotations the riders had significantly higher jumping height and AT than during the 360 ° jumps. No significant correlations were found between the best subjectively judged 720 ° and jumping height, jumping length or AT. None of the physiological tests results produced significant correlations with subjectively judged snowboard performance. Conclusions When the participants performed a higher degree of rotation, jumping height and AT increased significantly. No relationships were observed between jumping height, jumping length, or AT with subjectively judged snowboard jump performance. It is believed that the rank of the best 720 ° was primarily based on the athletes’ personal riding style. The physiological tests showed no relationship to the subjectively judged snowboard jump performance. Other factors such as psychology, technique and coordination might be more important for performance...|$|R
