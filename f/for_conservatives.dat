5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat <b>for</b> <b>conservatives,</b> the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the ordination of women as lay elders.|$|E
25|$|Politics in late Victorian Britain {{moved in}} {{directions}} that Spencer disliked, and his arguments provided so much ammunition <b>for</b> <b>conservatives</b> and individualists in Europe and America {{that they are}} still in use in the 21st century. The expression 'There Is No Alternative' (TINA), made famous by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer.|$|E
25|$|The liberal {{policies}} of Presiding Bishop Hines and the General Conventions of 1967 and 1969 {{led to a}} conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became an easy target <b>for</b> <b>conservatives,</b> who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by John M. Allin, the bishop of Mississippi and a conservative.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Prussian constitutional conflict, the opposition between liberals and conservatives in Berlin reached its peak. Suspected of supporting parliamentarians against William I, the Crown Prince and his wife were subjected to harsh criticism. The trip that the couple made to the Mediterranean in October 1862 aboard Queen Victoria's yacht served as a pretext <b>for</b> <b>conservatives</b> to accuse Frederick of abandoning his father in a time of great political tension. They also emphasised the fact that the Crown Prince traveled aboard a foreign vessel escorted by an English warship.|$|E
25|$|Prominent {{projects}} were the Lincoln Tunnel, the Triborough Bridge, the LaGuardia Airport, the Overseas Highway and the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. The Rural Electrification Administration used co-ops to bring electricity to rural areas, {{many of which}} still operate. The National Youth Administration was another the semi-autonomous WPA program for youth. Its Texas director, Lyndon Baines Johnson, later used the NYA {{as a model for}} some of his Great Society programs in the 1960s. The WPA was organized by states, but New York City had its own branch Federal One, which created jobs for writers, musicians, artists, and theater personnel. It became a hunting ground <b>for</b> <b>conservatives</b> searching for Communist employees.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{operated}} {{parochial schools}} primarily {{to maintain their}} religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, but they always had extensive coverage of religion. Most German Catholic children by 1910 attended schools taught entirely in English. In the 199x–1930 era, German Catholics generally voted for the Liberal ticket (rather than the Provincial Rights and Conservative tickets), seeing Liberals as more willing to protect religious minorities. Occasionally they voted <b>for</b> <b>Conservatives</b> or independent candidates who offered greater support for public funding of parochial schools. Nazi Germany made a systematic effort to proselytize among Saskatchewan's Germans in the 1930s. Fewer that 1% endorsed their message, but some did migrate back to Germany before anti-Nazi sentiment became overwhelming in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Conservatives united {{behind the}} 1964 presidential {{campaign}} of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater (1919–1998), though his campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. Goldwater published The Conscience of a Conservative (1960), a bestselling book that explained modern conservative theory. Goldwater was significantly weakened by his unpopular views regarding social security, income tax, {{and the war}} in Vietnam. In Tennessee, he suggested selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, which was a favorite <b>for</b> <b>conservatives</b> in its region. He voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thereby winning the support of Southern segregationists. Support for the campaign came from numerous grassroots activists, such as Phyllis Schlafly and the newly formed Young Americans for Freedom, sponsored by Buckley to mobilize conservatives. Buckley himself tried to win the 1965 mayoral election of New York, but failed.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often {{members of the}} United States Republican Party), despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical <b>for</b> <b>conservatives,</b> such as being pro-choice and an atheist.

500|$|Subcontracting cooperatives to peasants {{became the}} norm by the late-1970s and was legalised in 1981. <b>For</b> <b>conservatives</b> this policy {{was similar to}} that of Lenin's New Economic Policy, a {{temporary}} break from hardline socialist development. However, those who supported reforms saw subcontracting as another way of implementing socialism in agriculture, which was justified by the ideological tenet of the [...] "three interests".

500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: [...] "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now I understand what you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it <b>for</b> <b>conservatives</b> like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan {{released}} a report titled , asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended {{and that there is}} little evidence that these efforts have been successful. In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that [...] "penalize families for getting ahead" [...] and that [...] "the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates," [...] both of which [...] "reduce the incentive to work". At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In an appendix titled [...] "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements [...] " [...] implications for both conservatives and liberals. <b>For</b> <b>conservatives,</b> this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones." [...] According to an article in the Fiscal Times, several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.|$|E
