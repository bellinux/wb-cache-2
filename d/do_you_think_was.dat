6000|$|... "They got Collins," [...] Granet said, {{dropping}} his voice {{almost to a}} whisper. [...] "He was shot by my side. They caught me, too. I've been in a few tight corners but nothing tighter than that. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> sent down from the War Office to hold an inquiry? Thomson--that fellow Thomson!" ...|$|E

60|$|It made Peter very miserable, {{and what}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> {{the first thing}} he did? Sitting on the rail {{at the foot of the}} bed, he played a {{beautiful}} lullaby to his mother on his pipe. He had made it up himself out of the way she said 'Peter,' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and what}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> {{the first thing}} I was {{conscious}} of next morning--my old Colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon. If you knew my Colonel you'd still believe in things. There is something, you know, behind all this evil. After all, you can only die once, and if it's for your country all the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|But when {{he reached}} the Manor House his {{daughter}} met him with news of her own which for the moment kept his news in abeyance. [...] "Oh, papa," [...] she said, [...] "I am so glad you've come!" [...] He had sent her a telegram {{to say that he was}} coming.

I have had many since I married. And how long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> my first? A day! I was a foreman then, and the wedding was at six o'clock in the morning. We went into the country, the wife and I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You satirical creature!" [...] {{she burst}} out gayly. [...] "If you had lived a dull life at St. Domingo, {{you would have}} taken to spoiling paper too. I might really have turned out an artist, if I had been clever and industrious like you. As it was, I learned a little drawing--and got tired of it. I tried {{modeling}} in wax--and got tired of it. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> my teacher? One of our slaves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he don't alter," [...] Ellen declared, {{looking back}} from the door, [...] "you'll find him here one day by Carter Patterson's, with a label around his neck. I'm not one for keeping {{children}} about the place that know more than their mothers. I give him another three weeks, and not a day longer. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> {{the last thing he}} did? Went and had his hair cut--wanted to get rid of his curl, he said." ...|$|E

Why, those big, fat nuts were {{rattling}} {{down to the ground}} on every side, just as if Old Mother West Wind was shaking the tree as hard as she could. But Old Mother West Wind wasn't there at all. No, Sir, there wasn't even one of the Merry Little Breezes up in the tree-tops. The big fat nuts were rattling down just on account of the dreadful quarrel of Striped Chipmunk's two foolish cousins, Happy Jack and Chatterer.|$|E

This dead man has {{been killed in a}} duel--he, the desperate, the miserable, has died in the commission of mortal sin; and the men who saw the killing of him ask us Capuchins, holy men, servants of Heaven, children of our lord the Pope--they ask us to give him burial!

6000|$|Mercy, and {{the revelation}} thereof, {{is the only}} {{antidote}} against sin. It is of a thawing nature; it will loose the heart that is frozen up in sin; yea, it will make the unwilling willing to come to Jesus Christ for life. Wherefore, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> it that Jesus Christ told the adulterous woman, and that before so many sinners, {{that he had not}} condemned her, but to allure her, with them there present, to hope to find favour at his hands? (As he also saith in another place, [...] "I came not to judge, but to save the world.") For might they not thence most rationally conclude, that if Jesus Christ had rather save than damn an harlot, there was encouragement for them to come to him for mercy.|$|E
6000|$|As for {{the notion}} that foreigners hate us because we have beaten them so often, my dear sir, this is the {{greatest}} error in the world: well-educated Frenchmen DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BEATEN THEM. A man was once ready to call me out in Paris because I said that we had beaten the French in Spain; and here before me is a French paper, with a London correspondent discoursing about Louis Buonaparte and his jackass expedition to Boulogne. [...] "He was received at Eglintoun, it is true," [...] says the correspondent, [...] "but what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the reason? Because the English nobility were anxious to revenge upon his person (with some coups de lance) the checks which the 'grand homme' his uncle had inflicted on us in Spain." ...|$|E

6000|$|While {{we watched}} that craft depart there {{came into my}} mind {{the memory of a}} picture in an old Latin book of my father's, which {{represented}} the souls of the dead being paddled by a person named Charon across a river called the Styx. The scene before us bore a great resemblance to that picture. There was Charon's boat floating on the dreadful Styx. Yonder glowed the lights of the world, here was the gloomy, unknown shore. And we, we were the souls of the dead awaiting the last destruction at the teeth and claws of some unknown monster, such as that which haunts the recesses of the Egyptian hell. Oh! the parallel was painfully exact. And yet, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the remark of that irrepressible young man Stephen? ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{worry is}} one of the worst things in the world, and it didn't seem as if there was {{anything}} that Danny Meadow Mouse need worry about. But you know it is the easiest thing in the world to find something to worry over and make yourself uncomfortable about. And when you make yourself uncomfortable, you are almost sure to make everyone around you equally uncomfortable. It was so with Danny Meadow Mouse. Striped Chipmunk had twice called him [...] "Cross Patch" [...] that morning, and Johnny Chuck, who had fought Reddy Fox for him the day before, had called him [...] "Grumpy." [...] And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the matter with Danny Meadow Mouse? Why, he was worrying because his tail was short. Yes, sir, that is all that ailed Danny Meadow Mouse that bright morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Do not you {{be frightened}} or downhearted, Mrs. Dr. dear,' she said gently. 'I felt {{somewhat}} that way myself last night, and I rose from {{my bed and}} lighted my lamp and opened my Bible; and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> the first verse my eyes lighted upon? It was 'And they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, saith the Lord of Hosts, to deliver thee.' I am not gifted {{in the way of}} dreaming, as Miss Oliver is, but I knew then and there, Mrs. Dr. dear, that it was a manifest leading, and that Hindenburg will never see Paris. So I read no further but went back to my bed and I did not waken at three o'clock or at any other hour before morning.' ...|$|E
