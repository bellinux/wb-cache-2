40|$|Abstract. A {{method to}} {{determine}} the condensing temperature set point of air-cooled refrigeration system with an <b>electronic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> was discussed in this paper. This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed <b>electronic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of expansion valve allows more refrigerant flowing through the expansion valve into evaporator. This feature offers an opportunity to lower the condensing temperature via increasing opening of expansion valve to enhance refrigeration efficiency and in the same time designed cooling capacity can be maintained at low ambient temperature. In this case it is supposed that the installed electronic expansion valve’s capacity was larger than the evaporator’s, and in fact that occurs frequently in refrigeration system designing. The benefits of this method could include: the capacity of <b>electronic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is fully utilized, the refrigeration system will operate at a lower condensing pressure and the power consumption of compressor can decrease, hence the improvement of system efficiency is predictable...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an approach for identifying critical model parameters in dynamic air-conditioning systems using limited sensor information. The expansion valve {{model and the}} compressor model parameters {{play a crucial role}} in the system model's accuracy. In the past, these parameters have been estimated using a mass flow meter; however, this is an expensive devise and at times, impractical. In response to these constraints, a novel method to estimate the unknown parameters of the expansion valve model and the compressor model is developed. A gray box model obtained by augmenting the expansion valve model, the evaporator model, and the compressor model is used. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and Simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters of the expansion valve model and the compressor model. This parameter estimation is done by minimizing the error between the model output and the experimental systems output. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares algorithm was more robust for this estimation problem than the Simplex search algorithm. In this thesis, two types of expansion valves, the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> and the Thermostatic Expansion Valve, are considered. The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve</b> model is a static model due to its dynamics being much faster than the systems dynamics; the Thermostatic expansion valve model, however, is a dynamic one. The parameter estimation algorithm developed is validated on two different experimental systems to confirm the practicality of its approach. Knowing the model parameters accurately can lead to a better model for control and fault detection applications. In addition to parameter estimation, this thesis also provides and validates a simple usable mathematical model for the Thermostatic expansion valve...|$|E
