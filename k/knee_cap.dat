5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> slips out of place.|$|E
25|$|Is caused {{from the}} {{inflammation}} of a sac {{in the front}} of the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> which swells up and can be painful. Preventing this can be done by wearing a knee pad to help reduce impact on the knee.|$|E

25|$|A bull {{appears to}} gore the horse from underneath. The bull's head is formed mainly by the horse's entire front leg {{which has the}} knee on the ground. The leg's <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> forms the head's nose. A horn appears within the horse's breast.|$|E
25|$|Chihuahuas {{are also}} known for luxating patella, a genetic {{condition}} that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.|$|E
25|$|As in the First and Fourth Tests Australia {{were left}} to improve a large first innings lead and set England a target with a declaration. Rick McCosker was caught by wicketkeeper off Arnold on 16/1, but there were few other {{problems}} for the home side who ended the day on 111/2. England could have taken more wickets as Fletcher and Cowdrey both dropped Ian Chappell, who hit Underwood for six, then made an indecisive drive-sweep that skied the ball to Knott for 41. In the intervening rest day the players were invited to the Barossa Valley vineyard of 'Windy' Hill-Smith, where Jeff Thomson sprained his shoulder playing tennis. The following day he found {{that he could not}} raise his bowling arm and that he was out of cricket {{for the rest of the}} series, having taken a remarkable 33 wickets (17.93) in four and a half Tests. To balance the books Bob Willis was also out for the rest of the series with his recurring <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> injury. Redpath and Greg Chappell lasted the day, but were both out in the morning to Underwood (4/102) to leave Australia 133/4 as only 24 runs were scored in the first 12 overs of the day. Doug Walters (71 not out) and Rod Marsh (55) were more aggressive and took 10 runs off one Underwood over. Marsh swept the spinner, once for six, twice to see Knott spill a running catch and third to be caught by Greig. Chappell waited for a few more overs before declaring at 272/5, 404 runs ahead with 500 minutes of play left, very similar to the situation at Sydney.|$|E

These are generally considered blemishes.|$|R
500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either {{malformation}} or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to [...] "luxate" [...] (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain {{is caused by the}} <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc.|$|E
500|$|What I went through, only I {{will ever}} know. My <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E
500|$|In June, after batting [...]336 with 23 RBI in 107 at-bats, he {{suffered}} a small <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> fracture against the Houston Astros by running into the wall tracking a fly ball in right field. [...] The team placed him {{on the disabled list}} (DL) with an expected intermission of about six weeks. [...] The healing of the fracture stagnated throughout the season, however, and swelling persisted around the knee, slowing Craig's rehabilitation. [...] Nevertheless, he regularly strengthened the muscles around his patella and was cleared to play after passing a battery of medical tests. [...] He also spent extra time warming up his knee before each game. [...] After his return, Craig hit [...]290 in 35 games. [...] He ended the regular season with a [...]315 batting average, 15 doubles, 11 home runs, 40 RBI, and a [...]555 slugging percentage in 75 games and 219 PA.|$|E

(e.g. expandable baton, baton, pepper spray, Taser, beanbag rounds, rubber fin stabilized ammunition, Mace (spray), police dogs, etc.) Intermediate weapon techniques are designed to impact muscles, arms and legs, and intentionally using an intermediate weapon on the head, neck, groin, <b>knee</b> <b>caps,</b> or spine would be classified as deadly or lethal force.|$|R
50|$|Bobby Leach (born 1858 in Cornwall, United Kingdom; died April 26, 1926 in New Zealand) was {{the second}} person to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel, after Annie Taylor, and {{the first man to}} do so, {{accomplishing}} the feat on July 25, 1911. He spent six months in the hospital recovering from injuries he sustained during the fall, which included two broken <b>knee</b> <b>caps</b> and a fractured jaw. Leach had been a performer with the Barnum and Bailey Circus and was no stranger to stunting. Prior to his trip over the falls he owned a restaurant on Bridge Street and would boast to customers that anything Annie could do, he could do better.|$|R

500|$|At the {{completion}} of the 1888baseball season, Albert Spalding organized an around-the-world tour to promote the game of baseball. [...] The two teams Spalding selected were the White Stockings and a collection of players from other National League teams. [...] The tour departed on October20, 1888 to play exhibition games throughout the western United States for a month, before departing to Hawaii. [...] The tour visited several foreign countries, such as Australia, Egypt, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), France, Italy, and England. [...] It was during a game played on at the Parc Aristotique in Paris, France on March8, 1889, when Williamson suffered a torn <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> which forced him to be bedridden in England on doctor's orders, missing the tour through Britain. [...] Though players in the 19th century were responsible for their own medical care, Williamson asked Spalding to help him financially with the mounting medical costs. [...] Spalding refused, citing that he was not obligated to assist, and Williamson never forgave him for this.|$|E
500|$|In the World Series, Craig {{debuted in}} Game 1 by hitting a two-out, go-ahead pinch-hit single off Texas Rangers' pitcher Alexi Ogando's fastball. [...] The next night, La Russa again summoned Craig to pinch hit against Ogando. [...] This time, he lined a [...] fastball to right field {{to break a}} {{scoreless}} tie. [...] On that single, he joined Dusty Rhodes, Del Unser and Hal McRae as the only players to collect pinch-hit RBI in three consecutive postseason at bats. [...] He also joined Duke Snider and Amos Otis as the only hitters with the go-ahead hit in the sixth inning or later in consecutive World Series games. [...] Further, Craig became the first player with two go-ahead RBIs as a pinch-hitter in World Series play. [...] After hitting the go-ahead home run in Game 7, he caught the last out of the Series, helping to secure the Cardinals' eleventh World Series championship. [...] That home run tied a World Series record Kiki Cuyler and Hank Greenberg shared with three game-winning RBI. [...] For the series, Craig appeared in all seven games, collected five hits in 19 at-bats (.263 batting average), three home runs and five RBI for a [...]737 slugging percentage. [...] His totals in the 2011 postseason included [...]622 slugging percentage and 1.013 on-base plus slugging (OPS).

40|$|Simulations of bipedal walking {{showed that}} the {{evolution}} of stable gaits can be greatly facilitated by harnessing design solutions inspired by those of biological organisms. Three such areas are addressed in this paper: a) the use of passive dynamics such as free-swinging lower legs, <b>knee</b> <b>caps</b> and springy ankles, b) proportional derivative controllers (or their variants) as actuators, and c) a modular, specifically coupled neural controller architecture. It is shown that an appropriate implementation of these components greatly improves the speed of evolution – stable straight line walking is typically achieved in substantially less than 100 generations. Moreover, compared to earlier experiments, {{the quality of the}} solutions arrived at is more satisfying with respect to their resemblance to human body dynamics during walking. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{uniform of}} the British army consisted of the traditional red coat with cocked hats, white breeches and black gaiters with leather <b>knee</b> <b>caps.</b> Hair was usually cut short or fixed in plaits {{at the top of}} the head. As the war progressed many line regiments replaced their cocked hats with slouch hats. The full [...] "marching order" [...] a line infantryman was expected to carry on campaign was extensive, and British soldiers often dropped much of their equipment before battle. Soldiers were also issued with greatcoats to be worn in adverse conditions, which were often used as tents or blankets. Drummers usually wore colours in reverse of their regimental colour, they carried the coat of arms of their colonel and wore mitre caps. Most German regiments wore dark blue coats, while cavalry and loyalists often wore green.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{having just}} {{established}} himself as England's primary bowling strikeforce, he suffered a most appalling knee injury on 10 February 1992, in Wellington, New Zealand, while playing for his country. In {{the middle of his}} delivery stride, his left patella (<b>knee</b> <b>cap)</b> shattered, the noise of it reaching as far as the boundary; spectators said the sound of his knee splitting was [...] "like a pistol shot". Lawrence collapsed to the ground screaming in extreme agony, and was eventually carried from the field on a stretcher, comforted by team mate Ian Botham. Despite two come-back attempts for his county, including the first after a full thirteen months of recuperation, when the knee cracked yet again during a gymnasium work-out, he was never able to play for England again and was eventually forced to retire from the sport at the age of 29.|$|E

40|$|Pressure ulcer (also {{known as}} {{pressure}} sore, bedsore, ischemia, decubitus ulcer) {{is a global}} challenge for today’s healthcare society. Found in several locations {{in the human body}} such as the sacrum, heel, back of the head, shoulder, <b>knee</b> <b>caps,</b> it occurs when soft tissues are under continuous loading and a subject’s mobility is restricted (bedbound/chair bound). Blood flow in soft tissues becomes insufficient leading to tissue necrosis (cell death) and pressure ulcer. The subject’s physiological parameters (age, body mass index) and types of body support surface materials (mattress) are also factors in the formation of pressure ulcer. The economic impacts of these are huge, and the subject’s quality of life is reduced in many ways. There are several methods of detecting and preventing ulceration in human body. Detection depends on assessing local pressure on tissue and prevention on scales of risk used to assess a subject prior to admission. There are also various types of mattresses (air cushioned/liquid filled/foam) available to prevent ulceration. But, despite this work, pressure ulcers remain common. This article reviews the aetiology, cost, detection and prevention of these ulcers...|$|R

50|$|The discovery’s {{significance}} lay {{not only}} in Selam’s antiquity, but also in her age at death. Although relatively complete infant skeletons have been recovered for more recent human species, not a single juvenile skeleton has been found {{for any of the}} species in the preceding millions of years. Most of these early finds consist of nothing more than a skull, a piece of jaw or some isolated teeth. In contrast to these relatively sparse finds, not only was the DRP team able to recover Selam’s complete skull, but also a sandstone impression of her brain and even the hyoid bone. Due to the fragility of the hyoid, such a discovery in a species of Selam’s antiquity is almost completely unprecedented. The team was able to recover a significant portion of Selam’s bones below the neck as well, including most of the spinal column, the ribs, both collar bones and both shoulder blades. These bones are almost completely absent in the fossil record, except for fragmentary pieces from Lucy.
