5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
25|$|Although {{adoption}} of wine consumption {{is not recommended}} by some health authorities, a significant volume of research indicates moderate consumption, such as one <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> a day for women and two for men, may confer health benefits. Emerging evidence is that wine polyphenols such as resveratrol provide physiological benefit, whereas alcohol itself may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system.

The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.|$|E

25|$|In February 1900, Grand Duke Andrei {{was invited}} by his brothers, Grand Dukes Kirill and Boris, {{to a dinner}} party {{at the house of}} Mathilde Kschessinska. Kschessinska, the Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Mariinsky Theatre, was the eldest among the three most {{prominent}} dancers of her generation at the Imperial Russian Ballet, along with Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina. Grand Duke Andrei sat next to his hostess during the dinner, but accidentally spilt a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> on her. Mathilde, attracted to the young grand duke, seven years her junior, took the incident as good omen. Age 28, Mathilde had been the mistress of Tsar Nicholas II when he was heir to the throne. Their two-year relationship ended with Nicholas' engagement to his future wife, Alexandra. Mathilde was ambitious and eager to maintain her close relationship with the Romanovs. She subsequently began a long time affair with Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Nicholas and Andrei's first cousin once removed. As she was not in love with Sergei, but enjoyed his company and protection, Mathilde pursued a relationship with Grand Duke Andrei, the third Romanov to become involved with her. By July 1900, they became lovers, traveling together that summer to Biarritz and Paris. In the autumn 1901, they visited several Italian cities, including Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Grand Duke Sergei tolerated their affair, remaining a close and loyal friend to the famous ballerina, but {{the relationship between the two}} grand dukes grew tense. They tried to avoid each other and maintain civility while sharing the same woman for almost two decades.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 June 2013, {{there were}} tense scenes between sympathizers of the Attack and anti-government demonstrators {{close to the}} {{headquarters}} of the nationalists on Vrabcha Street, with some objects being thrown by both sides. The protesters have accused the Attack leadership of betraying the trust of the people and [...] "phony nationalism" [...] by refusing to vote against the formation of a government that includes the MRF. According to media reports, 3 people suffered light injuries and 1 person was arrested. On 28 October 2013, journalists from the TV7 news channel and Alfa TV (the media anchor of the Ataka party) were prevented from entering the university premises and reporting on the Sofia University occupation by a small number of students, security officers and anti-government demonstrators. In the evening of 8 November 2013, MP Desislav Chukolov and some other members and sympathizers of the Ataka party confronted a group of students who had been overheard chanting [...] "Resignation!" [...] near {{the headquarters of the}} Bulgarian National Television. In the ensuing commotion, a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> was spilled on Chukolov's shirt. Five students were subsequently arrested by the police, but were released on the next day without any charges pressed against them, though Chukolov has stated that he may take the matter to the courts. On 8 January 2014, Attack party deputies entered the Nova TV building and angrily demanded an explanation from protest activists Tsvetozar Valkov and Viktor Stoyanov who were being interviewed by host Milen Tsvetkov. Valkov and Stoyanov were wearing face masks of Volen Siderov and had previously participated in demonstrations in favour of revoking the Attack leader's parliamentary immunity. Nova TV staff emphasized that they had on numerous occasions extended invitations to Attack members to debate with other guests on Tsvetkov's show, but the Attack functionaries had rebuffed them, preferring to go about their endeavour through illegal means.|$|E
60|$|At the {{beginning}} of the night, all the ladies who had accompanied their relatives were separated from them, and put into the women's room; but when morning came they entreated earnestly to return to them, but Mademoiselle de Fausse Lendry was assured that her uncle was safe, and they were told soon after that all who remained were pardoned. About twenty-two ladies were together, and were called to leave the prison, but the two who went first were at once butchered, and the sentry called out to the others, 'It is a snare, go back, do not show yourselves.' They retreated; but Marie de Sombreuil had made her way to her father, and when he was called down into the court, she came with him. She hung round him, beseeching the murderers to have pity on his grey hairs, and declaring that they must strike him only through her. One of the ruffians, touched by her resolution, called out that they should be allowed to pass if the girl would drink {{to the health of the}} nation. The whole court was swimming with blood, and the glass he held out to her was full of something red. Marie would not shudder. She drank, and with the applause of the assassins ringing in her ears, she passed with her father over the threshold of the fatal gates, into such freedom and safety as Paris could then afford. Never again could she see a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> without a shudder, and it was generally believed that it was actually a glass of blood that she had swallowed, though she always averred that this was an exaggeration, and that it had been only her impression before tasting it that so horrible a draught was offered to her.|$|E

40|$|Resveratrol, {{present in}} grapes and <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> is {{reported}} to be a natural chemopreventive agent against cancer. However, the con-centrations required to exert these effects may be difficult to achieve by drinking only 1 or 2 <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> a day. There-fore, developing more potent, nontoxic analogues of resveratrol may provide a feasible means of achieving an effective physiologic concentration. Here we report that the resveratrol analogue, 3, 5, 30, 40, 50 -pentahydroxy-trans-stilbene (RSVL 2), inhibits 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) -induced neoplastic trans-formation in JB 6 P 1 mouse epidermal cells. Further, we identi-fied MEK/ERK signaling as the direct molecular target for the anticancer effects of RSVL 2 and demonstrated that RSVL 2 inhib-ited MEK 1, but not Raf 1 or ERK 2 kinase activity. RSVL 2 also dose-dependently suppressed MEK 1 kinase activity induced by TPA and the inhibition of H-Ras-induced cell transformation was much stronger for RSVL 2 than for PD 098059 or resveratrol. Both in vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays indicated that RSVL 2, but not resveratrol, directly bound with GST-MEK 1, but did not com-pete with ATP for binding. Docking data indicated that the low in-hibitory activity of resveratrol might be {{due to the lack of}} the hydroxyl group at the meta position of the B ring, thereby pre-venting resveratrol from forming a hydrogen bond with the back-bone amide group of Ser 212, which is the key interaction for stabi-lizing the inactive conformation of the activation loop...|$|R
