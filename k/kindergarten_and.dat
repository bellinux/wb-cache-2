40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify {{characteristics}} and shifts of discussions on the relationship between <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries in occupied Japan. To achieve this goal, this study analyzed articles of “Youji no Kyoiku (Early Childhood Care and Education) ”. The result indicated that discussions can be classified into four stages: (1) From 1946 to the mid- 1947, various groups of the society discussed actively about the relationship <b>and</b> unification of <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries. (2) From mid- 1947 to 1948, as a result of the enactment of the School Education Law and Child Welfare Act, the ECCE system was divided into two distinct forms of institutions: <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries, but it was argued at the same time that educational contents of <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries should be similar. (3) In 1949, ministry officials reemphasized fundamental differences between <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries. (4) Likewise, after 1950, educators and experts started also look at some differences between <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries. In conclusion, this study revealed that debates on the relationship between <b>kindergartens</b> <b>and</b> day nurseries in occupied Japan varied over time and varied depending on the status and influence of social groups involved...|$|R
