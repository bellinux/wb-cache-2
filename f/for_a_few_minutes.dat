5|$|January 17, 1892: At 10:30 am, sleet fell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> only at Madison, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Major {{stars like}} George Raft and Jean-Paul Belmondo were given top billing in the film's {{promotion}} and screen trailers {{despite the fact}} that they only appeared <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3. It may possibly be produced by acting {{with a mixture of}} hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000°C.|$|E
60|$|Carthoris had {{followed}} the creature <b>for</b> but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> when it disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as though dissolved into thin air.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{was absent}} <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Sogrange and the Baroness {{exchanged}} the merest commonplaces. As they all passed {{down the hall}} Sogrange lingered behind.|$|R
50|$|Shrews {{are active}} day and night, but mostly after dark. They are active {{most of the}} time, resting <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> between bursts of activity.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before sinking.|$|E
5|$|Toms ran to {{a nearby}} petrol station for help and a man there gave her his mobile phone to call the police. While making the call, she twice heard Parker cry out in pain. By chance she spotted a passing police car. She entered the car and guided the officer {{to the scene of}} the assault. Although Toms had only been away <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> by the time she {{returned}} Parker had already bled to death and the gang had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 January 2014: The bill {{is finally}} taken up for debate. However, this lasts <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> with the YSR Congress Party MLAs {{resuming}} protests.|$|R
60|$|He strolled on; and Violet, having {{sniffed the}} air <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>minutes</b> with her tip-tilted nose, went indoors to attend to her work.|$|R
60|$|No one moved <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>minutes,</b> {{and then}} with a trooper behind him Sergeant Stimson came in, and laid his hand on Winston's shoulder.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more}} than a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> he was able to get up and walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. He lay on the ice <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before being able to leave the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E
60|$|Those {{on board}} the launch were evidently {{conscious}} that they were likely to lose the race, <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> they began to open fire with their rifles.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{had been}} all she asked <b>for.</b> In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> she turned toward them again. Her sweet voice was steady once more; her eyes rested softly on Horace as she went on.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after Everett's well-received remarks, Lincoln spoke <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> With <b>a</b> [...] "few {{appropriate}} remarks", he {{was able}} to summarize his view of the war in just ten sentences.|$|R
5|$|Roddy Piper was Special Guest Referee for a bout between Jeff Hardy and Scott Hall, {{which was}} the {{following}} contest. After the two fought <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Hardy gained the pinfall victory after he jumped off the top rope and performed a Swanton Bomb, a high-angle front flip from the top rope, onto Hall who was laying flat against the mat. Abyss attacked Hardy after the match finished, and lifted Hardy up onto his shoulders and then dropped to a seated position, a move which Abyss dubbed the Shock Treatment.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{scheduled}} bout was a Three Way Elimination {{match between}} DDP, Kevin Nash, and Monty Brown. The winner of this match {{would go on}} to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. DDP eliminated Nash by performing a dropkick, which caused Nash to fall over the top rope and down to the floor. With Nash eliminated, it was down to Brown and DDP. After the two fought back and forth <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Brown threw DDP against the ropes while he ran against the opposite ropes and performed a running shoulder block {{in the center of the}} ring to complete a move he named the Pounce.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{the contest}} {{will consist of}} an opening {{ceremony}} in which the performers are welcomed to the event, the performances of the entries, a recap of the songs to help televoting viewers decide which entries to vote for, an interval act usually performed after the televoting has closed, {{the results of the}} televoting or back-up jury voting which is then followed by the declaration of the winner and a reprise of the winning song. At various points throughout the show, networks may opt out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to screen a commercial break.|$|E
60|$|On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met <b>for</b> breakfast <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{before the}} others appeared; {{and he took}} the {{opportunity}} of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{lead-acid}} cell can {{be demonstrated}} using sheet lead plates for the two electrodes. However, such a construction produces only around one ampere for roughly postcard-sized plates, and <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|BC Gowrishankar picturised {{the song}} [...] "Mani Mani" [...] in sunset for nine days as the sunset lasts <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Stage actor Mandya Ramesh made his acting debut with this film.|$|R
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> but with Tentacle, {{the team had}} grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.|$|E
5|$|Hamm's second World Cup {{appearance}} {{came during}} the 1995 tournament in Sweden. The United States were led by head coach Tony DiCicco. During the team's first match of the tournament, she scored the team's third goal in the 51st minute in a 3–3 draw against China PR. The U.S. faced Denmark during its second group stage match. Goals from Kristine Lilly and Tiffeny Milbrett led to a 2–0 win for the U.S. Hamm played goalkeeper <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> after Briana Scurry received a red card and {{was removed from the}} match. After defeating Australia 4–1 on June, 10, the U.S. advanced to the knock-out stage and defeated Japan 4–0 in the quarter-final. The U.S. was defeated by eventual champion Norway 1–0 in the semi-finals and captured third place after defeating China PR 2–0 on June 17. Hamm scored the second U.S. goal of the match in the 55th minute.|$|E
60|$|All {{the glow}} and uplift {{went out of}} Faith. Her gladness {{collapsed}} like a pricked balloon. She sat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dismal <b>minutes</b> in silence, facing the consequences of her rash act.|$|R
6000|$|The {{man will}} tell you what has happened. I feel as though I was [...] mad. I do not know who to send to. Will you come to me, only <b>for</b> [...] <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Success {{attended}} their search, <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> Paul and {{the captain}} returned with loads of dry branches, and Olly came back reporting water close at hand, trickling from a crevice in the cliffs.|$|R
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They {{are capable of}} diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E
5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} {{likewise}} {{unprepared for the}} emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{before returning to the}} ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but Titanics passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, Charles Joughin, and his staff to do so. No lifeboat or fire drills had been conducted since Titanic left Southampton. A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} an anxious day, but this makes up for everything," [...] he said. [...] "Now--and it is so long since I have seen you--can't we, <b>for</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> forget our troubles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Peterkin had his wish, <b>for</b> in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{afterwards}} {{fire was}} put to the pile, the roaring flames, ascended, and amid the acclamations of the assembled thousands, the false gods of Mango were reduced to ashes! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I sold it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{sovereign}} {{to a young}} gentleman what inquired <b>for</b> it <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago. <b>A</b> thin, dark chap he is. I don't {{know his}} name, but I've seen him driving with you." ...|$|R
