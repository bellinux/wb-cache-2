25|$|Salt {{is added}} to food, either by the <b>food</b> <b>producer</b> or by the consumer, as a flavor enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent and color developer. The salt {{consumption}} in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy and grain mill products. Salt {{is added to}} promote color development in bacon, ham and other processed meat products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made up of meat, fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as a flavor enhancer and as a tenderizer.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study aims {{to provide an}} understanding of on-farm food waste on conventional and organic farms. Through interviews with <b>food</b> <b>producers,</b> I addressed three research questions: 1) do organic <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> produce more or less waste than conventional <b>food</b> <b>producers?,</b> 2) do <b>food</b> waste management practices differ between organic and conventional <b>food</b> <b>producers?,</b> and 3) What role do <b>producer</b> <b>food</b> waste practices play in agricultural sustainability? I found no conclusive differences between organic and non-organic <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> regarding volume and management of on-farm food waste; however, I found that different farm characteristics intersect in numerous ways, resulting {{in a variety of}} impacts on on-farm food waste. Additionally, all research participants indicated that the factor most likely to encourage them to address on-farm food waste is cost savings. To fully address food waste, actions oriented towards minimizing and sustainably managing food waste must be undertaken in a collaborative manner across all stages of the food supply chain...|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{according to}} which the entire Torah was principally written by Moses, the first tithe is contrasted with the poor tithe, and second tithe, as entirely different tithes from each other, {{and for this reason}} gave the tithes the distinct names they possess; these latter tithes, which are mentioned by the Deuteronomic Code, differ by not covering cattle or fruit, and rather than just going to the Levites, are in one case shared among the poor and other charitable destinations, and in the other go to the <b>food</b> <b>producer</b> themselves. According to some secular scholars, the poor tithe and the second tithe, when taken together, are a conflicting version of the same single tithe as the first tithe; the poor tithe and second tithe together being the Deuteronomist's version and the first time being the version of the priestly source.|$|E
25|$|Cocoa Life Program: FLO-Cert, {{a company}} {{established}} in 1997, which {{is working for}} the improvement of labelled Fairtrade and Mondelēz International, the third greatest <b>food</b> <b>producer</b> in the world, launched in 2012 the Cocoa Life Program. Because the conditions for cocoa farmers haven't changed much in the past 50 years, it is necessary to improve the supply chain. The Cocoa Life Program invests $400m in its cocoa supply chain over the next ten years. Approximately $100m of the money will be spent for the cocoa supply chain in Ivory Coast. This will improve the life of about 75,000 farmers. Furthermore, $100m will be spent to Ghana and the remaining $200m will be shared between Brazil, Dominican Republic and India. The company is not only investigating in the purchase of certificated cocoa, but focus more on the direct investment in the cocoa supply chain. The long-term goal of the Cocoa Life Program are: higher incomes for farmers, authorization, inspiring young people and conserving the environment.|$|E
25|$|Venezuelan {{consumers}} mainly had {{negative feelings}} toward the fingerprint rationing system, stating that it created longer lines; especially when fingerprint machines malfunctioned, {{and that the}} system does nothing to relieve shortages because it only overlooks the large economic changes that the country needed to make. Following {{the announcement of the}} fingerprint system, protests broke out in multiple cities in Venezuela denouncing the proposed move. The MUD opposition coalition called on Venezuelans to reject the new fingerprinting system and called on supporters to hold a nationwide cacerolazo that were primarily heard in traditionally government opposing areas. Students in Zulia state also demonstrated against the proposed system. Lorenzo Mendoza, the president of Empresas Polar, Venezuela's largest <b>food</b> <b>producer,</b> expressed his disagreement with the proposed system, saying it would penalize 28 million Venezuelans for the smuggling carried out by just a few. Days after the announcement, the Venezuelan government scaled back its plans on implementing the new system, saying the system is now voluntary and is only for 23 basic goods.|$|E

How should Swedish fresh <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> further develop and extend their environmental and social actions? Purposes: The {{purposes of this study}} are to describe how Swedish fresh <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> acquire information about consumer expectations, to analyse which environmental and social actions within the CSR concept these producers could handle {{to bridge the}} consumer expectations gap and to suggest what environmental and social actions Swedish fresh <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> should undertake to do more and to do better.   Method: This study carries out a qualitative research with a deductive scientific approach. The empirical findings were gathered through semi-structured interviews with six respondents from the Swedish fresh food industry.   Conclusion: The results indicated that all the studied companies are involved in some environmental and social actions to meet the consumer requirements. The CSR concept should support the Swedish fresh <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> by providing a framework and a scope of possible actions. Depending on the company, different methods to acquire consumer information are used, from outsourced surveys to direct contact. Concerning the CSR actions, a reference to Carroll’s pyramid enables to demonstrate the current degree of companies’ commitment, while the empirical findings indicated that the level of involvement will keep on increasing and be further developed. ...|$|R

According to the World Bank, {{the objective of this}} project is to [...] "improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets." [...] The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts. Its first component is to work towards the improvement of food production, including financing grants and providing 'voucher for work' programs for households who cannot pay their contribution in cash. The project's next component involves improving the ability of food products, particularly in rural areas. This includes supporting the marketing of food products, and aims to strengthen the capabilities of stakeholders to control the variability of food products and supplies at local and national levels. Lastly, the third component of this project focuses on institutional development and capacity building. Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation. The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of <b>food</b> <b>producer</b> organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate project activities.|$|E

40|$|In the {{agriculture}} sector, globalization of food production has considerably influenced {{the food supply}} system by increasing distance the food has to be transported to reach consumers. This situation not only has increased {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} but also has reduced the relationship between local <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> and consumers, affecting local <b>food</b> <b>producers,</b> their environment and culture. In this study, local food supply chain characteristics were investigated using data from some local <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> and existing large-scale food distribution centers from entire Sweden. A coordinated distribution system of locally produced food was developed to improve logistics efficiency; reduce environmental impact; increase potential market for local <b>food</b> <b>producers</b> and to improve traceability of food origin for consumers. For this, integrated logistics networks were developed by forming clusters of producers and determining the optimum collection centers of food products for each cluster. These food collection centers could be linked to <b>food</b> <b>producers,</b> <b>food</b> distributors and consumers/retailers enabling coordinated distribution of local food products and facilitated the integration of food distribution from the collection centers into large scale food distribution channels. The analysis carried out using tools such as Geographic Information System and Route LogiX software indicated that integrating the logistics activities in the delivery system of local food has advantages. It reduced the transport distance and time and the number routes of food collection and distribution. The possibility of integration of local food distributions into large scale food distribution channels increased the potential market for local <b>food</b> <b>producers.</b> These indicate its positive impact on environmental issue and traceability of food quality and origin. However, in this study, the locations of the customers of each producer and the existing delivery routes from producers to customers could not be mapped due to the shortage of data.
