5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to {{say that}} a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
25|$|The {{eye of the}} Sea <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and {{the foam}} another. Let the foam go, and gaze with {{the eye of the}} Sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: oh amazing! You behold the foam but not the Sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.|$|E

25|$|All I ask of you <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing...</b> I {{ask this}} {{particularly}} {{of the young}} people who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to worship}} a picture, {{it is another}} by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see {{what they ought to}} follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or many.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to impose}} a tax {{dependent}} upon {{the conduct of the}} taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite another thing to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{admits that}} Protagoras has given an {{excellent}} answer {{and that there}} is only one small thing to clarify which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom are one or many things, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together or that of a face which form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into a rhetoric which does not answer the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. Socrates complains that Protagoras is long-winded, like a gong that booms when you strike it and won't stop until you lay a hand on it. It is a typical moment of Socrates opposite a Sophist where the latter is using eloquent speech to hide arguments that might not stand logical scrutiny while the former is trying to use his notorious question/answer format that will lead to a logical conclusion in his favour. Protagoras begins to bristle at this and so Socrates supposes that their styles are opposite. He personally doesn't like long-winded speeches like the one Protagoras just delivered, because he is forgetful and cannot follow the train of thought (334d), and Protagoras does not like to be peppered with questions that seem to lead them off track. Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and public speaking another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.|$|E

500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] {{was just what}} the label was looking for, they believed that [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." ...|$|E
500|$|Marc Lamont Hill, a {{professor}} at Columbia University, compared the fugitive ex–Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner to a real-life Django, saying [...] "It's almost like watching 'Django Unchained' in real life. It's kind of exciting." [...] Writing in the Los Angeles Times, journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino's Jackie Brown and Django Unchained: [...] "It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating, yet Django does exactly that, either to enlighten or entertain. A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation à la Jackie Brown <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another." ...|$|E

500|$|When Tom Welling {{auditioned for}} the role {{he was not sure}} how to prepare. While waiting for his turn, he {{realized}} that the character <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> above all else: [...] "... a high school kid ...." [...] To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that by doing that, the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen. For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had [...] "... great chemistry".|$|E
500|$|... "1 Thing" [...] was {{produced}} by Harrison and is built around a sample of The Meters' 1970 version of the theme song from Oh! Calcutta!, [...] "Oh, Calcutta!", written by Stanley Walden. Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that keeps her hooked ("It's this one thing that's got me trippin'"). Amerie said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always one thing that keeps you attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Crookshank, {{who had his}} jersey retired {{while playing}} for Halifax, said that the {{prospect}} of having the organization fold was [...] "sad." [...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to my stomach that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds. But there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> we know for sure. That when a group of good people unite to take a stand in the name of safety, good values, people’s rights and strong principles, that this will rise above any rules or even winning." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} {{at the start}} of the season when head coach Ralph Friedgen selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner. In 2007, when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th-ranked Rutgers, the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory. He then started the remainder of the season, compiled a 4–5 record in games he started, and led another upset against eighth-ranked Boston College. In comparing the practice performances of Steffy, Turner, and third-stringer Josh Portis, offensive coordinator James Franklin said:It gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category, it's hard to rationalize not making him the starter ... because your gut feeling <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and the statistics are another. Jordan led by a pretty large amount in completion percentage ... the least interception percentage. He didn't lead in yards per ... percentage of explosive plays. I consider an explosive play a play of 16yards or more ... Portis led in that and Turner was second and Jordan was third.|$|E
500|$|To promote Beyond the Sea, Spacey and Phil Ramone {{devised a}} 12-city United States concert tour titled An Evening Celebrating the Music of Bobby Darin, which {{consisted}} of Spacey performing with a 19-piece band. [...] "It's me singing Bobby and talking about Bobby and talking {{a little bit about}} the movie," [...] Spacey explained in June 2004. Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> but it's another thing to go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good." [...] The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.|$|E
500|$|Isherwood {{also notes}} that this serves a female audience. [...] "If there are chick flicks and chick lit – {{derogatory}} though some might find those terms to be – Love, Loss, and What I Wore should clearly be classified as chick legit...for the women who can share deeply in the particulars of experience dissected and discussed." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes the light nature of the subject matter: [...] "...isn't out to reclaim female sexuality from centuries of oppression; it wittily celebrates wardrobe malfunctions..." [...] According to Reiner, the show points out that [...] "...if there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> the females of the species have in common, it's a deep and abiding love/hate relationship with their wardrobe...this wonderfully witty show illustrates, what one wears to the party is sometimes more memorable than the party itself." [...] He {{also notes that}} the entire performance has meaning as it is [...] "jam-packed and resonant" [...] throughout. Shaw notes that [...] "The cozy humor strikes many women's funny bones with a mighty whack, perhaps because it reaffirms so perfectly their own preoccupations." ...|$|E
