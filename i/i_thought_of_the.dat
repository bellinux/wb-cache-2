2500|$|In a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, Borges {{was asked about}} the story by a student from the {{creative}} writing program. He recalled, [...] "When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, {{but at the same time}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe, [...] who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named Adolf Hitler, and I think there is tragedy there." ...|$|E
2500|$|A guitar-dominated album, its {{musical styles}} range from thrash, art pop and power pop to {{psychedelic}} folk featuring acoustic guitar. Pitchfork described Red Barked Tree as a [...] "shrewdly sequenced album", a necessity {{arising from the}} variety of different styles represented on it: [...] "its 11 songs {{are more or less}} positioned along a logical arc, where a sense of ominous unease gives way to violent release before simmering into a peaceful comedown". Grey stated in an interview with The Quietus, [...] "I was asked to propose a track sequence for the album, and I found it difficult initially. Then I realised that if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks as a series of scenes in a play or a film, it made it easier. I like the idea of the tracks telling a story: the story was the album from beginning to end." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{first with}} her eating eyes, And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second with hers, green-gray, And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third, experienced, wise, And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth who sang all day.|$|E

60|$|On this long, five-months' voyage, I {{found that}} among all my bodily needs not <b>the</b> {{slightest}} shred <b>of</b> a bodily need for alcohol existed. But this I did find: my need was mental and social. When <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, <b>the</b> connotation was fellowship. When <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> fellowship, <b>the</b> connotation was alcohol. Fellowship and alcohol were Siamese twins. They always occurred linked together.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>the</b> more {{convinced}} was I {{that that was}} the right procedure.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glossy ringlets and pearly teeth; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kalydor; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coachman's bruised ear {{and bloody}} nose; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tender love secrets {{which she had}} whispered to the judge and jury and a {{thousand}} tittering auditors,--and gave another groan! ...|$|E
60|$|The moon {{began to}} rise, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> placid {{look at the}} white ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on earth.|$|E
60|$|Her Will! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drops which I {{had seen}} in her work-box. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bluish tinge which I had noticed in her complexion. A light which was not of this world--a light shining prophetically from an unmade grave--dawned on my mind. My aunt's secret was a secret no longer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, things strike {{people in}} strangely {{different}} lights. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girl's costume but her countenance." ...|$|R
60|$|During these days, in a rambling, {{inconclusive}} way, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curate and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> his death.|$|R
60|$|I {{refrained from}} asking any more {{questions}} at that time, but afterwards <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Railroad as spelled with a capital.|$|R
60|$|Could this {{be really}} Wales?-Wales?--and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Wales.|$|E
60|$|Attley, the well-meaning man, {{to make me}} feel at ease, {{asked what}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheerless walls, {{the silent}} figures by the fire, and the roaring wind, and hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{doubt of}} it. I won't do things by halves for my best friend. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball-dress, and <b>of</b> other things also.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is Lord Melfort an author, then?" [...] I asked, {{for much}} as Alan <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> soldiers, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gentry that write books.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! you cannot--the English milor' can {{and will}} {{if only we could}} know where he is. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him <b>the</b> moment <b>I</b> {{received}} that awful man's letter--and then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> you...." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferocious Ercole with a long, {{untrimmed}} {{beard and}} unkempt hair falling over his face.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the annals}} of {{apostasy}} offer anything comparable to such a declaration as that, I {{can only say that}} the case in point is not producible from the stores of my reading. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mothers'-Small-Clothes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sunday-Sweetheart-Supervision. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Societies, too numerous to mention, all built up on this man as on a tower of strength. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> struggling Female Boards, who, so to speak, drew the breath of their business-life through the nostrils of Mr. Godfrey--of that same Mr. Godfrey who had just reviled our good work as a [...] "nuisance"--and just declared that he wished he was at the uttermost ends of the earth when he found himself in our company! My young female friends will feel encouraged to persevere, when I mention that it tried even My discipline before I could devour my own righteous indignation in silence. At the same time, it is only justice to myself to add, that I didn't lose a syllable of the conversation. Rachel was the next to speak.|$|E
60|$|Don Felipe {{turned to}} me and asked what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seville prison. I made some {{complimentary}} reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> taking <b>the</b> night mail, but I feel so tired. I really don't know. I think I shall go by {{the nine}} o'clock train to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{right or}} wrong of a man's being what he was born. Perhaps we might justly blame his ancestors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marconigram," [...] Aynesworth said, [...] "I am sure I {{should have}} done it. But {{as a matter of}} fact, I did not." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long {{record of}} Brighton scandals, London scandals, Newmarket scandals, and I {{had to leave}} George undefended.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{suspicion}} that had {{crossed my mind}} when I read Van Brandt's letter. I made no reply.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master, and I {{ordered a}} cold leg of pork {{to be washed}} down with tea and beer.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it <b>the</b> {{more excited}} I became, until my fingers raced madly {{back and forth}} over those bewildering little hills and valleys upon that bit of paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Andie, I see I'll have {{to speak}} out plain with you," [...] I replied. And I told him so much as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> needful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facts.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> first place, {{but your}} father {{seemed to think}} it implied a social {{distrust}} of them; and we couldn't afford to have that appearance, even to ourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|I hid {{my face in}} the soft, {{fragrant}} grass. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wasted {{years of}} my life between thirteen and twenty-three.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And so you {{actually}} despatched my Lord to eat humble pie in my name. You might have {{waited to see}} what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process.' ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Fairlie came last. I {{could not}} trust myself {{to look at}} her when I took her hand, and when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Andie, I see I'll {{have to be}} {{speak out}} plain with you," [...] I replied. And I told him so much as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> needful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facts.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have told her at once that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind!" [...] exclaimed Allan, indignantly. [...] "Why did you leave her a moment in doubt about it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Sylvia {{picked up}} her {{knitting}} and went away. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> savagely <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead man she loved and called him a cad, or at best, a fool.|$|R
