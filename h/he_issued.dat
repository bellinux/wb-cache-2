5|$|Like his {{political}} career, Kogălniceanu's tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies. Also in 1875, <b>he</b> <b>issued</b> from Paris an anti-Austrian brochure about the Romanian cause in Bukovina.

Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E

The assembly outlawed Stephen Balogsemjén, a staunch supporter of the late LadislausIV, for major trespass. From the assembly, Andrew went to Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania). Here <b>he</b> <b>issued</b> the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians, in February or March. Around the same time, Andrew dismissed Amadeus Aba and made Ivan Kőszegi palatine.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. <b>He</b> <b>issued</b> such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rhetoric}} grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he {{considered}} the situation surrounding his sister, the French Queen Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, <b>he</b> <b>issued</b> the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family.

5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} {{practice}} of the imperial cult, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, not only did he reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since <b>he</b> <b>issued</b> no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was {{considered}} a saint, although never canonized) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury.

King Æthelred, preoccupied with the threat of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but <b>he</b> <b>issued</b> a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon, which is thought to be related. A 13th-century calendar of saints gives the date of this translation as 20 June.|$|E
