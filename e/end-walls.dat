40|$|The {{potential}} for loss reduction by using non-axisymmetric <b>end-wall</b> profiling {{has been demonstrated}} in the so called &# 8220;Durham&# 8221; cascade (Hartland et al [1]) and in a turbine representative rig (Brennan et al [2] and Rose et al [3]). This paper aim to enhance the understanding of <b>end-wall</b> profiling. It describes detailed measurements from upstream to downstream through the Durham cascade. The measurements cover the profiled <b>end-wall</b> used by Hartland, a second generation <b>end-wall</b> design (Gregory-Smith et. al. [4]) and the planar reference case. Considerable effort has gone into refining the measurement technique used in the cascade and new results are presented for traverses downstream which capture more accurately the flow near the <b>end-wall.</b> These measurements show the development of loss and secondary flow throughout the blade row. It is shown that <b>end-wall</b> profiling has a dramatic effect on the flow patterns {{in the early part}} of the blade row which then translates to a loss reduction later in the blade row. Comparison with CFD results aids the understanding of the role of the reduced horseshoe vortex in this process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{secondary}} <b>end-wall</b> corner flows on near wall flow parameters in turbomachinary are studied. Important near wall flow parameters {{such as the}} wall shear stress vector, the mean wall pressure, the wall pressure fluctuations, and the correlation of the wall pressure fluctuation with the velocity fluctuation in three-dimensional turbulent flows are first experimentally investigated. The blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region is simulated by mounting airfoil section of symmetric blades {{on both sides of}} the flat plate with semicircular leading edge. Observed changes in the maximum values of the wall shear stress and its location from the corner line could be associated with the streching and attenuation of the horseshoe vortex. The values of wall pressure fluctuation intensity in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region are found to be influenced by the changes of the strength of the horseshoe vortex. The correlation of the wall pressure fluctuation with the velocity fluctuation indicated higher values of correlation coefficient in the inner region as compared to the outer region of the shear layer. The values of wall pressure-velocity correlation coefficient in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region also decrease in the streamwise direction while increasing in the presence of favorable and adverse pressure gradients...|$|R

50|$|Bulkhead flatcars are {{designed}} with sturdy <b>end-walls</b> (bulkheads) to prevent loads from shifting past {{the ends of the}} car.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and the direction}} of wall shear stress and surface pressure in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region were investigated. The measurements were obtained on a specially designed Preston tube, the tip {{of which could be}} concentrically rotated about its axis of rotation at the measurement location. The magnitude of wall shear stress {{in the vicinity of the}} corner was observed to increase significantly (170 percent) compared to its far-upstream value; the increase was consistently higher on the blade surface compared to the value on the plate surface of the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner. On both surfaces in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner, the variation of the wall shear stress direction was found to be more predominant in the vicinity of the blade leading-edge location. The trend of the measured wall shear stress direction showed good agreement with the limiting streamline directions obtained from the flow visualization studies...|$|R
40|$|The near wall flow {{parameters}} in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region is investigated. The blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region was simulated by mounting an airfoil section (NACA 65 - 015 base profile) symmetric blades {{on both sides}} of the flat plate with semi-circular leading edge. The initial 7 cm from the leading edge of the flat plate was roughened by gluing No. 4 floor sanding paper to artificially increase the boundary layer thickness on the flat plate. The initial flow conditions of the boundary layer upstream of the corner region are expected to dictate the behavior of flow inside the corner region. Therefore, an experimental investigation was extended to study the combined effect of initial roughness and increased level of free stream turbulence on the development of a 2 -D turbulent boundary layer in the absence of the blade. The measurement techniques employed in the present investigation included, the conventional pitot and pitot-static probes, wall taps, the Preston tube, piezoresistive transducer and the normal sensor hot-wire probe. The pitot and pitot-static probes were used to obtain mean velocity profile measurements within the boundary layer. The measurements of mean surface static pressure were obtained with the surface static tube and the conventional wall tap method. The wall shear vector measurements were made with a specially constructed Preston tube. The flush mounted piezoresistive type pressure transducer were employed to measure the wall pressure fluctuation field. The velocity fluctuation measurements, used in obtaining the wall pressure-velocity correlation data, were made with normal single sensor hot-wire probe. At different streamwise stations, in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region, the mean values of surface static pressure varied more on the <b>end-wall</b> surface in the corner region were mainly caused by the changes in the curvature of the streamlines. The magnitude of the wall shear stress in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region increased significantly in the close vicinity of the corner line. The maximum value of the wall shear stress and its location from the corner line, on both the surfaces forming the corner region, were observed to change along the corner. These observed changes in the maximum values of the wall shear stress and its location from the corner line could be associated with the stretching and attenuation of the horseshoe vortex. The wall shear stress vectors in the blade <b>end-wall</b> corner region were observed to be more skewed on the <b>end-wall</b> surface as compared to that on the blade surface. The differences in the wall shear stress directions obtained with the Preston tube and flow visualization method were within the range in which the Preston tube was found to be insensitive to the yaw angle...|$|R

This variation is taken as the difference above or below that predicted by blade element theory at any spanwise location. It {{was found that the}} stator variation is strongly affected by the <b>end-wall</b> boundary-layer thickness as well as camber, solidity, and blade channel aspect ratio. Rotor variation was found to depend on <b>end-wall</b> boundary layer thickness and tip clearance normalized by blade span. If these parameters are known or can be calculated, the models provide a reasonable approximation to the spanwise variation of deviation for middle compressor stages operating at low to high subsonic inlet Mach numbers...|$|R

The GTX is a Vertical Take-off/ Horizontal Landing reusable single-stage-to-orbit system {{powered by a}} rocket-based combined-cycle propulsion system. Tests were conducted in the NASA Glenn 1 - by 1 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel during two entries in October 1998 and February 1999. Tests were run from Mach 2. 8 to 6. Integrated performance parameters and static pressure distributions are reported. The maximum contraction ratios achieved in the tests were lower than predicted by axisymmetric Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD). At Mach 6, the maximum contraction ratio was roughly one-half of the CFD value of 16. The addition of either boundary-layer trip strips or vortex generators had a negligible effect on the maximum contraction ratio. A shock boundary-layer interaction was also evident on the <b>end-walls</b> that terminate the annular flowpath cross section. Cut-back <b>end-walls,</b> designed to reduce the boundary-layer growth upstream of the shock and minimize the interaction, also had negligible effect on the maximum contraction ratio. Both the excessive turning of low-momentum comer flows and local over-contraction due to asymmetric <b>end-walls</b> were identified as possible reasons for {{the discrepancy between the}} CFD predictions and the experiment. It is recommended that the centerbody spike and throat angles be reduced in order to lessen the induced pressure rise.

40|$|Linear cascade {{transonic}} {{wind tunnels}} {{with an open}} jet test section can suffer from pitchwise <b>end-wall</b> interference. This causes a loss of pitchwise periodicity in the cascade, increasing the uncertainty in the measurements and producing less accurate estimates of turbine stage performance, flow exit angle and loss coefficient.

The experimental results are obtained using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser doppler anemometry, pressure probes and surface oil flow visualization techniques. The first three techniques {{have been used}} to investigate the bulk flow hydrodynamics of the vortex unit. Surface oil flow visualization is adopted to visualize streamlines near the <b>end-walls</b> of the vortex unit. The surface streamlines help to determine the azimuthal and radial velocity components of the radial near-wall jets. Simulations of the vortex unit using FLUENTVR v. 14 a are simultaneously performed, computationally resolving the near-wall jet regions in the axial direction. The simulation results together with the surface oil flow visualization establish the 3 D structure of the near-wall jets in GVUs {{for the first time in}} literature. It is also conjectured that the near-wall jets develop due to the combined effect of bulk flow acceleration and swirl.

40|$|The flow in {{multistage}} {{axial flow}} compressors is particularly complex in nature {{because of the}} proximity of moving bladerows, the growth of <b>end-wall</b> boundary layers {{and the presence of}} tip and seal leakages and secondary flow. The problems associated with these phenomena are at their most acute in the latter, subsonic stages of the core compressor, where Reynolds numbers are modest and the blading has low aspect ratio. Indeed, much of the inefficiency of axial stages is believed {{to be associated with the}} interaction between blading and <b>end-wall</b> flows. The fact that the <b>end-wall</b> flow phenomena result in conditions local to the blade which are quite different from those over the major part of the annulus was appreciated by many of the earliest workers in the axial turbomachinery field. However, experiments on blading designs aimed specifically at attacking the end-loss have been sparse. This thesis includes results from tests of conventional and end-bent blading in a four-stage, low-speed, axial compressor, built specifically for the task, at a scale where high spatial measurement resolution could be readily achieved within the flowpath. Two basic design styles are considered: a zero a 0 stage with DCA aerofoils and a low-reaction controlled-diffusion design with cantilevered stators. The data gives insight into the flow phenomena present in 'buried' stages and has resulted in a much clearer understanding of the behaviour of end-bent blading. A 3 D Navier-Stokes solver was calibrated on the two low-reaction stators and was found to give good agreement with most aspects of the experimental results. An improved design procedure is suggested based on the incorporation of end-bends into the throughflow and iterative use of the 3 D Navier-Stokes solver...|$|R

Various simulations show irregular transitions between two approximately equally stable states, with rapid oscillations preceding the conversions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is experimental and computational study of three dimensional viscous flow field in the nozzle passage of an axial flow turbine stage. The nozzle passage flow field has been measured using a two sensor hot-wire probe at various axial and radial stations. In addition, two component LDV measurements at one axial station (x/c(sum m) = 0. 56) were performed to measure the velocity field. Static pressure measurements and flow visualization, using a fluorescent oil technique, were also performed to obtain the location of transition and the endwall limiting streamlines. A three dimensional boundary layer code, with a simple intermittency transition model, was used to predict the viscous layers along the blade and endwall surfaces. The boundary layers on the blade surface {{were found to be}} very thin and mostly laminar, except on the suction surface downstream of 70 % axial chord. Strong radial pressure gradient, especially close to the suction surface, induces strong cross flow components in the trailing edge regions of the blade. On the <b>end-walls</b> the boundary layers were much thicker, especially near the suction corner of the casing surface, caused by secondary flow. The secondary flow region near the suction-casing surface corner indicates the presence of the passage vortex detached from the blade surface. The corner vortex is found to be very weak. The presence of a closely spaced rotor downstream (20 % of the nozzle vane chord) introduces unsteadiness in the blade passage. The measured instantaneous velocity signal was filtered using FFT square window to remove the periodic unsteadiness introduced by the downstream rotor and fans. The filtering decreased the free stream turbulence level from 2. 1 % to 0. 9 % but had no influence on the computed turbulence length scale. The computation of the three dimensional boundary layers is found to be accurate on the nozzle passage blade surfaces, away from the <b>end-walls</b> and the secondary flow region.
