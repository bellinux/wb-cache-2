5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E

5000|$|However archeologists {{have been}} able to {{identify}} three distinct phases of art: pre-estuarine (dry climate and extinct animals), estuarine (rising sea levels and marine fauna) and freshwater (freshwater fauna, moving into 'historical' subjects such as Makassan traders, and European technology e.g. guns). Rock art also demonstrates cultural and technological changes, for instance boomerangs <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> broad spearthrowers which <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> long spearthrowers, which <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> guns and boats.https://web.archive.org/web/20051125151823/http://www.lonker.net/art_aboriginal_1.htm ...|$|R

The four-man starting rotation has <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the First World War, Britain's economy enjoyed a brief boom. Businesses rushed to replenish stocks and re-establish peacetime conditions of trade, and while prices rose rapidly, wages rose faster and unemployment was negligible. By April 1920 this boom had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Britain's first post-war slump, which ushered in an era of high unemployment. Britain's adoption of generally deflationary economic policies, including a return to the gold standard in 1925, helped to ensure that the percentage of the workforce without jobs remained at around 10% for the rest of the 1920s and beyond, well above the normal pre-war levels. During the world recession that began in 1929 and lasted until 1932, the percentage of unemployed peaked at 22%, representing more than 3 million workers.|$|E

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though the plants in its median have <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a steel guard rail, and most {{recently}} to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and has <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, {{there is no single}} test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E

5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the ideas of the}} Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|When Chamorro {{was sworn}} into office on 25 April 1990, {{it was the}} first time in more than five decades that a {{peaceful}} transition of power had occurred in Nicaragua and the first time that one elected president had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> another. She inherited a hyperinflated, war-torn economy, but she was able to end the war and establish a lasting peace. Chamorro's leadership covered six difficult years marked by economic strife and social unrest, but she was able to compromise with rivals, maintain a constitutional regime, re-establish international banking relationships and end the hyperinflation that had plagued the country for several years. The years of Violeta Chamorro initiate a period of significant economic and social decline for Nicaragua. From 1990 to 2001, the country fell from 60th to 116th in the world in terms of human development, and has become the poorest of America after Haiti, according to United Nations Development Programme. After leaving office on 10 January 1997, Chamorro worked on several international peace initiatives until poor health forced her to retire from public life.|$|E
5|$|At 12:15, {{with the}} 47th Battalion having <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the German onslaught and {{withdrawing}} past them up towards the high ground, the two forward companies of the 48th on the embankment began to withdraw, leaving the northern-most company in its posts around the gully near the Albert–Amiens road. Soon after, the northern company {{was forced to}} withdraw its posts on the southern side of the gully. When he heard of the withdrawal, Leane sent forward his second-in-command to establish the line that the battalion would now attempt to hold. By 13:30, the 48th was still holding its left flanking posts near the Albert–Amiens road, {{but the rest of}} the battalion had withdrawn to Pioneer Trench on the high ground. The left flank posts were not withdrawn until about 15:30. At this point, a counterattack was ordered, involving the 49th Battalion of the 13th Brigade, which had been in reserve, with all but the far left flank of the 12th Brigade conforming with its advance. Sinclair-Maclagan wanted to use four available tanks to support the attack, but this was refused by the brigade commanders. Deayton surmises that this rejection of the tanks was at the urging of Leane, who had taken such a negative view of them at Bullecourt. Sinclair-Maclagan then argued that the objective of both brigades must be to retake the railway line, but this was opposed by Gellibrand, supported up by Leane, whose opinion he still valued highly. They argued that the 12th Brigade should only aim to retake the former support line partway down the hill. Sinclair-Maclagan's view prevailed, possibly as he was acting in accordance with direction from higher headquarters. Despite this, Leane, as the commander of the forward troops of the 12th Brigade, once again displayed his strong independent streak, disobeying those orders and directing the troops' main effort towards recapturing the support trenches.|$|E
