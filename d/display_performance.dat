A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist.

500|$|The {{tour was}} divided into seven segments: Check-In, Mystic Lounge, Mystic Garden, The Onyx Zone, Security Cameras, Club and the encore. Check-In <b>displayed</b> <b>performances</b> with dance and {{advanced}} in the hotel theme. Mystic Lounge featured an homage to Cabaret and other musicals, while remixing some of Spears's early hits. Mystic Garden displayed a jungle-inspired stage. The Onyx Zone <b>displayed</b> a ballad <b>performance</b> with acrobats. Security Cameras was the raciest part of the show, with Spears and her dancers emulating different sexual practices. Club <b>displayed</b> a <b>performance</b> with urban influences. The encore consisted of a system malfunction interlude and Spears performed wearing a red ensemble. The tour received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who praised it for being an entertaining show while criticizing it for looking [...] "more [...] a spectacle than an actual concert".|$|R

5000|$|For {{the first}} time {{complete}} sets of all relevant material parameters which govern the electro-optical perfor-mance of TN-LCDs are determined, including elastic constants. Specific relevant molecular functional groups of LC-molecules are identified and correlated with material properties and <b>display</b> <b>performance.</b> Heterocyclic rings are shown to induce small bend/splay elastic constant ratios. Analytical expressions are derived describing the electro-optical performance of TN-LCDs. The find-ings led to inventing and developing new LC-classes enabling increased information contents of TN-LCDs. As a result, first dot-matrix TN-displays for pocket calculators and office equipment evolved in the early 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} time it is shown that double bonds at {{specific}} sites in the hydrocarbon side-chains of liquid crystals strongly broaden the range of LC-mate-rial parameters, especially the elastic- and visco-elastic constants. First correlations between alkenyl molecules, material parameters and <b>display</b> <b>performance</b> are presented. Numerous new classes of alkenyl liquid crystals - designed and patented in our laboratories between 1984 and 1995 - are based on these findings. Alkenyl liquid crystals have become key components for achieving high information content super-twisted nematic (STN)-LCDs and fast responding, thin-film transistor (TFT)-addressed monitor- and television -LCDs.|$|E
5000|$|Optical bonding {{is the use}} of an optical-grade {{adhesive}} to glue a {{glass to}} the top surface of a display. The main goal of optical bonding is to improve the <b>display</b> <b>performance</b> under outdoor environments. This method eliminates the air gap between the cover glass and the display. [...] Moreover, anti-reflective coating is often used in optical bonding glass. The real problem for display readability in outdoor environments is not the display's brightness but its contrast. Contrast means the ratio of the white level to the black level; in other words, the contrast ratio of display means the difference of light intensity between the brightest white pixel and the darkest black pixel. The main purpose of optical bonding is to increase the display's contrast ratio by reducing the amount of reflected ambient light.|$|E

50|$|The {{brothers}} both piloted {{the aircraft}} {{many times in}} the Nottingham area, and flew it as far as Hatfield in June 1935 to attend a flying <b>display.</b> <b>Performance</b> on the Bristol Cherub engine was marginal; as originally built the Archaeopteryx was an Ultralight and as such the performance was adequate, so long as the pilot was no more than 11 stone, it was flown quite successfully for five years prior to it retirement, the throttle control was placed outside of the fuselage and a positive climb rate could only be obtained by the pilot moving his arms and elbows into the cramped cockpit to minimise drag. The external throttle linkage was not a feature of the original aircraft, this was a later addition when in 1975 it was restored to flight condition by the Shuttleworth trust who used the throttle linkage from a Tiger moth, The aircraft was difficult to control in pitch, especially on landing where a series of large bounces often developed.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the {{physicists}} Martin Schadt and Wolfgang Helfrich {{invented the}} twisted nematic field effect (TN-effect) in the Central Research Laboratories of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, in Basel, Switzerland. The resulting patent CH532261 was licensed worldwide to electronics and watch industries and thus initiated a paradigm change towards flat panel field effect liquid crystal (LC) displays. In the early 1970s, Martin Schadt started to investigate correlations between liquid crystal molecular structures, material properties, electro-optical effects and <b>display</b> <b>performance</b> to obtain criteria for novel, effect-specific liquid crystal materials for TN- and subsequent field-effect applications. His interdisciplinary approach involving {{physics and chemistry}} {{became the basis for}} modern industrial LC-materials research and led to the discovery and production of numerous new functional molecules and new electro-optical effects. In 1970, shortly after the invention of the TN-effect, he developed the first commercial room temperature nematic liquid crystal mixture with positive dielectric anisotropy, used in the displays of the first Japanese digital TN-LCD watches. The pharmaceutical company Roche established itself as a major supplier of liquid crystal materials for the emerging LCD-industry.|$|E
5000|$|The Verge complimented the higher-quality build of the Galaxy Note 5, {{describing}} {{it as being}} a [...] "more humane device" [...] due to its lighter build with thinner bezels {{in comparison to the}} Galaxy Note 4, along with its <b>display,</b> <b>performance</b> and additional S Pen features. However, the Galaxy Note 5 was panned for not offering a removable battery, expandable storage, or a 128 GB model, considering these oversights to be inappropriate for a device in a series that was [...] "unapologetically meant for power users." [...] The device was also described as being the result of Samsung [...] "themselves back", having dropped the [...] "old, unfettered excessiveness of the old Note" [...] in favour of developing a [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] device with only minor upgrades over the S6. Techradar shared a similar degree of positivity towards the Galaxy Note 5, noting that [...] "the sacrifices Samsung felt it needed to make to get to that premium Note 5 design have turned off some longtime users. Thankfully, there's a lot more to like about this phone upgrade than dislike." ...|$|E
