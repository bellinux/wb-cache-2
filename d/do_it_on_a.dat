25|$|When told by Nick Chance of Cafiero's {{decision}} not to go, booking agent Gerrard suggested drummer Cathy Green, who was based in Canberra. Gerrard knew Green was {{a huge fan of}} X, and thus knew the songs, and was a great drummer in her own right who could fill in to save the Melbourne tour. Luckily Cathy agreed to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> few days' notice. There were two hastily organised rehearsals prior to the Melbourne shows, {{which turned out to be}} a huge success. Cathy brought a new fresh yet solid feel to the band. Tragically, not long after that, Cafiero died when injected with a dye prior to an X-ray for a back complaint and Cathy became a permanent final member of X.|$|E

2500|$|Nuttall and Barba theorized {{from their}} own {{experience}} about how an LAPD officer would commit a murder. It {{would be better to}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> day off, and departmental records showed that Lazarus had indeed been off the day Sherri Rasmussen was killed. An officer would know better than to use his or her duty gun, since {{it would have to be}} disposed of after the crime and the penalties for losing a duty gun or failing to prevent its theft were severe. Instead it made sense to use a backup gun like Lazarus' [...]38. Lastly, a working patrol officer would know how to do just enough to make the crime scene look like an interrupted burglary to satisfy an overworked detective.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the free}} market view, a secure system of private {{property}} rights {{is an essential part}} of economic freedom. [...] Such systems include two main rights: the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. These rights offer people the possibility of autonomy and self-determination according to their personal values and goals. Economist Milton Friedman sees property rights as [...] "the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights." [...] With property rights protected, people are free to choose the use of their property, earn on it, and transfer it to anyone else, as long as they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> voluntary basis and do not resort to force, fraud or theft. In such conditions most people can achieve much greater personal freedom and development than under a regime of government coercion. A secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful. Empirical evidence suggests that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems, and that a market system with significant private property rights is an essential condition for democracy. According to Hernando de Soto, much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized property rights. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth. One thinker to question private property was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a socialist and anarchist, who argued that property is both theft and freedom.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{criticism}} and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based off the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, [...] "If you look at other suppliers' ability to differentiate, there's very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut if you understand what the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it's all about getting stuff done. Games, media, we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game. Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> me-too approach." [...] Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear remarked [...] "We want to regain our position as the number one in the world", while Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben proclaimed [...] "It could be the greatest comeback in tech history.

6000|$|There {{were still}} two {{men to be}} rescued, and the {{question}} was, whether to wait for Livingstone, who was armed with authority to give a lesson to the negroes, or for the mission party to undertake it themselves, especially in the haste which was needful {{in order to be}} in time for the meeting with the Pioneer. They decided on the march, so as to release the men, and thus were forced to break up the calm of the Christmas feast. [...] "If it is right to do it at all, it is right to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> holy day," [...] was the Bishop's argument, and so the Christmas Day was spent, partly in walking, partly at Chipoka's village, where was held the Holy Communion feast. [...] "How wondrous," [...] wrote the Bishop, [...] "the feeling of actual instantaneous communion with all you dear ones, though the distance and means of earthly communication are so great and so difficult!" [...] The negroes of the neighbouring villages joined them, and they proceeded. Near Manasomba's village they met a large body of men, with whom the Bishop attempted to hold a parley, but they ran away, and only discharged a few arrows. The village was deserted except by a few sheep, goats, and Muscovy ducks, and these were driven out and the huts set on fire.|$|E
6000|$|Who has {{not heard}} of mosquitoes? We may inform those who have never seen or felt {{them that they are}} peculiarly virulent and {{numerous}} and vicious and bloodthirsty in the swampy lands of North America, and that night we had got into a region of swamps. It may also, perhaps, be unknown to some people that mosquitoes do not slumber--unless, indeed, they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> preconcerted plan of relieving guard. Either there is a [...] "day and night shift" [...] or they do not rest at all. As a consequence we did not rest. Groans and maledictions were the order of the night. We spent much time in slapping our own faces, and immolated hundreds of the foe at each slap, but thousands came on to refill the ranks. We buried our heads under our blankets, but could not sleep for suffocation. Some of the men left their faces exposed, went to sleep in desperate exhaustion, after hours of fruitless warfare, and awoke with eyes all but shut up, and cheeks like dumplings. Others lay down to leeward of the fire and spent the night in a compound experience of blood-sucking and choking. One ingenious man--I think it was Salamander--wrapped his visage in a kerchief, leaving nothing exposed save the point of his nose for breathing purposes. In the morning he arose with something like a huge strawberry on the end of his prominent feature.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{wrong for}} once," [...] he said, with a bitter laugh. [...] "The {{exasperating}} {{part of it}} is that Farnaby has said neither Yes nor No. The oily-whiskered brute--you haven't seen him yet, have you?--began by saying Yes. 'A man like me, the heir of a fine old English family, honoured him by making proposals; he could wish no more brilliant prospect for his dear adopted child. She would fill the high position that was offered to her, and fill it worthily.' That was the fawning way in which he talked to me at first! He squeezed my hand in his horrid cold shiny paw till, I give you my word of honour, I felt as if I was going to be sick. Wait a little; you haven't heard the worst of it yet. He soon altered his tone--it began with his asking me, if I had 'considered the question of settlements'. I didn't know what he meant. He had to put it in plain English; he wanted to hear what my property was. 'Oh, that's soon settled,' I said. 'I've got five hundred a year; and Regina is welcome to every farthing of it.' He fell back in his chair as if I had shot him; he turned--it was worse than pale, he positively turned green. At first he wouldn't believe me; he declared I must be joking. I set him right about that immediately. His next change was a proud impudence. 'Have you not observed, sir, in what style Regina is accustomed to live in my house? Five hundred a year? Good heavens! With strict economy, five hundred a year might pay her milliner's bill and the keep of her horse and carriage. Who is to pay for everything else--the establishment, the dinner-parties and balls, the tour abroad, the children, the nurses, the doctor? I tell you this, Mr. Goldenheart, I'm willing to make a sacrifice to you, as a born gentleman, which I would certainly not consent to in the case of any self-made man. Enlarge your income, sir, to no more than four times five hundred pounds, and I guarantee a yearly allowance to Regina of half as much again, besides the fortune which she will inherit at my death. That will make your income three thousand a year to start with. I know something of domestic expenses, and I tell you positively, you can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farthing less.' That was his language, Rufus. The insolence of his tone I can't attempt to describe. If I hadn't thought of Regina, I should have behaved in a manner unworthy of a Christian--I believe I should have taken my walking-cane, and given him a sound thrashing." ...|$|E
