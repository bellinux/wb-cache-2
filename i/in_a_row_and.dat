Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the}} most vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
5|$|Beginning to play {{organized}} hockey {{at the age}} of four, Hamhuis was {{competing against}} other players as old as eight years, as his hometown was not big enough to fill teams for younger age groups.

Future Predators teammate Cody Franson was a stick boy for Hamhuis' team, while another Nashville blueliner, Shea Weber, did the same for a competing team at provincial tournaments.

Canavan's injury was so severe that he was still feeling the effects for over a year, and there was speculation as to whether he had been playing on a broken foot.|$|E
