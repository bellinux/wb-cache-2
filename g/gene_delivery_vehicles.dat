Polymer-metal hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) are good candidates as <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{due to their}} unique properties and facile functionalization. The polymer component in hybrid NPs can provide accurate cancer cell targeting and high DNA binding ability while the metallic component can provide imaging functions for the nanodevices. In the present study, hybrid NPs comprising an Au-Ag bimetallic core and a folic acid-chitosan shell (Au-Ag@CS-FA) were fabricated. The structure and relevant properties of Au-Ag@CS-FA NPs were subsequently studied {{using a variety of}} techniquesï¼Œlike scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and UV-visible spectra.

40|$|Segmental bone {{defects and}} nonunions are {{relatively}} common problems facing all orthopaedic surgeons. Osteogenic proteins, i. e., BMP- 2, can promote bone healing in segmental bone defects. However, a large quantity {{of the human}} recombinant protein is needed to enhance the bone healing potential. Cell mediated gene therapy in the bone defect can allow a sustained expression of the osteogenic proteins and further enhance bone healing. Muscle cells can be easily isolated and cultivated, and they {{are known to be}} an efficient <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> to muscle and nonmuscle tissues. Furthermore, they are capable of transforming into osteoblasts when stimulated by BMP- 2. Thus, the utilization of muscle cells as the <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> to a bone defect would be an important step in establishing a less invasive treatment for non-unions and segmental bone defects. Muscle cells were transduced when the adenoviral-lacZ vector and injected into the bone defect and the muscles surrounding the defect. Expression of the marker gene was visualized 7 days after the injection, both macroscopically and microscopically, using lacZ histochemistry. The lacZ expressing cells in the defect tissue were also stained for desmin, a muscle specific marker, indicating the presence of muscle cells that have fused into myofibers in this nonmuscle bone defect area.

40|$|While gene-directed enzyme prodrug {{therapy has}} shown {{potential}} as a cancer therapeutic in animal and clinical trials, concerns over the efficacy, selectivity, and safety of <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> have restricted its advance. In an attempt to relieve some of the demands on targeted <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> and achieve the full potential of enzyme prodrug therapy, cancer-targeted activity can be engineered into the enzyme itself.

The biodegradable nanoparticles can efficiently deliver nucleic acid to human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and enhance the effect of functional miRNA delivered, such as the cell cycle suppressor miRNA 26 a. Importantly, it is proved that serum cannot inhibit the transfection activity of this nanoparticle. These PLGA-based nanoparticles also display an improved safety profile in comparison with high molecular weight PEIs and liposome because of the lower cytotoxicity of the polyplex formulations.

50|$|For example, an {{enhanced}} <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{can be obtained}} by using a polyrotaxane formed by rings, backbones, then stoppers that linked by a disulfide bond (or other chemical bond that can be selected cleave in the body). The cation-funcitionalized polyrotaxanes can bind with pDNA to form complex through the electronstatic interaction. Glutathione(GSH) (or other corresponding chemicals that can cleave the sensitive chemical bond) is over-expressed in the target cells. When the polyrotaxane/plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes are uptaken by the target cells, intercellular GSH could cleave the disulfide bond to cut off the stoppers at the end of polyrotaxanes, which results in the dissociation of the polyrotaxanes. As the rings dethread from the chain, pDNA is release with the ring molecules.|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) as <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> to simultaneously express human hepa-tocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) to improve the outcome of islet transplantation. Methods Morphology and islet-binding affinity of hBMSCs were checked by microscope. The expression of target genes and endogenous genes was determined by ELISA. Protection of islets by hBMSCs was evaluated in vitro by Calcein-AM/Propidium Iodide staining and in vivo by alloge-neic islet transplantation study. Function and revascularization of islets was evaluated by immune fluorescence study. Results Non-donor-specific hBMSCs showed strong binding affinity to human islets and protected viability and function. Transduction of hBMSCs with adenovirus encoding human HGF and human IL- 1 Ra (Adv-hHGF-hIL- 1 Ra) prior to co-culturing with islets further protected from apoptotic cell death, helped maintain 3 D structures and morphology, and enhanced insulin secretion. Transplantation of human islets reconstituted with Adv-hHGF-hIL- 1 Ra transduced hBMSCs under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-induced diabetic non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice reversed diabetes by reducing blood glucose levels to â‰¤ 200 mg/dL for up to 15 weeks and {{reduced the number of}} islets required to achieving normoglycemia.

In this study, we constructed a hybrid system composed of baculovirus (B) and galactosylated polyethylenimine (GP) /DNA complexes through electrostatic interaction. The resulting GP/B hybrid had suitable physicochemical properties and low cytotoxicity for use in gene therapy. Furthermore, the GP/B significantly enhanced transduction efficiency and showed good cell-specificity compared to either viral or non-viral vector systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adenovirus (Ad) vectors show {{promise as}} cancer <b>gene</b> therapy <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> but {{immunogenic}} safety concerns and coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) -dependency have limited their use. Alternately, biocompatible and bioreducible nonviral vectors, including arginine-grafted cationic polymers, {{have been shown}} to deliver nucleic acids through a cell penetration peptide (CPP) and protein transduction domain (PTD) effect. We utilized the advantages of both viral and nonviral vectors to develop a hybrid <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> by coating Ad with mPEG-PEI-g-Arg-S-S-Arg-g-PEI-mPEG (Ad/PPSA). Characterization of Ad/PPSA particle size and zeta potential showed an overall size and cationic charge increase in a polymer concentration-dependent manner. Ad/PPSA also showed a marked transduction efficiency increase in both CAR-negative and-positive cells compared to naked Ad. Competition assays demonstrated that Ad/PPSA produced higher transgene expression levels than naked Ad and achieved CAR-independent transduction. Oncolytic Ad (DWP 418) /PPSA was able to overcome the nonspecificity of polymer-only therapies by demonstrating cancer-specific killing effects. Furthermore, the DWP 418 /PPSA nanocomplex elicited a 2. 24 -fold greater antitumor efficacy than naked Ad in vivo. This was supported by immunohistochemical confirmation of Ad E 1 As accumulation in MCF 7 xenografted tumors. Lastly, intravenous injection of DWP 418 /PPSA elicited less innate immune response compared to naked Ad, evaluated by interleukin- 6 cytokine release into the serum. The increased antitumor effect and improved vector targeting to both CAR-negative and-positive cells make DWP 418 /PPSA a promising tool for cancer gene therapy. 1...|$|R

Therefore, we investigated other human, rat and mouse osteogenic sarcoma {{and other types of}} tumour cell lines for transduction efficiency via baculovirus vectors containing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of either a cytomegalovirus or Rous sarcoma virus promoter. The expression of b-galactosidase protein, assessed by X-Gal staining and b-galactosidase ELISA, demonstrated an extremely high level of transduction efficiency in some osteogenic sarcoma cell lines, such as U- 2 OS, Saos- 2 and Saos-LM 2. These human osteogenic sarcoma cell lines showed levels of b-galactosidase expression 5 â€“ 40 times greater than HepG 2 cells, which were previously thought to be the mammalian cells most susceptible to baculovirus-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery.</b> The level of acetylated histone proteins in these tumour lines did not correlate well with the high level of reporter gene expression.

40|$|Effective {{gene therapy}} is {{dependent}} on safe <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> that can achieve efficient transduction and sustained transgene expression. We are developing a hybrid viral vector system that combines in a single particle the large cloning capacity and efficient cell cycle-independent nuclear gene delivery of adenovirus (Ad) vectors with the long-term transgene expression and lack of viral genes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The strategy being pursued relies on coupling the AAV DNA replication mechanism to the Ad encapsidation process through packaging of AAV-dependent replicative intermediates provided with Ad packaging elements into Ad capsids. The generation of these high-capacity AAV/Ad hybrid vectors takes place in Ad early region 1 (E 1) -expressing cells and requires an Ad vector with E 1 deleted to complement in trans both AAV helper functions and Ad structural proteins. The dependence on a replicating helper Ad vector leads to the contamination of AAV/Ad hybrid vector preparations with a large excess of helper Ad particles. This renders the further propagation and ultimate use of these <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> very difficult. Here, we show that Cre/loxP-mediated genetic selection against the packaging of helper Ad DNA can reduce helper Ad vector contamination by 99. 98 % without compromising hybrid vector rescue.

The polylactide shell protects the encapsulated DNA from degradation during electrospinning of a mixture of encapsulated DNA nanoparticles and biodegradable PLGA (a random copolymer of lactide and glycolide) to form a nanofibrous non-woven scaffold using the same solution mixture.

Though promising results have been demonstrated, limitations of viral vectors, including spread of virus to distant sites, neutralisation by the host immune system and low transduction efficiencies have stimulated the investigation of biomaterials as <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> for improved protein expression at an injury site. Here, we show how N-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) self-assembling peptide (SAP) hydrogels, designed for tissue specific central nervous system (CNS) applications via incorporation of the laminin peptide sequence, isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV), are effective as biocompatible, localised viral vector <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> in vivo. Through the addition of a C-terminal lysine (K) residue, we show that increased electrostatic interactions, provided by the additional amine side-chain, allows the effective immobilisation of lentiviral vector particles, thereby constraining their activity exclusively to the site of injection and enabling focal {{gene delivery}} in vivo in a tissue specific manner. When the C-terminal lysine was absent {{there was no difference between}} the number of transfected cells, the volume of tissue transfected or the transfection efficiency with and without the Fmoc-SAP.

Our laboratory has developed a systemically administered, ligandâ€“liposome complex that can effectively and preferentially deliver its therapeutic payload to both primary and metastatic tumors. To further improve the transfection efficiency of this targeting complex, a synthetic pH-sensitive histidylated oligolysine K[K(H) KKK] 5 -K(H) KKC (HoKC), designed to aid in endosomal escape and condensation of DNA, was included in the complex. The presence of HoKC increased the in vitro transfection efficiency over that of the original complex. Moreover, no increase in cytotoxicity was observed due to the presence of the HoKC peptide. In a DU 145 human prostate cancer xenograft tumor model in athymic nude mice, inclusion of the HoKC peptide did not interfere with the tumor targeting specificity of the i. v. administered ligand/liposome/DNA complex.

Tumors were generated by stereotaxic intracerebral injection of 1 x 10 (4) C 6 cells in nude mice. After 8 days of tumor growth, 3 x 10 (8) ADV/RSV-tk viral particles were injected into the tumors and the mice subsequently were treated with GCV for 6 days. Tumor size in untreated and treated animals was compared 20 days after tumor implantation. The mean cross-sectional area of the tumors in the treated animals was 23 -fold smaller than in control animals and the tumor volume was reduced by > 500 -fold. These results demonstrate that the recombinant adenoviral vector can function as an efficient <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{for the treatment of}} gliomas by in vivo gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) is a polycation with proven {{success as}} a <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> both in vitro and in vivo. The work {{described}} herein addresses several aspects of PEI-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery.</b> First, a model system was developed, and an assessment of what PEI molecular weights should be considered for optimal transfection was made. Next, PEI/DNA complexes were examined and their physical characteristics (such as surface charge concentration and buffering capacity) defined {{in an attempt to}} further improve PEI/DNA transfection efficiencies. After characterizations were completed, cellular trafficking studies were performed to yield a pictorial overview of the route taken by PEI/DNA complexes during transfection. With the general trafficking route in place, the stage was set for a more in-depth examination of the mechanism behind PEI-mediated transfection. The intracellular route of PEI/DNA complexes during transfection was then re-evaluated with respect to lysosomes, and a novel finding was made that disproves a popular hypothesis that has attempted to explain the success of PEI-mediated transfection. Additionally, the stability of PEI/DNA complexes was established, and applied toward the fact that the complexes are shuttled into cell nuclei during transfection. Finally, the effects of PEI's nuclear entry were addressed in terms of secreted cellular products and cell viability...|$|R
