5|$|<b>Fluoride</b> {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and <b>fluoride</b> supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. <b>Fluoride</b> helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated <b>fluoride</b> makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical <b>fluoride,</b> such as a <b>fluoride</b> toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical <b>fluoride</b> solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

50|$|The metal <b>fluorides</b> show broad trends {{based on}} the charge of the metal. Metals in an {{oxidation}} state of +3 or lower tend to form ionic, refractory, <b>fluorides.</b> Metals charged +5 or higher tend to form covalently bonded <b>fluorides,</b> polymers or discrete molecules, and are more volatile. (The tetrafluorides are a transition zone.) The bonding variations mean that metal <b>fluorides</b> can be solids, liquids, or gases at room temperature.|$|R
50|$|Metal <b>fluorides</b> have {{similarities}} {{with other}} metal halides but are more ionic. In many respects, metal <b>fluorides</b> differ from other metal halides (chlorides, bromides, iodides), {{very similar to}} each other.

5|$|Caesium <b>fluoride</b> or cesium <b>fluoride</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound usually encountered as a hygroscopic white solid.

5|$|Protactinium(V) <b>fluoride</b> can be {{prepared}} by reacting protactinium oxide with either bromine pentafluoride or bromine trifluoride at about 600°C, and protactinium(IV) <b>fluoride</b> is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen <b>fluoride</b> at 600°C; a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove atmospheric oxygen leaks into the reaction.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} to aryl chlorides and bromides, aryl <b>fluorides</b> form Grignard reagents only reluctantly. On the other hand, aryl <b>fluorides,</b> e.g. fluoroanilines and fluorophenols, often undergo nucleophilic substitution efficiently.|$|R

5000|$|The {{solubility}} of <b>fluorides</b> varies greatly but {{tends to}} decrease as the charge {{on the metal}} ion increases. Dissolved <b>fluorides</b> produce basic solutions. (F− is a weak base because HF is a weak acid.) ...|$|R
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium <b>fluoride,</b> or 32–64mg <b>fluoride</b> ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested <b>fluoride</b> forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear <b>fluoride</b> ions.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic <b>fluoride.</b> Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to <b>fluoride</b> and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the <b>fluoride</b> itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic <b>fluoride</b> and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than <b>fluoride</b> alone. This may explain why <b>fluoride</b> formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while <b>fluoride</b> formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E

5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium <b>fluoride</b> and praseodymium(III) <b>fluoride</b> with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium <b>fluoride</b> {{is removed from the}} reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen <b>fluoride.</b> Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E
5|$|Actinium metal {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the reduction of actinium <b>fluoride</b> with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300°C.

40|$|Besides several toxic heavy metals, {{electroplating}} effluents {{can have}} in solution different cations and anions, which may influence heavy metals removal by the biomass. Among them, <b>fluorides</b> {{are commonly used}} in the electroplating industries and thus {{can be found in}} the respective wastewaters. In the present work, the effect of the presence of <b>fluorides</b> in the efficiency of chromium(III), copper(II) and nickel(II) removal, from an effluent, by heat-inactivated cells of a brewing flocculent strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was evaluated. The presence of <b>fluorides</b> severely decreased (> 60 %) the removal of chromium(III) by yeast biomass. This effect impaired the effective treatment of the effluent according to the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Portuguese law; conversely, a higher removal of copper(II) and nickel(II) was observed. This behaviour can be understood by metal speciation. In the presence of <b>fluorides,</b> chromium(III) was mainly complexed, becoming unavailable for yeast accumulation; this effect decreased the efficiency of chromium(III) removal. Thus, in the presence of <b>fluorides,</b> less chromium(III) is associated with biomass and consequently more yeast binding sites remain available for the uptake of other metals present in solution. This fact explains the increase of copper(II) and nickel(II) removal in the presence of <b>fluorides...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{predictions of}} "unprecedented proximity" {{of the electronic}} ground state of iridium <b>fluorides</b> to the SU(2) symmetric j_eff= 1 / 2 limit, relevant for superconductivity in iridates, motivated us to investigate their crystal and electronic structure. To this aim, we performed high-resolution x-ray powder diffraction, Ir L_ 3 -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, and quantum chemical calculations on Rb_ 2 [IrF_ 6] and other iridium <b>fluorides.</b> Our {{results are consistent with}} the Mott insulating scenario predicted by Birol and Haule [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 096403 (2015) ], but we observe a sizable deviation of the j_eff= 1 / 2 state from the SU(2) symmetric limit. Interactions beyond the first coordination shell of iridium are negligible, hence the iridium <b>fluorides</b> do not show any magnetic ordering down to at least 20 K. A larger spin-orbit coupling in iridium <b>fluorides</b> compared to oxides is ascribed to a reduction of the degree of covalency, with consequences on the possibility to realize spin-orbit-induced strongly correlated physics in iridium <b>fluorides...</b>|$|R

A rising concentration of <b>fluorides</b> in the environment could be a potentially negative factor affecting the male fertility.
