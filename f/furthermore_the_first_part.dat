5000|$|More realistically, perhaps contradicting the {{multiple}} dates {{idea is that}} there are no breaks between the bound paper blocks that match the different sections. Each page is one part of eight, of a larger sheet folded. When bound, the pages originating from the same sheet can appear in quite different parts of a book, but always within the same block. The enigma here is that sections that seem like afterthoughts and added at later stages, do not appear as separate page bundles that were printed independent of earlier sections. If that is the case, and Matthew had devised his book as it is, from the outset, {{it is hard to see}} how he went to press before the July Revolution, as he states, with a book originally intended to be only on arboriculture, but then end up with a book quite different, if it had not been added to in the interim. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> of the colophon ("In taking a retrospective glance at our pages…" [...] p388) refers to the book as already printed, and the few mistakes he could have improved, plus, there is an erratum on the final page.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{analysis}} of the economic reforms implemented in reconstruction of the Soviet economy by M. S. Gorbachev since the late 1980 s to early 1990 s. The first part of the work is engaged in analysis of the underlying assumptions of the Soviet economy, thus its poor condition and negative factors that caused this state. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> of the work focuses on the analysis of domestic and foreign political scene and the discussion on the need for economic reforms, which took place recently in 1960 s.

Work answers the question, why did the conversion process ended in failure and why it failed to implement the original three key reforms. The work demonstrates that legalization of entrepreneurship was not understood by most of citizens and byrocrats. Laws were inadequately prepared, included many uncertainties and space for deviation from the original intentions of their creators.

The burden of international commitments and the fact that increasing criminal activities have recently been committed by legal entities led the Czech legislator to adopt the criminal liability of legal entities which represents a great milestone for the Czech criminal law. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the positive legal regulation of the criminal liability of legal entities whilst taking into consideration {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the effective legal regulation. Especially it deals with the analysis of the particular substantive provision of the Act (except for provisions regarding the sanctioning of the legal entities) which are (not only) by the experts considered to be at least disputable.

The opening chapter of the bachelor thesis deals with the general problems of aging and old age, elaborating on the individual concepts and contingencies that invariably accompany these issues. The next part of the thesis details certain relevant facts about homes for the elderly, comparing care for the elderly in the past and today. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> of the thesis focuses on intervention mobility programs, describing what these programs are about, what is considered adequate physical activity, and what role the retention of mobility plays in the life of the elderly in general.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze {{macroeconomic}} impacts of four selected oil shocks on the United States economy and their subsequent comparison. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> of this study deals with the theoretical background of supply shock, its influence on the economy, and the possible responses of economic policy. <b>Furthermore,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> I focus on <b>the</b> historical events that led to the oil crisis, specifically on the OPEC oil embargo imposed on the United States, production cuts caused by the Iranian revolution, Iran-Iraq War and Persian Gulf War and on the demand as well as the supply factors that led to the oil shock of 2007 - 2008. The second part of this study presents the specific impacts of four selected oil shocks on the US economy and their comparison. Based on the findings, it was possible to confirm the hypothesis saying that past oil shocks, especially those that took place in the 1970 's, had more negative impacts on the United States economy in comparison with those that happened more recently. In other words, that the effects of changes in oil prices have lessened over time. There are many reasons of this moderation, but the most important ones include more effective monetary policy response, the decrease in wage rigidities, and more recently also the decline of United States dependency on imported oil...|$|R

But that resolution paved a distant place. On the morrow I was in bed. I was not sick, but I was very unhappy, and I was in bed. When describing the wonderful water of Hawaii I forgot to describe the wonderful sun of Hawaii. It is a tropic sun, and, <b>furthermore,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> of June, it is an overhead sun. It is also an insidious, deceitful sun. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in my life I was sunburned unawares. My arms, shoulders, and back had been burned {{many times in the past}} and were tough; but not so my legs. And for four hours I had exposed the tender backs of my legs, at right- angles, to that perpendicular Hawaiian sun. It was not until after I got ashore that I discovered the sun had touched me. Sunburn at first is merely warm; after that it grows intense and the blisters come out. Also, the joints, where the skin wrinkles, refuse to bend. That is why I spent the next day in bed. I couldn't walk. And that is why, to-day, I am writing this in bed. It is easier to than not to. But to-morrow, ah, to-morrow, I shall be out in that wonderful water, and I shall come in standing up, even as Ford and Freeth. And if I fail to-morrow, I shall do it the next day, or the next. Upon one thing I am resolved: the Snark shall not sail from Honolulu until I, too, wing my heels with the swiftness of the sea, and become a sun-burned, skin-peeling Mercury.|$|R

The guards quickly stand down when Oswald reveals he is wearing an explosive vest (at Jack's suggestion). This advantage seems short-lived when a radio transmission from The Cousin at the Buenos Aires site reveals that Three Families operatives there have captured Esther and Rex, but when Oswald expresses that he didn't expect to leave Shanghai alive, the operatives temporarily stand down. After spending some time examining the face of The Blessing, deducing that it generates a morphic field linking the human race, Jack and Gwen question The Mother about the Miracle; she reveals that the Miracle was produced by introducing Jack's immortal blood to The Blessing- causing it to disperse immortality to the whole human race as a 'defence' to a perceived 'attack'-, and <b>furthermore</b> is simply <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> in a larger plan to assert control of the world.

40|$|The {{following}} study analyses {{the occurrence}} of product recalls in the toy industry. The first part explores whether toy companies follow any structured guidelines upon conducting recalls, basing on the framework for effective recall management evaluated by Smith, Thomas and Quelch (1996). <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>part</b> outlines whether toy companies adopt proactive or passive responses to the recalls; and what approaches according to the “company response continuum” they undertake. The {{second part of the}} research investigates consumers’ expectations of how toy recalls should be handled and identifies what recall actions are considered most important to them. The operational and managerial implications of the above expectations are also discussed. The study argues that companies do not generally follow any structured steps when conducting toy recalls and that they do not adhere to the Smith, Thomas and Quelch’s (1996) framework in the same way. Moreover, the study discovers that passive responses are prevalent among the recalling toy companies, while both the “super-effort” and the “forced compliance” approaches according to the “company response continuum” are equally common. Finally, the research outlines that consumers vary in their expectations of of recalls’ handling; however, they anticipate similar behavior from toy companies. This includes: proactive preparation for recalls; conducting recalls immediately after discovering faulty toys; keeping the customers fully informed about the cause of the defects and their potential consequences and providing them with an adjustment offer in return for the defective products...|$|E
