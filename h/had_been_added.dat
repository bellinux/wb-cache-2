5|$|By 1870, a track <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to {{the east}} of the station and two sidings <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the west; one of the western sidings was a bay {{platform}} for passenger trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor. Interlocking signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.|$|E
5|$|A new figure, a wizard, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to {{the left}} of the sleighs and the lion guardians at the entry of the temple, which had {{received}} a noticeably Chinese character. The colours are forceful and there are considerable amounts of gold, something that Larsson intended as a disclaimer of the common notion that pre-history was gray.|$|E
5|$|The first epizoic {{species of}} earwig was {{discovered}} by a London taxidermist {{on the body of}} a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909, then described by Karl Jordan. By the 1950s, the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to Dermaptera.|$|E
5000|$|Changes made {{specific}} to [...] "Backwards" [...] include an animated {{shot of the}} ejected Rimmer <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the opening scene with Starbug with scream and thump sounds enhanced. Starbugs sounds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> remixed and enhanced throughout. A new time-hole tunnel sequence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> when Starbug travels through it. POV landscape shots <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> as Starbug enters the backwards Earth. Fire elements and sound effects <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the Starbug crash. The cafe exterior <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> as a transitional shot. The cloaking Starbug <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the existing empty shot of Lister and Cat arriving on backwards Earth. The end credit sequence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> flipped and reads in reverse.|$|R
40|$|An {{implicit}} unfactored SSOR algorithm <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the overset Navier-Stokes CFD code OVERFLOW 2 for unsteady {{and moving}} body applications. The HLLEM and HLLC third-order spatial upwind convective flux models <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> for high-speed flow applications. A generalized upwind transport equation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> for {{solution of the}} two-equation turbulence models and the species equations. The generalized transport equation is solved using an unfactored SSOR implicit algorithm. Three hybrid RANS/DES turbulence models <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> for unsteady flow applications. Wall function boundary conditions that include compressibility and heat transfer effects <b>have</b> <b>been</b> also <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to OVERFLOW 2...|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{was created}} in 1979 with 426.2 ha of land. 204.8 <b>ha</b> <b>were</b> <b>added</b> in 1986 and 1.7 <b>ha</b> <b>were</b> <b>added</b> in July 2001.|$|R
5|$|The gardens {{were well}} {{established}} by 1633, and by 1667 several walled gardens and courts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> with established orchards. They {{were accompanied by}} stone gate lodges, which were removed in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the {{existing}} ruined walls {{on the east side}} of the castle to make it look more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site of the castle was excavated.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, D.C., Mulder {{introduces}} Scully to the Lone Gunmen, {{a trio of}} eccentric {{conspiracy theorists}} with whom he collaborates. After returning to FBI headquarters, Scully discovers a surveillance device within her pen. Mulder meets with Deep Throat, who provides him with documentation of an intercepted Iraqi transmission regarding the downed UFO. Scully continues to investigate the Tennessee incident, learning that two thousand pounds of extra weight <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to Ranheim's truck. She also learns Ranheim's true identity as Frank Druce.|$|E
50|$|Basins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> in {{a number}} of the rooms, along with {{built-in}} cupboards and some new partitions. Two kitchens <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> and <b>are</b> generally equipped with basic timber joinery and stainless steel benches.|$|R
50|$|A {{weatherboard}} boathouse/living {{area with}} a corrugated iron gable roof <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the northwest of the kitchen house, and a later weatherboard bunkhouse with a hipped corrugated iron roof <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the southwest.|$|R
50|$|The school's 2014 {{construction}} {{project will be}} complete after several months of construction. Several additions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> by contractor Sano-Rubin Construction Services. A gymnasium and gate station <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> Also several wings on the second and first floors and three science labs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> As well, they have moved the Pupil Personnel Services, expanded the Counseling Center, expanded and moved art rooms, expanded the cafeteria, and moved the fitness center.|$|R
5|$|In May 1993, {{the band}} {{heard that a}} record {{executive}} from Creation Records would be scouting for talent at King Tut's in Glasgow. Together, they found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Parry (1818−1879), an architect, builder {{and future}} Member of Parliament for Boston {{employed}} {{his business partner}} and brother-in-law, Charles Kirk the younger, to design Westholme House on the site for him; their firm Kirk and Parry completed the mansion around 1849. Parry moved in with his wife, mother and sister, and employed two servants; by 1871, two domestic workers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to his household. Parry died in 1879 followed by his wife, Henrietta, in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Though more seats <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to {{the synagogue}} by {{narrowing}} the aisles, {{as a result}} of Sparger's innovations Beth Elohim outgrew its Pearl Street building, and a new one was sought. After a three-year search, in 1885 Beth Elohim purchased the building of the Congregational Church at 305 State Street (near Hoyt) for $28,000 (today $), and moved in that year.|$|E
5000|$|Hockey Ultimate Team: The {{design of}} HUT <b>has</b> <b>been</b> revamped, the reward system {{improved}} {{and a new}} playoff format for HUT <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> New features for player-card collections <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> {{to make it easier}} to create a HUT team.|$|R
50|$|Several {{resources}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> under subsequent phases. A dictionary of 10,000 sports terms <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> as well {{as tools}} for translation memories and other resources for translators including a link facility to The New Corpus for Ireland.|$|R
40|$|This July 2014 {{edition of}} the IAS-USA drug {{resistance}} mutations list updates the figures last published in March 2013. The following mutations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to existing classes or drugs: K 65 E/N <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the bars for the nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTIs) abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, and tenofovir; L 100 I <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the bar for the nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) rilpivirine; and F 121 Y <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the bars for the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) dolutegravir, elvitegravir, and raltegravir. With regard to protease inhibitors (PIs), it cannot be excluded that drug resistance may be selected for outside the protease encoding region...|$|R
5|$|While {{she was out}} of {{commission}} at Mare Island, Bennington was refitted. A pilothouse that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> on top of her bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893–94 – were removed. Benningtons mainmast was also removed, leaving her as a two-mast rig. In addition, two tall ventilation cowls were added immediately behind the bridge. After 18months of inactivity, Bennington was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas.|$|E
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, British {{submarines}} began reconnoitering the German patrol lines. On 23 August, several British commanders submitted {{a plan to}} attack the patrol line with the light cruisers and destroyers of the Harwich Force, commanded by Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. These ships would be supported by submarines and Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers and associated light forces. The plan was approved and set for 28 August. The British forces began to leave port {{on the evening of}} 26 August, beginning with the submarines assigned to the operation. Most of the surface forces went to sea early on the following morning; the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to provide further support to the Harwich Force, left port later in the day.|$|E
50|$|Levels one and {{two have}} {{terracotta}} tile awnings with timber brackets. Two offices <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> {{to the rear of}} the ground level, and a rear bedroom and side bathroom, both with corrugated iron skillion roofs, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to level two.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of Rising Tide was announced on May 18, 2015. The game {{was released on}} October 9, 2015. Several new features <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> post launch. A spoils of war system <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to allow victors in war to pick what they want from the defeated foes. A black market <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to allow players {{to buy or sell}} resources for diplomatic capital. The AI is much more aggressive toward players close to the completion of wonders or to victory.|$|R
50|$|New quality {{measures}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b>|$|R
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added,</b> and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> {{to the south}} wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs {{was removed from the}} west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to {{the system}} that took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, took over the Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took {{over much of the}} remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N had been created that overlaid US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the truncation of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E
50|$|LXQt <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|A new {{electric}} {{parking brake}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> with brake wheel {{on the left side}} of the long hood. Ditch lights <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the rear during rebuilding.|$|R
50|$|Since 1958, no repairs or renovations {{were done}} to the temple. This caused some serious decay to the {{structures}} and sculptures. From 1978 till 1980, extensive renovation was done. A sculptor from the Academy of Sculptors in Mahapalipuram, Chennai and two assistant sculptors were brought from India to restore the structure. Although the basic form of the 1933 structure <b>had</b> <b>been</b> retained, many new areas <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> A new hall 31 feet × 27 feet, suitable for small religious functions, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> and over this, another story <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> for administrative offices.|$|R
5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to their empire and Eretria had been punished. It was only a minor setback that the {{invasion}} had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire. Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It {{was the first time}} that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{embarked}} on a six-date concert tour from November 5 to November 15, 2011, through North America and Europe to promote both the mixtape and his other musical projects. Originally, six shows were scheduled with a New York City performance at the Bowery Ballroom on the 6th. The original date for that show was postponed to the 27th, and that an additional show on the 28th <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> The reported reason was because Ocean was sick. The performances featured no opening act, and the only performer on stage {{at any given time}} was Ocean.|$|E
50|$|More ships <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to the fleet.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the arcade versions, but included with a stage select and option menu. The option menu {{is similar to}} the configuration menus in the arcade versions, except that the ability to save and load high scores and adjust the screen <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b> For Gradius III, the option to change the amount of lag <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> because the PS2 processor is much faster than the arcade processor and for Gradius IV, the option to change sound (stereo/mono) and screen size (PCB/full-size) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added.</b>|$|R
50|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> little {{alteration}} to {{the chapel}} over time. Aluminium blade sun shades <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> to some windows and the crucifix in the mediation chapel <b>has</b> <b>been</b> removed. The reflecting pond in the forecourt <b>has</b> <b>been</b> removed. A wide concrete ramp <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>added</b> in the forecourt probably replacing a wide stair.|$|R
