5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. In November 1939, during the so-called 'Phoney War', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production The First Days, in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum initially remained open but was closed {{for the duration of the}} war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.|$|E

50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was completed}} in 1939 but was left empty due to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. It was reputed that a mock Clapham Junction railway station was built inside to confuse the Luftwaffe. The reservoir was used for <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> experiments {{in the development of the}} FIDO landing system.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was first}} used as grass landing strip for the nearby firing ranges before being turned into a RAF station with concrete runways and hangars. The station is unique {{as it was the}} only fighter station where the <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO) was used.|$|R
50|$|Barnes Wallis {{used the}} base {{to test his}} {{bouncing}} bomb on the coast at nearby Reculver prior to the Dambusters raid. A prototype is on public display at the Spitfire & Hurricane Museum. Hawker Typhoon attack aircraft were based there later in the war, and also the first Meteor jet squadron of the RAF. It {{was used as a}} departure point for airborne forces in Operation Market Garden. It {{was one of the few}} airfields installed with the <b>Fog</b> Investigation <b>Dispersal</b> Organisation (FIDO) system designed to remove fog from airfields by burning it off with petrol.|$|R
25|$|A {{solution}} for landing returning military aircraft developed in World War II was called <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO). It involved burning {{enormous amounts of}} fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog, allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft. The high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations.|$|R
50|$|RAF Foulsham at Foulsham in Norfolk {{was built}} between 1941 and 1942 for No. 2 Group RAF Bomber Command and opened in May 1942 and {{declared}} operational on 26 June 1942. Foulsham {{was one of}} the few airfields to be fitted with FIDO in 1944, a <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> system which used fires at the sides of the runways.|$|E
50|$|Carnaby was one {{of fifteen}} airfields {{operating}} the <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> system known as Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). The system consisted of two rows of pipes emitting burning petrol {{one on each side}} of the runway, the heat from this fire raised the air temperature above the runways, cutting a hole in the fog and provided crews with a brightly lit strip indicating the position of the runway.|$|E
50|$|As {{the bomber}} {{offensive}} grew in scale, more aircraft flew ever greater distances and more accidents followed. Despite Churchill's injunction, no measures {{being taken to}} reduce the losses caused by bad weather. Eventually, in September 1941 Charles Portal, Chief of the Air Staff and Lord Cherwell, Churchill's scientific advisor, recommended that the pre-war <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> work should be resumed. However, the idea met with resistance and Cherwell later reluctantly recommended postponement.|$|E
50|$|The {{adverse weather}} {{conditions}} included much fog and this caused the loss of many aircraft. To counter this <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO) was installed on runway Baker (the bomber runway) and it became operational in mid-June 1944. It was used on several occasions, allowing successful take-off and landing in foggy conditions that would otherwise have prevented safe operations.|$|R
50|$|In December 1947 a Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3 {{flying into}} the airport made the world's first blind landing by a {{scheduled}} commercial airliner using Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA) radar, Instrument Landing System (ILS) and <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO) oil-burning units adjacent to the runway. By the following year the airline had made 1,200 routine instrument landings at the often fog-shrouded airport.|$|R
50|$|About 30% of the {{emergency}} landings were caused by bad weather, especially fog which could be dispersed by <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO) where up to 450,000 L of petrol per hour was pumped through a system of pipes {{along the side of}} the runway and burnt to produce a wall of flames which would lift the fog. Fuel was transported to Melton railway station before being piped to the airfield.|$|R
50|$|The Second World War he {{returned}} to military service, and was Adjutant and Quartermaster General of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. He served in the British Expenditionary Force (BEF) in 1940, and was mentioned in despatches. He became a Major-General in 1943. From 1940 to 1945 he was Director-General of the Petroleum Warfare Department, which developed innovative applications for petrol during the conflict, include FIDO, (<b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> at airports), and PLUTO (pipeline under the ocean taking fuels from England to Europe during & after the Invasion build-up).|$|E
50|$|The closest {{airport is}} the Arcata-Eureka Airport located in McKinleyville. This airport {{was built by}} the Army Air Corps in World War II in a {{particularly}} foggy location, as a site to test <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> techniques. No successful dispersal method {{appears to have been}} found, and after demobilization the airfield was given to the County of Humboldt as a civilian airport. This airport is one of the foggiest in the world, resulting in frequent flight delays or cancellations. Some arriving flights are diverted to Redding, California, a three-hour drive to the east, or Crescent City, about 90 mi to the north.|$|E
50|$|RAF Downham Market opened as a {{satellite}} station for RAF Marham in the Summer of 1942. The station {{was equipped with}} three concrete runways, one of 1,900 yards and two of 1,400 yards. Originally there were 36 hardstandings, although this dropped to 34 when an additional B1 hangar was added in the north west of the station. Six T2 hangars were built, three of which were for the storage of gliders. Accommodation was provided for 1,719 males and 326 females, with Bexwell Hall being used as the officer's mess. In October 1943 the station was equipped with the FIDO <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> system.|$|E
50|$|The airline's {{innovative}} spirit {{extended into}} air safety, as well: in December 1947, a Southwest Airways DC-3 {{flying into the}} coastal town of Arcata made the world's first blind landing by a scheduled commercial airliner using ground-controlled approach radar, instrument landing system devices, and <b>fog</b> investigation and <b>dispersal</b> operation oil-burning units adjacent to the runway. By the following year, the airline had made 1,200 routine instrument landings at the often fog-shrouded Arcata airport.|$|R
50|$|Ludford Magna {{was one of}} a {{small number}} of RAF {{stations}} equipped with an early experimental <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO) system. The station was provided with seven large fuel tanks, which pumped petrol into two large pipes running up either side one of their runways. Once the open flame burners {{along the length of the}} main runway were ignited the intense rising heat would lift and disperse the fog leaving a visually clear and illuminated runway.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (FIDO) (which was {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "Fog Intense Dispersal Operation" [...] or [...] "Fog, Intense Dispersal Of") was a system used for dispersing fog and pea soup fog (dense smog) from an airfield so that aircraft could land safely. The device was developed by Arthur Hartley for British RAF bomber stations, allowing the landing of aircraft returning from raids over Germany in poor visibility by burning fuel in rows {{on either side of the}} runway.|$|R
5000|$|By September 1942 it was {{realised}} {{that not}} only were many aircraft being unnecessarily lost but that sustained operations were being limited by considerations of the weather. Secretary of State for Air, Archibald Sinclair recommended that PWD undertake <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> trials. Within 24 hours, a personal minute was on Geoffrey Lloyd's desk: [...] "It is of the greatest importance to find a means to dissipate fog at aerodromes so that aircraft can land safely. Let full experiments to this end be put in hand by the Petroleum Warfare Department with all expedition. They should be given every possible support. W.S.C." ...|$|E

40|$|The charged {{particle}} generator was further tested after some design modification. The generator performance {{was measured with}} additional instrumentation and found to confirm previous measurements. Plans for a field testing were than developed. The overall status {{of the program and}} the field test plans were presented to a group of atmospheric scientists and electrostatic experts at the NASA/MSFC sponsored USRA Workshop on Electrostatic <b>Fog</b> <b>Dispersal</b> at NCAR, Boulder, Colorado discussed in previous sections. The recommendations from this workshop are being evaluated as to whether NASA should proceed with the field test or whether further theoretical research on the phenomenon of electrostatic <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> and additional development of the {{charged particle}} generator should be carried out. Information obtained from the USRA Workshop clearly identified three physical mechanisms that could possibly influence the <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> process, which heretofore have not been considered, and which may provide additional insight to the direction of further <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> work. These mechanisms are: the effect of corona discharge on the electric field strength at the surface, the influx of fog into the cleared volume by turbulent diffusion, and the increase in supersaturation as liquid water is removed, activating haze particles, and thus generating more fog. Plans are being formulated to investigate these mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-low-volume (ULV) {{and thermal}} <b>fog</b> aerosol <b>dispersals</b> of {{pesticides}} {{have been used}} against mosquitoes and other insects for half a century. Although each spray technology has advantages and disadvantages, only 7 studies have been identified that directly compare their performance in the field. US military personnel currently operating in hot-arid environments are impacted by perpetual nuisance and disease vector insect problems, despite adulticide operations using modern pesticide-delivery equipment such as ULV. None of the identified comparative studies has looked at the relative feasibility and efficacy of ULV and thermal fog equipment against mosquitoes in hot-arid environments. In this study we {{examine the impact of}} ULV and thermal fog applications of malathion against caged sentinel mosquitoes in the field in a warm temperate area of Florida, followed by a similar test in a hot-dry desert area of southern California. Patterns of mortality throughout 150 m × 150 m grids of sentinel mosquitoes indicate greater efficacy from the thermal fog application in both environments under suboptimal ambient weather conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings for future military preventive medicine activities and encourage further investigations into the relative merits of the 2 technologies for force health protection...|$|R
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Hartley was seconded from Anglo-Iranian to the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1940. From 1940-1 he assisted with the development of a stabilized bombsight which was used by RAF Bomber Command in the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz in 1944. From 1942 Hartley worked with the Petroleum Warfare Department and was appointed as its technical director. Here he developed, at the request of Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris, the <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation which was known as FIDO. This was a means of burning oil along runways to disperse fog. The system was installed at fifteen airfields across Britain, beginning in 1943. FIDO is credited with bringing 2,500 aircraft and 10,000 aircrew safely home during the war.|$|R
50|$|The Petroleum Warfare Department (PWD) was an {{organisation}} {{established in}} Britain in 1940 {{in response to}} the invasion crisis during World War II, when it appeared that Germany would invade the country. The department was initially tasked with developing the uses of petroleum as a weapon of war and it oversaw the introduction {{of a wide range of}} flame warfare weapons. Later in the war, the department was instrumental in the creation of the <b>Fog</b> Investigation and <b>Dispersal</b> Operation (commonly known as FIDO) that cleared runways of fog allowing the landing of aircraft returning from bombing raids over Germany in poor visibility; and Operation Pluto which installed prefabricated fuel pipelines between England and France soon after the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944.|$|R
40|$|Low {{visibility}} due to warm fog {{has caused}} costly disruptions {{in the case}} of aircraft schedules, and fog-related difficulties can arise in connection with Space Shuttle flights. As current methods of fog elimination are not entirely satisfactory, Kelley (1983) has proposed a new brute force procedure for warm <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal.</b> This procedure makes use of recycled water sprays. Fog droplets are removed by coalescence/rainout. Details regarding the involved approaches are described, and a demonstration of the method is discussed. Attention is given to tests conducted in October 1984, visual range improvement in response of water spray <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal,</b> a systematic investigation concerning a selection of firefighting nozzles, and histograms of fog droplet number concentration measured in the spray curtain outflow with a forward scattering spectrometer probe...|$|E

40|$|A new brute-force {{method of}} warm <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> is described. The method uses large volume {{recycled}} water sprays to create curtains of falling drops {{through which the}} fog is processed by the ambient wind and spray induced air flow. Fog droplets are removed by coalescence/rainout. The efficiency of the technique depends upon the drop size spectra in the spray, the height to which the spray can be projected, the efficiency with which fog laden air is processed through the curtain of spray, and {{the rate at which}} new fog may be formed due to temperature differences between the air and spray water. Results of a field test program, implemented to develop the data base necessary to assess the proposed method, are presented. Analytical calculations based upon the field test results indicate that this proposed method of warm <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> is feasible. Even more convincingly, the technique was successfully demonstrated in the one natural fog event which occurred during the test program. Energy requirements for this technique are an order of magnitude less than those to operate a thermokinetic system. An important side benefit is the considerable emergency fire extinguishing capability it provides along the runway...|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War the {{airfield}} sited to the north-east of Bradwell Waterside was a front-line station, and named RAF Bradwell Bay. Prior to this conflict a small grass airfield was sited there for refuelling and re-arming the aircraft used by pilots practising shooting and bombing at the ranges on nearby Dengie Marshes. In 1941 {{the airfield}} was enlarged, swallowing up the pre-war grass landing ground, and three concrete runways were laid down. As {{it was quite}} near to the coast, and many aircraft in distress landed there, it had the FIDO (<b>Fog</b> Intensive <b>Dispersal</b> Operation) system installed to help pilots find a safe landing in foggy weather. Many night-fighter squadrons were based here, equipped first with the Douglas Havoc, then the de Havilland Mosquito, the ubiquitous multi-role-combat aircraft of its time. The airfield was also used as a jumping-off point for fighters escorting long-distance bombing raids on Germany, and such types as the Spitfire and North American Mustang could be seen. A recent memorial, {{in the shape of}} a crashed de Havilland Mosquito, has been placed near to the edge of the airfield to remember all those who lost their lives in defence of Britain in the Second World War whilst based at RAF Bradwell Bay.|$|R
40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} in <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal</b> {{technology is}} briefly discussed. Fog is categorized as supercooled fog, occurring in air temperatures below freezing, and warm fog, occurring at above-freezing temperatures. Operational techniques {{are available to}} disperse supercooled fog in the airport area. It {{is much more difficult}} to cope with warm fog. Various known concepts to disperse warm fog are evaluated as to their operational merits. The most effective concept for immediate use involves heating the air to cause fog evaporation. Use of helicopter downwash has some application, possibly complementing the promising concept of seeding with sized hygroscopic particles. These latter two concepts appear to have future application, pending further research. The concept using polyelectrolytes is of uncertain value, lacking both a scientific explanation and a substantive evaluation of reported operational successes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} under {{presentation}} it was performed theoretical analysis of acoustic field influence on processes proceeding into two-component medium which is fog (waterdrops {{suspended in the}} air). Acoustic waves may influence on media where they propagate. Acoustic field, {{except for the fact}} that causes to accelerate waterdrop coagulation process, influences kinetics of phase changes: water – steam (gas). If gas medium is not steam – saturated enough then under acoustic field, evaporation of waterdrops suspended in the air follows. If then gas medium is steam – saturated enough so under acoustic field increase in size of waterdrops follows (fog condensation). In the both cases the change of waterdrop radius value is observed, suspended in the gas medium and this causes the change of its clarity. Under specific conditions these processes cause <b>fog</b> <b>dispersal,</b> then it is possible to use acoustic field as agent causing increase in atmosphere clarity...|$|E
