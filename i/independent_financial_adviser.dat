40|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> play a {{vital role}} in {{assisting}} clients to meet their financial goals. However, it appears that additional guidance is needed for these advisers to survive in their complex business environment, governed by strict legislation. To date, only a small amount of research has been conducted in this area and no formal research study in South Africa has provided a course of direction for these advisers. Consequently, this study aimed to expand the body of knowledge by investigating the potential problems posing a threat to the businesses of <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> in their business life cycle, as well as possible strategies that can be implemented to counter those obstacles. Based on the findings a theoretical framework was proposed, suggesting key areas <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> would need to focus on in their business life cycle to conquer the challenges they might encounter and survive. The study concluded with a number of hypotheses to set the direction for future empirical research regarding the survival and growth of <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> in South Africa.

40|$|Orientation: <b>Independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> in South Africa {{can make}} a {{valuable}} contribution to the financial well-being of the country’s citizens and, through sound financial planning and education, assist them in becoming financially independent. Research purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop guidelines for creating customer loyalty towards <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> in South Africa. Motivation: To succeed, <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> need to build good relationships with clients and ensure they remain loyal to them in the long term. Research design, approach and method: A convenience non-probability sampling technique was applied, and altogether 262 self-administered questionnaires were completed and used in the analysis. Descriptive and standard multiple regression analysis and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique were used to test four hypotheses formulated for the study. Main findings: Relationship commitment must be established in a trustworthy environment, regardless of the type of province where the business is operated. Practical/managerial implications: In urban provinces (such as Gauteng) both trusting relationships and commitment could lead to customer loyalty; in semi-urban provinces (such as North-West) only the commitment variable might do so. <b>Independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> in both provinces should explore additional factors that could foster customer loyalty. Contributions: The research findings of this study challenge the seminal work of Morgan and Hunt (1994) by establishing that in South Africa, the extent to which trust and commitment predicts customer loyalty is specific to both industrial and geographical location. This study further provides customer loyalty guidelines for <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> in South Africa. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> have {{to address}} {{different}} problems as they pro¬gress through the life cycle stages of their businesses. A number of researchers, however, are {{of the opinion that}} small business owners do not have the ability to manage the growth-related transitions effectively. It appears that additional guidance is needed to assist <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> with the survival and growth of their small businesses. Until now, only a small amount of research has been conducted in this area and no formal research study has proposed a marketing mix framework for these advisers, portraying the various factors threatening their survival and growth in their organisational life cycle, as well as the various marketing mix strategies that can be implemented to proactively manage the problems and help generate sales growth. The objective {{of this study was to}} propose such a framework to offer additional assistance for business survival and sales growth. This study was exploratory in nature and commenced with a comprehensive lit¬erature investigation to gain the necessary background to support the empirical part of the study. Different opinions and studies were presented and evaluated, which led to the identification of a general business life cycle model as well as a number of problems and marketing mix solutions that could potentially occur in each life cycle stage. These literature findings were then further investigated among <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> by means of telephone and personal interviews. Following the empirical findings, the recommended framework suggests that <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> may experience three types of problems in their businesses: critical problems, important problems and problems that only need consideration. <b>Independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> can use four groups of recom¬mended marketing mix strategies to address these problems. There are also four groups of recommended marketing mix strategies that can assist these advisers to grow their sales (commission). These advisers would, however, need to ensure that they are aware of and understand the various environmental factors that can hinder the successful implementation of the marketing mix strategies. They also need to be able to use the recommended counterstrategies to address the environmental factors. Ultimately, the successful implementation of the recommended marketing mix strategies could then help <b>independent</b> <b>financial</b> <b>advisers</b> to grow their businesses and progress to a more advanced life cycle stage.
