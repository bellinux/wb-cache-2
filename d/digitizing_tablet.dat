50|$|Simple {{computer}} systems, able {{to display}} only 7-bit ASCII text (essentially the 26 Latin letters, 10 digits, and punctuation marks), long provided a convincing argument for using pinyin instead of Chinese characters.

40|$|Small {{hand-held}} touchpads {{can be used}} {{to replace}} stylusbased <b>digitizing</b> <b>tablets</b> when the use of a stylus is not convenient. In text entry tasks where the writing surface is held in a hand the error rate becomes a problem. The small size of strokes compared to the width of the fingertip and the additional imprecision caused by the interaction of the pad and finger movements make input very imprecise. We describe a new improved clock-face based stroke system for entering numbers with a touchpad. In a 20 -session user study with 6 users we found slightly better throughput of successfully entered numbers with the proposed new system. This advantage was mainly due to lower error rate with the new system. User preference similarly slightly favored the new system over an earlier straightforward proposal based on the clock metaphor...|$|R

Functionality is distributed between the PDA and the main computer, with the PDA performing low-level shape recognition and editing functions, and the back-end computer performing high-level recognition functions, including recognition of spatial relations between picture elements. This organization provides a number of advantages over conventional pen-based systems employing simple <b>digitizing</b> <b>tablets.</b> It provides the opportunity to use hardware specially designed for shape recognition and editing in a general diagram recognition system, it allows for improved performance through parallel processing, and it allows diagram entry to be performed remotely through use of the PDA front end in the field, with recognized shapes subsequently downloaded to the main diagram recognizer.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} {{in which an}} on-line handwritten character {{is characterized by a}} sequence of dominant points in strokes and a sequence of writing directions between consecutive dominant points. The directional information is used for character preclassification and the positional information is used for fine classification. Both preclassification and fine classification are based on dynamic programming matching. A recognition experiment has been conducted with 62 character classes of different writing styles and 21 people as data contributors. The recognition rate of this experiment is 91 %, with 7. 9 % substitution rate and 1. 1 % rejection rate. The average processing time is 0. 35 second per character on a 486 50 MHz personal computer. 1 Introduction With the development of <b>digitizing</b> <b>tablets</b> and microcomputers, on-line handwriting recognition has become an area of active research since the 1960 s [3].

40|$|Due to {{technological}} progress and European standardization (e. g. ISO certification) {{there is an}} increasing demand to automate the digital recording of building plans. Currently there are two approaches available: (1) labour-intensive redrawing with <b>digitizing</b> <b>tablets</b> or by screen digitizing, (2) automatic scanning and vectorizing where vectorization generally demands an interactive follow-up treatment due to incomplete or ambigues results. This paper proposes a knowledge-based approach for building plan analysis. The procedure reveals the following processing steps: scanning of the building plan, enhancing the image quality and binarization, extraction of lines, line junctions and character fields, knowledge-based interpretation and grouping of image features to domain specific feature aggregates like door symbols, stair symbols etc., optical character recognition and lexicon-based interpretation of character fields, matching of feature aggregates with dimension sets.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} method, {{based on}} polar coordinates that allow modelling of {{primary and secondary}} growth processes in stems of extant and fossil plants, is summarized and its potential is discussed in comparison with numerical methods using <b>digitizing</b> <b>tablets</b> or electronic image analysing systems.

In {{the second half of}} the paper we present new data of a functional analysis of stem structure and biomechanics of the early lignophyte Tetraxylopteris schmidtii (Middle Devonian) using the polar coordinate method for modelling the tissue distribution in stems of different ontogenetic age. Calculations of the mechanical properties of the stems, based on the modelling of the tissue arrangement, indicate that there is no increase in structural bending modulus throughout the entire development of the plant. The oldest ontogenetic stage has a significantly smaller bending elastic modulus than the intermediate ontogenetic stage, a 'mechanical signal', which is not consistent with a self-supporting growth form. These results, and the ontogenetic variations of the contributions of different stem tissues to the flexural stiffness of the entire stem, are discussed in the evolutionary context of cambial secondary growth...|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} treatment {{approaches have}} been ap- plied for handwriting remediation in school-aged children. The {{effects of these}} treatments are usually evaluated by using ad-hoc checklists {{as well as some}} standard test protocols like Movement ABC tests, Visual-Motor Integration (V. M.

In this paper, the influence of a new rehabilitation protocol (Terzi’s method) on kinematics of cursive writing was evaluated. The analysis was carried out on 22 nonproficient handwriting children, attending primary or secondary school, which undertook a series of three exercises, with and without linguistic concerns. A set of kinematic parameters was calculated before and after the rehabilitation process. The results showed that Terzi’s rehabilitation program is capable of producing a significant velocity increase in the test without linguistic involve- ment, whereas a significant slowdown in the stroke realization was present in the other tasks. The effectiveness of Terzi’s rehabilitation program was proved by significant improvements in the V. M. I. test, in the Movement ABC test as well as in writing legibility (evaluated by checklist) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} mobile electronic devices and {{the advent of}} wearable computing has encouraged the development of compact alternatives to the keyboard and mouse. These include one-handed keyboards, <b>digitizing</b> <b>tablets,</b> and glove-based devices. This paper describes a combination pointer position and non-chorded keystroke input device that relies on miniature wrist-worn wireless video cameras that track finger position. A Hidden Markov Model is used to correlate finger movements to keystrokes during a brief training phase, after which the user can type in the air or above a flat surface as if typing on a standard keyboard. Language statistics are used to help disambiguate keystrokes, allowing the assignment of multiple unique keys to each finger and obviating chorded input. In addition, the system can be trained to recognize certain finger positions for switching between input modes; for example, from typing mode to pointer movement mode. In the latter mode of operation, the position of the mouse pointer is controlled by hand movement. The camera motion is estimated by tracking environmental features and is used to control pointer position. This allows fast switching between keystroke mode and pointer control mode. ...|$|R
