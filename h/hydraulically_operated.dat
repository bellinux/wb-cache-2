40|$|Calibration {{machines}} up to a {{torque range}} of 20 kN·m need extensive design if the force is performed by dead weights. A machine {{based on two}} force reference standards and a vertical torque axis may serve to avoid these specific problems. The precision force transducers work at a lever arm of precision length. The test piece is mounted in vertical arrangement between a <b>hydraulically</b> <b>operating</b> rotary-actuator and the torque measuring system. Such a calibration machine allows additionally performing easily continuous calibration. Regarding an overall relative uncertainty not greater than 2 · 10 - 4 there are some significant problems. The estimation of the uncertainty has been proved by comparative tests with the national torque standard by the PTB according to the guidelines EA- 10 / 14 and EA- 2 / 03.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{volumetric}} hydraulic drive structure consisting of an unregulated pump, hydraulic motor, and energy accumulation block with pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator (PHA). Drive control is provided through frequency modification of current {{arriving at the}} asynchronous electric drive (AED) from the frequency changer. The paper describes drive advantages when the energy accumulation block is set to allow power accumulation both from the AED and in recuperation regimes with moving outlet drive link with assisting loads. It offers simulation models and computer programmes to analyze a non-stationary movement of the outlet link of volumetric hydraulic drive with frequency control (VHD-FC) with hydraulic motor power supplied from the PHA. The paper examines acceleration regimes of motor axis under different loads and presents PHA energy characteristics and algorithms to find desirable operational non-displaced and constructional accumulator capacities that provide motor outlet link acceleration up to the necessary speed. It presents graphs to show changing motor axis angle speed and PHA-displaced fluid volume as well as energy and PHA power during its discharge versus acceleration time of the motor axis. These dependences are obtained through varying different parameters of the system, namely: inertia, viscous friction, constant load moment, and volumetric displacement. The paper shows that decrease of inertia load and use of hydraulic motor with high volume constants result in the most essentially reduced acceleration time. Setting the PHA allows more than 2. 5 times decreasing acceleration time of the motor axis. At the same time, because of the evidently complicated VHD-FC, taking decision on the sound PHA design and parameters {{must be based on}} the integration analysis of requirements. These requirements concern the VHD-FC reliability and performance in standard and failure modes as well as the technical-and-economic indexes and operation parameters of drive competitiveness, which are defined by specific designation of engineering <b>hydraulically</b> <b>operating</b> object. </p...|$|R
25|$|Besides the Dutch Luchtvaartafdeeling, several foreign {{air forces}} showed an {{interest}} in the G.I. as either a fighter or dive-bomber. In order to test its potential as a dive-bomber, the G.1 prototype was fitted with <b>hydraulically</b> <b>operated</b> dive brakes under the wings. Flight tests revealed that the G.1 was capable of diving at over 644km/h (400mph) and demonstrated aerobatic capabilities. Swedish Air Force officer Captain Björn Bjuggren tested the G.1 in over 20 dives and reported favourably on its effectiveness as a dive bomber. Orders for G.1b Wasp aircraft came from Spain (26 ordered) and Sweden (18), while the Mercury variant was ordered by Denmark (12) together with a production license that never became to be used, and Sweden (72). Although Belgium, Finland, Turkey, Hungary and Switzerland air forces showed great interest, they never placed firm orders.|$|E
25|$|The camera {{platforms}} {{included a}} modified Citroën sedan, camera trucks, helicopters and a flying rig constructed by Dick Parker. Parker had built it for model sequences in Strategic Air Command (1955). The rig {{consisted of two}} construction cranes and a <b>hydraulically</b> <b>operated</b> device to tilt and position a model, along with 200ft (61m) of cables. Parker's rig allowed actors to sit inside full-scale models suspended 50ft (15m) above the ground, yet provide safety and realism for staged flying sequences, with the sky realistically in the background. A further hydraulic platform did away with matte shots of aircraft in flight. The platform was large enough to mount an aircraft and Parker or stunt pilots could manipulate its controls for realistic bluescreen sequences. Composite photography was used when scenes called for difficult shots; these were completed at Pinewood Studios. Some shots were created with rudimentary cockpits and noses grafted to an Alouette helicopter. One scene over Paris was staged with small models when Paris refused an overflight. However, {{for the majority of}} flying scenes, full-scale flying aircraft were employed.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 200 C-46As in two initial batches were ordered in 1940, {{although}} only two were actually delivered by December 7, 1941. At this time, one other important change was made; more powerful 2,000hp Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engines replaced the two Wright Twin Cyclones. By November 1943, 721 modifications {{had been made}} to production models, although many were minor, such as fuel system changes and fewer cabin windows were also adopted. Subsequent military contracts for the C-46A extended the production run to 1,454 examples, 40 of which were destined for the U.S. Marine Corps, to be designated R5C-1. The military model was fitted with double cargo doors, a strengthened floor and a <b>hydraulically</b> <b>operated</b> cargo handling winch; 40 folding seats were the sole passenger accommodation for what was essentially a cargo hauler. Tests indicated that the production C-46 was capable of carrying a substantial payload, and it could fly well on one engine. When empty, the aircraft could even climb on one engine at 200–300ft per minute.|$|E

40|$|As no {{limiting}} {{values are}} available for in situ deformability of horizontal soil layers such deformation was investigated in this research project. New test apparatus was developed to perform large-scale deformation tests on 0. 6 m high barrier models with a diameter of 4. 2 m. The test apparatus is known as 'The Darmstadt Simulator for Large-Scale Deformation Tests on Horizontal Soil Layers'. The {{main part of the}} support construction consists of cylindrical rubber cushions filled with water, concentrically arranged so that three independent ring encirclings are formed. By removing water from the rings the model is deformed vertically. Downward movement can be produced in a highly controlled way by means of <b>hydraulically</b> <b>operating</b> cushions to simulate subsidence and deformation. The lowering of its support leads to a radius of curvature in the model, at subsidence velocity 4 mm per day in the centre of the support construction. The model is made from 16 t of material, compacted in 5 cm lifts. A 0. 6 m deep water layer is maintained on its top and the onset of damage due to excessive deformation is indicated by appearance of water at its lower edge, measured by TDR probes and tensiometers in the support/drainage layer immediately below. Due to this definition of damage, special care is taken to prevent water from by-passing the barrier model down the inside wall of the test apparatus. Three deformation tests were carried out, two on Hessen silt, a low plasticity material and one on medium plastic Hessen clay. Sudden increases of water content in the support/drainage layer on reaching radii of curvature between 70 m to 40 m indicated the onset of deformation failure in the Hessen silt soil layers. However, on dismantling the models cracks could not be observed visually. For the Hessen clay the maximum deformation of the test apparatus, corresponding to a radius of curvature of 6 m, does not cause any leakage. The serviceability of the model using Hessen clay is still available under those subsidence conditions. (orig.)
