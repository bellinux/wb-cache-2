40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of routinely screened cervical smears to predict a <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesion in histologically confirmed cases of cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), invasive adenocarcinoma (ADCA), adenosquamous carcinoma (ADSQCA), and severe combined glandular and squamous cell lesions. METHODS: Between 1989 - 2000, a total of 1, 141 women with a histologic diagnosis of cervical AIS, ADCA, ADSQCA, and combined lesions (<b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesion with a coexistent squamous cell lesion) were registered in the Dutch National Pathology Archive (PALGA). In 1054 of these 1, 141 histologic cases, an additional conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smear diagnosis was registered from the same patient. Material was evaluated with regard to the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis, the percentage of combined lesions, the mean age of the patients, and the time interval between AIS and ADCA. RESULTS: Of 1, 141 registered histologic cases, 57. 5 % were registered as having an "intraepithelial" lesion, whereas 42. 5 % were registered as having an "invasive" process. A combined process was diagnosed in 63. 2 % of cases. From the same patients, a cytologic diagnosis of a severe cervical epithelial lesion was registered in PALGA for 91. 2 % (n = 961) of 1054 cases. A cytologic registration of a severe <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesion (with or without a squamous cell component) was made in 547 cases (51. 9 %). Prediction of a severe <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesion on the Pap smear was found to be more accurate in cases of histologically confirmed pure <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> abnormalities than in cases with a histologic diagnosis of a combined lesion. The cytologic prediction was found to be correct in 75. 2 % of cases of pure AIS and 47. 3 % of cases of AIS with coexistent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) (cervical intraepithelial lesion [CIN] type 2 [CIN 2] or CIN 3). The mean ages of the patients with AIS and AIS + HGSIL were 37. 3 years and 34 years, respectively, whereas the mean age of the patients with ADCA and ADCA + HGSIL was 41. 9 years and 38. 1 years, respectively. The interval between the average ages of patients with AIS and ADCA and those with AIS + HGSIL and ADCA + HGSIL was 4. 6 years and 4. 1 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a data search of the PALGA registry, it can be concluded that in a relatively large number of cases a severe cervical <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesion was not diagnosed on the Pap smear. Furthermore, data demonstrated that the prediction of a glandular abnormality is less accurate in cases of combined squamoglandular cell lesions than in pure <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesions...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the current}} report, the authors {{present the results}} of a reevaluation of cytologic smears and histologic {{specimens}} obtained from patients with severe cervical <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesions (adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS] or adenocarcinoma [ADCA] of the cervix) and coexisting Grade 1, Grade 2, or Grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or squamous cell carcinoma. The goal of the current study was to assess whether knowledge of the specific cytologic characteristics of the cervical <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesions could have made the cytologic diagnosis of these combined neoplasms more accurate. METHODS: Cytologic smears and histologic specimens obtained from 36 patients with combined severe cervical lesions were evaluated for the presence of a range of microscopic cytologic and histologic features that were considered indicative of <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> changes. RESULTS: The findings of the current study suggest that the proper identification of characteristic cytomorphologic features of cervical glandular lesions would have resulted in more accurate diagnoses of combined severe cervical lesions. In the set of samples reevaluated by the authors, consideration of these features would have increased the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis from 55. 6 % to 75. 0 %. The presence of AIS was predicted in the majority of cytologic specimens, and in most cases, the identity of the predominant subtype of AIS could also be predicted. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis revealed that consideration of specific cytomorphologic features of glandular lesions of the cervix increased the authors' accuracy in diagnosing combined severe lesions of the cervix. More accurate identification of intraepithelial <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> lesions may eventually lead to decreases in cervical adenocarcinoma incidence, just as increases in diagnostic accuracy have led to decreases in the incidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions and invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix...|$|E

40|$|SummaryAtypical <b>glandular</b> <b>cells</b> are {{a common}} finding in {{cervical}} cytology in cervical cancer screening and its occurrence has increased in the last decades. The identification of these cells is clinically very important due to its association with cervical and endometrial dysplasic lesions and cancer. Using a systematic approach, this article reviewed studies investigating cervical lesions that are characteristic in patients previously diagnosed as having atypical <b>glandular</b> <b>cells.</b> Studies in which diagnostic investigation did not include histopathological diagnosis were excluded. A comprehensive search for available material in LILACS, SciELO, PubMed/ Medline and Old Medline databases, dated between 1966 and 2009 was performed. Articles omitted by the electronic database search were also included. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected. This report aims at evaluating whether atypical <b>glandular</b> <b>cells,</b> initially found in cervical cytology and subsequently identified at the histological analysis, {{are related to the}} presence of benign, pre-malignant and malignant lesions.

40|$|Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (SS) is {{a chronic}} autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine glands, primarily the salivary and lacrimal glands. It {{has been suggested}} that exogenous agents may trigger SS in genetically predisposed individuals. However, at present, the etiology of SS is far from being understood, and no direct evidence for any of these triggers has been presented. The salivary and lacrimal glands from patients with SS harbor unique and highly selected T- and B-cell populations. Disturbance in <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis may be one possible explanation for the sicca symptoms in SS. However, discrepancies between glandular destruction and salivary flow give rise to processes causing glandular dysfunction preceding or triggering <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> destruction. Recent reports suggested autoantibodies inhibiting neuronal innervation of acinar cells and defective water transport to be implicated in salivary secretion deficiency observed in SS. Several types of autoantibodies have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of SS. However, how the tolerance to these structures is broken down is unknown at present. Studies on B-cell activating factor indicated that diminished apoptosis and disturbed B-cell maturation could be responsible for the occurrence of autoreactive B-cells and B-cell hyperreactivity. B-cell activation may also provide a basis for lymphoma development observed in up to 5 % of the patients with SS...|$|E

Results: The success rates for culture of eutopic endometrial cells from endometriosis-free women and patients with endometriosis were 91. 67 % and 93. 75 % respectively. The success rate for culture of endometriotic cells was 75. 00 %.

Earlier studies focused on the general tentacle morphology and put little attention on the adhesive gland system. Our results show that the epithelial parts on the oral adhesive ridge contain three secretory cell types (columnar, goblet, and cell type 1) that differ in shape and granule size. In the non-adhesive aboral epithelium, two <b>glandular</b> <b>cell</b> types (cell types 2 and 3) are present; these were not mentioned in any earlier study and differ from the cells in the adhesive area.

The nasal tumors, mostly epidermoid carcinomas, were derived from the respiratory epithelium and nasal glands, both of which revealed squamous metaplasia or dysplasia in the anterior nasal cavity. Most nasal tumors were confined to the anterior nasal cavity and occasionally invaded the dorsonasal bones and posterior nasal cavity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the degree of tissue eosinophilia and the expression of these chemokines in the <b>glandular</b> and stromal <b>cells</b> of colorectal neoplastic lesions ranging from benign to malignant tumors. Methods: We counted the number of infiltrating eosinophils in neoplastic lesion tissue and we evaluated the expression of CCL 11 and CCL 24 in <b>glandular</b> <b>cells</b> and stromal cells by immunohistochemical staining. Results: The results showed that the number of eosinophils decreased significantly and the expression of CCL 11 and CCL 24 in <b>glandular</b> <b>cells</b> decreased with tumor progression, whereas the stromal expression of CCL 11 and CCL 24 appeared to increase. Conclusions: The discrepancy in CCL 11 and CCL 24 expression between <b>glandular</b> <b>cells</b> and stromal cells might shed light on how colorectal cancer evades the immune system, which would enable further development of immunotherapies that target these chemokines.
