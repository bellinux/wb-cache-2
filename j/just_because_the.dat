25|$|Some have {{described}} the women’s rights movement in Morocco as a movement of elites and criticized the new Mudawana on similar grounds.

500|$|Readers of AfterElton.com voted Jack {{the tenth}} best gay or {{bisexual}} television character of all time, the poll itself ultimately being won by Brian Kinney, a character from the North American version of Queer as Folk which {{was developed by}} Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman from the British series created by Russell T Davies. The website praised Jack—one of only two bisexual characters {{on the list of}} 25—for being having both [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "tender" [...] sides to his personality, as seen in the Torchwood episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness". Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating Hellblazers John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a [...] "'post-gay' approach to sexual themes" [...] and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance. For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that [...] "unlike virtually every other TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual. Ironically, this [...] "small" [...] change served to help make the science fiction genre, long the ultimate bastion of straight men, accessible not just to GLBT people, but also straight women, who also enjoy the show’s alternate take on sexuality." [...] The third award won for Torchwood, after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented [...] "Torchwood is revolutionary not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack’s case [...] "omnisexual") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it’s also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter-of-fact way. There’s no apologiing, no minimiing, and no moraliing—just good, old-fashioned romance and adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|The art {{style was}} {{influenced}} by a simplification approach, eliminating enough details but keeping overall shapes to make objects clearly recognizable. According to Antonio, they took inspiration for simplification from real-world photography, artwork, and from the environments of the games Journey, Team Fortress 2, and Mirror's Edge. They still wanted {{to ensure that a}} player would be able to recognize an area of the island they were in based on the visual appearance, such as by the types of trees around them, and assured there was enough distinction while simplifying the assets to make this possible. Blow's team was also able to engage with Fourm Design Studio, a real-world architecture firm, and Fletcher Studio, a landscape architecture team, to help develop the environments for The Witness. According to Fourm's founder, Deanna Van Buren, they developed the various manmade and cultivated areas based on the concept of three different civilization periods, with later civilizations building on the structures from earlier ones and repurposing these structures as needed. Their studios helped to bring design principles to the main development team, allowing them to then extrapolate their own ideas for the final game. Blow said that the guidance and advice of the architects helped to craft the island in a way that [...] "feels more immersive <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> details are in place, and your brain kind of picks up on it". Blow gives an example of how many of the buildings on the island are in various states of deterioration, but were designed as fully detailed and complete structures and purposely worn down to create the ruined look; the resulting structures retain logically-consistent details, such as the remains of wooden support posts for rotted-away stairways in a castle, that aid in immersion for the player.|$|E

500|$|After {{the fact}} pattern, Cardozo began his {{discussion}} of the law with [...] "the conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." [...] Cardozo quoted Pollock on Torts and cited several cases for the proposition that [...] "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." [...] Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, [...] "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." [...] Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger {{at the other end of}} the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, [...] "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." [...] The chief judge instructed, [...] "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.|$|E
500|$|... "The Calusari" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, with critics citing {{inconsistencies in}} the plot as the main detractions. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] rating, calling it [...] "an Exorcist/Omen rip-off, but a classy one". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

However, while he was [...] "not sure everything hangs together" [...] and he wished for more backstory, VanDerWerff did praise some [...] "really great moments", particularly the opening teaser. John Keegan from Critical Myth, while calling the episode [...] "a mixed bag", awarded it a 7 out of 10. He praised the entry's [...] "fascinating implications [...] the mythology hidden within the events depicted", and noted that it was [...] "well directed and acted". Despite this, he was more critical of the episode's plot and wrote that there were [...] "clear logical flaws [...] and the subject matter can be disturbing. This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called it a [...] "pale retread of The Exorcist" [...] and noted that many of the episode's elements, like the chicken-sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members, were [...] "tremendously crass". Shearman and Pearson, however, did enjoy the episode's dialogue, praising one scene in particular where the spirit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother. Regardless, however, the duo concluded that [...] "there's something stale and pointless at [...] heart." [...] The plot for [...] "The Calusari" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Garth Nix.|$|E
