40|$|Body size, sexual dimorphism, {{reproductive}} cycles, fecundity, {{diet and}} feeding behaviour of the colubrid snake Tomodon dorsatus from south-eastern Brazil were studied. Females of this viviparous species attained larger body sizes than males, the latter maturing with smaller body size than the former. Vitellogenesis {{occurred at the}} onset of rainy season, ovulation by mid rainy season, and parturition from late dry to early rainy season. Reproductive cycle was extended, maybe {{as a consequence of the}} low metabolism and food intake. Litter size ranged 4 - 26 offspring and was correlated with maternal body size. Relative clutch mass ranged 0. 48 - 0. 82, and neonates ranged 12 - 17 cm in snout-vent length. Tomodon dorsatus was shown to feed exclusively on veronicellid slugs quickly swallowed by long excursions of the specialized upper <b>jaw</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo assess operator-, examination-, and patient-related factors, {{affecting}} patient {{movement and}} re-exposure in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination. Study DesignThe {{sample consisted of}} 248 CBCT examinations in 190 patients video-recorded during examination. Three observers scored the videos; the patient moved or did not move. Operator-, examination-, and patient-related factors were evaluated separately (chi-square test) and by multivariate regression analyses (patient movement and re-exposure as separate outcomes). ResultsThe prevalence of movement was 21 %. Cotton roll stabilizing patient's <b>jaws,</b> CBCT <b>unit</b> touching patient's hair, and patient's age 15 years or greater were related to movement. Age 15 years or greater {{had a significant impact}} on movement (P < . 001; odds ratio [OR] 11. 0). There were 16 re-exposures (6. 4 %). Age 15 years or greater, presence of a cotton roll, and field of view (FOV) were related to re-exposure. Use of a large FOV had significant impact on re-exposure (P =. 04; OR 5. 8). ConclusionsOperator-, examination-, and patient-related factors may affect patient movement and re-exposure in CBCT examination...|$|R

40|$|Summary Surgical {{treatment}} of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is controversial. Current recommendations contraindicate aggressive surgery because its results are unpredictable and may trigger disease progression. In this prospective study, we assessed {{the effectiveness of}} surgical resection of the jaws in cancer patients with BRONJ. Between June 2004 and July 2009, 30 cancer patients with refractory BRONJ underwent surgical resection of the <b>jaws</b> at our <b>Units.</b> They were followed-up weekly for the first month, at 3 -month intervals up to 1 year, and at 6 -month intervals up to 2 years. Panoramic radiographs and CT-scan were obtained at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Primary outcomes were the 24 -month recurrence rate of BRONJ and the 24 -month mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were post-operative complications, duration of hospital stay after surgery, time to return to oral diet, and degree of oral pain. The 30 patients had a median age of 66 years and were mostly females (80...|$|R
40|$|Background : Tooth is {{the hardest}} tissue in human body, that can be injured because of {{attrition}} process. For old people, denture attrition process is caused by psysiological process relating with the mastication function which also supported by some bad habits such an bruxism, premature contact, and consuming habit of abrasive food. Attrition or abrasion can also be happened with patien’t dentition {{who does not have}} teeth subtutition for long time due the lost of their maxillary as well as mandibulary. The pasient will loose their vertical dimension of occlusion, injure, and the lower jaw becomes over closed which is called over closure. Purpose : This article reported the management of over closured anterior teeth due to attrition. Case : a seventy six year old woman patient came to Prosthodontic Clinic in Faculty of Dentistry, Airlangga University, to rehabilitate her upper and lower severe attrited anterior teeth and her posterior teeth. The patient has experienced of wearing acrylic removable mandibular partial denture ten years ago. Unfortunaly, the denture was uncomfortable, and she did not wear it anymore since five years ago. Case management : The severe attrition of anterior teeth with the lost of occlusal vertical dimension can be treated by improving the occlusal vertical dimension gradually. The treatment is then followed by the increasing of the height of the anterior teeth by lengthening the crown teeth of upper <b>jaw</b> with 12 <b>units</b> of span bridge and the acrylic removable partial denture of lower jaw. Conclusion : The severe attrition of anterior teeth with the lost of occlusal vertical dimension can be treated by improving the occlusal vertical dimension gradually, using long span bridge and acrylic removable partial denture. </span...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} myotatic reflex involvement in jaw muscle control, an analysis {{was made of}} the motor responses induced by mechanical vibration (120 - 160 Hz) of the jaw elevator muscles in healthy subjects. As seen in torque measurements and mean-voltage electromyographic (EMG) recordings, the vibration caused involuntary reciprocal changes in jaw muscle tone, the contraction force increasing in jaw elevators and decreasing in antagonistic jaw opening muscles. This tonic vibration reflex (TVR) elicited from the jaw elevators exhibited many characteristics similar to those previously described for limb muscle tonic vibration reflexes: it varied in strength from one subject to the next independently of the briskness of the jaw elevator tendon jerks; it had a gradual onset with successive recruitment of <b>jaw</b> elevator motor <b>units</b> firing largely out of phase with one another and at rates much lower than the vibration frequency; it was susceptible to voluntary control [...] when allowed visual feed-back from the torque meter all subjects were able to suppress the TVR and keep mean contraction force constant. The results indicate that with respect to the tonic motor response to sustained inflow in the Ia afferent nerve fibres, the jaw elevators do not differ markedly from other skeletal muscles. Independently of whether a TVR was present or not, the vibration caused a timing of the motor unit discharges in the jaw elevators that could not be controlled voluntarily and that showed up in gross EMG recordings as a marked grouping of discharges synchronous with each wave of vibration. A similar but less distinct grouping of the gross EMG pattern was seen in limb muscles exposed to vibration, the dispersion increasing with the peripheral conduction distances of the reflex arcs. It is suggested that contrary to the TVR, which depends on the sustained mean level of the Ia afferent input, the timing phenomenon depends, like the tendon jerk, on the degree of synchrony in the afferent Ia volleys. Monosynaptic projections may well be involved in the dynamic timing of motor discharges during tonic firing, but this does not imply that the TVR or the tonic stretch reflex is dependent upon such projections...|$|R
