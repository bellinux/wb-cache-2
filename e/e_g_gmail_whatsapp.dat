40|$|Representing world {{knowledge}} in a machine processable format is important as entities and their descriptions have fueled tremendous growth in knowledge-rich information processing platforms, services, and systems. Prominent applications of knowledge graphs include search engines (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Google Search and Microsoft Bing), email clients (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Gmail),</b> and intelligent personal assistants (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Google Now, Amazon Echo, and Apple’s Siri). In this paper, we present {{an approach that}} can summarize facts about a collection of entities by analyzing their relatedness in preference to summarizing each entity in isolation. Specifically, we generate informative entity summaries by selecting: (i) inter-entity facts that are similar and (ii) intra-entity facts that are important and diverse. We employ a constrained knapsack problem solving approach to efficiently compute entity summaries. We perform both qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate that our approach yields promising results compared to two other stand-alone state-of-the-art entity summarization approaches...|$|R
40|$|Typical web {{sessions}} can be hijacked easily by {{a network}} eavesdropper in attacks {{that have come}} to be designated “sidejacking. ” The rise of ubiquitous wireless networks, often unprotected at the transport layer, has significantly aggravated this problem. While SSL can protect against eavesdropping, its usability disadvantages often make it unsuitable when the data is not considered highly confidential. Most web-based email services, for example, use SSL only on their login page and are thus vulnerable to sidejacking. We propose SessionLock, a simple approach to securing web sessions against eavesdropping without extending the use of SSL. SessionLock is easily implemented by web developers using only JavaScript and simple server-side logic. Its performance impact is negligible, and all major web browsers are supported. Interestingly, it is particularly easy to implement on single-page AJAX web applications, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Gmail</b> or Yahoo mail, with approximately 200 lines of JavaScript and 60 lines of server-side verification code...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{exploits}} of client-server protocols and applications involve modifying clients {{to behave in}} ways that untampered clients would not, such as crafting malicious packets. In this paper, we demonstrate practical verification of a cryptographic protocol client's messaging behavior as being consistent with the client program it {{is believed to be}} running. Moreover, we accomplish this without modifying the client in any way, and without knowing all of the client-side inputs driving its behavior. Our toolchain for verifying a client's messages explores multiple candidate execution paths in the client concurrently, an innovation that we show is both specifically useful for cryptographic protocol clients and more generally useful for client applications of other types, as well. In addition, our toolchain includes a novel approach to symbolically executing the client software in multiple passes that defers expensive functions until their inputs can be inferred and concretized. We demonstrate client verification on OpenSSL to show that, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Heartbleed exploits can be detected without Heartbleed-specific filtering and within seconds of the first malicious packet, and that verification of legitimate clients can keep pace with, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Gmail</b> workloads...|$|R
40|$|Asynchronous or {{event-driven}} programming {{has become}} the dominant programming model {{in the last few}} years. In this model, computations are posted as events to an event queue from where they get processed asynchronously by the application. A huge fraction of computing systems built today use asynchronous programming. All the Web 2. 0 JavaScript applications (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Gmail,</b> Facebook) use asynchronous programming. There are now more than two million mobile applications available between the Apple App Store and Google Play, which are all written using asynchronous programming. Distributed servers (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Twitter, LinkedIn, PayPal) built using actor-based languages (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Scala) and platforms such as node. js rely on asynchronous events for scalable communication. Internet-of-Things (IoT), embedded systems, sensor networks, desktop GUI applications, etc., all rely on the asynchronous programming model. Despite the ubiquity of asynchronous programs, their unique execution characteristics have been largely ignored by conventional processor architectures, which have remained heavily optimized for synchronous programs. Asynchronous programs are characterized by short events executing varied tasks. This results in a large instruction footprint with little cache locality, severely degrading cache performance. Also, event execution has few repeatable patterns causing poor branch prediction. This thesis proposes novel processor optimizations exploiting the unique execution characteristics of asynchronous programs for performance optimization and energy-efficiency. These optimizations are designed to make the underlying hardware aware of discrete events and thereafter, exploit the latent Event-Level Parallelism present in these applications. Through speculative pre-execution of future events, cache addresses and branch outcomes are recorded and later used for improving cache and branch predictor performance. A hardware instruction prefetcher specialized for asynchronous programs is also proposed as a comparative design direction...|$|R
40|$|The {{email system}} is the central battleground against {{phishing}} and social engineering attacks, and yet email providers still face key challenges to authenticate incoming emails. As a result, attackers can apply spoofing techniques to impersonate a trusted entity to conduct highly deceptive phishing attacks. In this work, we study email spoofing to answer three key questions: (1) How do email providers detect and handle forged emails? (2) Under what conditions can forged emails penetrate the defense to reach user inbox? (3) Once the forged email gets in, how email providers warn users? Is the warning truly effective? We answer these questions through end-to-end measurements on 35 popular email providers (used by billions of users), and extensive user studies (N = 913) that consist of both simulated and real-world phishing experiments. We have four key findings. First, most popular email providers have the necessary protocols to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to get into user inbox (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email gets in, most email providers have no warnings for users, particularly on mobile email apps. Some providers (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Gmail</b> Inbox) even have misleading UIs that make the forged email look authentic. Third, a few email providers (9 / 35) have implemented visual security cues for unverified emails, which demonstrate a positive impact to reduce risky user actions. Comparing simulated experiments with realistic phishing tests, we observe {{that the impact of}} security cue is less significant when users are caught off guard in the real-world setting...|$|R
40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{personal}} information stored at remote service providers increases, so does the danger of data theft. When connections to remote services {{are made in the}} clear and authenticated sessions are kept using HTTP cookies, data theft becomes extremely easy to achieve. In this paper, we study the architecture of the world's largest service provider, i. e., Google. First, {{with the exception of a}} few services that can only be accessed over HTTPS (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Gmail),</b> we find that many Google services are still vulnerable to simple session hijacking. Next, we present the Historiographer, a novel attack that reconstructs the web search history of Google users, i. e., Google's Web History, even though such a service is supposedly protected from session hijacking by a stricter access control policy. The Historiographer uses a reconstruction technique inferring search history from the personalized suggestions fed by the Google search engine. We validate our technique through experiments conducted over real network traffic and discuss possible countermeasures. Our attacks are general and not only specific to Google, and highlight privacy concerns of mixed architectures using both secure and insecure connections. Comment: Our report was sent to Google on February 23 rd, 2010. Google is investigating the problem and has decided to temporarily suspend search suggestions from Search History. Furthermore, Google Web History page is now offered over HTTPS only. Updated information about this project is available at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent web-based {{applications}} offer users free {{service in}} exchange for access to personal communication, such as on-line email services and instant messaging. The inspection and retention of user communication is generally intended to enable targeted marketing. However, unless specifically stated otherwise by the collecting service’s privacy policy, such records have an indefinite lifetime and may be later used or sold without restriction. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible}} to protect a user’s privacy from these risks by exploiting mutually oblivious, competing communication channels. We create virtual channels over online services (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Google’s <b>Gmail,</b> Microsoft’s Hotmail) through which messages and cryptographic keys are delivered. The message recipient uses a shared secret to identify the shares and ultimately recover the original plaintext. In so doing, we create a wired “spread-spectrum ” mechanism for protecting the privacy of web-based communication. We discuss the design and implementation of our open-source Java applet, Aquinas, and consider ways that the myriad of communication channels present on the Internet can be exploited to preserve privacy. ...|$|R
40|$|Current Web users {{usually have}} their own files, work documents, {{communications}} and personal contacts distributed in the storage systems of many widely-used Internet services (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Google Docs, <b>Gmail,</b> Face book, Zoho). Therefore, they {{face the challenge of}} being not able to have an integrated view for their related data objects (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> mails, pics, docs, contacts). Recently, most of the major Internet services provide standard APIs that allow developing software applications that can read and write data from their underlying data store after providing the credential access information of registered accounts. The World Wide Web is witnessing an increase in the amount of structured content – vast heterogeneous collections of structured data are on the rise due to the Deep Web, annotation schemes like Flickr, and sites like Google Base. While this phenomenon is creating an opportunity for structured data management, dealing with heterogeneity on the web-scale presents many new challenges. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in two scenarios – the Deep Web and Google Base. We contend that traditional data integration techniques are no longer valid {{in the face of such}} heterogeneity and scale. We propose new data integration architecture, as means for achieving web-scale data integration...|$|R
40|$|Password-based {{authentication}} is {{the dominant}} form of ac-cess control in web services. Unfortunately, it proves to {{be more and more}} inadequate every year. Even if users choose long and complex passwords, vulnerabilities in the way they are managed by a service may leak them to an attacker. Recent incidents in popular services such as LinkedIn and Twitter demonstrate the impact that such an event could have. The use of one-way hash functions to mitigate the problem is countered by the evolution of hardware which enables powerful password-cracking platforms. In this paper we propose SAuth, a protocol which em-ploys authentication synergy among different services. Users wishing to access their account on service S will also have to authenticate for their account on service V, which acts as a vouching party. Both services S and V are regular sites vis-ited by the user everyday (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Twitter, Facebook, <b>Gmail).</b> Should an attacker acquire the password for service S he will be unable to log in unless he also compromises the password for service V and possibly more vouching services. SAuth is an extension and not a replacement of existing authentica-tion methods. It operates one layer above without ties to a speci c method, thus enabling different services to employ heterogeneous systems. Finally we employ password decoys to protect users that share a password across services...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to integrate}} various learning approaches, i. e., multiple literacies, experiential learning, game-enhanced learning, and global simulation, into an extracurricular module, {{in which it}} remodels traditional ways of teaching input, specifically, the lexical- and grammatical-only approaches of business English at a private university in Bangkok, Thailand. Informed by those approaches, a game-enhanced simulation was specifically designed as an experiential space for L 2 learners to experience the dynamic and real business contexts of language use. A strategy-simulation video game, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum (RCT 3), was selected and used {{in the implementation of}} the pilot course. The game was embedded in a global simulation of two amusement park companies – where students worked in groups of five to form characters and socially interact with others. The global simulation involved learners in a sequence of genre-based (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> memoranda and business presentations) and technology-based tasks (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> using <b>Gmail,</b> Google Docs, and LinkedIn). Ten second-year students from five disciplines – Accounting, Logistics Engineering, Technology and Creative Business, Logistics Management, and Airline Business Management, participated in the study. Within this game-enhanced simulation, it turned out that each student simulated the role of a department head that was relevant to her or his discipline, for example, department heads of Financial Management, Technical Service Management, Customer Relationship Management, Legal and Operations Management, and Human Capital Management. The findings show that the learners' interactivity within the gameplay depicted the pedagogical affordances of RCT 3 for a business English simulation, that is, exploratory interactivity, goal-orientedness in gameplay, goal-orientedness for roleplaying, and emergent narratives. The data present how this videogame features an interplay between two game perspectives – ludology and narratology. That is, ludic affordances in RCT 3 could be activated in a narrative system: meaningful personal or emergent narrative by well-designed global simulation tasks. The simulations were established through students’ interpretation and creativity in gameplay and roleplay as related to their disciplines. Moreover, the game-enhanced simulation appeared to provide learners with an effective social context for promoting global English development and professional identity formation, which moved them beyond the learning practices of traditional coursebooks and classroom settings. Students of the study had opportunities to use professional Discourses related to their disciplines as ways to establish their desired identities within the simulated global workplace...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that goal priming effects are context dependent. We show that goal primes encourage prime-consistent behavior when the behavioral context is common and prime-inconsistent behavior when the behavioral context is un-common. While the prime-consistent behavior is compatible with existing theory, the prime-inconsistent behavior poses a theoretical challenge. We argue that un-common behavioral contexts encourage {{the release of a}} primed goal and, as a consequence, an increase in the relative activation of information inconsistent with the primed goal and prime-inconsistent behavior. The influence of priming in consumer behavior is ubiq-uitous. Primes have been shown to influence product evaluations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Brendl, Markman, and Messner 2003), consideration set formation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shapiro 1999), choices (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Chun and Kruglanski 2005; Sheeran et al. 2005), the extremity of behavior (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shang, Reed, and Croson 2008), and product experience (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Aaker and Stayman 1992).

In birds, egg size varies with laying date (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> HILL, 1984) (4), female age (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> DESROCHERS & MCGRATH, 1993) (5), year (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> PERRINS, 1969) (6), seasonal variations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> COULSON, 1963) (7), laying order (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> MURPHY, 1994) (8), female condition (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> HÕRAK et al., 1995) (9) and other factors.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of antihistamine activity in extracts prepared from tissues of rat, guinea pig and dog has been investigated. It was observed {{that in some}} tissues (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> ear skin), the antihistamine activity paralleled the known histamine content; in other tissues (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> stomach), this was not so. The influence of pretreatment with Compound 48 / 80, semicarbazide along with a pyridoxine-deficient diet; reserpine, adrenalectomy, cortisone, diphenylhydantoin and/or phenobarbital upon the tissue antihistamine levels was also studied in the rat, guinea pig and doge Decreases in tissue histamine-inhibitory activity were observed in rats after Compound 48 / 80 (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> abdominal skin), semicarbazide and a pyridoxine-free diet (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> brain), or reserpine (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> lung).

40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of {{understanding}} of young men's perspectives in obesity-related research. This study aims to: (1) identify young men's perceived motivators and barriers in adopting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, and (2) explore any differences in responses by weight status categories. Methods: Ten focus groups (32 - 63 minutes; 3 - 9 participants per group) were conducted with 61 young men (BMI: 25. 3 ± 5. 1 kg/m², aged: 18 - 25 years) from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. There were 35 (57. 4 %) healthy weight men and 26 (42. 6 %) overweight/ obese men. Three groups were with healthy weight participants, three with overweight/obese participants and four with mixed-BMI participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted by an independent researcher using NVIVO 10. Results: Motivators for healthy eating grouped into four themes: physical health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to live longer), sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to support their sporting goals), physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness) and social influences (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> societal expectations to eat healthy), while key motivators for physical activity were: physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness), social inclusion (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> making friends), physical and mental health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> relieve stress) and improvements for sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> improve fitness). Themes for key barriers to eating healthy were: intrinsic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> perceived effort to adopt healthy eating), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> peer influence), while busy lifestyles (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> lack of time), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), cognitive-emotional (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> feelings of inferiority) and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> family upbringing) were key barriers for physical activity. Responses varied little by BMI status. Conclusion: This research emphasises the importance of consulting young men when developing healthy lifestyle programs that aim to promote healthy eating and physical activity in young men. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways to address their motivators and barriers in intervention research...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{carbon in}} the {{atmosphere}} from biogenic as well as anthropogenic sources triggers the radical cycle {{in the atmosphere}} on global {{as well as on}} regional scales (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Monks, 2005). Oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) leads to changes in surface ozone {{as well as in the}} particle burden that will likely affect the people’s health and plant productivity (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Jenkin and Clemitshaw, dependent in general (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Guenther et al., 1995). The dominating biogenic compound emitted is isoprene (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Simpson et al., 1999). In contrast to anthropogenic VOC (AVOC), BVOC are more reactive in the atmosphere (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Atkinson, 2000) with a pronounced emis-sion maximum in summer (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Guenther et al., 1995; Smiatek and Steinbrecher, 2006).
