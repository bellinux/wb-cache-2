25|$|In overdoses, {{atropine}} is poisonous. Atropine {{is sometimes}} added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea opioid {{drugs such as}} diphenoxylate or <b>difenoxin,</b> wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the anti-diarrhea effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difenoxin,</b> an {{antidiarrheal}} drug, such as {{when combined}} with atropine (Motofen) (<b>difenoxin</b> is 2-3 times more potent than diphenoxylate, the active ingredient in Lomotil, which is in Schedule V) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Difenoxin</b> is a Schedule I drug {{by itself}} in the US; the {{combination}} with atropine is in the less-restrictive category Schedule IV {{on account of the}} adulterant (the practice of making opioids more easily available by including an abuse-deterring adulterating agent is standard practice in the United States). Pure <b>difenoxin,</b> in Schedule I, has a quota of 50 grammes, and an ACSCN of 9168. The combination of <b>difenoxin</b> and atropine, in Schedule IV, has the DEA ACSCN of 9167 and being in Schedule IV is not assigned an aggregate annual manufacturing quota.|$|E
50|$|Motofen is {{the brand}} name for an antiperistaltic anti-diarrheal medication, {{containing}} 1.0 mg <b>difenoxin</b> HCl and 0.025 mg atropine (U.S. Food and Drug Administration: Schedule IV Combination). It was invented by Kendra Clark. Atropine is purposely added at 25 micrograms per tablet, or 1/24 to 1/40 of the usual therapeutic dose for atropine to minimize the potential of misuse by swallowing large numbers of tablets or preparing them for injection since <b>difenoxin</b> is chemically related to the pethidine-piritramide subgroup of the opioid family, and could theoretically be misused. Although unlikely, physical and mental withdrawal symptoms (from both anticholinergic rebound caused by atropine, and opiate withdrawal caused by the <b>difenoxin)</b> are possible if taken {{for long periods of}} time. However, both of these compounds are responsible for the medicinal effects of the medicine (both atropine and <b>difenoxin</b> slow gut movement).|$|E
50|$|Diphenoxylate is metabolized in {{the body}} to yield <b>difenoxin.</b> <b>Difenoxin</b> is another {{centrally}} acting antidiarrheal that is 250 to 400 percent the strength of diphenoxylate via the oral route and is also able to be manufactured and is distributed as Motofen, (1 mg difenoxin/25 µg atropine), which {{was introduced in the}} United States in the late 1990s after being discovered in 1970 at Janssen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difenoxin</b> (Motofen, R-15403) is an opioid drug used, {{often in}} {{combination}} with atropine, to treat diarrhea. [...] It is the principal metabolite of diphenoxylate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recommended}} initial dosing is two tablets, and one tablet to {{be taken}} after each loose stool thereafter. The therapeutic dosage for Motofen should not exceed 8 tablets (8 milligrams of <b>Difenoxin).</b> There are currently no instructions indicating usage for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Hyperhidrosis, although as stated above, {{it has been used}} successfully in treating symptoms of both disorders (which can accompany each other). There was a [...] "Motofen half-strength" [...] tablet, containing only 0.5 milligram of <b>difenoxin,</b> but it has since been discontinued. Only standard 1.0 milligram strength tablets are available by prescription.|$|E
50|$|In overdoses, {{atropine}} is poisonous. Atropine {{is sometimes}} added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea opioid {{drugs such as}} diphenoxylate or <b>difenoxin,</b> wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the anti-diarrhea effects.|$|E
5000|$|Some centrally-acting antidiarrheals, such as {{diphenoxylate}} (Lomotil) when {{mixed with}} atropine (to make it unpleasant {{for people to}} grind up, cook, and inject). <b>Difenoxin</b> with atropine (Motofen) has been moved to Schedule IV. Without atropine, these drugs are in Schedule II.|$|E
50|$|The {{atropine}} additive {{strategy is}} designed to discourage use of the drug in a manner inconsistent with its labelling and physician and manufacturer instructions; in theory, the anticholinergic effect of atropine will produce severe weakness and nausea if standard dosage is exceeded, {{and at the time}} diphenoxylate was introduced in the United States a number of manufacturers used this strategy with oral forms of morphine, methadone (also using scopolamine), oxycodone and others. Currently, the only other narcotic produced in the United States to use this strategy is Motofen (<b>difenoxin</b> 1 mg with 25 µg atropine sulfate). <b>Difenoxin</b> is a DEA schedule C-I without atropine, but a schedule C-IV or C-V with varying doses of concurrent atropine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Difenoxin</b> {{has a high}} peripheral/central actions ratio, working {{primarily}} on various opioid receptors in the intestines. Although {{it is capable of}} producing significant central effects at high doses, doses within the normal therapeutic range generally do not notably impair cognition or proprioception, resulting in therapeutic activity roughly equatable to that of loperamide (Imodium). Increased dosages result in more prominent central opioid effects (and anticholingeric effects when the formulation also contains a tropane alkaloid). It therefor offers limited advantages over more potent anti-diarrheal opioid options (ex. morphine) when treating intractable cases of diarrhea which fail to respond to normal or moderately increased <b>difenoxin</b> doses, and may in fact be harmful in such circumstances if the formulation used also contains atropine or hyoscyamine.|$|E
50|$|Diarrhoea {{resulting}} from cyclic or diarrhoea-predominant IBS {{may not be}} optimally treated with diphenoxylate or <b>difenoxin,</b> and may not respond to a meaningful degree to loperamide; thus, diarrhoea and cramping which does not respond to belladonna derivatives and non-centrally-acting soothing and/or stool-desiccating agents are often treated with conservative doses of codeine, especially where paregoric and/or laudanum are not currently in general use.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>difenoxin</b> and {{atropine}} tablets are Schedule IV {{and therefore}} federally controlled and require a prescription, loperamide is unscheduled {{and not on}} prescription, and diphenoxylic acid is classified {{as a form of}} diphenoxylate. Other Schedule IV narcotics also include butorphanol nasal spray, pentazocine, propoxyphene-based mixtures and others of the same type. Unscheduled narcotics and opioid agonists include loperamide (OTC), and nalbuphine (Rx).|$|E
50|$|Diphenoxylate is the {{prototype}} of a small subfamily of opioids (the phenylpiperidines) including <b>difenoxin</b> (diphenoxylic acid), an active metabolite of diphenoxylate produced in the human body, and loperamide, which unlike the former two works exclusively in the intestines because it only crosses the blood-brain barrier in very small amounts. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956. It is a congener to the narcotic pethidine. Other somewhat more distant relatives include alphaprodine and piritramide.|$|E
50|$|According to {{e-mails and}} calls to Valeant's {{customer}} service department, there was apparent issue with {{a manufacturer of}} one of the chemicals used in the making of <b>difenoxin.</b> This chemical's name, nor the manufacturer, would not be released to the public at-large. It was said that the manufacturer was not in the United States. Valeant did set up a list of those calling in about the medication to inform interested parties and it is assumed that this reaction by those who do need this medication is what prompted the return of Motofen despite the numerous instances of pushing back of the return date by Valeant.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{loperamide}} and <b>difenoxin</b> preparations, {{the usual}} protocol {{is to take}} a loading dose (usually two tablets or the quantity of liquid containing 5 mg of diphenoxylate) and then the standard dose of one tablet every 3 to 4 hours prn over a time period not to exceed 48 hours unless so ordered by the physician. Long-term intermittent prn users should contact their physician if the need for it arises more than was usual at the outset of therapy as tolerance to diphenoxylate can occur. Those taking it in large quantities or continuously over an extended period should taper down the dose on a schedule devised by the physician and/or pharmacist.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Difenoxin</b> {{crosses the}} {{blood brain barrier}} and induces some euphoria; it is often sold with or {{administered}} with atropine to reduce the potential for abuse and overdose. [...] At high doses there are strong CNS effects and the atropine at such high doses causes typical anticholinergic side effects, such as anxiety, dysphoria, and delirium. Excessive use or overdose causes constipation and can promote development of megacolon as well as classic symptoms of overdose including potentially lethal respiratory depression. [...] In the 1990s its use in children was restricted in many countries due to the CNS side effects, which included anorexia, nausea and vomiting, headache, drowsiness, confusion, insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, euphoria and depression.|$|E
5000|$|The abuse-deterring {{effects of}} {{atropine}} when {{used as an}} adulterant are reasonably effective in reducing the combination's potential for recreational use. It combines the mechanisms of naloxone and paracetamol (the two more commonly used abuse-deterring agents) by increasing {{the likelihood of the}} overdose resulting in harmful and/or fatal sequelae (as does paracetamol), in addition to reliably producing unpleasant side-effects which [...] "spoil" [...] the opioid euphoria and discourage abusers from overdosing again following their initial experience (as does naloxone). This does not deter the use of single doses of <b>difenoxin</b> to potentiate another opiate, the anticholingeric activity of a single tablet is actually likely to increase the pleasurable effects of opioid use {{in a manner similar to}} combining one or more opioids with orphenadrine.|$|E
