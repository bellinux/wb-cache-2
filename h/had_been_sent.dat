5|$|The Alsos Mission now {{attempted}} {{to recover the}} shipment that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> to France. Documentation was discovered that said {{that part of it}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash's command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> to Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.|$|E
5|$|A later senatorial {{investigation}} into {{the disappearance of the}} public funds took no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony. Octavian made another bold move in 44BC when, without official permission, he appropriated the annual tribute that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> from Rome's Near Eastern province to Italy.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} consideration for Napoleon {{was that a}} French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, {{and most of the}} British veterans of the Peninsular War <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> to North America to fight in the War of 1812.|$|E

Xu Lai reportedly discovered the identity of a Japanese spy while playing mahjong with Zhou Fohai's wife, and personally delivered messages to Chinese agents in Shanghai in urgent situations.|$|E
5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> to Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king {{to come to the}} Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E

5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 it was {{believed}} that the signal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E
5|$|By 1809, the Napoleonic Wars {{were six}} years old and the British Royal Navy was {{dominant}} at sea. Blockaded in their home ports by British squadrons, French warships, merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and, as a result, the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France. These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and, as a result, their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed, resulting in economic collapse, severe food shortages and social unrest. Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> {{during the summer of}} 1808, particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. In response supplies <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn. The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island, and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London, who had ordered Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them.|$|E
