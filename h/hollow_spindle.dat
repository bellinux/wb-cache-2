Reinforced cowrap spinning yarns and thermoplastics offer {{a potential for}} low-cost manufacturing of complex-shaped and good, drapable composite parts, due to reduced impregnation times and resin flow distance during processing. In this article, the cowrap spinning yarns were produced by cowrap spinning method with flax and polypropylene (PP) and then woven to fabric preforms. The natural flax fibers were twistless in yarns and preforms, and PP served as a carrier for flax and prevented damage to flax fibers during processing, and became the polymer matrix in the final composites.

Previously, this had been investigated up to 100 m/s. Both the supplying air pressure and combinations of nozzles and pipes changed diffusion of the flow in a pipe. Air drag force increased extremely if the primary stream acted on the yarn directly when the jet from the nozzle was directed at very high speed (around sonic velocity). Yarn was often stuck inside the pipe by the airflow when very thin pipes were used. When this occurred, air drag force was reduced to half. The air drag coefficient Cf for monofilament yarn has been arranged using the radius Reynolds number, Rea, for suction flow with lower than 100 m/s. The formula, Cf = KRea-n, has been applied for suction flow under 500 in Rea.

Acting forces such as the air drag on a spandex yarn were measured and the behaviors of a running yarn were observed during the drawing-in operations.

Even with {{direct access to the}} threads, detection of fatigue cracks in the thread roots is very difficult using visual and penetrant methods. Therefore, the purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to demonstrate an improved nondestructive inspection method for the spindle threads applicable to routine teardown maintenance, and (2) to determine the feasibility of performing safety-of-flight inspections on the spindle with only minimal disassembly. Recent projects funded by the Air Force have shown that the electric current perturbation (ECP) method is capable of detecting very small surface fatigue cracks in gas turbine engine disks 1 and second layer defects in relatively thick structural wing sections. 2 Based on these results, the ECP method was evaluated for its capability to inspect the spindle thread roots not only by scanning the outside diameter (crest of the threads), but also by scanning the <b>hollow</b> <b>spindle</b> bore under the threads and inspecting through the wall thickness for flight-critical cracks. With an ECP probe located on the crest of the threads, high sensitivity to very small defects in the thread roots was achieved and thumbnail shaped EDM slots as small as 0. 53 mm long by 0. 23 mm deep by 0. 064 mm wide were detected. Inspection from the bore requires only that the rotary wing be removed so that a probe can be inserted into the spindle bore. Since this inspection is performed through the spindle wall, sensitivity is reduced and only larger defects are detectable.

This can be rotated about the horizontal axis by a balanced miniature DC motor via a belt-pulley system, reducing the spindle speed to about 3000 rpm (can also be either decreased or increased continuously). This spindle system may also be used as an attachment to any NC table of any type of EDM through its motor housing structure, to receive motions in the horizontal plane.

To ensure a compact mono block design with minimal components and low stray capacitance in the system, the entire housing and support structure is of single piece made of ABS plastic. The design and fabrication of a compact wire feeding mechanism for micro EDG ensures in situ processing of the micro tool on the spindle.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide data from ferrofluid flow and torque measurements in uniform and nonuniform rotating magnetic fields that can be compared to theoretical analyses in order to fully understand observed paradoxical ferrofluid behavior. In the presence of rotating magnetic fields, ferrofluid particles will rotate to try to align their magnetic moment with the field but because of the fluid viscosity, magnetization M will lag behind the rotating H field, thereby resulting in a body torque on the ferrofluid. The viscous torque from this fluid flow is measured using a Couette viscometer as a function of magnetic field amplitude, frequency, and direction of rotation. The first three sets of experiments measure this torque on the outer wall of a Lexan spindle that is attached to a viscometer, functioning as a torque meter. The spindle is immersed in a beaker of ferrofluid centered inside a 2 -pole or 4 -pole motor stator winding, creating uniform or nonuniform rotating magnetic fields, respectively. The spindle rotates at a constant speed up to 100 rpm or is stationary in these measurements. Anomalous behaviors such as zero and negative magnetoviscosity are demonstrated and discussed. The next set of experiments measure the magnetic torque on the inner wall of a <b>hollow</b> <b>spindle</b> attached to the torque meter and filled completely with ferrofluid so that there is no free surface. The spindle is centered inside the motor stator windings and exposed to clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) rotating magnetic fields. The last set of experiments measures the surface spin rate of a small floating plastic ball placed on the ferrofluid surface at a fixed location as a function of magnetic field parameters and radial position on the surface. When the rotating magnetic fields induce ferrofluid flows, the ball spins in the opposite direction to magnetic field rotation and this spin rate is determined using frame-by-frame video analysis. by Adam D.
