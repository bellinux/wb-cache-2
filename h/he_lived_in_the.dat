5|$|The Deshastha {{community}} has produced several saints and philosophers. Most {{important of these}} were Dnyaneshwar, Eknath and Ramdas.

5|$|The {{supposed}} {{author of the}} chronicle, William Gregory, was born in Mildenhall, Suffolk. He married three times, and had two daughters.

He became Sheriff and Mayor in this period. He left bequests to the Skinner's Company in his will.|$|E
5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. <b>He</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} Barcelona, Gaudí {{frequently}} changed his address: {{as a student}} he lived in residences, generally {{in the area of}} the Gothic Quarter; when he started his career he moved around several rented flats in the Eixample area. Finally, in 1906, he settled in a house in the Güell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since been transformed into the Gaudí Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaudí (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). <b>He</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house until 1925, several months before his death, when he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Purdue, he met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics. According to the couple, {{there was no}} real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement, except that it occurred while Armstrong was working at the NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles.

5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|Georgi Kinkladze {{was born}} on 6 July 1973 in Tbilisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. As a child, <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Didube {{district}} of the city with his father, Robinzon (an engineer), his mother Khatuna (a teacher) and his elder sister. Robinzon was keen to see his son succeed as a footballer, sometimes making him walk around the family home on his knees to strengthen his legs, and enrolled him for Dinamo Tbilisi's junior side when he was six years old. Khatuna disapproved of some of her husband's methods, instead taking Georgi to lessons in mtiuluri, a traditional Georgian ballet. Over the next few years, Kinkladze played in Dinamo Tbilisi's youth teams, progressing {{as far as the}} reserve team, where he played alongside Shota Arveladze, who would later become his teammate at both senior and international level.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Wodehouse {{moved to}} France for tax reasons; in 1940 {{he was taken}} {{prisoner}} at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, taking dual British-American citizenship in 1955. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974.
