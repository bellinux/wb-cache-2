Exploiting the European digital video broadcasting standard in regenerative configurations, the paper introduces an architecture that utilises the television stream as a common broadband infrastructure, capable to deliver not only custom <b>digital</b> television <b>bouquets,</b> but also and most predominant, {{to provide access to}} triple-play services. Utilising this television beam in backhaul (middle-mile) configurations it extends the core backbone to reach rural and dispersed locations, enabling therefore the immediate and cost-effective deployment (in these areas) of technologies that provide for always-on connectivity, such as WLAN, xDSL, etc...|$|R
