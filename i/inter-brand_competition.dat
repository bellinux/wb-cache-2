40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{vertical}} integration when a monopolistic producer can make a capital commitment before deciding on output. For the vertically separated industry structure, we find that opportunism resulting from competition between retailers leads to a longrun underinvestment in capital. With vertical integration, the capital investment is efficient but output is monopolistically restricted. We show that welfare may be higher with vertical integration. While the previous literature {{has pointed out that}} intra- and <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> are perfect substitutes, this does not hold in our model as perfect <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> leads to the first-best allocation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper first {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} issue of brand proliferation by a monopolist allowing transfer pricing as a channel to bridge headquarters and brand divisions, and then to view how the headquarters uses transfer pricing as a strategic device to encounter intra-brand competition, <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and cross-border profit-shifting under an oligopolistic market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper models cross-country interactions in a Cournot-Nash framework, and characterizes equilibrium that involves both transfer pricing and output decision. MNE’s behavior {{is based on a}} two-stage process in which the centralized headquarters ’ prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision-making. Findings – It is demonstrated that MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit cross-border. Higher transfer pricing enables brand divisions to collude easier in the intra-brand competition model, and the level of transfer price hinges upon the strength of intra-brand competition and <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition.</b> In addition, transfer pricing is affected by tax differences between two countries. Originality/value – This paper provides the theoretical underpinning to see how headquarters may use transfer pricing as a strategic device to face intra- and <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> that is visibly evident in many diverse industries...|$|E
40|$|Market {{integration}} is an objective of Article 101 TFEU. As a result, agreements aimed at partitioning national markets are in principle restrictive of competition by object. The case law {{on this point}} has been consistent since Consten-Grundig. Making sense of it, however, remains a challenge. The purpose of this piece is to show, first, how the methodological approach followed by the Court of Justice changes when market integration considerations are at stake. Secondly, it explains why and when restrictions on cross-border trade have been found not to restrict competition by object {{within the meaning of}} Article 101 (1) TFEU. 	An agreement aimed at partitioning national markets is not as such contrary to Article 101 (1) TFEU if the analysis of the counterfactual reveals that it does not restrict <b>inter-brand</b> and/or intra-brand <b>competition</b> that would have existed in its absence. It is possible to think of three scenarios in this regard: (i) an agreement may be objectively necessary to achieve the aims sought by the parties; (ii) a clause may be objectively necessary for an agreement and (iii) competition is precluded by the underlying regulatory context (as is the case, in particular, when the exercise of intellectual property rights is at stake) ...|$|R

In this paper I analyze how the structure of the upstream industry influences upstream manufacturers' decisions regarding the choice of production technologies that enable them to extend product variety. The results of a theoretical model with two pairs of supply chains in which producers procure inputs from either two or a single supplier reveal that the benefits of new technologies to manufacturers might be eroded.

40|$|Under the store-within-a-store arrangement, {{retailers}} essentially {{rent out}} their retail space to manufacturers {{and give them}} complete autonomy over retail decisions like pricing and in-store service.

In this paper, we use an analytical model to investigate the economic incentives that a retailer faces while deciding upon this arrangement. The retailer’s trade-off is between channel efficiency and <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition,</b> moderated by returns to in-store service and increased store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices and the service levels that the manufacturers will effect in an integrated channel, so it decides, instead, to allow them to set up stores-within-a-store. This suggests that stores-within-a-store is a phenomenon that emerges when a power retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space.

40|$|The central {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show how vertical restraints, which affect intra-brand competition, can and will be used as an effective mechanism for reducing <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and increasing producer profits. We show how exclusive territories alter the perceived demand curve, making each producer believe he faces a less elastic demand curve, thereby inducing an increase of the equilibrium price. The use of exclusive territories may increase producers' profits, even if the producers cannot charge franchise fees, and so cannot recapture, from the retailers, the monopoly rents they earn from their exclusive territory: we show that 'double marginalization' effects can be overcome by the strategic effect on producers' competition. We provide a model in which we can clearly specify the full range of feasible contracts between producers and retailers, and show that it is always a dominant strategy for firms to use exclusive territories (so that exclusive territories are used in equilibrium) and that the best situation from the producers' viewpoint may or may not entail franchise fees. In all cases, exclusive territories hurt consumer surplus and reduce total welfare, which yields a different light on vertical restraints from a competition policy perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing {{can be used}} as a {{strategic}} instrument to accomplish those objectives that enterprises pursue within the context of multi-divisional organization. This paper analyses the use of transfer pricing for decentralized multinational enterprises (MNEs) as {{a strategic}} instrument to tackle the issues of brand proliferation. The centralized headquarters ’ prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision- making. It shows that the higher transfer pricing has enabled easier collusion amongst the brand’s agencies in developing an intra-brand competition model. With regard to the level of transfer pricing, this hinges upon the strength of intra-brand competition and <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> which are expressed in opposite direction. It also demonstrates that the optimal transfer pricing is affected by any difference in tax rates between two countries. (In the case where tax rates are the same, there is no effect on transfer pricing strategy). With the rapid growth of multinational enterprises (MNEs), the pricing of internal transactions undertaken by MNE’s headquarters is a tax issue that tax authorities are concerned about but it is also a strategic concern of MNE in supporting its local subsidiaries in brand proliferation and output decision, as the MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit “cross-border”, so that they may minimize their tax burden.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{contribution}} that the co-existential nation and Community trademark systems {{are likely to}} make toward the stated {{aims and objectives of}} the internal market programme. The inauguration of the Community Trademark (CTM) creates an unprecedented facility for acquiring and enforcing unitary trademark rights. The territorial character of nationally based trademarks has inhibited the potential for economic integration. By removing barriers to inter-State trade, in principle the CTM system enables all undertakings to adapt their trading activities to the Community scale. This thesis argues that trademark decisions must be wary of granting broadening rights based on classifying trademarks as 'property'. The resultant deduction that trademarks proprietors should be endowed with wide powers may encourage monopoly rights in the marked goods. Protection must only reflect the inherent economic value of trademarks: the informative and identificatory function. The practical exploitation of other protected attributes, which merely reflect that the trademark has value may jeopardise <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and the fulfilment of internal market objectives. Developing national and community case law is tested against the economic arguments established to judge how trademark decisions are dealing with the enduring tension between trademarks and competition. To achieve a level-playing field, there must be convergence of substantive national and Community laws. This must try to avoid the problems of over- and under-protection by establishing balance between protection of and access to trademark rights. To do so, decision makers must resolve the fundamental challenges of 'What do we want to protect in a trademark?' and from this, 'What is the content and scope of an efficient system of trademark protection?'. Of particular importance is how the small- to medium-sized enterprises, the cornerstone of Europe's economic future, respond the the new system.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of power retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Home Depot and department store chains like JC Penney and Macy 2 ̆ 7 s, has significantly changed the competitive landscape in the retailing industry. This {{aim of this}} dissertation is to analyze how power retailers impact the contracts in and, indeed, the structures of, distribution channels. ^ The first essay studies the dominance strategies of power retailers. They frequently dominate other small retailers by explicitly undercutting on price (“market dominance”). Some also pursue the strategy of dominating the distribution channel by participating in setting the wholesale price (“channel dominance”). Wal-Mart seems to simultaneously exercise both market and channel dominance (“dual dominance”), while others, e. g., Sears and Costco, seem to exercise channel dominance alone. Upstream manufacturers complain of being squeezed by the power retailers but, at the same time, many have profitable partnerships with them, e. g., P 2 ̆ 6 G with Wal-Mart. In this essay, using a game-theoretic model, I investigate the dominance strategy (market, channel or dual dominance) that a self-interested power retailer should pursue, and how this decision affects {{other members of the}} channel. I find that dual dominance is not always the best strategy for a self-interested power retailer and, surprisingly, it can also prefer channel dominance alone, under certain conditions. I also find that it is quite likely that all channel members may simultaneously benefit from the exertion of dominance by power retailers. ^ The second essay is motivated by the “store-within-a-store” phenomenon, where retailers essentially rent out their retail space to manufacturers and give them complete autonomy over pricing and in-store service provision. This is an intriguing channel arrangement which is seen in several product categories in department store chains. In this essay, I use an analytical model to investigate the economic incentives that a retailer faces while deciding upon this arrangement. A store-within-a-store works like an integrated channel and, therefore, the retailer allows manufacturers to set up stores-within-a-store in categories where the degree of <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> is small. This suggests that the store-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a power retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} optical {{scanning}} devices and decreases {{in the cost}} of computing power have made it possible to assemble databases with sales and marketing mix information in an accurate and timely manner. These databases enable the estimation of demand functions and pricing/promotion decisions in “real” time. Commercial suppliers of marketing research like A. C. Nielsen and IRI are embedding estimated demand functions in promotion planning and pricing tools for brand managers and retailers. This explosion in the estimation and use of demand functions makes it timely and appropriate to re-examine several fundamental issues. In particular, demand functions are latent theoretical constructs whose exact. Estimates of price elasticities, profit maximizing prices, <b>inter-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and other policy implications are on the parametric form assumed in estimation. In practice, many forms may be found that are not only theoretically plausible but also consistent with the data. The different forms could suggest different profit maximizing prices leaving it unclear as to what is the appropriate pricing action. Specification tests may lack the power to resolve this uncertainty, particularly for non-nested comparisons. Also, the structure of these tests does not permit seamless integration of estimation, specification analysis and optimal pricing into a unified framework. As an alternative to the existing approaches, I propose a Bayesian mixture model (BMM) that draws on Bayesian estimation, inference, and decision theory, thereby providing a unified framework. The BMM approach consists of input, estimation, diagnostic and optimal pricing modules. In the input module, alternate parametric models of demand are specified along with priors. Utility structures representing the decision maker's attitude towards risk can be explicitly specified. In the estimation module, the inputs are combined with data to compute parameter estimates and posterior probabilities for the models. The diagnostic module involves testing the statistical assumptions underlying the models. In the optimal pricing module the estimates and posterior probabilities are combined with the utility structure to arrive at optimal pricing decisions. Formalizing demand uncertainty in this manner has many important payoffs. While the classical approaches emphasize choosing a demand specification, the BMM approach emphasizes constructing an objective function that represents a mixture of the specifications. Hence, pricing decisions can be arrived at when there is no consensus among the different parametric specifications. The pricing decisions will reflect parametric demand uncertainty, and hence be more robust than those based on a single demand model. The BMM approach was empirically evaluated using store level scanner data. The decision context was the determination of equilibrium wholesale prices in a noncooperative game between several leading national brands. Retail demand was parametrized as semilog and doublelog with diffuse priors for the models and the parameters. Wholesale demand functions were derived by incorporating the retailers' pricing behavior in the retail demand function. Utility functions reflecting risk averse and risk neutral decision makers were specified. The diagnostic module confirms that face validity measures, residual analysis, classical tests or holdout predictions were unable to resolve the uncertainty about the parametric form and by implication the uncertainty with regard to pricing decisions. In contrast, the posterior probabilities were more conclusive and favored the specification that predicted better in a holdout analysis. However, across the brands, they lacked a systematic pattern of updating towards any one specification. Also, none of the priors updated to zero or one, and there was considerable residual uncertainty about the parametric specification. Despite the residual uncertainty, the BMM approach was able to determine the equilibrium wholesale prices. As expected, specifications influence the BMM pricing solutions in accordance with their posterior probabilities which act as weights. In addition, differing attitudes towards risk lead to considerable divergence in the pricing actions of the risk averse and the risk neutral decision maker. Finally, results from a Monte Carlo experiment suggest that the BMM approach performs well in terms of recovering potential improvements in profits. pricing, Bayesian econometrics, decision theory, regression, nonnested models, demand structures, scanner data...|$|E
