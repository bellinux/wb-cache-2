5|$|The {{heavy rains}} caused {{two people to}} drown in Charlotte. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek, and a woman drowned while in her car. Also in North Carolina, {{tropical}} rains related to Danny caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek, spilling about 2,500 gallons (9,500L) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Island, and parts of Cape Cod, {{in addition to the}} coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts. The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> service to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July.|$|E

25|$|Against this revisionist tradition, {{an essay}} by Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, called Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War, argues {{that much of}} this {{information}} (as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it) concerning what was <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American art scene during the 1940s and 50s is flatly false, or at best (contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles) decontextualized.

25|$|The pair were {{partners}} in 'Hudson Amusements' {{and had been}} operating their amusements in Omeath {{for the duration of}} the Omeath Gala.

25|$|Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz {{whether the}} Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's motives were twofold. The first was that {{reprisals}} {{could be taken}} against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen {{in a short period}} of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
25|$|Missouri and Iowa State {{first met}} in 1896 and the {{regional}} rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, {{which took place in}} Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches box were wired so that either school could hear what was <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time. When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended.|$|E

25|$|As well as combating the Neptunists, he also {{opened up}} the concept of deep time for {{scientific}} purposes, in opposition to Catastrophism. Rather than accepting that the earth {{was no more than}} a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Before long, scientific inquiries provoked by his claims had pushed back the age of the earth into the millions of yearsstill too short when compared with the accepted 4.6 billion year age in the 21st century, but a distinct improvement.|$|E
500|$|Allied {{intelligence}} {{failed to}} detect the German intention. In Ultra transcripts, {{there are only a}} few indications of what was <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the front. On 4 December 1944, II Jagdkorps had ordered stockpiling for navigational aids, such as [...] "golden-rain" [...] flares and smoke bombs. Allied intelligence made no written observations of this communication. They also disregarded communications to Junkers Ju 88 groups regarding the use of flares when leading formations. Intelligence concluded that these instructions were designed for a ground support mission rather than an interception operation. This was reasonable, but no indications of possible ground targets were given.|$|E

The filmmakers originally intended to use the chroma key technique {{to make it appear}} as if activity was <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the glass; but the composited images were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a [...] "clinical look".

The White House interior sets used had already been built for The American President and had previously been used for Nixon. Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.|$|E

[...] She has commented that her decision {{to take on the}} role of Liz came from wanting to play characters that were different from her past appearances as Belinda Keffers in All My Children, and Gilly Grant Speakes in Guiding Light. In an interview with Soap Talk, Marshall said, [...] "I just love the fact that he saw me and realized that I could be such a witch." [...] An article on Metacritic noted that Marshall was removed due to changes in the show's budget.|$|E
