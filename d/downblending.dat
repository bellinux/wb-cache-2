In recent years, the US Department of Energy / National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) has returned almost 75 kilograms of HEU spent fuel to Russia and has <b>downblended</b> all remaining fresh HEU (33 kilograms) in-country.

40|$|The United States, Russian Federation, and the International Atomic Energy Agency {{have been}} working {{together}} on a program called the Russian Research Reactor Fuel Return (RRRFR) Program, {{which is part of}} the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. The purpose of this program is to return Soviet or Russian-supplied high-enriched uranium (HEU) fuel, currently stored at Russian-designed research reactors throughout the world, to Russia. In February 2003, the RRRFR Program began discussions with the Nuclear Research Institute (NRI) in Rež, Czech Republic, about returning their HEU spent nuclear fuel to the Russian Federation for reprocessing. In March 2005, the U. S. Department of Energy signed a contract with NRI to perform all activities needed for transporting their HEU spent nuclear fuel to Russia. After 2 years of intense planning, preparations, and coordination at NRI and with three other countries, numerous organizations and agencies, and a Russian facility, this shipment is scheduled for completion before the end of 2007. This paper will provide a summary of activities completed for making this international shipment. This paper contains an introduction and background of the RRRFR Program and the NRI shipment project. It summarizes activities completed in preparation for the shipment, including facility preparations at NRI in Rež and FSUE “Mayak” in Ozyorsk, Russia; a new transportation cask system; regulatory approvals; transportation planning and preparation in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation though completion of the Unified Project and Special Ecological Programs.

40|$|According to a many {{publications}} and discussions, fast reactors hold promises to improve safety, non-proliferation, economic aspects, {{and reduce the}} nuclear waste problems. Consequently, several reactor designs advocated by the Generation IV Forum are fast reactors. In reality, however, after decades {{of research and development}} and billions of dollars investment worldwide, there are only two fast breeders currently operational on a commercial basis: the Russian reactors BN- 600 and BN- 800. Energy generation alone is apparently not a sufficient selling point for fast breeder reactors. Therefore, other possible applications for fast nuclear reactors are advocated. Three relevant examples are investigated in this thesis. The first one is the disposition of excess weapon-grade plutonium. Unlike for high enriched uranium that can be <b>downblended</b> for use in light water reactors, there exists no scientifically accepted solution for the disposition of weapon-grade plutonium. One option is the use in fast reactors that are operated for energy production. In the course of burn-up, the plutonium is irradiated which intends to fulfill two objectives: the resulting isotopic composition of the plutonium is less suitable for nuclear weapons, {{while at the same time}} the build-up of fission products results in a radiation barrier. Appropriate reprocessing technology is in order to extract the plutonium from the spent fuel. The second application is the use as so-called nuclear batteries, a special type of small modular reactors (SMRs). Nuclear batteries offer very long core lifetimes and have a very small energy output of sometimes only 10 MWe. They can supposedly be placed (almost) everywhere and supply energy without the need for refueling or shuffling of fuel elements for long periods. Since their cores remain sealed for several decades, nuclear batteries are claimed to have a higher proliferation resistance. The small output and the reduced maintenance and operating requirements should make them attractive for remote areas or electrical grids that are not large enough to support a standard-sized nuclear power plant. The last application of fast reactors this thesis investigates promises a solution to the problem of the radioactive waste from nuclear energy production. The separation of the spent fuel in different material streams (partitioning) and the irradiation of minor actinides in a fast neutron spectrum (transmutation) is claimed to solve this problem. Implementation of partitioning and transmutation (P&T) would require centuries of dedicated efforts, since several irradiation cycles and repeated reprocessing of the spent fuel elements between the irradiation cycles would be necessary. For all three applications, computer models of exemplary reactor systems were set up to perform criticality, depletion, and dose rate calculations. Based on the results, a specific critique on the viability of these fast reactor applications was conducted. Possible risks associated with their deployment were investigated. A Super-Safe, Small and Simple reactor promises to meet the energy demand of remote, small energy grids. The discussion of the proliferation risks associated with the spread of this kind of reactors often addresses the sealed core. The fissile material produced in the core and the possibility of breaking a seal and extracting the fuel is neglected. To address these questions, the Toshiba 4 S reactor was modeled as an example of a fast small reactor with a core lifetime of 30 years and an energy output of 10 MW. The fast SMR core is said to have a high level of proliferation resistance. Depletion calculations, however, show a production rate of more than 5 kg plutonium per year. Furthermore, the plutonium- 239 fraction in the fuel is higher than 90...|$|R

The terms also required that the HEU be converted by dilution (<b>downblending)</b> to LEU in Russian nuclear facilities.

40|$|Note: Some {{figures in}} this paper may be in color only in the {{electronic}} versionMany studies have proven that thorium-based fuel cycles are more expensive than current uranium fuel cycles, which is confirmed {{in this paper}} as well. This research, however, goes beyond the conventional nuclear plant refueling cycle, aiming to optimize the refueling cycle in line with specific advantages realized from the thoriumbased refueling cycle. These benefits are the good thermal neutronic characteristics of fertile 232 Th and fissile 233 U, resulting in longer refueling cycles, higher capacity factors, and reduced volumes of spent fuel. This paper focuses on once-through, homogeneously mixed, thorium-uranium fuel cycles and explores the economic advantages to introducing thorium as a fertile component in pressurized water reactor fuels as compared to once-through conventional uranium-only cycles. The economic evaluation compares the operational savings incurred {{as a result of}} longer fuel cycles and reduced reactor downtime with increased fuel expenses, due to higher initial enrichment of uranium and <b>downblending</b> with thorium. Uranium fuel is compared with thorium-uranium fuel in terms of the fuel cycle costs, reactor downtime cost due to refueling, and income due to electricity sales. Thorium-uranium fuel costs more than uranium, but the income from electricity sales and reactor downtime refueling cost is advantageous. These factors have also been taken into account and prove that the advantage of increased income outweighs the higher fuel costs. Issues related to longer fuel cycles and higher burnups need to be addressed, but the development and adoption of oncethrough, homogeneous, thorium-uranium fuel can be justified by a clear economic benefit for utilities operating nuclear power plants[URL]...|$|E
