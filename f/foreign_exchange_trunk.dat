First, these central banks do not always fully sterilize their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interventions. In addition, they issue regulations and conduct their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> operations in a way that increases the central bank''s information advantage and the size of their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> intervention relative to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market turnover.
