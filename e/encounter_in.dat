5|$|Gorbachev began {{a period}} of {{internal}} economic restructuring, known as perestroika, and agreed {{to a series of}} summits with the American president.

40|$|Socioecological theory {{suggests}} that between-group competition {{is an important factor}} affecting the nature of primate social relationships. Between-group <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> macaques may involve female resource defense, male mate defense, and male resource defense. We observed between-group <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> two groups (a forest group and a temple group) of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata). We observed 102 <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> 875 h of observation of the forest group (1. 40 per 12 -h day) and 58 <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> 907 h of observation of the temple group (0. 77 per 12 -h day). Aggressive interactions between groups occurred in 32. 4 % and 29. 3 % of <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> the forest and temple groups, respectively. Overall, we found little support for the female resource defense hypothesis. Females in both groups rarely participated aggressively <b>in</b> between-group <b>encounters.</b> We found support for the male mate defense hypothesis. For example, males of the forest group were more aggressive during <b>encounters</b> <b>in</b> the mating season than in the non-mating season. Males were also aggressive to females from their own group immediately following encounters. We also found partial support for the male resource defense hypothesis. <b>Encounters</b> <b>in</b> the forest group occurred in a feeding context more often than expected based on time budgets. Also, males in the temple group were more often aggressive <b>in</b> food-related <b>encounters</b> than <b>in</b> other <b>encounters.</b> The findings {{of this study suggest that}} socioecological models of primate social relationships need to distinguish male and female strategies during between-group encounters and integrate the resulting functional outcomes...|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the Fusō-class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing {{international}} naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an <b>encounter</b> <b>in</b> Japanese territorial waters.

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} to her feud with Jacqueline, Kim made two minor pay-per-view appearances in a short feud against Robert Roode, before outlasting nine other competitors in a ten-woman gauntlet match to become the inaugural TNA Women's Knockout Champion on October 14, 2007 at Bound for Glory. She made her first title defense on November 11 at Genesis, where she retained the renamed TNA Women's Knockout Championship by defeating Roxxi Laveaux, ODB, and Angel Williams.

Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him.
