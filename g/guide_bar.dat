2500|$|A {{few lines}} of the Paris Métro in France operate on a four-rail power scheme. The trains move on rubber tyres which roll {{on a pair of}} narrow roll ways made of steel and, in some places, of concrete. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two guide bars {{provided}} outside the running 'roll ways' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 V DC, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. Each wheel set of a powered truck carries one traction motor. A side sliding (side running) contact shoe picks up the current from the vertical face of each <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> The return of each traction motor, as well as each wagon, is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the running rails. This and all other rubber-tyred metros that have a [...] track between the roll ways operate in the same manner.|$|E
50|$|The term 'bow saw' {{has also}} been applied to a type of {{chainsaw}} with a large, circular <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

The Busan Subway Line 4, that lacks a rail track, has I-beams installed with the flanges being vertical. The Sapporo Municipal Subway, that lacks a rail track as well, has none.|$|R

50|$|A common {{accident}} {{arises from}} kickback, when a chain tooth {{at the tip}} of the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> catches on wood without cutting through it. This throws the bar (with its moving chain) in an upward arc toward the operator which can cause serious injury or even death.|$|E
50|$|The Mark II version {{dispensed}} {{with the use}} of relative speeds and set the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> on a sliding speed scale, thus allowing the speed of the guide and the speed of the own ship to be set independently. The device was constructed largely of brass.|$|E

5000|$|The warp passes {{down the}} lace in {{straight}} lines, the warp beam {{is at the}} bottom and the thread passes through a sley, and then the front <b>guide</b> <b>bar,</b> the warp bar. The warp bar is controlled by a cam. All warps remain in parallel; they cannot pattern, they form the skeletal support for the fabric.|$|E
5000|$|The bottom board, (Swiss {{board or}} {{occasionally}} beam) {{was not present}} in the early machines, acts as weft in both {{the ground and the}} pattern. This contains the finer threads. If the pattern is complex spools must be used but a beam can be used where the pattern is fairly even. The threads go through a tensioning spring and through holes in the middle <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> (Swiss bar, fine spool bar).|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} in the form of an {{electric}} multiple unit, with power supplied by both of the guide bars, which thus also serves as the third rail (the current is not picked up through the horizontal wheels, but through a separate lateral pickup shoe). The return current passes through a return shoe to the top of one, or both of the rails, or to the other <b>guide</b> <b>bar,</b> depending on the type of system.|$|E

50|$|The Mark V {{instrument}} {{dispensed with}} the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> and own ship's bar, retaining {{only the two}} position bars. However, the circular base plate was added to by the provision of two celluloid transparent discs which were placed {{on top of the}} base and free to rotate. The instrument body was made of an aluminium alloy and had a scale graded in degrees around the outside. The base plate had no scale, but a series of interrupted parallel lines running across it. This device was in production around 1955.|$|E
50|$|A {{chainsaw}} is a portable, {{mechanical saw}} which cuts {{with a set}} of teeth attached to a rotating chain that runs along a <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> It is used in activities such as tree felling, limbing, bucking, pruning, cutting firebreaks in wildland fire suppression and harvesting of firewood. Chainsaws with specially designed bar and chain combinations have been developed as tools for use in chainsaw art and chainsaw mills. Specialized chainsaws are used for cutting concrete. Chainsaws are sometimes used for cutting ice, for example for ice sculpture and in Finland for winter swimming. Someone who uses a saw is a sawyer.|$|E

5000|$|To use the instrument, {{the course}} of the {{flagship}} was first set on the <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> When the initial and final stations had been set using the position bars, the speed ratio clamp was set to show the ratio of own ship speed to the speed of the flagship (if the flagship was doing 10 knots, and the manoeuvring ship had 15 knots available, the clamp would be set to [...] "1.5"). Ensuring that the pin beneath the speed ratio clamp was set within the diameter grove, the course required to take station could then be read off the circular disc.|$|E
50|$|Travelling {{microscope}} {{consists of}} a cast iron base with machined-Vee-top surface and is fitted with three levelling screws. A matallic carriage, clamped to a spring-loaded bar slides with its attached vernier and reading lens along an inlaid strip of metal scale. The scale is divided in half millimeters. Fine adjustments are made {{by means of a}} micrometer screw for taking accurate reading. Both vernier reading to 0.01mm or 0.02mm. Microscope tube consists of 10x Eyepice and 15mm or 50mm or 75mm objectives. The Microscope, with its rack and pinion attachment is mounted on a vertical slide, which too, runs with an attached vernier along the vertical scale. The microscope is free to rotate n vertical plane. The vertical <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> is coupled to the horizontal carriage of the microscope. for holding objects a horizontal stage made of a milki conolite sheet is provided in the base.|$|E

50|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{launched}} the “Sans Secousse”, with Houdaille-type paddle-based shock absorbers and separate springs for the 4 wheels. At the front, the suspension was handled by leaf springs with 2 vertical <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> supporting the hydraulic shock absorbers; in the rear, it was handled by oscillating semi-trees with double universal joints and 2 overlapping leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, stud contact systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
40|$|Husqvarna {{is a world}} leading {{producer}} of chainsaws with a well-established brand name. Husqvarna now {{has an interest in}} investigating the possibiltiy to expand their production of chains and <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> to include cutting equipment for timber-harvesters. This project is a technical study which aims to answer questions about cutting equipment for timber-harvesters that have been decided in cooperation with Husqvarna. The questions have mainly been focused on forces, cutting speeds, service and maintenance -as well as general questions regarding the size of the Swedish market. Two methods have been applied to answer the questions. Interviews with retailers of harvesters, producers of harvester heads and harvester drivers. The main findings in this project show that there is a relatively small selection of harvester chains on the Swedish market. In contrast to the selection of harvester chains the selection of <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> is quite large. Ranging from solid bars to bars with a replaceable sprocket nose with a special alloy to bars with special easy to fit attachments. In total: timber-harvesters on the Swedish market demand for a number of harvester chains that is between 600 000 – 1 000 000 and between 85 700 – 167 700 for <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b> There are big differences between chains and harvester chains when it comes to cutting speeds, chain forces and depth gauge settings. In general significantly higher standard of requirement is set on the harvester chain. When it comes to kick-backs and vibrations however, standards are higher for handheld chained machine...|$|R
