While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost.

25|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} can arise when the professional responsibilities {{of a teacher}} are affected, or appear to be affected, by a special personal relationship with a student. These can include showing favoritism towards a student sexually involved with the teacher, or hostility towards a student due to a past relationship. If a teacher is sexually involved with a student, colleagues may feel pressured to give preferential treatment to the student, such as better marks, extensions on essays, <b>extra</b> <b>help,</b> or academic opportunities. When there are multiple relationships between several staff and students, the possibilities for conflict {{of interest}} are enormous. Even {{if there is no}} favoritism or hostility, it can be perceived by others to be exhibited.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} with A-T have difficulty in school {{because of a}} delay in response time to visual, verbal or other cues, slurred and quiet speech (dysarthria), abnormalities of eye control (oculomotor apraxia), and impaired fine motor control. Despite these problems, {{children with}} A-T often enjoy school if proper accommodations to their disability can be made. The decision {{about the need for}} special education classes or <b>extra</b> <b>help</b> in regular classes is highly influenced by the local resources available. Decisions about proper educational placement should be revisited as often as circumstances warrant. Despite their many neurologic impairments, most individuals with A-T are very socially aware and socially skilled, and thus benefit from sustained peer relationships developed at school. Some individuals are able to function quite well despite their disabilities and a few have graduated from community colleges.|$|E

25|$|Polygyny {{in birds}} occurs {{infrequently}} {{when compared to}} mammals, as monogamy is most commonly observed. Evolutionarily speaking, polygyny in birds might have evolved because many females do not require male support {{to care for their}} offspring. Because females do not need <b>extra</b> <b>help</b> raising their nests, males can afford to invest in multiple females. Nonetheless, male parental care is often found in many polygynous territorial bird species, leading to female competition for male assistance. Most often, males will seek a second female to impregnate, once the first female has laid her eggs. Strongly polygynous or monogamous species display increased female-female aggression. Many factors affect female aggression including predator density, habitat quality, nest spacing, and territory size. Oftentimes females will fight for resources from the male, such as food and nest protection. The female disadvantages of mating with an already-mated male bird can be overcome with ample resources provided by the male, resulting in female choice.|$|E

As Harris/Grimm's unsuccessful efforts had taken more than forty days, Ballard decided that <b>extra</b> <b>help</b> would be needed. He approached the French national oceanographic agency, IFREMER, with which Woods Hole had previously collaborated. The agency had recently developed a high-resolution side-scan sonar called SAR and agreed to send a research vessel, Le Suroît, to survey the sea bed in the area where Titanic was believed to lie. The idea was for the French to use the sonar to find likely targets, and then for the Americans to use Argo to check out the targets and hopefully confirm whether they were in fact the wreck. The French team spent five weeks, from 5 July to 12 August 1985, [...] "mowing the lawn"– sailing back and forth across the [...] target area to scan the sea bed in a series of stripes. However, they found nothing, though it turned out that they had passed within a few hundred yards of Titanic in their first run.|$|E

2500|$|Undeterred, {{the group}} went to Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. {{headquarters}} regularly, offering to provide <b>extra</b> <b>help</b> for Motown's recordings, often including hand claps and background vocals. That year, the group recorded two tracks for Lu Pine Records, with Ross singing lead {{on one of}} the tracks. During the group's early years, Ross served as hair stylist, make-up artist, seamstress, and costume designer. In late 1960, having replaced McGlown with Barbara Martin, The Primettes were allowed to record their own songs at Hitsville's studio, many written by [...] "Smokey" [...] Robinson, who, by then, was vice president of Motown ("Your Heart Belongs To Me" [...] and [...] "A Breathtaking Guy"). Gordy, too, composed songs for the trio, including [...] "Buttered Popcorn"(featuring Ballard on lead) and [...] "Let Me Go The Right Way". While these songs were regional hits, they were not nationwide successes. In January 1961, Gordy agreed to sign the group on the condition they change their name. Eventually, Janie Bradford approached Florence Ballard, the only group member at the studio at the time, to pick out a new name for the group. [...] Ballard chose [...] "Supremes", reportedly, {{because it was the only}} name on the list that didn't end with [...] "ette". Upon hearing the new name, the other members weren't impressed, with Ross telling Ballard she feared the group would be mistaken for a male vocal group (A male vocal was, indeed, named The Supremes.). Gordy signed the group under their name on January 15, 1962. A year later, Barbara Martin left the group, reducing the quartet to a trio. In late 1963, the group had their first hit with [...] "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes", peaking at #23 on Billboard's Hot 100 Pop chart. At the end of the year, Gordy assigned Ross as the group's lead singer, even though Ballard was usually the lead vocalist.|$|E
