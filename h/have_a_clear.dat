5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{dependence on the}} number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E

Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student.

Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> sense that objects exist even when out of sight.

This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E

5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, caused by mutations of the COL3A gene, leads to defective production of the collagen, type III, alpha 1 protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of arteries and internal organs. Marfan's syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including aneurysm of the aortic root.|$|E

5|$|The Deal is a 2003 British {{television}} film directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Peter Morgan, {{based in part}} upon The Rivals by James Naughtie. The film stars David Morrissey as Gordon Brown and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, and depicts the Blair-Brown deal—a well-documented pact that Blair and Brown made whereby Brown would not stand in the 1994 Labour leadership election, so that Blair could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> run at becoming leader {{of the party and}} Prime Minister. The film begins on 9 June 1983, as Blair and Brown are first elected to Parliament, and concludes in May 1994 at the Granita restaurant—the location of the supposed agreement—with a brief epilogue following the leadership contest.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet unit concept was no longer seen as being relevant, and Australia did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> role. As a result, post-war budget cuts {{prompted}} the RAN to take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share of resources and manpower consumed by Australia could be better used elsewhere in the RAN. In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN's 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship's company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In {{the event of a}} major conflict, Australia was to serve in a role akin to coastal artillery. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the RAN to provide a trained complement at short notice.|$|E
5|$|Further to the south, near Rakowiec, lay a {{group of}} forts of the outer line. All had already been {{abandoned}} by the Poles in early September, and were captured by Russian infantry under General Muraviev without a fight. Forces under General von Strandmann captured Szopy and started attacking Forts 44, 45 and the fortifications around Królikarnia. Although von Strandmann's unit did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> numerical superiority (2,900 Russians with six guns against 1,700 Poles with six guns), they quickly pushed back the Polish defenders. Soon dense black powder smoke covered the battlefield. Unable to determine the direction of Russian attacks, the Polish commanders believed that {{the aim of the}} main thrust would be delivered against the positions at Królikarnia.|$|E
