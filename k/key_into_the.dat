5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard {{was part of}} the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.|$|E
5|$|During their play-date, Bart {{notices that}} Ralph's father has a police master key capable of opening any door in Springfield. Bart and Ralph thus steal {{the key and}} decide to enter several closed stores at night. After encountering Nelson and his gang, the boys go to a {{condemned}} penitentiary. When Ralph objects because he is afraid, the bullies leave, but not before tossing the <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> penitentiary. Ralph and Bart enter the prison to retrieve the key, {{and in the process}} stumble onto a room housing an old electric chair. After testing out the chair, the two flee when an elderly guard approaches.|$|E

500|$|In open {{addressing}} solutions to this problem, the data structure is an array [...] (the hash table) whose cells [...] (when nonempty) each store a single keyâ€“value pair. A hash function {{is used to}} map each <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cell of [...] where that key should be stored, typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near {{each other in the}} table. A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a key into a cell that is already occupied by a different key. Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> closest following empty cell.|$|E
500|$|Squash was domesticated first, {{followed}} by maize and then beans, {{becoming part of}} the Three Sisters agricultural system of companion planting. The English word [...] "squash" [...] derives from askutasquash (a green thing eaten raw), a word from the Narragansett language, which was documented by Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, in his 1643 publication A <b>Key</b> <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> Language of America. Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family.|$|E
500|$|Marcotte {{embedded}} {{the secret}} HD DVD <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{colors of the}} flag itself, using the flag hex code format colors #09F911 #029D74 #E35BD8 #4156C5 #635688. [...] By appending the byte [...] "C0" [...] to the bottom {{right corner of the}} flag, Marcotte implied that the act of publishing a number is [...] "Crime Zero". [...] He originally released the flag [...] "freely" [...] with [...] "rights for people to make similar, derivative works," [...] but later released it into the public domain.|$|E

50|$|The truck's chevron-style {{tires are}} similar to those {{included}} with the Clod Buster, yet are minutely changed in molding; the wheels are carryovers from the Juggernaut, except for enlarged circular pegs for <b>keying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> widened hubs for improved durability.|$|R
500|$|USB Key Mode: The user must {{insert a}} USB device that {{contains}} a startup <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> computer {{to be able to}} boot [...] the protected OS. Note that this mode requires that the BIOS on the [...] protected machine supports the reading of USB devices in the pre-OS [...] environment. [...] The key may also be provided by a CCID for reading a cryptographic smartcard. [...] Using CCID provides additional benefits beyond just storing the key file on an external USB thumb drive, because the CCID protocol hides the private key using a cryptographic processor embedded in the smartcard; this prevents the key from being stolen by simply being read off the media on which it is stored.|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, Providence founder Roger Williams {{learned the}} tribe's language. He {{documented}} {{it in his}} 1643 work A <b>Key</b> <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> Language of America. [...] Williams gave the tribe's name as Nanhigganeuck.|$|E
2500|$|... "Love locks" [...] is a {{practice}} {{by which a}} couple inscribes a date and their initials onto a lock, attach it to the bridge, and throw the <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water {{as a sign of}} their [...] "everlasting love". Although the origin of the practice is unknown, it is more popular in Europe, where more than 20 countries have at least one city with a similar location. It has reportedly caused damage to certain bridges and is officially illegal in New York City. Workers periodically remove the love locks from the bridge.|$|E

2500|$|As in many coastal states, seafood {{is readily}} available. Shellfish is {{extremely}} popular, with clams {{being used in}} multiple ways. The quahog is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. (The word quahog comes from the Narragansett Indian word [...] "poquauhock"; see A <b>Key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Language of America by Roger Williams 1643.) It is also ground and mixed with stuffing (and sometimes spicy minced sausage) and then baked in its shell to form a stuffie. Steamed clams are also a very popular dish. Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried and is served as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically Sicilian-style (i.e., tossed with sliced banana peppers and with marinara sauce on the side).|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} escape his father, Clark decides {{to use a}} kryptonite key to destroy his spaceship. When Clark puts the kryptonite <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spaceship, Beck and his FX team tried to create a [...] "virus/fungus" [...] growth from the key slot to {{simulate}} [...] "some sort of fractal decay". Mike McCormick worked specifically {{on the process of}} destroying the ship, giving the ship the appearance that it has a [...] "nasty skin infection" [...] that is spreading as if it is caught in the circulatory system. Next, Beck had to tackle the problem of the ship's final destruction. Originally, it was intended to have the ship explode, but no one wanted to have to rebuild the Kent farm. Instead, they settled on a giant EMP wave given off by the ship the moment it is destroyed. Entity FX created a beam of light that shot vertically up from the ship's location and then fell back down expanding into a [...] "ripple that spread across the land". This beam of light would create a crater where the storm cellar was, which was dug prior to filming and digitally covered up so as to keep the illusion. One of the final shots of the episode was of Lex watching as his plane crashed into the ocean. In a homage to Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, Entity FX crafted a digital effect of the ocean water flooding Lex's plane as it hits the ocean. The scene is reminiscent of the same scene in Cast Away where Tom Hanks's character also watches as the ocean water floods his plane as he crash lands in the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Xan Brooks of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film one star, {{describing}} it as [...] "a primped and simpering folly, the turkey that dreamed it was a peacock. Brooks predicted that the film [...] "may even surpass 2008's Filth and Wisdom, Madonna's calamitous first outing as a film-maker. Her direction is so all over the shop that it barely qualifies as direction at all." [...] Pointing out a scene, he added that [...] "Madonna has Wallis bound on stage to dance with a Masai tribesman while Pretty Vacant blares on the soundtrack. But why? What point is she making? That social-climbing Wallis-Simpson was the world's first punk-rocker?" [...] Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film resembled a documentary of a woman out on a shopping expedition. McCarthy felt that the storyline was especially dreary during the portrayal of the love affair between Wally and Evgeni. [...] "For the audience, Wally, despite Cornish's gentle and warm presence, offers very little in terms of personal interest or as a <b>key</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world {{of one of the}} last century's most discussed couples." [...] However, McCarthy praised cinematographer Hagen Bogdaski's work. Oliver Lyttelton of indieWire also slammed the film stating that [...] "the use of music is horrible" [...] and [...] "Weâ€™ve never looked forward to Madonna going back on tour more, if only because it means that weâ€™ll know, for certain, that she wonâ€™t be using that time to direct another movie." [...] Emma Pritchard from Grazia added that [...] "Wallis Simpson was the kind of woman who was accused of being more style than substanceâ€“ and that, alas, is what Madonna has recreated on screen with W.E." [...] Mark Adams of Screen Daily singled out Riseborough's performance as a [...] "highlight", but overall felt that the film was disappointing. Leslie Felperin from Variety was disappointed in the film, saying that it is [...] "burdened with risible dialogue and weak performances". Felperin felt that the reason for the film's downfall was its script, which attended to the costumes and fashion more than the actual story, which she felt had much potential, but was unused.|$|E
