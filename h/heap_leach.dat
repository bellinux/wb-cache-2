5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a <b>heap</b> <b>leach.</b> This {{is done by}} percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heap</b> <b>leach</b> is {{significantly}} cheaper than traditional milling processes. The low costs allow for lower grade ore to be economically feasible (given {{that it is}} the right type of ore body). Environmental law requires that the surrounding ground water is continually monitored for possible contamination. The mine will also have to have continued monitoring even after the shutdown of the mine. In the past mining companies would sometimes go bankrupt, leaving the responsibility of mine reclamation to the public. Recent additions to the mining law require that companies set aside the money for reclamation before the beginning of the project. The money will be held by the public to insure adherence to environmental standards if the company were to ever go bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Geomembranes {{represent}} the other {{largest group of}} geosynthetics, and in dollar volume their sales are {{greater than that of}} geotextiles. Their growth in the United States and Germany was stimulated by governmental regulations originally enacted in the early 1980s for the lining of solid-waste landfills. The materials themselves are relatively thin, impervious sheets of polymeric material used primarily for linings and covers of liquids- or solid-storage facilities. This includes all types of landfills, surface impoundments, canals, and other containment facilities. Thus the primary function is always containment as a liquid or vapor barrier or both. The range of applications, however, is great, and in addition to the environmental area, applications are rapidly growing in geotechnical, transportation, hydraulic, and private development engineering (such as aquaculture, agriculture, <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> mining, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Plugging of pore spaces is {{the most}} {{significant}} contributor to ponding, decrease in the mineral resource recoveries and stability problems in <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> operations as ore permeability is reduced. Consequently, the identification of different plugging mechanisms is very important for optimisation of <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> processes. This paper reviews various pore spaces plugging mechanisms, including ore heap compaction, migration of fine particles, presence of large fractions of clays in ores, agglomerate destruction under acid effect and dissolution-precipitation processes. Proactive plugging reduction techniques including ore placement, ore agglomeration, heap aeration and lixiviant application techniques are also explained as means to prevent pore spaces plugging during <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> operations. The findings of this paper can be useful in guiding laboratory and industrial <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> operations...|$|R

In this report, we study chemical and physical processes in <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of <b>leach</b> <b>heaps.</b> These processes are complicated, not well supported by data, and generally not well understood. <b>Heap</b> <b>leaching</b> is investigated using a variety of complementary approaches: data analysis, microstructure models of the ore, overall chemical processes, and analysis of fluid motions by continuum and probabilistic methods. A significant finding of our work is that voids in the heap are not full of solution, and further the distribution of leach liquor within the ore is not uniform which decreases the efficiency of the leaching process. We suggest mechanisms by which the uniformity of the leach liquor distribution can be increased, thus increasing the efficiency of the process...|$|R

Optimisation of <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> parameters {{was carried out by}} performing both stirred-tank and in-tray batch leaching tests. Based on the optimum conditions established, a semi-continuous <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> pilot plant was designed and run.
