40|$|In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{lightweight}} passive deployment mechanism based on the tape spring and the shape memory alloy is presented for the secondary mirror of a deployable space telescope. In this passive deployment mechanism for the secondary mirror, the high elastic potential energy of the <b>folded</b> <b>tape</b> springs is used as driving force when the support structure is extended, and the high stiffness characteristics of the circular arc cross section of the tape spring can be used to achieve structure self-locking after deployment. Then a deployable space telescope combined with lightweight passive deployable mechanism for the secondary mirror is designed for applying to nanosatellite imaging. Furthermore, a lock-release device is designed to achieve the function of locking the folded structure and releasing on orbit by taking advantage of the phase transformation characteristics of shape memory alloy with temperature changing. Finally, the correction method for the deployment error of secondary mirror is discussed. The temperature of the tape springs is controlled respectively to make a required length change. This can achieve the purpose of adjusting the position of the secondary mirror and improve the deployment accuracy. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preoperative marking is {{of primary}} {{importance}} in body contouring and when precise simulation of skin excisions is difficult. Because the "cut as you go" principle can be delicate, especially in patients after massive weight loss, {{a simple and}} quick method is needed for preoperative planning. We suggest an approach that helps visualize the optimal skin incision lines and simulates the postoperative result by body taping. METHODS: Twelve patients who underwent abdominal contouring, including classic and vertical abdominoplasties as well as dog ear and scar revision, were prospectively analyzed. The skin to be excised was preoperatively <b>folded,</b> <b>taped,</b> and then marked. The area marked was measured and compared with the actual intraoperatively resected area and the postoperative result was evaluated after 1 year by the patients and three surgeons. RESULTS: With body taping, an 83 % congruence between the preoperative planning and the surgery was obtained and only two patients had additional skin resected. No wound dehiscence and flap necrosis occurred and patients as well as surgeons scored the final body contour positively. CONCLUSION: Body taping is a simple, quick, and economic method for planning contour surgery with high accuracy {{as demonstrated by the}} low rate of intraoperative changes of the planned resection and low complication rate...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Common duct tape can be used to inexpensively and conveniently fashion a manipulator to polish thin sections. This procedure has two parts: (1) affixing a piece of duct tape {{to the back of the}} thin section and (2) affixing a handle composed of <b>folded</b> duct <b>tape</b> to the tape applied in step one. This produces a manipulator that remains attached to the glass slide under wet conditions. When polishing is completed, the duct tape can be removed easily from the glass slide. This method improves manual dexterity during polishing and reduces loss of, or damage to, thin sections. Materials needed for this pro-cedure are duct tape and a single-edge razor blade. Both items are inexpensive and easily obtained...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study of the}} folding, stowage, and deployment behavior of viscoelastic tape springs. Experiments show that during folding the relationship between load and displacement is nonlinear and varies with rate and temperature. In particular, the limit and propagation loads increase with the folding rate but decrease with temperature. During stowage, relaxation behavior leads {{to a reduction in}} internal forces that significantly impacts the subsequent deployment dynamics. The deployment behavior starts with a short, dynamic transient that is followed by a steady deployment and ends with a slow creep recovery. Unlike elastic <b>tape</b> springs, localized <b>folds</b> in viscoelastic <b>tape</b> springs do not move during deployment. Finite-element simulations based on a linear viscoelastic constitutive model with an experimentally determined relaxation modulus are shown to accurately reproduce the experimentally observed behavior, and to capture the effects of geometric nonlinearity, time and temperature dependence...|$|R
