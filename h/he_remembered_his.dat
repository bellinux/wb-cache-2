25|$|The household, {{dominated}} by the uncle (whom Ernst nicknamed O Weh—"Oh dear!"—in a play on his initials), was pietistic and uncongenial. Hoffmann was to regret his estrangement from his father. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> aunts with great affection, especially the younger, Charlotte, whom he nicknamed Tante Füßchen ("Aunt Littlefeet"). Although she {{died when he was}} only three years old, he treasured her memory (e.g. see Kater Murr) and embroidered stories about her {{to such an extent that}} later biographers sometimes assumed her to be imaginary, until proof of her existence was found after World War II.|$|E

25|$|Meri was a kind-hearted and {{beautiful}} lady and Phra Rothasen {{lived with her}} very happily for some time, but <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> blind mother and aunts who still stayed in the dark cave. While showing him the palace, Meri had told Rothasen about certain magic medicines kept in a locked room including Phra Rothasen's mother and aunts's eyes. Then he made a plan to get Meri to sleep by making her drink wine and take the eyes for his mother and aunts. Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the eyes from the locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with a loud voice. To stop her, Phra Rothasen threw a magic branch that turned the space between them into a deep lake and a high mountain. Seeing her husband escape from her Meri wailed in despair, asking him to stop. Phra Rothasen was moved by her sad screams and replied that he will back after he finished his urgent mission. Then Phra Rothasen flew away and left Meri with a broken heart crying bitterly at {{the shore of the}} lake.|$|E
500|$|Sheppard {{was born}} in Waynesboro, Virginia on March 8, 1865, to William Henry Sheppard, Sr. and Fannie Frances Sheppard (née Martin), a free [...] "dark mulatto", {{a month before the}} end of the American Civil War. No records exist to confirm William Sr.'s status as a slave or freedman, but it has been speculated that he may have been among the slaves forced to serve the Confederacy as Union troops marched upon the South. William Sr. was a barber, and the family has been {{described}} as the closest to middle class that blacks could have achieved given the time and place. At age twelve, William Jr. became a stable boy for a white family several miles away while continuing to attend school; <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> two-year stay fondly and maintained written correspondence with the family for many years. Sheppard next worked as a waiter to put himself through the newly created Hampton Institute, where Booker T. Washington was among his instructors in a program that allowed students to work during the day and attend classes at night. A significant influence on his appreciation for native cultures was the [...] "Curiosity Room", in which the school's founder maintained a collection of Native Hawaiian and Native American works of art. Later in life he would collect artifacts from the Congo, specifically those of the Kuba, and bring them back for this room, as evidenced by his letters home, such as [...] "t was on the first of September, 1890 that William H. Sheppard addressed a letter to General Samuel Armstrong, Hampton, From Stanley Pool, Africa, that he had many artifacts, spears, idols, etc., and he was '...saving them for the Curiosity Room at Hampton'".|$|E
2500|$|A century later, Shakespeare {{editor and}} {{historian}} A. L.

Shakespeare had also become the godfather of William Walker in the Church of England, and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> godson in his will with twenty shillings.|$|E

2500|$|Macmillan {{had often}} play-acted being {{an old man}} long before real old age set in. As early as 1948 Humphry Berkeley wrote of how [...] "he makes a show of being feeble and decrepit", {{mentioning}} how he had suddenly stopped shambling and sprinted for a train. Nigel Fisher tells an anecdote of how Macmillan initially greeted him to his house leaning on a stick, but later walked and climbed steps perfectly well, twice acting lame again and fetching his stick when <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> [...] "act". However, in genuine old age he became almost blind, causing him to need sticks and a helping arm.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his dream}} he was {{shutting}} {{the front door}} with its strawberry windows and lemon windows and windows like white clouds and windows like clear water in a country stream. [...] Two dozen panes squared round the one big pane, colored of fruit wines and gelatins and cool water ices. [...] <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> father holding him up as a child. [...] "Look!" [...] And through the green glass the world was emerald, moss, and summer mint. [...] "Look!" [...] The lilac pane made livid grapes of all the passers-by. [...] And at last the strawberry glass perpetually bathed the town in roseate warmth, carpeted the world in pink sunrise, and made the cut lawn seem imported from some Persian rug bazaar. [...] The strawberry window, best of all, cured people of their paleness, warmed the cold rain, and set the blowing, shifting February snows afire.|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{was born}} Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. on 10 November 1925 {{in a house}} at 2 Dan-y-bont in Pontrhydyfen, Neath Port Talbot, in Wales. He was the twelfth of {{thirteen}} children born to Richard Walter Jenkins Sr. (1876-1957), and Edith Maude Jenkins (née Thomas; 1883-1927). Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miner's Arms, which was also {{the place where she}} met and married her husband. According to biographer Melvyn Bragg, Richard is quoted saying that Daddy Ni was a [...] "twelve-pints-a-day man" [...] who sometimes went off on drinking and gambling sprees for weeks, and that [...] "he looked very much like me". <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> mother to be [...] "a very strong woman" [...] and [...] "a religious soul with fair hair and a beautiful face".|$|E

On several similar occasions Alvaro is reminded of his life up to that point, and many memories have connections to the political climate in Spain during the most riotous years preceding and following the Spanish Civil War and Franco's regime.|$|R
2500|$|Bishop {{was buried}} {{on the south}} hill above the cave in {{what became known as}} [...] "The Old Guides' Cemetery." [...] According to Mammoth Cave Historian Harold Meloy ("Stephen Bishop: The Man and the Legend", in Caves, Cavers, and Caving, [...] Bruce Sloane, Editor, 1977, pp. 290–91), James Ross Mellon, {{president}} of the City Deposit Bank, Pittsburgh, PA, visited the cave for one week in November 1878. He heard charming stories of Bishop, and he met Charlotte, who then managed the hotel dining room. She led him to Stephen's gravesite, [...] "which had only a cedar tree to mark it." [...] Mellon promised to have a headstone carved for Stephen's grave. Three years after Mellon returned home to Pittsburgh <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> promise to Charlotte.
