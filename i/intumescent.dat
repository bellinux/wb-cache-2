25|$|<b>Intumescent</b> firestops {{are often}} used, {{in the event}} plastic pipes are used for toilet drains, so that the melting plastic pipe is choked off {{in the event of}} an {{accidental}} fire. It is, however, customary to fill the metallic drain pipe annulus with rockwool packing. Even with the best of intentions, it would be difficult for the firestopper to install a sealant, because the installer is not allowed to remove the flange, which is partially used to support the drain pipe below during the installation process.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other automakers, Tesla {{does not}} use {{individual}} large battery cells, but thousands of small, cylindrical, lithium-ion commodity cells like those used in consumer electronics. It uses a version of these cells {{that is designed to}} be cheaper to manufacture and lighter than standard cells by removing some safety features. According to Tesla, these features are redundant because of the advanced thermal management system and an <b>intumescent</b> chemical in the battery to prevent fires. Panasonic is the sole supplier of the cells and cooperates with Tesla in the Gigafactory 1's '21-70' cells.|$|E

For countries that use a hose-stream test, the Fomox is reinforced with <b>intumescent</b> graphite, whereas {{for those who do}} not use a hose-stream, this ingredient is omitted.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>intumescents</b> are {{susceptible}} to environmental influences, such as humidity, which can reduce or negate their ability to function. In Germany, the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik, DIBt, quantifies the ability of <b>intumescents</b> to {{stand the test of}} time against various environmental exposures. DIBt-approved firestops and fireproofing materials are available in Canada and the U.S.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: A passive fire {{protection}} example of an <b>intumescent</b> with strong expansion pressure. This <b>intumescent</b> is called Palusol®. It is based on waterproofed sodium silicate. Another high-expansion <b>intumescent</b> popular for use in plastic pipe firestop devices is graphite. Graphite tends to be less affected by atmospheric conditions than many water-bearing intumescents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intumescent</b> dampers may be {{qualified}} to ISO 10294-5:2005 Fire dampers for air distribution systems—Part 5: <b>Intumescent</b> fire dampers. They swell shut due to intumescence {{in the event}} of a fire. Unlike mechanical dampers, it is a physical/chemical reaction that causes the closure to work. Provided the <b>intumescent</b> is within demonstrable ageing and/or shelf life and providing the absence of massive combustible objects (sabotage), the damper is certified to maintain its functionality subject to its certification listing or type approval. In other words, cleaning (when necessary) and an age assessment comprise the inspection. The annulus of an <b>intumescent</b> damper is shut as per its certification listing, such that the <b>intumescent</b> can press against a shut frame to close the opening, thus eliminating annular smoke migration.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: <b>intumescent</b> fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an <b>intumescent</b> one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. <b>Intumescent</b> fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members. The thickness of this <b>intumescent</b> coating is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. <b>Intumescent</b> coatings are applied as an intermediate coat in a coating system (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively low thickness of this <b>intumescent</b> coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, <b>intumescent</b> coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|E
50|$|Soft char {{producers}} are typically used in thin film <b>intumescents</b> for fireproofing structural steel {{as well as}} in firestop pillows. Typically, the expansion pressure that is created for these products is very low, because the soft carbonaceous char has little substance, which is beneficial if the aim is to produce a layer of insulation.|$|R
50|$|These <b>intumescents</b> {{produce a}} light char, {{which is a}} poor {{conductor}} of heat, thus retarding heat transfer. Typically the light char consist of microporous carbonaceous foam formed by a chemical reaction of three main components: Ammonium polyphosphate, Pentaerythritol and Melamine. The reaction {{takes place in a}} matrix formed by the molten binder which is typically based on vinyl acetate copolymers or styrene acrylates.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} phosphorus-containing flame retardants {{including}} some <b>intumescents</b> have been formulated with selected resins and applied as back-coatings to both cotton and cotton-polyester (35 : 65) blended fabrics. While all formulations raise the limiting oxygen index, only those based on ammonium polyphosphate and a cyclic phosphonate enable samples {{to pass a}} small-scale version of the simulated match test. BS 5852 : 1979, Source 1. While the back-coatings containing <b>intumescents</b> promoted higher levels of char formation this did not reflect in their performance to the match test. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that the more effective flame retardants, as ex-emplified by ammonium polyphosphate, are those which liquefy by melting and/or de-composition well below 300 °C. It is proposed that this liquefication enables wetting of the back face of the fabric and diffusion to the front face where, as the temperature rises towards 3 OO 0 C, char formation occurs before ignition can take place...|$|R

50|$|Nanocomposites {{have become}} a hotspot in the {{research}} of ﬁre-safe polymers because of their relatively low cost and high flexibility for multifunctional properties. Gilman and colleagues did the pioneering work by demonstrating the improvement of fire-retardancy by having nanodispersed montmorillonite clay in the polymer matrix. Later, organomodiﬁed clays, TiO2 nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, layered double hydroxides, carbon nanotubes and polyhedral silsesquioxanes were proved to work as well. Recent {{research has suggested that}} combining nanoparticles with traditional fire retardants (e.g., <b>intumescents)</b> or with surface treatment (e.g., plasma treatment) effectively decreases ﬂammability.|$|R
50|$|Although {{low voltage}} cabling {{does not require}} {{inspection}} or training to install in some jurisdictions, {{it is still important}} for installers to be aware of specific electric code safety rules such as how to correctly penetrate building fire barriers and use firestop putty (<b>intumescents)</b> to prevent a low voltage cable from reducing building fire protection and increasing the risk of injury or death for building occupants. Access to such safety information is typically restricted and limited access by the electrical industry itself so as to only permit licensed professionals to learn the NEC rules and educate themselves.|$|R

The small, orange chunk on the bottom right is capable of growing into the large black object above and to its left. This type of <b>intumescent</b> is typically highly endothermic and contains {{a considerable amount of}} chemically bound water in hydrates. As this is released, it cools adjacent materials. Such intumescents are useful as ingredients in firestop pillows and in paints used for fireproofing purposes. They do not produce enough expansion force to be used in plastic pipe devices, where the <b>intumescent</b> must squeeze shut a melting plastic pipe or conduit.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of fire tests apart from those on firestops. Walls and floors themselves can be tested, closures within them, such as windows, fire doors, fire dampers, structural steel, and more. Fire tests are conducted both on active fire protection and on passive fire protection items. Each have different test methods and scales. There are full scale, small scale and bench scale tests. There are tests on systems, such as the one below, but there are also tests on materials, such as <b>intumescents,</b> to be sure of components that may be used within a system.|$|R
50|$|Harder chars are {{produced}} with sodium silicates and graphite. These products {{are suitable for}} use in plastic pipe firestops as well as exterior steel fireproofing. In those applications, {{it is necessary to}} produce a more substantial char capable of exerting quantifiable expansion pressure. In the case of firestops, a melting, burning plastic pipe must be squeezed together and shut so {{that there will be no}} opening for fire to propagate to an otherwise fire-resistance rated wall or floor assembly. In the case of exterior fireproofing, a hydrocarbon fire must be held off with quite potentially more kinetic energy than a house fire. <b>Intumescents</b> that produce hard chars are unsuitable for interior spray fireproofing.|$|R
50|$|Not {{unlike other}} <b>intumescents,</b> sodium silicate, both in bead form and in liquid form, are {{inherently}} endothermic, due to liquid {{water in the}} water glass and hydrates in the prill form. The absence in the US of mandatory aging tests, whereby PFP systems are made to undergo system performance tests after the aging and humidity exposures, are {{at the root of}} the continued availability, in North America, of PFP products that can become inoperable within weeks of installation. Indiscriminate use of sodium silicates without proper waterproofing measures are contributors to the problems and risk. When sodium silicates are adequately protected, they function extremely well and reliably for long periods. Evidence of this can be seen in the many DIBt approvals for plastic pipe firestop devices using Palusol, which use waterproofed sodium silicate sheets.|$|R

50|$|To {{accomplish}} these aims, {{many different}} types of materials are employed in the design and construction of systems. For instance, common endothermic building materials include calcium silicate board, concrete and gypsum wallboard. During fire testing of concrete floor slabs, water can be seen to boil out of a slab. Gypsum wall board typically loses all its strength during a fire. The use of endothermic materials is established and proven to be sound engineering practice. The chemically bound water inside these materials sublimes. During this process, the unexposed side cannot exceed the boiling point of water. Once the hydrates are spent, the temperature on the unexposed side of an endothermic fire barrier tends to rise rapidly. Too much water can be a problem, however. Concrete slabs that are too wet, will literally explode in a fire, which is why test laboratories insist on measuring water content of concrete and mortar in fire test specimens, before running any fire tests. PFP measures can also include <b>intumescents</b> and ablative materials. The point is, however, that whatever the nature of the materials, they on their own bear no rating. They must be organised into systems, which bear a rating when installed in accordance with certification listings or established catalogues, such as DIN 4102 Part 4 or the Canadian National Building Code.|$|R
