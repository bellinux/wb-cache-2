25|$|The <b>electroscope</b> is an {{important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the <b>electroscope</b> is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the <b>electroscope</b> discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged <b>electroscope</b> and further charge a positive <b>electroscope.</b> However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.|$|E

25|$|In 1873, Frederick Guthrie {{discovered}} the basic principle of operation of thermionic diodes. He {{discovered that a}} positively charged <b>electroscope</b> could be discharged by bringing a grounded piece of white-hot metal close to it (but not actually touching it). The same {{did not apply to}} a negatively charged <b>electroscope,</b> indicating that the current flow was only possible in one direction.|$|E
25|$|Gold-leaf electroscopes are {{designed}} to detect static electricity. Charge placed on the metal cap spreads to the stem and the gold leaf of the <b>electroscope.</b> Because they then have the same charge, the stem and leaf repel each other. This will cause the leaf to bend away from the stem.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{did more}} than any other {{electrician}} up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring electrometer, based on the old <b>electroscope</b> of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.|$|E
50|$|Cavallo's {{multiplier}} was {{an early}} electrostatic influence machine, invented in 1795 by the Anglo-Italian natural philosopher Tiberius Cavallo. Its purpose was to multiply, or amplify, a small electric charge to a level where it was detectable by the insensitive <b>electroscopes</b> of the day. Repeated operation of the device could produce voltages high enough to generate sparks.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} {{extraction}} of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, {{which is similar}} to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the <b>electroscope.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1748, Nollet invented one of {{the first}} electrometers, the <b>electroscope,</b> which showed {{electric}} charge using electrostatic attraction and repulsion. Nollet is reputed {{to be the first to}} apply the name [...] "Leyden jar" [...] to the first device for storing electricity. Nollet's invention was replaced by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure's electrometer in 1766.|$|E
2500|$|Galvani's {{scientific}} colleagues {{generally accepted}} his views, but Alessandro Volta, the outstanding {{professor of physics}} at the University of Pavia, was not convinced by the analogy between muscles and Leyden jars. Deciding that the frogs' legs used in Galvani's experiments served only as an <b>electroscope,</b> he held that the contact of dissimilar metals was the true source of stimulation. [...] He referred to the electricity so generated as [...] "metallic electricity" [...] and decided that the muscle, by contracting when touched by metal, resembled the action of an <b>electroscope.</b> Furthermore, Volta claimed that if two dissimilar metals in contact with each other also touched a muscle, agitation would also occur and increase with the dissimilarity of the metals. Galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action using two pieces of similar metal. [...] Volta's name was later used for the unit of electrical potential, the volt.|$|E

5000|$|Since it {{is able to}} {{distinguish}} between charged and non-charged objects, it {{is an example of a}} class of devices known as <b>electroscopes.</b> The versorium is of a similar construction to the magnetic compass, but is influenced by electrostatic rather than magnetic forces. At the time it was invented, the differences between magnetic and electrical forces were poorly understood and Gilbert did a series of experiments to prove they were two separate types of forces with the versorium and another device called a Terrella (or [...] "little Earth"). In fact, Gilbert was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity and is credited with establishing the term electricity.|$|R
2500|$|Ghost illusions {{were the}} {{mainstay}} of Williams' show for {{almost a quarter of}} a century with the 'ghosts' making their final appearance at Nottingham Goose Fair in October 1897. Williams' show travelled under a variety of different names over the years including The Great Hobgoblinscope (1872 - 1885); Great Ghost Show (1881 - 1895); and Randall Williams Grand <b>Electroscope</b> and Mammoth Phantoscopical Exhibition (1896-1897).|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} was when Abraham Bennet, the {{inventor}} of the gold leaf <b>electroscope,</b> described a [...] "doubler of electricity" [...] (Phil. Trans., 1787), as a device similar to the electrophorus, but that could amplify a small charge by means of repeated manual operations with three insulated plates, {{in order to make it}} observable in an <b>electroscope.</b> Erasmus Darwin, W. Wilson, G. C. Bohnenberger, and (later, 1841) J. C. E. Péclet developed various modifications of Bennet's device. Francis Ronalds automated the generation process in 1816 by adapting a pendulum bob as one of the plates, driven by clockwork or a steam engine – he created the device to power his electric telegraph. In 1788, William Nicholson proposed his rotating doubler, which can be considered as the first rotating influence machine. His instrument was described as [...] "an instrument which by turning a winch produces the two states of electricity without friction or communication with the earth". (Phil. Trans., 1788, p.403) Nicholson later described [...] a [...] "spinning condenser" [...] apparatus, as a better instrument for measurements.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electrometer}} is {{an electrical}} instrument for measuring electric charge or electrical potential difference. There {{are many different}} types, ranging from historical handmade mechanical instruments to high-precision electronic devices. Modern electrometers based on vacuum tube or solid-state technology {{can be used to}} make voltage and charge measurements with very low leakage currents, down to 1 femtoampere. A simpler but related instrument, the <b>electroscope,</b> works on similar principles but only indicates the relative magnitudes of voltages or charges.|$|E
5000|$|Bruno Rossi {{wrote of}} this period that [...] "In the late 1920s and early 1930s the {{technique}} of self-recording <b>electroscopes</b> carried by balloons into the highest layers of the atmosphere or sunk to great depths under water was brought to an unprecedented degree of perfection by the German physicist Erich Regener and his group.

[...] Ernest Rutherford stated in 1931 that [...] "thanks to the fine experiments of Professor Millikan and the even more far-reaching experiments of Professor Regener, we have now got for the first time, a curve of absorption of these radiations in water which we may safely rely upon.".|$|R
40|$|More {{careful and}} {{prolonged}} {{observations on the}} small, daily variation before reported in the measured intensities of the cosmic rays, the new observations being made under such conditions as to eliminate {{the possibility of a}} slight temperature effect suggested by Bowen and Millikan's recent explanation of ionization-pressure relations in high-pressure <b>electroscopes,</b> yield the definite result that within the limits of the author's present observational uncertainty which is of the order of a third of a percent, the sun has no direct influence on cosmic-ray intensities. New evidence is presented that if observed and apparently systematic variations of the order of a third of a percent are in fact real they are best interpreted as the result of small changes in the blanketing effect of the earth's atmosphere due to air currents...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} with Neher recording <b>electroscopes</b> {{have been}} made both in Peru and in the Philippines on the cosmic-ray ionization of the atmosphere up to altitudes of 29, 000 feet, with the following results: (1) In both localities the ionization rises essentially exponentially following a coefficient μ= 0. 50 per meter of water. This means that in the equatorial belt the ionization at 29, 000 feet (two-thirds {{of the way to}} the top of the atmosphere) is about 50 ions per cc per sec., or half its value at the same altitude in the temperate zone. (2) If any longitude effect such as that which we have proved to exist at sea level exists at altitudes of 26, 000 feet, it is inside the limits of our observational uncertainty, about 5 percent...|$|R
2500|$|The {{electric}} machine was soon further improved by Andrew (Andreas) Gordon, a Scotsman {{and professor at}} Erfurt, who substituted a glass cylinder {{in place of a}} glass globe; and by Giessing of Leipzig who added a [...] "rubber" [...] consisting of a cushion of woollen material. The collector, consisting of a series of metal points, was added to the machine by Benjamin Wilson about 1746, and in 1762, John Canton of England (also the inventor of the first pith-ball <b>electroscope)</b> improved the efficiency of {{electric machine}}s by sprinkling an amalgam of tin over the surface of the rubber. In 1768, Jesse Ramsden constructed a widely used version of a plate electrical generator.|$|E
2500|$|The gold-leaf <b>electroscope</b> {{was one of}} the [...] {{instruments}} used {{to indicate}} electric charge. It is still used for science demonstrations but has been superseded in most applications by electronic measuring instruments. The instrument consists of two thin leaves of gold foil suspended from an electrode. [...] When the electrode is charged by induction or by contact, the leaves acquire similar electric charges and repel each other due to the Coulomb force. Their separation is a direct indication of the net charge stored on them. On the glass opposite the leaves, pieces of tin foil may be pasted, so that when the leaves diverge fully they may discharge into the ground. [...] The leaves may be enclosed in a glass envelope to protect them from drafts, and the envelope may be evacuated to minimize charge leakage. A further cause of charge leakage is ionizing radiation, so to prevent this, the electrometer must be surrounded by lead shielding. [...] This principle has been used to detect ionizing radiation, as seen in the quartz fibre electrometer and Kearny fallout meter.|$|E

"'After {{reading these}} {{articles}} with avidity,' Bottazzi's report begins: 'Professor Galeotti, my associate, and I {{looked at each}} other astounded, and the same thoughts in the same words came simultaneously to our lips: [...] "We, too, must see, must touch with our hands--and at once--here in this laboratory where experiments of the phenomena of life are daily carried on, with the impartiality of men whose object is the discovery of scientific truth, here in this quiet place where sealed doors will be superfluous.

50|$|Between 1911 and 1913, Hess {{undertook}} {{the work}} that won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. For many years, scientists had been puzzled by the levels of ionizing radiation measured in the atmosphere.

The <b>electroscopes</b> previously used gave an approximate measurement of the radiation, but indicated that at greater altitude in the atmosphere the level of radiation might actually be higher than that on the ground. Hess approached this mystery first by greatly increasing the precision of the measuring equipment, and then by personally taking the equipment aloft in a balloon. He systematically measured the radiation at altitudes up to 5.3 km during 1911-12. The daring flights were made both at day and during the night, at significant risk to himself.|$|R

40|$|The {{excitation}} {{functions for}} the production of long range alpha-particles, gamma-rays, and electron pairs by the bombardment of F 19 by protons have been observed simultaneously up to a bombarding energy of 1. 5 Mev. The long range alpha and pair curves exhibit resonance peaks superimposed on a background of increasing intensity with increasing bombarding energy. Approximate coincidence in two instances of pair and alpha-resonances suggests that full range alphas and the short range alphas preceding pair emission can be products of competing modes of decay of the same intermediate states of Ne 20. This in turn suggests that the state of O 16 which decays by pair emission has the same parity (even) as the ground states of O 16 and thus that the pair emission can be due to ordinary electromagnetic forces.
