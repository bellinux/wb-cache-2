25|$|Touch on / touch off {{has both}} {{benefits}} and costs. On {{the one hand}} it allows fares to be automatically calculated, always giving the passenger the cheapest fare option and special off-peak fares to encourage travel during quiet times could be implemented, which is impossible with Metcard. The main disadvantage would be to passengers who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> off and who would therefore be charged the total fare for the trip they might have taken.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{beneficial}} to select the cover material carefully in order to not only cover the feces but also to inoculate them with beneficial soil microbes. In that case, finished compost {{could be used as}} cover material, although {{it is important that the}} users either <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> this cover material with their bare hands or that the composting process is sufficiently controlled such that no pathogens remain in the material.|$|E

25|$|Qantas {{operates}} flightseeing charters to Antarctica {{on behalf}} of Croydon Travel. It first flew Antarctic flightseeing trips in 1977.

Although these flights <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> down, they require specific polar operations and crew training due to factors like sector whiteout, which contributed to the 1979 Air New Zealand disaster.|$|E
25|$|A similar issue arises for {{passengers}} arriving at Wimbledon by tram. Normally tram users <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> out, but at Wimbledon {{they must do}} so to leave the station; touching out at the regular turnstile accomplishes this. If, however, a passenger touches their card at a standalone Oyster reader (such as the one by the manual gates), the system will see this as starting a new journey rather than ending one, and will deduct a maximum fare from the card.|$|E
25|$|The British Protection of Wrecks Act, enacted {{to protect}} {{historic}} wrecks, controls access to wrecks such as Cattewater Wreck {{which can only}} be visited or investigated under licence. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access to wrecks which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other wrecks divers may visit provided they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch,</b> interfere with or penetrate the wreck. In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.|$|E

25|$|In the Chinese {{province}} of Hebei, women's parking spaces {{have been established}} in shopping centers. These are wider and are clearly marked in different colors. This was made to ease parking for women, according to the representative of one shopping center. In the Wonder Mall in Hebei, one of three underground lots is designated for women. The spaces are between 3.2 and 3.3 meters wide, so that even when car doors are fully open, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> neighboring cars, a measure intended {{to reduce the number}} of collisions. The Global Times daily newspaper, citing insurance company data, states that female drivers cause twice as many collisions in parking lots than in other places.|$|E
25|$|Batteries convert {{chemical}} energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell {{consists of two}} half-cells connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which cations (positively charged ions) migrate. Redox reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> each other, but are electrically connected by the electrolyte. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Skin {{impressions}} {{are known}} from Platecarpus, preserved in LACM 128319 as soft impressions and phosphate material. Scales {{on the tip}} of the snout and the top of the skull are somewhat hexagonal in shape and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> one another. The scales on the jaws are longer and rhomboidal in shape, overlapping one another. The scales on the snout indicate that the nostrils were placed far in front of the skull at its tip and faced laterally as in most squamates and archosaurs. The body scales are all rhomboidal in shape and form tightly connecting diagonal rows that overlap each other at their posterior edges. They are generally the same size throughout {{the entire length of the}} body. The caudal scales on the tail are taller and larger than those of the rest of the body, although those covering the lower surface of the tail are more similar to body scales.|$|E

500|$|Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, {{described}} by Pabon as [...] "a form of self defense {{disguised as a}} dance." [...] Its influence on breaking is disputed and debated; one side believes that breaking came from capoeira, while the other side denies this. Capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking, and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance. Both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and, since both art forms are acrobatic, some moves look similar to each other. However, capoeira is more rule-oriented. One rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista's back can never touch the ground. In contrast, a breaker's back is almost always on the ground, and the only rule in breaking is that you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> your opponent during a battle.|$|E

2500|$|A {{circle that}} is tangent to {{two sides of}} a triangle, as the Malfatti circles are, must be {{centered}} {{on one of the}} angle bisectors of the triangle (green in the figure). These bisectors partition the triangle into three smaller triangles, and Steiner's construction of the Malfatti circles begins by drawing a different triple of circles (shown dashed in the figure) inscribed within each of these three smaller triangles. Each pair of two of these three inscribed circles has two bitangents, lines that touch both of the dashed circles and pass between them: one bitangent is the angle bisector, and the second bitangent is shown as the red dashed line in the figure. Label the three sides of the given triangle as , , and , and label the three bitangents that are not angle bisectors as , , and , where [...] is the bitangent to the two circles that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> side , [...] is the bitangent to the two circles that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> side , and [...] is the bitangent to the two circles that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> side [...] Then the three Malfatti circles are the inscribed circles to the three tangential quadrilaterals , , and [...] The three bitangents , , and [...] cross the triangle sides at the point of tangency with the third inscribed circle, and may also be found as the reflections of the angle bisectors across the lines connecting pairs of centers of these incircles.|$|E
