5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward <b>inflexion</b> to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E

Possible reasons for some misconceptions relating to the number {{and the nature of the}} musical intervals used in Carnatic music today are also suggested. Sample pitch tracks are presented to illustrate our arguments...|$|R

25|$|In grammar, {{inflection}} or <b>inflexion</b> – {{sometimes called}} accidence – is the modification {{of a word}} to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. The inflection of verbs is also called conjugation, and one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, participles, prepositions, postpositions, numerals, articles etc, as declension.|$|E
25|$|The {{logistic}} {{growth curve}} is initially {{very similar to}} the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because the population is as large as possible based on the resources available. Experiments on Daphnia growth rates showed a striking adherence to the logistic growth curve. The <b>inflexion</b> point in the Daphnia population density graph occurred at half the carrying capacity, as predicted by the logistic growth model.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a {{significant}} figure {{in the emergence of}} Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color Field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His Black Pin Stripe paintings of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no <b>inflexion.</b> During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{diffraction}} of light were first carefully observed and characterized by Francesco Maria Grimaldi, who also {{coined the term}} diffraction, from the Latin diffringere, 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665. Isaac Newton studied these effects and attributed them to <b>inflexion</b> of light rays. James Gregory (16381675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first diffraction grating. In 1803 Thomas Young did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his double slit interferometer. Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. Augustin-Jean Fresnel did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by Christiaan Huygens and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory.|$|E

In pedagogic and linguistic literature on Inuktitut, these infix morphemes are often called verb chunks. These modifiers indicate tense, aspect, manner and a variety of functions that in English require auxiliary verbs, adverbs, or other structures.|$|R

In Le Mirage linguistique (1988), translated and expanded as The Spell of Language (2001), he argued that several major French thinkers (Claude Lévi-Strauss, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault) used linguistic notions in a metaphorical rather than rigorous fashion. In the same vein, in <b>Inflexions</b> de voix (Voice <b>Inflexions)</b> (1976), Pavel describes language as the privileged site of ideals and, at the same time, as the existential proof that humans can rarely fulfill them.|$|R

2500|$|While for typical {{unimodal}} distributions (with {{centrally located}} modes, <b>inflexion</b> points at {{both sides of}} the mode, and longer tails) (with Beta(α,β) such that [...] ) it is known that the sample mean (as an estimate of location) is not as robust as the sample median, the opposite is the case for uniform or [...] "U-shaped" [...] bimodal distributions (with Beta(α,β) such that [...] ), with the modes located at the ends of the distribution. [...] As Mosteller and Tukey remark ( [...] p.207) [...] "the average of the two extreme observations uses all the sample information.

[...] By contrast, it follows that the median of [...] "U-shaped" [...] bimodal distributions with modes {{at the edge of the}} distribution (with Beta(α,β) such that [...] ) is not robust, as the sample median drops the extreme sample observations from consideration. [...] A practical application of this occurs for example for random walks, since the probability for the time of the last visit to the origin in a random walk is distributed as the arcsine distribution Beta(1/2,1/2): the mean of a number of realizations of a random walk is a much more robust estimator than the median (which is an inappropriate sample measure estimate in this case).|$|E
