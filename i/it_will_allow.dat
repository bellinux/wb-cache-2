Hermann {{claims that}} the Breach will {{stabilize}} and the Kaiju will increase in number, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests drifting with a Kaiju’s brain {{to learn more about}} them. Newton goes ahead with his plan despite Herman's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually bioweapons grown by alien colonists, that live on the dimension {{on the other side of}} the breach called the Anteverse, who plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau who sells body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift with. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Soon after, two new Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge simultaneously to find Newton.|$|E
