40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{corporate}} {{e-mail messages}} {{as a medium}} to convey work tasks. Research indicates that categorization of e-mail could alleviate the common problem of information overload. Although e-mail clients provide possibilities of e-mail categorization, not many users spend effort on proper e-mail management. Since e-mail clients are often used for task management, we argue that intent- and task-based categorizations might be what is missing from current systems. We propose a taxonomy of tasks that are expressed through e-mail messages. With this taxonomy, we manually annotated two e-mail datasets (Enron and Avocado), and evaluated {{the validity of the}} dimensions in the taxonomy. Furthermore, we investigated the potential for automatic e-mail classification in a machine learning experiment. We found that approximately half of the corporate e-mail messages contain at least one task, mostly informational or procedural in nature. We show that automatic detection of the number of tasks <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>message</b> is possible with 71 % accuracy. One important finding is {{that it is possible to}} use the e-mails from one company to train a classifier to classify e-mails from another company. Detecting how many tasks a message contains, whether a reply is expected, or what the spatial and time sensitivity of such a task is, can help in providing a more detailed priority estimation of the message for the recipient. Such a priority-based categorization can support knowledge workers in their battle against e-mail overload. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A selective-phrase-based {{preprocessor}} for use {{in generating}} the feature set of an email message prior to its classification as spam or non-spam is presented. The proposed preprocessor subsumes the phrase-based preprocessor used by Yerazunis and the word-based preprocessor employed by Graham. In Yerazunis 2 ̆ 7 phrased-based approach, a sliding window of W contiguous words is used to generate phrases, and all sub-phrases of each W-word phrase are used as features. In Graham 2 ̆ 7 s word-based method, just the individual words <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>message</b> are used as features. The primary goal {{of this investigation was}} to detennine whether the classification accuracy attained by Yerazunis 2 ̆ 7 preprocessor can be achieved at a lower computational cost by selecting a much smaller but promising set of phrases from which to generate the sub-phrases that constitute the features. The proposed preprocessor first identifies a small number f of words from the input text (namely, those that are most likely to appear in spam messages). For each such word, it then selects B distinct phrases of W contiguous words that contain that word and uses all sub-phrases of each such phrase as features. A secondary goal of the research was to investigate the sensitivity of the classification accuracy on/, B, and W. The methods used by the proposed preprocessor and the preprocessors devised by Yerazunis and Graham were tested on a benchmark corpus of e-mail messages. The classification accuracy and other metrics were measured and reported. The results indicated that the classification accuracy of the proposed preprocessor was comparable to that of Yerazunis 2 ̆ 7 preprocessor while utilizing a much smaller set of features. In addition, the research indicated optimum values for f, B, and W: The best accuracies were achieved at (j, B, W) = (2, I, 2) and (j, B, W) = (2, 2, 2) ...|$|E
