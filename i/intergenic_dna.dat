The structural remodeling that ensues leaves nucleoli unable to sustain their primary function, ribosomal biogenesis.

40|$|The H 2 A and H 2 B {{genes of}} the Xenopus xlh 3 histone gene cluster are {{transcribed}} {{in opposite directions}} from initiation points located approximately 235 bp apart. The close proximity of these genes to one another suggests that their expression may be controlled by either a single bidirectional promoter or by separate promoters. Our analysis of the transcription of histone gene pairs containing deletions and site-specific mutations of <b>intergenic</b> <b>DNA</b> revealed that both promoters are distinct but that they overlap physically and share multiple regulatory elements, providing a possible basis for the coordinate regulation of their in vivo activities.

40|$|Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of {{flowering}} plants {{are well known}} for their extreme diversity in size, structure, gene content, and rates of sequence evolution and recombination. In contrast, {{little is known about}} mitogenomic diversity and evolution within gymnosperms. Only a single complete genome sequence is available, from the cycad Cycas taitungensis, while limited information is available for the one draft sequence, from Norway spruce (Picea abies). To examine mitogenomic evolution in gymnosperms, we generated complete genome sequences for the ginkgo tree (Ginkgo biloba) and a gnetophyte (Welwitschia mirabilis). There is great disparity in size, sequence conservation, levels of shared DNA, and functional content among gymnosperm mitogenomes. The Cycas and Ginkgo mitogenomes are relatively small, have low substitution rates, and possess numerous genes, introns, and edit sites; we infer that these properties were present in the ancestral seed plant. By contrast, the Welwitschia mitogenome has an expanded size coupled with accelerated substitution rates and extensive loss of these functional features. The Picea genome has expanded further, to more than 4 Mb. With regard to structural evolution, the Cycas and Ginkgo mitogenomes share a remarkable amount of <b>intergenic</b> <b>DNA,</b> which {{may be related to the}} limited recombinational activity detected at repeats in Ginkgo.

40|$|We develop {{methods to}} infer levels of {{evolutionary}} constraints in the genome by comparing rates of nucleotide substitution in noncoding DNA with rates predicted from rates of synonymous site evolution in adjacent genes or other putatively neutrally evolving sites, while accounting {{for differences in}} base composition. We apply the methods to estimate levels of constraint in noncoding DNA of Drosophila. In introns, constraint (the estimated fraction of mutations that are selectively eliminated) is absolute at the 5 ' and 3 ' splice junction dinucleotides, and averages 72 % in base pairs 3 - 6 at the 5 '-end. Constraint at the 5 ' base pairs 3 - 6 is significantly lower in the lineage leading to Drosophila melanogaster than in Drosophila simulans, a finding that agrees with other features of genome evolution in Drosophila and indicates {{that the effect of}} selection on intron function has been weaker in the melanogaster lineage. Elsewhere in intron sequences, the rate of nucleotide substitution is significantly higher than at synonymous sites. By using intronic sites outside splice control regions as a putative neutrally evolving standard, constraint in the 500 bp of <b>intergenic</b> <b>DNA</b> upstream and downstream regions of protein-coding genes averages approximately 44 %.

40|$|Missense point {{mutations}} in the TP 53 gene are frequent genetic alterations in human tumor tissue and cell lines derived thereof. Mutant p 53 (mutp 53) proteins have lost sequence-specific DNA binding, but have retained {{the ability to}} interact in a structure-selective manner with non-B DNA and to act as regulators of transcription. To identify functional binding sites of mutp 53, we established a small library of genomic sequences bound by p 53 R 273 H in U 251 human glioblastoma cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Mutp 53 binding to isolated DNA fragments confirmed the specificity of the ChIP. The mutp 53 bound DNA sequences are rich in repetitive DNA elements, which are dispersed over non-coding DNA regions. Stable down-regulation of mutp 53 expression strongly suggested that mutp 53 binding to genomic DNA is functional. We identified the PPARGC 1 A and FRMD 5 genes as p 53 R 273 H targets regulated by binding to intronic and intra-genic sequences.

40|$|Abstract Background Existing {{tools for}} multiple-sequence {{alignment}} focus on aligning protein sequence or protein-coding DNA sequence, {{and are often}} based on extensions to Needleman-Wunsch-like pairwise alignment methods. We introduce a new tool, Sigma, with a new algorithm and scoring scheme designed specifically for non-coding DNA sequence. This problem acquires importance with {{the increasing number of}} published sequences of closely-related species. In particular, studies of gene regulation seek to take advantage of comparative genomics, and recent algorithms for finding regulatory sites in phylogenetically-related intergenic sequence require alignment as a preprocessing step. Much can also be learned about evolution from <b>intergenic</b> <b>DNA,</b> which tends to evolve faster than coding DNA. Sigma uses a strategy of seeking the best possible gapless local alignments (a strategy earlier used by DiAlign), at each step making the best possible alignment consistent with existing alignments, and scores the significance of the alignment based on the lengths of the aligned fragments and a background model which may be supplied or estimated from an auxiliary file of <b>intergenic</b> <b>DNA.</b> Results Comparative tests of sigma with five earlier algorithms on synthetic data generated to mimic real data show excellent performance, with Sigma balancing high "sensitivity" (more bases aligned) with effective filtering of "incorrect" alignments. With real data, while "correctness" can't be directly quantified for the alignment, running the PhyloGibbs motif finder on pre-aligned sequence suggests that Sigma's alignments are superior.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Intergenic</b> <b>DNA,</b> often {{described}} as “playground of evolution”, harbors a plethora of cis and trans regulatory elements {{in the form of}} non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The evolution of the silencing mechanism mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), an important class of ncRNA, involves the proliferation of miRNA biogenesis and effector proteins, continuing innovation of novel families by the diversification of established families and spawning additional paralogous family members. Such evolving miRNA pathways for spatiotemporal regulation of the transcriptome have shaped the evolution of eukaryotic genomes and contributed to the complexity of multicellular organisms. Here, we focus on the emergence of new target specificity of the miRNAs along with the proliferation of core biogenesis and effector modules and show how this has contributed to generate diverse miRNA regulatory pathways...|$|E

The {{use of this}} approach is challenged by the difficulty in maintaining these cells ex vivo while keeping their myogenic potential, and ensuring sufficient transgene expression following their transplantation and myogenic differentiation in vivo. We investigated the use of the piggyBac transposon system to achieve stable gene expression when transferred to cultured mesoangioblasts and into murine muscles. Without selection, up to 8 % of the mesoangioblasts expressed the transgene from 1 to 2 genomic copies of the piggyBac vector. Integration occurred mostly in <b>intergenic</b> genomic <b>DNA</b> and transgene expression was stable in vitro. Intramuscular transplantation of mouse Tibialis anterior muscles with mesoangioblasts containing the transposon led to sustained myofiber GFP expression in vivo. In contrast, the direct electroporation of the transposon-donor plasmids in the mouse Tibialis muscles in vivo did not lead to sustained transgene expression despite molecular evidence of piggyBac transposition in vivo.
