And they took me to Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script.

But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant, Jean was asked about her reaction when she heard that Beyoncé was recording [...] "If I Were a Boy". She was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as [...] "do the whole artist thing as well". Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's {{going to be on}} my album!' And it can be on my album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>this,</b> people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially did not intend to hand it to another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics.

There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!'

[...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour.

2500|$|Philbin gained {{his first}} network TV {{exposure}} in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show on television (19671969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and Philbin {{would take the}} barbs in stride. [...] But his feelings were wounded when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about [...] "not being wanted and letting down" [...] the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in his book, How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>This</b> Way, this was actually all a ruse planned by Bishop and Regis to steal the spotlight and attract some of Johnny Carson's viewers. When The Joey Bishop Show was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to successfully carry the night on his own.|$|E

And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is to make you a target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king. So Kill the King is the title of my last album. Will they kill him or will he ride into the sunset happily ever after?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Producers later made {{a series}} of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they {{introduced}} a new hairstyle, which has been described as an [...] "enormous bouffant hair-do". Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an Inside Soap reporter that [...] "as soon as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> big hair, I felt the character get bigger. She strutted about more, and it brought a bit of comedy to her." [...] The actress has admitted that it took time for her make-up team to perfect Grace's look. She was unhappy with Grace's shot in the Hollyoaks opening title sequence because the hair was not big enough. But over time she began to leave the make-up department with almost square hair as it grew. Wall is supplied with an additional hair piece which is applied to her head each morning. It takes the make-up department two hours daily to wash, dress and curl it and an additional forty minutes to style it onto Wall's head. Grace's hair is very big and is often seen with differing styles, but always with plenty of volume in the roots to achieve her signature look. The hair style became known as [...] "Beryl Bouffant" [...] on the Hollyoaks set. The hair got so big that directors would sometimes complain that it was blocking views of other characters during filming.|$|E
