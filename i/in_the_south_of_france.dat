5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France</b> to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France,</b> in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing.

5|$|Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to tie down German forces away from Normandy by threatening other targets. Ironside's specific objective was to tie up the 17th SS and 11th Panzer divisions deployed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France.</b>|$|E
5|$|When first planned, the {{landings}} were to {{take place}} simultaneouslyOverlord in Normandy and Anvil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France.</b> It {{soon became clear that}} a dual landing was impossible to conduct with the available forces. The expansion of Overlord from a three- to a five-division front required many additional LSTs, which would have been needed for Anvil. At the same time, another Allied amphibious landing in Italy at Anzio had gone badly. All of these resulted in the postponing of Anvil by the Allies.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working {{with her husband and}} agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France.</b>|$|E

Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating. The couple married at the Château de La Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>of</b> <b>France,</b> on 1 July 2013 (which is Canada Day), {{after a year of}} being together.

5|$|Monteux {{was well}} known as a teacher.

5|$|On 26 February 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped his island {{prison of}} Elba and {{embarked}} for France. He arrived with about 1,000 troops near Cannes on 1 March. Louis XVIII {{was not particularly}} worried by Bonaparte's excursion, as such small numbers of troops could be easily overcome. There was, however, a major underlying problem for the Bourbons: Louis XVIII had failed to purge the military of its Bonapartist troops. This led to mass desertions from the Bourbon armies to Bonaparte's. Furthermore, Louis XVIII could not join the campaign against Napoleon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France</b> because {{he was suffering from}} another case of gout. Minister of War Marshall Soult dispatched Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans (later King Louis Philippe I), the Count of Artois, and Marshall MacDonald to apprehend Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded to dismantle the Vichy France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the Vichy French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile. With {{the collapse of the}} Vichy French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France</b> prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced the damage and suffering done to France.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Brigade's next {{parachute}} {{operation was}} Operation Hasty in June 1944. This {{was a small}} diversionary raid carried out by sixty men from the 6th Parachute Battalion. They were dropped into the area between Sora and Avezzano, their objective being to harass the Germans withdrawing to the Gothic Line. The mission was a success: a German brigade was diverted to hunt the small force, and a German division was retained on rear-area security duties instead of going into the front line. In June 1944, the brigade {{was released from the}} Eighth Army and joined the 1st Airborne Task Force for airborne operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France.</b>|$|E

5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France,</b> Crémant d'Alsace {{in the eastern}} region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made {{with a measure of}} crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France</b> or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E
5|$|With pessimism for Citadel {{increasing}} {{with each}} delay, in June, Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Staff at the OKW, instructed {{the armed forces}} propaganda office to portray the upcoming operation as a limited counteroffensive. Due to concerns of an Allied landing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>France</b> or in Italy and delays in deliveries of the new tanks, Hitler postponed again, this time to 20 June. Zeitzler was profoundly concerned with the delays, but he still supported the offensive. On 17–18 June, following a discussion in which the OKW Operations Staff suggested abandoning the offensive, Hitler further postponed the operation until 3 July. Finally, on 1 July, Hitler announced 5 July as the launch date of the offensive.|$|E
