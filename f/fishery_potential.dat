40|$|Commercial {{trawling}} for finfish in Nigeria's inshore {{water is}} a recent activity. Intensive industrial trawling started when the Federal Government distributed trawlers to viable fishermen cooperatives during the Third National Development Plan Period (1975 - 80). Hitherto, industrial fisheries development in the country focused on {{the assessment of the}} potential fish stock on Nigeria's continental shelf and measures to increase artisanal production. As a result of increasing demand for fish and shortage of foreign exchange to import fish, measures to increase fish supply leaned towards industrial exploitation of the <b>fisheries</b> <b>potentials</b> of Nigeria's continental shelf. Based on this background, this paper examines the investment prospects of trawling for fish in inshore waters. The <b>fisheries</b> <b>potentials</b> of the inshore zone of Nigeria are identified. Catch efficiency and profitability of inshore trawling are estimated. Measures that can safeguard the longterm interest of the trawling industry are recommende...|$|R
