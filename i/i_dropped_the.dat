He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

When confronted with the evidence that Hugo Black {{had been a member}} of the Klan, he responded in part: [...] "Before becoming a Senator <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> Klan. I have had nothing to do with it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization." ...|$|E

Before becoming a Senator <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> Klan. I have {{had nothing to do with}} it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization. I have never resumed it and never expect to do so."

She recounted that many had emigrated, {{and that she had}} received many letters and photographs from them, but stated [...] " ... when they marry <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> <b>the</b> correspondence. The moment a woman becomes Mrs. So and So I say you must not write to me now - <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> <b>the</b> correspondence at once."

500|$|... "Tuscan Leather" [...] {{generated}} controversy with label mate Nicki Minaj for the line: [...] "Not even talkin' to Nicki, {{communication is}} breakin' / <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> ball on some personal shit, I need {{to embrace it}} / I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it / Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'," [...] Speaking of the line, Drake {{said in an interview}} with MTV News: [...] "That line in 'Tuscan Leather' isn't exactly where I am in my life right now, but like a year ago...eight months, seven months ago, it was how I felt, I'd done something wrong, and I wasn't speaking to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{was an avid}} music lover, most {{interested}} in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E
500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and <b>I</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E
