5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV <b>env</b> <b>gene,</b> allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
25|$|Gp120 is coded by the HIV <b>env</b> <b>gene,</b> {{which is}} around 2.5 kb long and codes for around 850 amino acids. The primary env product is the protein gp160, which gets cleaved to gp120 (~480 amino acids) and gp41 (~345 amino acids) in the endoplasmatic {{reticulum}} by the cellular protease furin. The crystal structure of core gp120 shows an organization with an outer domain, an inner domain {{with respect to}} its termini and a bridging sheet. Gp120 is anchored to the viral membrane, or envelope, via non-covalent bonds with the transmembrane glycoprotein, gp41. Three gp120s and gp41s combine in a trimer of heterodimers to form the envelope spike, which mediates attachment to and entry into the host cell.|$|E
2500|$|Several conserved {{secondary}} structure elements {{have been identified}} within the HIV RNA genome. The 5'UTR structure consists of series of stem-loop structures connected by small linkers. [...] These stem-loops (5' to 3') include the trans-activation region (TAR) element, the 5' polyadenylation signal , the PBS, the DIS, the major SD and the ψ hairpin structure located within the 5' end of the genome and the HIV Rev response element (RRE) within the <b>env</b> <b>gene.</b> Another RNA structure that has been identified is gag stem loop 3 (GSL3), thought {{to be involved in}} viral packaging. RNA {{secondary structure}}s have been proposed to affect the HIV life cycle by altering the function of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase, although not all elements identified have been assigned a function.|$|E

To better understand the genetic diversity of this epidemic and its potential impact on vaccine development, we have cloned and sequenced the complete gag and <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> of 13 primary virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of our sequences and 69 complete <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> from the Los Alamos and GenBank databases revealed multiple subclusters within subtype C.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} {{in the use of}} porcine organs, tissues, and cells for xenotransplantation to humans has highlighted the need to characterize the properties of pig endogenous retroviruses (PERVs). Analysis of a variety of pig cells allowed us to isolate and identify three classes of infectious type C endogenous retrovirus (PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C) which have distinct <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> but have highly homologous sequences {{in the rest of the}} genome. To study the properties of these <b>env</b> <b>genes,</b> expression plasmids for the three <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> were constructed and used to generate retrovirus vectors bearing corresponding Env proteins. Host range analyses by the vector transduction assay showed that PERV-A and PERV-B Envs have wider host ranges, including several human cell lines, compared with PERV-C Env, which infected only two pig cell lines and one human cell line. All PERVs could infect pig cells, indicating that the PERVs have a potential to replicate in pig transplants in immunosuppressed patients. Receptors for PERV-A and PERV-B were present on cells of some other species, including mink, rat, mouse, and dog, suggesting that such species may provide useful model systems to study infection and pathogenicity of PERV. In contrast, no vector transduction was observed on nonhuman primate cell lines, casting doubt on the utility of nonhuman primates as models for PERV zoonosis. Interference studies showed that the three PERV strains use receptors distinct from each other and from a number of other type C mammalian retroviruses...|$|R

50|$|Vpu and Env are {{expressed}} {{from the same}} bicistronic mRNA in a Rev-dependent manner, presumably by leaky scanning of ribosomes through the vpu initiation codon. In fact Vpu gene overlaps at its3′-end with the <b>env</b> <b>gene.</b> Several HIV-1 isolates were found to carry point mutations in the Vpu translation initiation codon but have otherwise intact vpu genes. Since removal of the Vpu initiation codon results in increased expression of the downstream <b>env</b> <b>gene,</b> {{it is possible that}} HIV-1 actually uses this mechanism as a molecular switch to regulate the relative expression of Vpu or Env in infected cells. The possible benefits of such a regulation are unclear.|$|E
50|$|The <b>env</b> <b>gene</b> is {{translated}} into a single precursor polyprotein that is cleaved by a host protease into two proteins, the surface glycoprotein and the transmembrane glycoprotein.

40|$|The flvi- 2 locus is {{a target}} of insertional {{mutagenesis}} in thymic lymphosarcomas induced by feline leukemia virus (FeLV). flvi- 2 encodes the gene bmi- 1, whose product is implicated as a myc-collaborator in the induction of B- and T-cell lymphoma. We have examined the involvement of flvi - 2 and myc in natural and experimentally induced FeLV-positive feline lymphosarcomas which are heterogeneous in anatomical origin, geographic origin, and strain of FeLV involved. We further compared these findings with previous reports of novel FeLV <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> in the same tumors. The results show that proviral insertion at flvi- 2 occurs commonly in natural and experimental feline thymic lymphosarcomas of diverse origins [52 % overall], and that alterations in c-myc commonly accompany insertional mutagenesis of flvi- 2 [54 % overall]. However, 46 % of tumors with flvi- 2 insertions apparently lack involvement of c-myc. These observations {{support the hypothesis that}} interruption of flvi- 2 may be an early event in a multistep cascade, one possibility for completion of which is activation of c-myc. Interruption of flvi- 2 was not observed in nonthymic lymphosarcomas of alimentary or multicentric origin, although c-myc may be involved. A proportion of both thymic and nonthymic tumors have been shown previously to contain FeLV proviruses with recombinant or mutant <b>env</b> <b>genes.</b> Our findings strongly implicate the insertional mutagenesis of flvi- 2, the activation of c-myc, and the emergence of novel <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> in FeLV-mediated lymphomagenesis, particularly in the induction of thymic lymphosarcoma.

40|$|HIV {{transmission}} via breastfeeding {{accounts for}} a considerable proportion of infant HIV acquisition. However, the origin and evolution of the virus population in breast milk, the likely reservoir of transmitted virus variants, are not well characterized. In this study, HIV envelope (<b>env)</b> <b>genes</b> were sequenced from virus variants amplified by single-genome amplification from plasmas and milk of 12 chronically HIV-infected, lactating Malawian women. Maximum likelihood trees and statistical tests of compartmentalization revealed interspersion of plasma and milk HIV env sequences {{in the majority of}} subjects, indicating limited or no compartmentalization of milk virus variants. However, phylogenetic tree analysis further revealed monotypic virus variants that were significantly more frequent in milk (median proportion of identical viruses, 29. 5 %; range, 0 to 61 %) than in plasma (median proportion of identical viruses, 0 %; range, 0 to 26 %) (P = 0. 002), suggesting local virus replication in the breast milk compartment. Moreover, clonally amplified virus <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> in milk produced functional virus Envs that were all CCR 5 tropic. Milk and plasma virus Envs had similar predicted phenotypes and neutralization sensitivities to broadly neutralizing antibodies in both transmitting and nontransmitting mothers. Finally, phylogenetic comparison of longitudinal milk and plasma virus env sequences revealed synchronous virus evolution and new clonal amplification of evolved virus <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> in milk. The limited compartmentalization and the clonal amplification of evolving, functional viruses in milk indicate continual seeding of the mammary gland by blood virus variants, followed by transient local replication of these variants in the breast milk compartment...|$|R

The two <b>env</b> <b>genes</b> (named ENVOV 1 and ENVOV 2), with 1, 926 [*]bp coding region, originated from two MuLV-ERV loci on chromosomes 8 and 18, respectively.

Tropism trait and infectivity of ENVOV 2 were similar to the polytropic env; however, ENVOV 1 had very low level of infectivity.
