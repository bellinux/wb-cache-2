5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a decade before. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> diocese of his birth, and he had almost become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it was {{certainly}} enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first time anyone had been tested {{for the presence of}} 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.|$|E
5|$|The book {{expanded}} {{steadily in}} length, until by 1907 it reached 74 chapters and over 2000 pages. Nearly two million copies were sold by 1868, {{and it remains}} in print (as of 2016). Between 1875 and 1914 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most often consulted cookery book.

5|$|Manuel's career under Leo's successor, Michael II the Amorian (r. 820–829), is unclear, {{as he is}} not {{mentioned}} in the sources during this period. Certainly {{at the time of the}} outbreak of the great rebellion of Thomas the Slav, the strategos of the Armeniacs was Olbianos, while the Anatolics joined the rebellion. Manuel himself, however, evidently remained loyal to Michael, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> latter who raised him to the rank of magistros. The editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit suggest that Manuel may have been recalled by Michael to Constantinople, especially if the marriage of Michael's son and heir Theophilos (r. 829–842) and Manuel's niece Theodora took place around 821, as suggested by E.W. Brooks, and not around 830, as suggested by Treadgold.|$|E

5|$|Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) was {{a silent}} First World War film. At 12 minutes long, {{it was the}} longest {{animated}} film made at that time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first animated propaganda film to be made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has survived. Through World War II, animated propaganda shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company, working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war propaganda films between 1942 and 1945, including Der Fuehrer's Face (1943) and Education for Death (1943).|$|E
5|$|With Poland's {{conversion}} to Christianity {{in the late}} 10th century, the pagan stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones such as images of patron saints, or a Chi-Rho or dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. In 1000 CE, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno, the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor Otto III officially recognized Duke Boleslaus the Brave as King of Poland (see Congress of Gniezno), crowning him and presenting him with {{a replica of the}} Holy Lance, also known as Saint Maurice's Spear. This relic, together with the vexillum attached to <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first insignia of the nascent Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of King Boleslaus's rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor. It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the vexillum.|$|E
5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E
