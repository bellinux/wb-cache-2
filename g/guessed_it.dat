5|$|In 733, Bede {{travelled}} to York {{to visit}} Ecgbert, {{who was then}} bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, {{and it is likely}} that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and at some point visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and {{due to the fact that}} many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be <b>guessed.</b> <b>It</b> seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.|$|E

When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo.

In 1993, The Oregonian said: [...] "Wild, highly vocal speculation blamed the blast on either left-wing or right-wing terrorists, depending, of course, on the accusers' own political persuasions.

There are various accounts of how Amin died, but the exact details have never been confirmed. Amin was either killed by a deliberate attack or died by a [...] "random burst of fire". Amin's son was fatally wounded and died shortly after. His daughter was wounded, but survived. It was Gulabzoy who had been given orders to kill Amin and Watanjar who later confirmed his death.|$|E
500|$|Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline, writing: [...] "Forget Lynette's career stress, Gabrielle's baby daddy drama, {{and even}} Bree's new widowhood: This story has legs, and {{apparently}} arms." [...] She found it strange that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion {{in regards to}} Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and (you <b>guessed</b> <b>it)</b> lots of tears and shouting." [...] The Futon Critic selected [...] "Next" [...] as the 42nd best television episode of 2005, writing, [...] "Say what you will about the show's rocky sophomore season but one can't deny how strongly it started," [...] and citing the tie-changing scene as the episode's most memorable moment.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{planned for}} the ninth or tenth episode of the fourth season to focus on Miles's backstory; however, this was pushed back to the thirteenth episode of the fifth season {{as a result of}} the Writers Guild of America strike. [...] The revelation that Miles is Chang's son was not {{confirmed}} until Miles's flashback episode; however, this plot point had been speculated by the Internet fan community as early as Miles's first appearance on the show. [...] Further speculation occurred following the broadcast of the fifth-season premiere, in which Chang was seen tending to a baby boy. [...] This influenced the way that it was revealed in the show, as the writers looked for a way to present the information in a way that would both be interesting to those who had not <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> and not insulting to viewers who had been predicting it. [...] What resulted was Miles and Hurley discussing Chang with Miles plainly saying, [...] "That douche is my dad" [...] before a cut to a commercial break.|$|E

Lewis Corner of Digital Spy named [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{one of the}} [...] "10 tracks you need to hear", praising Minaj's vocal delivery, the inclusion of Soulja Boy, and the line [...] "Fix it, Jesus." [...] Colin Joyce of Spin called the song an [...] "unbridled joy", and noted that while {{it may not be}} included on The Pink Print, the album would be [...] "lucky, however, to feature any track half as exuberant as this one." [...] A writer for MTV News UK praised both the production and vocals on [...] "Yasss Bish", saying that Minaj's [...] "melodic" [...] vocals and [...] "fierce" [...] rap delivery were {{the best part of the}} song. Several critics noted a musical departure from the pop and dance-pop stylings of her second studio album [...] (2012). MTV News writer Emilee Lindner said [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] found Minaj going back to her original sound, saying: [...] "Nicki Minaj is letting her rapping speak for itself.

[...] Emma Goddard of Bustle praised the chemistry between the two rappers and saw the song as a change from the more upbeat sound found in Minaj's catalogue, which she credited with [...] "show her rapping prowess much more". Writing for The Source, Khari said of [...] "Yasss Bish": [...] " [...] sheds the wig and the excessive make-up, we get the most gorgeous Nicki we've seen in her career.

2500|$|Lankester {{pointed out}} that {{retrograde}} metamorphosis {{could be seen in}} many species that were not, strictly speaking, degenerate. [...] "Were it not for the recapitulative phases of the barnacle, we may doubt whether naturalists would ever have <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> was a crustacean." [...] The lizard Seps has limbs which are [...] "ridiculously small", and Bipes, a burrowing lizard, has no front limbs, and rear limbs reduced to stumps. The Dibamidae are legless lizards of tropical forests who also adopt the burrowing habit. Snakes, which have evolved unique forms of locomotion, and are probably derived from lizards. Thus degeneration or retrogressive metamorphosis sometimes occurs as species adapt to changes in habit or way of life.|$|E
2500|$|Herodotus {{regarded}} the Colchians as an Ancient Egyptian race. Herodotus {{states that the}} Colchians, with the Ancient Egyptians and the Ethiopians, {{were the first to}} practice circumcision, a custom which he claims (without historical proof) that the Colchians inherited from remnants of the army of Pharaoh Sesostris. Herodotus writes, [...] "For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what I say, I myself noted before I heard it from others. When it occurred to me, I inquired of both peoples; and the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians; [...] the Egyptians said that they considered the Colchians part of Sesostris' army. I myself <b>guessed</b> <b>it,</b> partly because they are dark-skinned and woolly-haired; though that indeed counts for nothing, since other peoples are, too; but my better proof was that the Colchians and Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision." [...] Apollonius of Rhodes states that the Egyptians of Colchis preserved as heirlooms a number of wooden tablets, which show, with considerable accuracy, seas and highways.|$|E

Brennan wasted no time in questioning the Ramsay Street residents, but he received conflicting information. Jackie Brygel from TV Week reported that Mark would have his work cut out for him as everyone was seemingly intent on pointing the finger at someone else. Everyone began jumping to conclusions as they had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor explained that Kate Ramsay would give Rebecca a false alibi, while Lyn would get Diana into [...] "strife" [...] and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) lands Andrew in trouble, but he would not help himself either. Channel 5 ran a poll on their website asking viewers to predict who pushed Paul and over 10,000 votes were cast. The majority of the voters thought it was someone other than the six suspects. 20% thought Diana had pushed Paul, followed by 19% who correctly <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> was Rebecca. Declan pulled in 16% of the vote, Andrew had 14%, while Lyn drew 6%, Sonya 5% and Toadie had 1%.|$|E

2500|$|A {{tradition}} of Highland hospitality and chivalry concerns Clan Lamont and Clan Gregor. The story {{is supposed to}} take place around the year 1600. The son of the chief of Clan Lamont and the only son of MacGregor of Glenstrae, chief of Clan Gregor, went hunting together {{on the shores of}} Loch Awe. After the two men had made camp at nightfall they eventually became embroiled in a quarrel {{at the end of which}} Lamont grabbed his dirk and MacGregor was mortally wounded. Lamont then fled, hotly pursued by MacGregor's furious retainers, until losing his way and eventually making it to the house of the MacGregor chief himself. On hearing that Lamont was fleeing for his life, MacGregor promised the lad protection. Soon, though, the old MacGregor <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> was his own son who had been slain, but considered himself bound to the Highland laws of hospitality, saying [...] "Here this night you shall be safe". With the arrival of the furious MacGregor clansman who pursued the young Lamont, the MacGregor chief was true to his word and protected Lamont from his clansmen's vengeance. Later, while it was still dark, the chief had Lamont personally conducted to Dunderave on Loch Fyne and provided him with a boat and oars. The chief bid him leave quickly, saying [...] "Flee for your life; in your own country we shall pursue you. Save yourself if you can!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the series {{suffered}} a sophomore slump and that the second season {{failed to live up}} to the first. Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the new season a [...] "B", blaming the deteriorating quality on the fact that it [...] "morphed into four series," [...] with [...] "the actresses wandering through their separate scenes." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today suggested that the series' weakness was due to Marc Cherry leaving the episodic screenwriting to other writing staff members. Variety Brian Lowry gave the season premiere a positive review, opining that the Lynette storyline looked [...] "extremely promising" [...] and enjoyed the addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette's [...] "tight-assed new boss." [...] He identified the Bree storyline as [...] "the real water-cooler sequence" [...] and complimented Marcia Cross' performance. However, Lowry criticized the Gabrielle and Susan storylines, opining that they are [...] "exhibiting signs of wear and tear." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "Next" [...] had [...] "a particularly sleepy opening twenty minutes" [...] while its exciting plot points all occurred in the second half of the episode. He praised the scene in which Bree changes the tie on Rex's corpse and called Cross' performance throughout the episode [...] "pitch-perfect." [...] Slezak also complimented Huffman's performance, but wondered if Fisher was [...] "a steely enough an actress to go Manolo-a-Manolo with Huffman every week." [...] Though he criticized the repetitive nature of the Susan and Gabrielle storylines, Slezak thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the show's chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodward's acting as well as her character's storyline, opining, [...] "there's something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodard's performance, such apple-pie wholesomeness, that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling." [...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline, writing: [...] "Forget Lynette's career stress, Gabrielle's baby daddy drama, and even Bree's new widowhood: This story has legs, and apparently arms."

[...] Aaron Wallace of Ultimate Disney notes Susan's decreasing importance throughout the season, pointing out Bree, who [...] "comfortably moves into position as the show's lead". Also in response to Susan's storyline, many critics saw the character suffer as a result of the declining quality of the second season.
