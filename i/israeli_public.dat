According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 132 Israeli individuals were killed by Palestinian militant bomb/suicide attacks within Israel proper between 2000 and 2004.|$|R

25|$|Palestinian {{attacks against}} Israel have been costly for Israel.

Such losses {{generated}} immense public pressure from the <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> for a forceful response, and ramped up targeted killings were one such outcome.|$|E

The demonstration was held under the banner [...] "Get Out of The Territories". According to [...] "Peace Now" [...] itself, shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Second Intifada, it was instrumental in creating the Israeli Peace Coalition, which later evolved into the Israeli-Palestine Peace Coalition. Its main objective is to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, and to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace based on a two-state solution.|$|R

25|$|In Israel, {{the only}} {{institutionalized}} form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i. e., a marriage conducted {{under the auspices}} of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law (halakha), as viewed by Orthodox Judaism. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to Jewish law (e. g., a kohen and a divorcée, or a Jew and one who is not halachically Jewish), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>public,</b> for the institution of civil marriage.|$|E
