50|$|When a {{woman came}} to him with an injured pelvis and retroverted uterus from a fall off of a horse, he placed her in a <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> and {{inserted}} his finger into the vagina; this triggered a full distention of the vagina with air, allowing Sims to see the vagina clearly. The distention inspired him to investigate fistula treatment further. Soon after he developed a precursor to the modern speculum out of a pewter spoon and strategically placed mirrors. From 1845 to 1849 Sims started doing experiments on slave women and these experiments were the basis for modern vaginal surgery. The Sims' vaginal speculum aided in vaginal examination and surgery. The rectal examination position, in which the patient {{is on the left}} side with the right knee flexed against the abdomen and the left knee slightly flexed, is also named after him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Moxibustion, {{acupuncture}} {{and other}} acupoint stimulations {{are commonly used}} for the correction of breech presentation. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxibustion and other acupoint stimulations to treat breech presentation. Methods We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on moxibustion, acupuncture or any other acupoint stimulating methods for breech presentation in pregnant women. All searches in PubMed, the Cochrane Library (2008 Issue 2), China National Knowledge Information (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP) and WanFang Database ended in July 2008. Two authors extracted and analyzed the data independently. Results Ten RCTs involving 2090 participants and seven CCTs involving 1409 participants {{were included in the}} present study. Meta-analysis showed significant differences between moxibustion and no treatment (RR 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 20 to 1. 51; 3 RCTs). Comparison between moxibustion and <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> did not show significant differences (RR 1. 30, 95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 79; 3 RCTs). Moxibustion plus other therapeutic methods showed significant beneficial effects (RR 1. 36, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 1. 54; 2 RCTs). Laser stimulation was more effective than assuming the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> plus pelvis rotating. Moxibustion was more effective than no treatment (RR 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 17 to 1. 42; 2 CCTs) but was not more effective than the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> treatment (RR 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 1. 34; 2 CCTs). Laser stimulation at Zhiyin (BL 67) was more effective than the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> treatment (RR 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 1. 54; 2 CCTs,). Conclusion Moxibustion, acupuncture and laser acupoint stimulation tend to be effective in the correction of breech presentation. </p...|$|E

40|$|T H E <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> is {{used here}} for (0. 65 mg.); very old, frail or sick {{patients}} {{the insertion of}} radium, {{in the treatment of}} carcinoma of the uterine cervix. With the anaesthetized patient in that position, the vagina lies widely open and this facilitates (i) finding the cervical canal, which since the cervix is often much deformed by the disease, may be relatively difficult; (ii) packing the radium ovoids into the vaginal fornices, well forward and away from the rectum. This minimizes the rectal reaction and the risk of recto-vaginal fistula. At this hospital each patient has two insertions of radium with an interval of one week between them; the radium is removed in the wards after approximately 72 hours. Treatment in two stages means that two anaesthetics are necessary for patients who are often poor anaesthetic risks. The treatment is necessary and the anaesthetic risks are worth taking because the terminal stages of untreated cervical carcinoma are so very unpleasant. The <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> should be used when-ever possible, as inaccurate placement of radium may well worsen the condition of the patient rather than alleviate it (Tod...|$|E

40|$|Background: In 3 to 4 {{percent of}} all term births, the fetus {{presents}} as a breech. The objectives of this trial were to assess if assuming the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> reduced the frequency of breech presentation at delivery, increased {{the success of the}} subsequent external cephalic version, or both, and to determine if this management plan reduced the need for cesarean delivery. Methods: A randomized clinical trial recruited 100 women from two hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia, with a singleton breech presentation and a gestational age equal to or more than 36 weeks. Women in the treatment group were advised to assume the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> for 15 minutes three times a day for one week. Women in the control group did not perform postural management. All participants were reviewed one week later, and women whose baby remained as a breech presentation were offered an external cephalic version. Results: Postural management did not increase the success of the external cephalic version, reduce the frequency of breech presentation at delivery, or reduce the need for cesarean delivery in women with a breech presentation at term. Conclusions: Findings from this trial included in a meta-analysis of postural management for breech presentation at term suggested that this is not an effective form of care to be offered routinely to women with a breech presentation at term.

40|$|Background: The {{frequencies}} {{and types of}} anal symptoms were compared with the {{frequencies and}} types of benign anal diseases (BAD). Methods: Patients transferred from GPs, physicians or gynaecologists for anal and/or abdominal complaints/signs were enrolled and {{asked to complete a}} questionnaire about their symptoms. Proctologic assessment was performed in the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position.</b> Definitions of BAD were tested in a two year pilot study. Findings were entered into a PC immediately after the assessment of each individual. Results: Eight hundred seven individuals, 539 (66. 8 %) with and 268 without BAD were analysed. Almost one third (31. 2 %) of patients with BAD had more than one BAD. Concomitant anal findings such as skin tags were more frequently seen in patients with than without BAD (&# 60; 0. 01). After haemorrhoids (401 patients), pruritus ani (317 patients) was the second most frequently found BAD. The distribution of stages in 317 pruritus ani patients was: mild (91), moderate (178), severe (29), and chronic (19). Anal symptoms in patients with BAD included: bleeding (58. 6 %), itch (53. 7 %), pain (33. 7 %), burning (32. 9 %), and soreness (26. 6 %). Anal lesions could be predicted according to patients' answers in the questionnaire: haemorrhoids by anal bleeding (p= 0. 032), weeping (p= 0. 017), and non-existence of anal pain (p= 0. 005); anal fissures by anal pain (p= 0. 001) and anal bleeding (p= 0. 006); pruritus ani by anal pain (p= 0. 001), itching (p= 0. 001), and soreness (p= 0. 006). Conclusions: The <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> may allow for the accumulation of more detailed information about BAD than the left lateral Sims' position, thus enabling physicians to make more reliable anal diagnoses and provide better differentiated therapies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Total mesorectal {{excision}} (TME) {{has contributed}} {{to a decline in}} local recurrence. The operation is difficult because of the complicated anatomy of the pelvis and the narrow spaces in the pelvis. We review the anatomy related to TME and we present our surgical technique. Anatomy: The pelvis can be divided into a parietal compartment and a visceral compartment. Both compartments are covered by a fascial layer: the parietal and the visceral fascia. A space between these fascial layers can be opened by dividing loose areolar tissue. The pelvic autonomic nerves consist of the sympathetic hypogastric nerve and the parasympathetic sacral splanchnic nerve. At the pelvic sidewall these nerves join in the inferior hypogastric plexus. Surgery: We present our surgical technique based on careful dissection under direct vision and describe our approach to abdominoperineal resection in the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position.</b> This position enables en bloc resection of the levator ani muscle with the mesorectum, preventing positive circumferential margins in distal rectal tumor. Conclusion: TME is a difficult and challenging operation. Continuous attention to surgical technique and anatomy is important to keep up the high standards of contemporary rectal surgery.

40|$|Background: The {{pattern of}} {{distribution}} of surgically treated symptomatic prolapsed lumbar and sacral intervertebral discs has been published, though scantily, especially in males. We {{decided to look}} at our own series, compare and contrast ours with some of those published. Materials and Methods: We treated 88 locations of this lesion in 68 males. The clinical features were those of lower back pains, with or without radiation into the lower extremities, sensory loss and paresis of the limbs. There was a case of loss of urinary bladder and ano-rectal control. All lesions were confirmed through cauda-equinograms and treated under general anaesthesia in <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> (MECCA position). The patients were followed up for 3 - 6 months post-operatively. Results: There were 88 locations in 68 males of 21 - 70 years of age, with 29 prolapses occurring during the age range 31 - 40 years, while 54 locations were on the left and 48 at L 4 / 5. The procedures were well tolerated by all patients and there were no post-operative complications. Conclusion: This lesion in our series occurred mostly on the left, at the L 4 / 5 level and peaked at 31 - 40 years age range.

40|$|Objectives. Achieving a {{comprehensive}} view of gastric mucosa {{has been a}} challenge for magnetic-guided capsule endoscopy (MGCE) for years. This study works on optimizing the performance of MGCE by changing the conventional positions to the five body positions. Methods. Sixty patients {{were enrolled in the}} study and underwent MGCE. All patients were asked to adopt five body positions (left lateral, supine, right lateral, knee-chest, and sitting). In each position, the ability to visualize the six gastric landmarks (cardia, fundus, body, angulus, antrum, and pylorus) was assessed. Rates of complete visualization were calculated for different position combinations. Results. Supine position was the best for cardia and body visualization (91. 7 % and 86. 7 %, resp., p< 0. 001). Left lateral position was the best for fundus visualization (91. 7 %, p< 0. 001). <b>Knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> was the best for angulus observation (80. 0 %, p< 0. 001). Right lateral and sitting positions were the best for antrum observation (88. 3 % and 90. 0 %, resp., p< 0. 001). Right lateral position was the best for pylorus observation (81. 7 %, p< 0. 001). The supine + right lateral + knee-chest combination achieved better angulus visualization than conventional 3 -position combination (93. 3 % versus 63. 3 %, p< 0. 001). Five-position combination significantly improved the comprehensive gastric landmark visualization (93. 3 %, p< 0. 001). Conclusion. Compared with 3 -position combination, 5 -position combination should be adopted for gastric mucosal visualization by MGCE...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:Anal condylomata acuminata was a {{well-known}} disease {{in ancient times}} {{but in recent years}} there has been a rapidly increasing number of people who suffer from this disease. The main cause of this disease is infection of human papilloma virus (HPV) which occurs through sexual contact. Currently there are three different ways to treat anal condylomata. Small changes of anal condylomata can be treated with local therapeutic agents, but the best results of treatment of extensive changes are obtained by surgical techniques. Material/Methods:The study group consisted of 30 patients with diagnosed extensive anal condylomata who underwent surgery in Mikolaj Pirogow High Specialized Hospital in Lodz. The survey was conducted from 2007 to 2011. Patients had been directed to the surgical ward by general surgeons and practitioners, proctologists and urologists. The diagnosis was made after proctological assessment in the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position.</b> Results:All patients underwent surgery and had complete macroscopic electroexcision of anal condylomata. In the research group there was no mortality. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 (13. 3 � 20 patients – postoperative bleeding. Strong pain was present in 14 (46. 7 � 20 patients but only in the postoperative period. During postoperative follow-up there was no observed infection in the anal region or recurrence of disease. In the operated group there were no observed cosmetic deformations of the anus and/or the anal canal, narrow anal canal or functional fecal incontinence symptoms. Conclusions:Surgical treatment of anal condylomata is an effective and safe method for the patient. In our research there were no serious postoperative complications or recurrence of the disease during the follow-up period...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives : Few {{studies have}} {{explored}} the hormonal triggers for masturbation in infants and young children. Thus, we aimed {{to study the}} sex hormones and clinical profiles of masturbating infants and young children. Methods : This case-control study involved infants and young children who masturbate and were referred to three pediatric neurology clinics between September 2004 and 2006 (n= 13), and a similar control group. All children underwent basic laboratory investigations prior to referral. Other tests included electroencephalography (n= 8) and brain neuroimaging (n= 9). We measured dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17 -hydroxyprogesterone, free testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and androstenedione in all participants. Result : The median age at the first incident was 19. 5 months (range, 4 - 36 months); the median masturbation frequency, 4 times/day; and the median duration of each event, 3. 9 min. The subjects masturbated in both prone (n= 10) and supine positions (n= 3); two subjects used the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position.</b> All subjects showed facial flushing; 6, friction between the thighs; 5, sweating; 9, sleeping after the event; and 12, disturbance on interruption. EEG was abnormal in one of eight subjects tested, and neuroimages were normal in all of nine subjects examined. The case and control groups had comparable levels of all sex hormones, except estradiol, which showed significantly lower levels in the case group (P =. 02). Conclusion : Masturbation in children seems {{to be associated with}} reduced estradiol levels, but not with other sex hormones. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings...|$|E
40|$|Objective and Background: There {{are various}} {{postulated}} possible causes of surgically symptomatic prolapsed intervertebral discs in the lumbar and sacral regions. They may be acting singularly or collectively. Yet, these factors {{have not been}} satisfactorily confirmed. Therefore, the continued search for pre-determinants of this lesion, in males, is hereby being encouraged, and, our views are being presented. Method : From 1971 to 2009, eighty eight (88) locations of symptomatic prolapsed intervertebral discs in the lumbar and sacral regions in 68 males were treated by us in Basel (Switzerland) : 67, in Imo and Ebonyi States (Nigeria) : 1 and none in Jamaica (West Indies). The clinical features were those of lower back pains, with or without radiation into the lower extremities, sensory loss and paresis of the limbs. There {{was a case of}} loss of urinary bladder and ano-rectal control. All lesions were confirmed through cauda-equinograms and treated under general anaesthsia in <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> (MECCA position). The patients were followed for 3 to 6 months postoperatively. Results: In Basel (Caucasian population only), there were 84 locations in 67 patients, 4 locations in 1 patient in Imo and Ebonyi States (African population only) and none in Jamaica (mixed population). Their ages ranged from 23 to 70 years in Basel and the only patient in Nigeria was 67 years old. The patients all tolerated the procedures very well and there were no complications postoperatively. Conclusion: We found surgically treated symptomatic prolapsed lumbar and sacral intervertebral discs in males to have occurred more in Basel, Switzerland than in Imo and Ebonyi States of Nigeria and/or Jamaica, West Indies...|$|E
40|$|CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH 16 th International Congress, Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons(SLS), San Francisco, USA, September 2007. It is an honour to {{be asked}} to be the Honorary Chairman for the 16 th SLS Congress, and I {{strongly}} feel that our SLS is the leader of multi-disciplinary endoscopic surgery worldwide. In fact endoscopic surgery is practically feasible and offers many advantages including better exposure of the operation field, magnification and adequate panoramic view, and operating very close to the affected tissue 1. During {{the latter part of the}} 20 th Century, endoscopy revolutionised surgical practice so much that clinicians who do not practice advanced endoscopic techniques would be losing an important dimension of contemporary surgical practice 2. With the early introduction of endoscopy in surgical disciplines, it was not uncommon to perform diagnostic endoscopy to diagnose a pathology; followed by a laparotomy to affect definitive treatment 3, 4. “Conversion” to laparotomy has known complications 5. While conventional surgery will continue to be a part, albeit diminishing, in professional training programs 6, 7, endoscopy is the “gold standard” approach to manage the majority of surgical problems both in elective and emergency situations 8 - 15. This immeasurable improvement has eventuated as a result of continuous upgrading of endoscopic surgical skills and knowledge, technological advances at diagnostic and operative spheres, improved instrumentation and better interdisciplinary co-operation between active clinicians practicing relevant fields of endoscopic surgery 16 - 21 and hence the valuable role played by multi-disciplinary endoscopic societies notably Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons. As the future is a continuum of the past and present and without ideas there is nothing; without ideas and without innovation there is nothing to test 22. It may be relevant to consider some historical aspects of endoscopy. As a gynaecologist, I shall discuss the rocky paths of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. For centuries, physicians aspired to inspect different body cavities by the use of visual aid 23. In Laparoscopy Many innovations took place in the world of gynaecological endoscopy, and one has to mention with admiration the creative work of the leading pioneers. Attempts at visualising the contents of the abdominal/pelvic cavity were made approximately 1000 years ago as reported by the Arabian physician, Abukasim (936 – 1013 AD) 24. However, the details of this apparently primitive attempt were not clear. In 1901, Kelling made the first attempt to inspect the peritoneal cavity with insufflation. He called it “Koeliskopie”. He reported the abdominal organs were much smaller than normal. That was because he created a very high pneumoperitoneum pressure of 50 - 60 mm Hg and once even 100 mm Hg. He employed air to distend the peritoneum 25. In 1910, Jacobaeus from Stockholm coined the term laparoscopy. He did not use pneumoperitoneum as most of his patients had ascites 26. In 1927, Korbsch suggested that the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) instead of air to a pressure less than 15 cm H 2 O. Unlike air which contains about 79 % nitrogen, CO 2 is readily absorbed within the body 27. In 1937, Ruddock published his series of 2500 laparoscopic sterilisation. He designed his own telescope, trocar, and pneumoperitoneum needle 28. His contemporary, Hope, suggested the use of laparoscopy in the evaluation of ectopic pregnancies 29. In 1944, Decker and Cherry introduced culdoscopy to visualise abdominal contents. It was performed with the patient under local anaesthesia and in the <b>knee-chest</b> <b>position</b> 30. Culdoscopy dominated pelvic endoscopy in the United States for over 20 years. Concerned about the number of unnecessary laparotomies, the late British gynaecologist, Steptoe (1913 – 1988), the father of IVF (in-vitro fertilisation), travelled to Boston and New York, USA, in 1958, to learn about culdoscopy. Unfortunately, Steptoe left America disappointed with the practical value of culdoscopy 31. In 1963, Semm, a German gynaecologist from Kiel University, developed the automatic insufflator “CO 2 - Pneu” that allowed more complex laparoscopic procedures to be performed. In 1979, Semm perfected his apparatus, creating an electronic insufflator; fully monitored pneumoperitoneum became possible 32. Semm was one of the world’s leaders of gynaecological endoscopy. However, the path was not all easy for him; but he overcame by persistence. In the seventies, his colleagues suggested only a person with brain damage would perform laparoscopic surgery, and they persuaded Semm to have a brain scan 33 ! In 1983, Semm reported the first laparoscopic appendicectomy 34. The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology rejected Semm’s paper on laparoscopic appendicectomy. One of the reviewers questioned the ethical aspect of this procedure 34 ! In 1985, Muhe of Boblingen, Germany, performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The German Surgical Society rejected Muhe in 1986 after he reported his pioneer operation, and the society considered the operation to be unethical. As he was ahead of his time, he received their highest award in 1992 35. In 1989, Harry Reich of Pennsylvania, USA, reported the first laparoscopic hysterectomy, a procedure that had new concepts and dimensions 36, 37 -; but, again, was not well received in its infancy especially by those physicians who could not perform the operation. And we have just heard the story of struggle of our good friend Professor Hary Hasson and his excellent technique of Open Laparoscopy 38 and many other patents that have been proudly adopted and practiced worldwide by many high profile Endoscopic Surgeons. The invention of a rod lens optical system by Hopkins in 1959 and the addition of fibre-optic light transmission by Storz in 1960 have been vital for modern endoscopy. Similarly, an important milestone in laparoscopy was the development of a video computer chip in 1987; that allowed magnification and projection of images onto television screens 39 - 42. In 1987,C. Nezhat published a much awaited report about the use of videolaparoscopy in Advanced Gynaecological Endoscopic Surgery. This was an important milestone in the development and successful practice of not only minimally- invasive gynaecological operations, but, also, many other disciplines and sub-specialities of surgery 42, 43. The techniques of video laparoscopic surgery became integrated into general and specialised surgery alike, and were vital for purposes of training, teaching and involving all operating theatre personnel in the following of surgical procedures. In Hysteroscopy Similar to laparoscopy, the modern operative hysteroscope evolved through many stages of development. The uterine cavity, like any other cavity in the body, is empty and dark and is a potential (not a real) cavity. In 1807, Bozini described a vase-shaped lantern made of tin and covered with leather to examine the uterine cavity. Interestingly, he declared that “adhesions, polyps and tumours will be operated upon under direct vision” 44. In 1869, Pantaleoni wrote on “endoscopic examination of the cavity of the womb” in which he stated that invention of the ophthalmoscope and laryngoscope led to the invention of the endoscope 45. The problem was how to throw sufficient light into an internal dark cavity. However, later on in the nineteenth century, Dr Cruise of Dublin introduced a light and prevented the instrument from becoming heated by light 46. In 1908, David, Paris University, wrote “sheaths and hysteroscopes of different sizes were made to meet anatomic variations in size, length and degree of cervical dilatation” 47. After these early contributions, illumination systems changed from candle-light and reflected light and were replaced by the electric bulb and distal lighting, proximal lighting, halogen, and xenon light systems and, most recently, fibre-optic systems 48. The initial attempts led to a long process of continuous improvement that allowed the gynaecological surgeon to perform complicated hysteroscopic and laparoscopic procedures without resort to laparotomy. Recent advances in fibre-optic technology have been the cornerstone of adequate visualisation of the operation field, which is the essential prerequisite of any operative procedure anywhere in the body 49 - 51. In essence, clinicians learned from their mistakes as well as their colleagues in different specialities of medicine. They all had great obstacles to overcome; nevertheless, they rose to the challenge and proved that success is an ongoing journey. At this point in time, clinicians and patients are cashing in on the benefits of the work of our predecessors. However, today’s challenges are by no means simple. Training and quality assurance are important issues 52 - 54. The surgeon must pass through a learning curve to acquire and maintain new skills and special expertise, and to avoid, recognise and manage complications of advanced endoscopic surgery 55. In fact, the learning process has to be closely tied with a vigorous system of quality assurance. A balance has to be struck between the ethical obligations to benefit patients while avoiding harm, and the professional expectation of continued learning, and this has to be maintained and expanded as long as surgical practice continues so that surgeons will be able to successfully follow the ever moving horizon of endoscopic surgery. The development and continuous progression of endoscopic surgery is a cumulative effort of internists, gynaecologists, urologists and surgeons alike. Hence, multi-disciplinary societies of minimally invasive surgery, notably the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgery, play a leading role in the 21 st Century.
