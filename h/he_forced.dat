5|$|Aged 18, Dot married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock). The {{following}} year, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> {{her to have}} an abortion; {{threatening to}} leave her if she did not, but left anyway {{because it was a}} bigamous marriage. While Dot was giving birth to their son, Nick (John Altman), Charlie {{was having an affair with}} her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, but was not an affectionate mother.|$|E

The match {{duration}} was twelve minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Angle {{was forced to}} sit out of the match for five minutes, giving The Unlikely Alliance the three on two advantage.

He did not play {{football}} until he attended James Logan High School in Union City, California. He was inducted into the James Logan High School Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010. He played college football with the Washington State Cougars. In his senior year, he missed all but two games due to a broken thumb.

5|$|Although born in England, Boucaud qualifies to {{play for}} Trinidad and Tobago through his parents, with his father born in Port of Spain and his mother born in Princes Town. Aged 19, his {{international}} debut came as a 61st-minute substitute in a 2–0 friendly victory over Iraq at the Hawthorns on 23 May 2004. A week later, he played in a 4–1 away defeat against Scotland on 30 May 2004, in which <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> goalkeeper Craig Gordon into making a save from a powerful shot.

He played in three 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers for Trinidad, playing against Saint Kitts and Nevis once and Mexico twice.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev was {{adept at}} the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He {{was a team}} player and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing to hear their opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until {{shortly before his death}} in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s to his death in 1982.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{increasingly}} dire military outlook, Nasjonal Samling's {{position at the}} head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the Reichskommissariat, remained unassailable. Nevertheless, the Germans exerted increasing control over law and order in Norway. Following deportation of the Jews, Germany deported Norwegian officers and finally attempted to deport students from the University of Oslo. Even Hitler was incensed by the scale of the arrests. Quisling became entangled in a similar debacle in early 1944 when <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> compulsory military service on elements of the Hird, causing a number of members to resign to avoid being drafted.|$|E
5|$|In 1487, Sigismund {{arranged}} {{the marriage of}} Frederick's daughter Kunigunde to duke Albert IV of Bavaria against her father's will, and he also signed away some of his territories in Tyrol and Further Austria to Albert IV. Frederick intervened by force: he founded the Swabian League in 1488, an alliance of the Swabian cities, the Swabian knights of the League of St. George's Shield and the counts of Württemberg and Tyrol and Vorarlberg. With their help, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> the Wittelsbach house to return the territories signed over by Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|In England, the Great Revolt against Henry's rule {{involved}} {{a coalition of}} rebel barons, bolstered by support from the King of Scotland and European allies. William the Lion pushed south from Scotland in 1173 and Bowes Castle was damaged in the raids; work {{was carried out in}} anticipation of further attacks the following year, including repairs to the chamber, gates and the construction of bulwarks around the keep. The next year William of Scotland directly besieged the castle, but was <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> to retreat after the arrival of a relief force led by Henry's illegitimate son Geoffrey, then the Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Sargsyan {{tightened}} {{his grip on}} the Armed Forces, establishing himself as a virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the Republican Party and joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the de facto decision-maker in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Loyalties in Somerset {{were divided}} {{at the start}} of the First English Civil War; many of the {{prominent}} landowners and those living in the countryside favoured King Charles I, but most of the towns, including Taunton, were Parliamentarian, predominantly due to their Puritan beliefs. By August 1642, the town was held by a small Parliamentarian force. In June the following year, Sir Ralph Hopton led his Royalist army, consisting of eighteen regiments equally split between foot and cavalry, out of Cornwall and into Somerset. <b>He</b> <b>forced</b> the surrender of Taunton to the King without engaging in battle, and established a garrison in Taunton Castle.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1993, Wallace's {{longtime}} girlfriend {{gave birth}} to his first child, T'yanna. Wallace had split with the girlfriend for some time before T'yanna's birth. Wallace wanted his daughter to complete her education, despite being {{a high school dropout}} himself. Wallace said that if his mother had promised him what he promised his daughter, everything she wanted, Wallace would have been not only a graduate but also {{at the top of his}} class. He continued selling drugs after the birth to support his daughter financially. Once Combs discovered this, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> Wallace to quit.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{holding on}} to his {{possessions}} in Asia Minor, Michael chose to expand the Empire, gaining only short-term success. To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the peasantry hated Michael and Constantinople. The efforts of Andronikos II and later his grandson Andronikos III marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring {{the glory of the}} Empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II would often backfire, with the Catalan Company ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The first {{resistance}} {{was met by}} Birks and a corporal, taking two machine-gun positions as another group of officers rushed a strong post. They were attacked with bombs, and the corporal was seriously wounded. Birks continued on alone. Reaching {{the rear of the}} pillbox, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> the occupants to surrender. Birks then led an attack a series of dugouts and pillboxes on the edge of Glencorse Wood, and fought against machine gun and bombs. He also assisted in the reorganisation and consolidation of Australian men who had drifted away from their unit.|$|E
5|$|Then Germanicus ordered Caius Silius {{to march}} against the Chatti with a mixed force of 3,000 cavalry and 33,000 {{infantry}} and lay waste of their territory, while he himself, {{with a larger}} army, invaded the Marsi {{for the third time}} and devastated their land. <b>He</b> <b>forced</b> Mallovendus, the defeated leader of the Marsi, to reveal the location of another of the three legion's eagles lost in AD 9. Immediately Germanicus despatched troops to recover it. The Romans advanced into the country, defeating any foe they encountered.|$|E

5|$|According to the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, he {{had secured}} the {{cooperation}} of Dublin, and perhaps gained the kingship of the town itself, through a stipend of 4,000 cows. In consequence, Dubliners formed part of Ua Conchobair's forces when he marched to Drogheda and Leinster, where <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> the submissions of the kings of Airgialla and Leinster respectively. In fact, Dublin appears to have formed {{a key part of}} Ua Conchobair's arsenal, and it is apparent that Mac Murchada was doomed without the support of this coastal-kingdom. Certainly, the twelfth–thirteenth-century La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande relates that Ascall ("MacTurkyl de Diveline") had abandoned his former overlord, and the eleventh–fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen specify that Mac Murchada was only expulsed from Ireland after the Leinstermen and Dubliners had turned against him. Although Ua Conchobair appears to have allowed Mac Murchada to retain his patrimonial lordship of Uí Chennselaig, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that the Leinstermen and Dubliners assisted Tigernán Ua Ruairc, King of Bréifne (died 1172) in forcing Mac Murchada from this final vestige of authority and into exile.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a handicap match- a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted a worm on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the guillotine choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> her to submit with this move.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} Nakhichevan {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its {{geographic}} position, it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. <b>He</b> <b>forced</b> some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan {{to leave their homes}} and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E
