2500|$|On the {{question}} of Sir Samuel Griffith's English translation of Dante Alighieri which had received numerous unflattering reviews, {{it was reported that}} when Griffith presented a copy to Salomons, the latter asked Griffith to autograph the fly leaf, explaining that [...] "I should not like anyone to think that I had borrowed the book, even less should I like anyone to think that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> it". Salomons was a supporter of religion being a moderator of human behaviour. [...] He endowed a local public school on the basis that religion was taught as a subject and was upset when it was not. [...] In an address on Australian Federation, he said that having an [...] "education without religion is like putting a sword into the hands of a savage".|$|E
2500|$|Our {{mechanic}} {{and general}} runner was David Nice, an Englishman from Colchester, {{who was not}} unlike me in a way, for his nose appeared to be, profile view anyway, very similar to mine (poor lad!) and I hit on the splendid idea of putting him out on the track in my place during the neutralised period. Tracksuited, a scarf over {{the lower part of}} his face and a Russian hat that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> completed the disguise. He was me to anyone giving a cursory glance at the figures plodding round the track. The get-up was quite in order for it became very cold there at night as they used to turn off all the heating. Everything went well for the first night of the wheeze and I congratulated myself on the plan. It could not go on [...] for ever, though, worse luck, for on the very next night the game was up. Dave was trundling round wrapped up to the eyebrows as before when, horrors upon horrors, the track manager, who often rode a bike round himself during the quiet time, started to talk to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> a cinematograph building," [...] said James. [...] "We are {{negotiating}} for the machinery now: the dynamo and so on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{interrupt}} you," [...] I said. [...] "My friend, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{not had a}} moment's respite from canvassers this day. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> a sewing-machine which I did not want; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> a map which is mistaken in all its details; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> a clock which will not go; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> a moth poison which the moths prefer to any other beverage; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> no end of useless inventions, and now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had enough of this foolishness. <b>I</b> would not <b>have</b> one of your echoes if you were even {{to give it to}} me. I would not let it stay on the place. I always hate a man that tries to sell me echoes. You see this gun? Now take your collection and move on; let us not have bloodshed." ...|$|R
60|$|Now you are mine, to-night at last I say it; You're a dove <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> for sacrifice, And to-night I slay it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> Sainte-Beuve's Chateaubriand and am immensely {{delighted with}} the critic. Chateaubriand is more antipathetic to me {{than anyone else in}} the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost wish," [...] he declared, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> {{that old}} swindler's business. It wouldn't have cost me a tenth {{part of what}} I am worth." ...|$|E
60|$|This act I {{regarded}} as another evidence of good breeding. He {{was not a}} beggar, and, therefore, could not have spent his childhood with the man from whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> him.|$|E
60|$|She was {{so pleased}} that I forgot {{absolutely}} my disgust {{of a moment}} before. I forgot that she had raised her price two hundred pounds a year and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> her at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm living here, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> no ranche. I'm only a hired man on {{somebody}} else's ranche, {{to look after}} the cattle." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ormsgill laughed. [...] "I {{want them}} to-morrow. There {{is a good}} deal to do. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the boys Domingo stole to trace when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> the woman back from Herrero." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too late!" [...] Guest declared. [...] "I {{will tell}} you some news. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken over the lease of this restaurant! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> the good-will and effects. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the papers in my pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|But, my dear fellow, this is preposterous. Why, {{these are}} the very things <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> for you. If you won't take any of these, I shall {{have to give you}} factory cotton and cordwood.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> a {{considerable}} quantity of sables, black fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs {{that are very}} rich; I say, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> them in that city for exchange {{for some of the}} goods brought from China; in particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part here; and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a much better price than I could have done at Louden; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and whose business, more particularly than mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the traffic we made here.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought he}} needn't {{have asked me}} if I had my ticket when he knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> it. But perhaps he thought I had lost it by this time. He was a very {{particular}} little man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "a slave--my slave whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> {{at a great}} price. Well, {{why should}} I let you go? I am minded to keep you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This gentleman and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> the wreck," [...] I explained; [...] "we wish to {{get some}} information, {{and it is very}} {{annoying}} to find the men all gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There; {{you see it}} says 'for a consideration.' That means <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> it of you {{and paid}} you for it. Here's a dollar for you. Now you sign it." ...|$|R
60|$|She'd the brooch <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> And the {{necklace}} and sash on, And her heart, as I thought, Was alive to my passion; And she'd done up {{her hair in}} the style that the Empress had brought into fashion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Happy! I do {{not know}} that my state of bliss here is very great. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> your shares, as you call them, and paid money for them, I don't see why my {{happiness}} need stand in the way." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{slipped away}} at this point, {{suddenly}} remembering {{that it was}} time to take a dose of magic seed. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> it from Billy Robinson three days before in school. Billy had assured me that it would make me grow fast.|$|E
6000|$|... "A poor investment!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "We shall see. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in America {{for many}} years, my nephew and I here, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{made a little}} money. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> the place and it must pay!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{there is}} nothing;--nothing at all! I've bought some {{property}} and {{have paid for}} it; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> some, and <b>have</b> not yet paid for it. There's no fraud in that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And when I {{come upon}} it, I shall find that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> a {{crumbling}} pile of ruined masonry, unfit to house {{a family of}} foxes," [...] replied the old woman peevishly.|$|R
6000|$|... "There were a dozen pictures," [...] {{she told}} me, [...] "but they were unframed, and nobody wanted them. Some of them sold {{for as much}} as ten francs, but mostly they went for five or six. Just think, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> them I should be a rich woman now." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{sudden and}} {{unreasonable}} disgust {{for the character}} which had given me so much entertainment succeeded to my past delight. I felt, moreover, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> {{the right to use}} some frankness with the veteran, and I said to him: [...] "Do you know now, I shouldn't care if I never saw you again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father cut {{a hole in}} one of the oranges that I {{sent down}} to mother, and then she {{squeezed}} the juice of it out into her mouth. She said afterwards that I could not conceive how much it refreshed her. I don't think she could conceive how glad I was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> it for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said I, as I {{took her}} by the hand, [...] "we are going to ride. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not hired a carriage. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> one. Do you see this horse? He is ours--our own horse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} knight, [...] "I will ask you this: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> the patent rights in your kingdom for Schneider's celebrated monkey wrench, and I want {{a letter from}} you {{endorsing}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can give}} your ladyship twenty-two pounds," [...] said Harry, {{blushing}} very red: [...] "I have but forty-four left till I get my Virginian remittances. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> horses and clothes, and been very extravagant, aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{got to know}} {{it sooner}} or later, so {{you might as well}} know it now," [...] he said in as steady a voice as he could command. [...] "Do you {{remember}} that I wrote to you about sixty-four thousand dollars' worth of bonds that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> for dad in place of some securities that he possessed?" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} home, Dumps displayed an {{evidence of}} good breeding, which {{convinced me that}} he could not have spent all his puppyhood in company with the man from whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> him. He wiped his feet on the door-mat with great vigour before entering my house, and also refused to pass in until I led the way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sordid slave!" [...] said Roland Graeme, [...] "dost thou think I {{would have}} {{accepted}} a boon from {{one who was}} giving me over a prey to detraction and to ruin, at the instigation of a canting priest and a meddling serving-woman? The bread that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>bought</b> with such an alms would have choked me at the first mouthful." ...|$|E
60|$|After <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> {{things at}} a shop I am quite unfit for social intercourse. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to go home}} and fume. There was a time when Euphemia would come and discuss my {{purchase}} with a certain levity, but on one occasion....|$|R
6000|$|... "They have arms, of course, {{and such}} armour as they need; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> four {{serviceable}} horses for their use, {{together with a}} horse to carry your baggage, but which will serve for your body servant.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> a {{meerschaum}} out {{of local}} sentiment, and am now very low and {{nervous about the}} bargain, having paid dearer than I should in England, and got a worse article, if I can form a judgment.|$|R
