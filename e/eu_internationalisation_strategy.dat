The Region of Zealand has put in place an International Strategy in which it envisages to increase internationalisation and cooperation at a European level.

The article states that the rise of competitive internationalisation among countries with similar location conditions, in particular within the European Union and between the European Union and the United States, over the 1990 s is most salient. Competitive internationalisation is driven by politically motivated Regional Integration Agreements (RIAs), triggering restructuring related intra-regional FDI and 'locational tournaments' between regions in the attraction of inward FDI.

The literature review combines three sets of literature on: the internationalisation of HE, management of HE institutions and strategic management.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> of service firms in sectors where markets become {{increasingly}} globalised while resource environments still remain distinctively shaped by national institutions. Design/methodology/approach – A theoretical framework is proposed {{that suggests that}} the more firms expand their business activities across borders by building up offices abroad or merging with firms from other countries, {{the more likely they}} are to embrace recombinant strategies to blend elements of different societal legacies. Subsequently, a comparative case study of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies,</b> governance modes and organisational forms of European and US law firms is presented to illustrate the value of the framework, followed by the analysis of a novel data set on multi-jurisdictional qualifications of partners in these international law firms.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} university <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> to determine what form they should take if they are to successfully achieve their intended outcomes. The study makes several contributions, filling gaps in the literature on the internationalisation of Higher Education (HE) and university management. The study synthesises ideas and concepts derived from three separate literatures: HE management; internationalisation of HE and strategic management to create a list of pre-requisite organisational qualities needed for the successful internationalisation of HE institutions. Empirical evidence is then gathered from four case studies based on 25 interviews of academics, managers and student representatives, supplemented by relevant secondary data. The research evidence suggests that the list of suggested pre-requisite organisational qualities may well be a useful indicator of the strength of university <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies.</b> Based on the evidence of the sample universities, the study finds that the main reason for a lack of progress towards the internationalisation of HE in the UK is not the lack of senior level interest or enthusiasm for the concept of internationalisation but weaknesses in institutional management. It appears that many universities lack the managerial skills and knowledge needed to implement and operationalise their <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies.</b> Those organisations that are more successful are those with more visible and committed leadership of the internationalisation agenda, coupled with the skills and ability to implement strategy. The study also identifies that HE internationalisation is shaped, communicated and understood in very different ways by stakeholders in different universities and at times even by stakeholders within the same organisation. As a result it is difficult to judge the success of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> because there is little shared understanding of what the concept entails. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> {{of companies}} in a globalising service industry, the telecommunications industry. Differences in the internationalisation processes between manufacturing and service companies, and companies in network industries in particular, are analysed. The telecommunication industry’s special characteristics are discussed. Special {{challenges faced by}} companies in small and open economies (SMOPECs) in their internationalisation are also covered. Broad research questions, and a conceptual framework and specific research propositions are presented. The methodology, a multi-case study, and research procedure are introduced, and the research findings are reported, analysed and discussed. During the last decade there has been continuous debate on how well the traditional internationalisation (process) theories are able to explain the internationalisation of service companies. In addition, several researchers {{have argued that the}} facts that service sectors are heterogeneous and have different characteristics causes remarkable variations in the internationalisation processes of different service sectors. The conceptual framework developed in this study to analyse the <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> of the case companies, national telecommunication companies (telcos) from SMOPECs, is based on the earlier research in the areas of international business and strategic management. The framework consists of two main parts, <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> and factors influencing these <b>strategies.</b> The four <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> included in the framework are product strategy, operation strategy, market strategy and organisation strategy. The factors influencing <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> have been divided into five main groups: global factors, industry specific factors, home country specific factors, company specific factors and host country specific factors. This cross-border multi-case study includes four case companies: Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel) from Singapore, Sonera Oyj (Sonera) from Finland, Telia AB (publ) (Telia) from Sweden, and Telstra Corporation Limited (Telstra) from Australia. The key findings of the study demonstrate that although in some areas the case study companies followed processes suggested by traditional internationalisation (process) theories there were also significant deviations. These deviations are most obvious when analysing market strategies. The findings present several factors behind these deviations. The findings mostly support earlier research on service industries, although there are distinctive characteristics which apply only to the telecommunications industry, or more generally, to network industries. The findings also demonstrate that the special challenges that companies from SMOPECs face in their internationalisation, influence their <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies.</b> Interestingly, in addition to these special challenges, the findings suggest that there are areas where these types of companies may have a competitive advantage in relation to their internationalisation. The conceptual framework developed in this study helps to understand the internationalisation process in the telco industry. The framework integrates findings from both international business and strategic management research, recognising the benefits of more generalisable internationalisation models originating from economic and marketing theories, but taking into account environmental circumstances and the influence of managerial actions, emphasised more in strategic management theories. That is, more contingency approach is taken than in some traditional internationalisation models. The conceptual framework and the findings contribute to the existing research on the internationalisation of services particularly, and to international business and strategic management research more generally.

40|$|Internationalisation is at {{the centre}} of debate {{on the future of}} higher {{education}} as an area of important strategic and organisational activity in the rapidly changing global and local landscapes within the knowledge-based economy. Internationalisation encompasses multiple dimensions of universities' strategies, and there is limited understanding on how these different dimensions influence universities' activities in a holistic way. Drawing on a case study of the University of Nottingham with its campuses in the UK, Malaysia and China, this paper examines the changing scope of its <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies</b> and how these strategies have affected four key institutional activities, namely, student learning, staff mobility, quality assurance, and community engagement. The study unpacks the concept of internationalisation through the lenses of stakeholder relationships and leadership theory and illustrates challenges of internationalisation as perceived by the university leaders and key stakeholders. Questions are raised about the sustainability of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategies,</b> in particular with regard to enhancing the quality of the student learning experiences in local contexts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we econometrically {{investigate}} the factors determining {{the choice of}} a specific <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategy.</b> We distinguish four strategies, ranging from “serving foreign markets through exports only” up to “exporting and locating abroad several business functions such as distribution, production and R & D”. These strategies are evaluated against the reference category “domestic sales only” (multinomial logit model). The analysis, to a large extent, confirms Dunning’s well-known OLI paradigm. O-advantages {{turn out to be the}} main drivers of internationalisation, irrespective of firm size and <b>internationalisation</b> <b>strategy.</b> However, the knowledge-base on which O-advantages of smaller firms rests is more narrow than that of large companies. Whereas the former rely, in relative terms, primarily on capabilities related to incremental innovations, the latter draw to a higher extent on assets enabling them to be competitive in terms of far-reaching innovations. L-advantages (wages, regulatory framework, etc.) primarily are relevant in case of small firms; but even for this size class, O-advantages are dominant. Copyright Springer 2005...|$|R

High levels of resource transferability lead to contracting partnerships or wholly owned foreign enterprises. Low levels led to importing or joint ventures.
