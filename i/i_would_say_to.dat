500|$|Following the {{disruption}} {{caused by a}} protestor in the previous year's race, Royal Marines provided support to the security arrangements surrounding the race. Race director David Searle urged nobody to repeat {{the disruption}} of 2012, saying [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> anybody thinking of doing that, is that it's unbelievably dangerous ... We had practised emergency stops and it worked". The manner of any potential restart was modified to allow the race re-commence as soon as practicable. The Metropolitan Police had made contact with the protestor, Trenton Oldfield, to assist him making a more peaceful protest should he wish to do so, but he declined the offer and {{did not attend the}} race in any capacity.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of news to me. Here's what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".|$|E
2500|$|At a press conference, Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard of the VPD {{apologized to}} the victims' families, saying [...] "I wish {{from the bottom of}} my heart that we would have caught him sooner. I wish that, the several {{agencies}} involved, that we could have done better in so many ways. I wish that all the mistakes that were made, we could undo. And I wish that more lives would have been saved. So on my behalf and behalf of the Vancouver Police Department and all the men and women that worked on this investigation, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the families how sorry we all are for your losses and because we did not catch this monster sooner." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the federal}} parliament, Morris topped off his officials' scepticism {{with his own}} brand of spleen, perhaps tinted by his long union {{experience}} in the transport industry. On 12 September 1984, answering a Question without Notice in the House of Representatives, he described the proposal as grandiose, likening it to another proposal to build a canal through the centre of Australia. He said [...] "I will not so recommend to the Government that resources should be allocated to even do a study on it." [...] As a parting shot, he observed that [...] "if, as has been suggested by its proponents ... {{the private sector is}} interested in it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Dr Wild that he should take the proposal back to the private sector ... and let them put it forward and fund it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trump recalls {{some of his}} romantic exploits, [...] "Beautiful, famous, successful, married — I’ve {{had them}} all, secretly, the world’s biggest names." [...] Trump {{reflects}} on how such exploits made him feel at the time, [...] "Oftentimes when I was sleeping {{with one of the}} top women in the world <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> myself, thinking about me as a boy from Queens, 'Can you believe what I am getting?'" [...] He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed, [...] "The women I have dated over the years could have any man they want; they are the top models and most beautiful women in the world. I have been able to date (screw) them all because I have something that many men do not have. I don’t know what it is but women have always liked it." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E

5000|$|Many {{have since}} agreed with Friedman and Schwartz's theory, {{including}} Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, who said: Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my {{status as an}} official representative of the Federal Reserve. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.|$|R

5000|$|Ripley {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed for being [...] "both a likable character and a cold-blooded killer". Sam Jordison of The Guardian wrote, [...] "It is near impossible, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> not <b>to</b> root for Tom Ripley. Not to like him. Not, on some level, to {{want him to}} win.

6000|$|I was {{constantly}} troubled about philosophic questions. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> my fellow {{students at the}} Art school, [...] "poetry and sculpture exist to keep our passions alive;" [...] and somebody would say, [...] "we {{would be much better}} without our passions." [...] Or I would have a week's anxiety over the problem: do the arts make us happier, or more sensitive and therefore more unhappy. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Hughes or Sheppard, [...] "if I cannot be certain they make us happier I will never write again." [...] If I spoke of these things to Dowden he would put the question away with good-humoured irony: he seemed to condescend to everybody and everything and was now my sage. I was about to learn that if a man is to write lyric poetry he must be shaped by nature and art to some one out of half-a-dozen traditional poses, and be lover or saint, sage or sensualist, or mere mocker of all life; and that none but that stroke of luckless luck can open before him the accumulated expression of the world. And this thought before it could be knowledge was an instinct.|$|E
