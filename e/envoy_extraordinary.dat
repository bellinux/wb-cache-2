5|$|In 1933, MacMurray {{returned}} to the foreign service. On September 9 of that year, he was appointed <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—a position he held until 1936. From 1936 to 1941, MacMurray served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary in Turkey. He {{returned to}} Washington in 1942 {{and worked as a}} special assistant to the Secretary of State until his retirement in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, {{he got the}} chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch {{government}} appointed him <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E

5|$|Kruger's final {{administration}} was, Meintjes suggests, {{the strongest}} {{in the history}} of the republic. He had the former Free State President FW Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.|$|E
5|$|Austria {{is closely}} linked to the fate of {{prominent}} Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov. He arrived in Vienna in 1833 as an adviser to the embassy, and, from 1854 to 1856, he led the Russian diplomatic mission. Gorchakov became <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian court at the most difficult period for Russia during the Crimean War, during which time he was able to preserve diplomatic relations with Austria and helped to overcome the international isolation of the Russian Empire and reinforced Russia's status as a great power. The Vienna Conference in 1855 was the first presence of Gorchakov in an international forum, and his performance in representing Russia at the Paris Conference of 1856 saw Alexander II appoint him as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 he {{was first}} {{appointed}} consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State. Muller held this position all through the Second Boer War and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902 Muller retired {{to a life of}} travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him <b>envoy</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to Czechoslovakia, where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.|$|E

5|$|Reitz did {{not stay}} a private person for long. A {{conflict}} between the South African Republic legislature and judiciary resulted in the dismissal of the Chief Justice. Reitz then took up an appointment as judge in early 1898 and quickly {{became part of the}} inner circle of the Transvaal administration. At the time the relationship with the British was already rapidly deteriorating and the government of the South African Republic was taking action to reinforce its national and international position. One of the measures taken was to replace State Secretary W.J. Leyds, who had the Dutch nationality, with a South African. Leyds was appointed <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary in Europe to represent the Republic abroad. Reitz took his place as State Secretary in June 1898, after Abraham Fischer had declined.|$|E
5|$|John White Stevenson {{was born}} May 4, 1812, in Richmond, Virginia. He {{was the only}} child of Andrew and Mary Page (White) Stevenson. His mother—the granddaughter of Carter Braxton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence—died during childbirth. Stevenson was sent to live with his {{maternal}} grandparents, John and Judith White, until he was eleven; by then, his father had remarried. His father, a prominent Virginia lawyer, rose to political prominence during Stevenson's childhood. He was elected to Congress, eventually serving as Speaker of the House and was later appointed <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James's (now called the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom) by President Martin Van Buren, where he engendered much controversy by his pro-slavery practices.

25|$|A {{prominent}} Whig, Tayloe supported Henry Clay for President in 1840.

He made many friends among the diplomatic corps, among them the Belgian <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary Comte Auguste Vanderstraeten-Ponthoz, with whom he met in 1843 (the Comte departed in 1844) and kept up a 20-year correspondence.|$|E

One of these experts, a smiling and pale-haired young man who talked to Mr. Ross about the new poetry, arranged to have office-boys go about with trays of water-glasses at ten, twelve, two, and four. Thitherto, the stenographers had wasted {{a great deal of time}} in trotting to the battery of water-coolers, in actually being human and relaxed and gossipy for ten minutes a day. After the visitation of the expert the girls were so efficient that they never for a second stopped their work--except when one of them would explode in hysteria and be hurried off to the rest-room. But no expert was able to keep them from jumping at the chance to marry any one who would condescend to take them out of this efficient atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|McLane {{resigned}} from the Senate in 1829 to serve as <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom. McLane was instructed to inform the English that his appointment signaled {{a break from the}} John Quincy Adams administration, and that issues of dispute under the Adams Administration would no longer be issues in a Jackson administration. His main assignment was to open up trade between the United States and the British West Indies. In this effort he was well received by Lord Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary, and successfully accomplished his mission. During his tenure, his personal secretary was Washington Irving, who was thereafter a close and loyal family friend.|$|E
25|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} Koerner would prevent Spain from entering into the American Civil War {{on the side}} of the Southern slave states. Although Koerner, the <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America (his precise titles as ambassador) managed to accomplish this objective, he was discontented in Spain and asked the president several times for a replacement. An important reason prompting his request was that the stipend for his ambassadorship did not nearly cover the huge financial obligations expected of him at the Spanish court. Koerner had to provide such funds from his private accounts. In 1864, he left the diplomatic service and returned to the United States.|$|E

In June 1884 he became Governor of Malta, where he oversaw significant constitutional and social changes on the island. After he retired in September 1888, the Foreign Office continued to utilise his services and in 1889 he went to Rome as <b>Envoy</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Minister Plenipotentiary to Pope Leo XIII.
