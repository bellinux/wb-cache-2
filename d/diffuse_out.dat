25|$|If the {{external}} partial {{pressure of the}} gas (in the lungs) is then reduced, more gas will <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> than in. This is a condition known as supersaturation. The gas will not necessarily form bubbles in the solvent at this stage, but supersaturation is necessary for bubble growth.|$|E
25|$|Circulatory {{systems are}} absent in some animals, {{including}} flatworms. Their body cavity has no lining or enclosed fluid. Instead a muscular pharynx {{leads to an}} extensively branched digestive system that facilitates direct diffusion of nutrients to all cells. The flatworm's dorso-ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the distance of any cell from the digestive system or {{the exterior of the}} organism. Oxygen can diffuse from the surrounding water into the cells, and carbon dioxide can <b>diffuse</b> <b>out.</b> Consequently, every cell is able to obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.|$|E
25|$|During slow {{freezing}}, {{cells are}} placed in a medium which is cooled below the freezing point using liquid nitrogen. This causes an ice mass to form in the medium. As {{the water in the}} medium freezes, the concentration of the sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant increase. Due to osmosis, the water from the cells enters the medium to keep the concentrations of sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant equal. The water that leaves the cells is eventually frozen, causing more water to <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> of the cell. Eventually, the unfrozen portion—cellular—becomes too viscous for ice crystals to form inside of the cell.|$|E

25|$|Gas remains {{dissolved}} in the tissues until the partial pressure of that {{gas in the}} lungs is reduced sufficiently to cause a concentration gradient with the blood at a lower concentration than the relevant tissues. As the concentration in the blood drops below the concentration in the adjacent tissue, the gas will <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> of the tissue into the blood, and will then be transported back to the lungs where it will diffuse into the lung gas and then be eliminated by exhalation. If the ambient pressure reduction is limited, this desaturation {{will take place in}} the dissolved phase, but if the ambient pressure is lowered sufficiently, bubbles may form and grow, both in blood and other supersaturated tissues. When the partial pressure of all gas {{dissolved in}} a tissue exceeds the total ambient pressure on the tissue it is supersaturated, and there is a possibility of bubble formation.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} regions, tubule {{cells in the}} distal {{convoluted}} tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na+/K+-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one sodium ion and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine is forming) into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> the cell through basolateral channels into the interstitial space, and water accompanies them. The water and chloride, {{as well as the}} sodium pumped out by the ATPase, will be absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based either on book lungs or on tracheae. Mesothele and mygalomorph spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and oxygen to diffuse in and carbon dioxide to <b>diffuse</b> <b>out.</b> This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. This system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and migrated posterior close to the spinnerets.|$|E

25|$|Gas remains {{dissolved}} in the tissues until the partial pressure of that {{gas in the}} lungs is reduced sufficiently to cause a concentration gradient with the blood at a lower concentration than the relevant tissues. A lowered partial pressure in the lungs will result in more gas diffusing out of the blood into the lung gas and less from the lung gas into the blood. A similar situation occurs between the blood and each tissue. As the concentration in the blood drops below the concentration in the adjacent tissue, the gas will <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> of the tissue into the blood, and will then be transported back to the lungs where it will diffuse into the lung gas and then be eliminated by exhalation. If the ambient pressure reduction is limited, this desaturation {{will take place in}} the dissolved phase, but if the ambient pressure is lowered sufficiently, bubbles may form and grow, both in blood and other supersaturated tissues.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly {{it is important for}} the right components—proteins and other molecules— to be in the right place at the right time. Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, making sense of neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E
25|$|If {{a bubble}} or an object exists which {{collects}} gas molecules {{this collection of}} gas molecules may reach a size where the internal pressure exceeds the combined surface tension and external pressure and the bubble will grow. If the solvent is sufficiently supersaturated, the diffusion of gas into the bubble will exceed {{the rate at which}} it diffuses back into solution, and if this excess pressure is greater than the pressure due to surface tension the bubble will continue to grow. When a bubble grows, the surface tension decreases, and the interior pressure drops, allowing gas to diffuse in faster, and <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> slower, so the bubble grows or shrinks in a positive feedback situation. The growth rate is reduced as the bubble grows because the surface area increases as the square of the radius, while the volume increases as the cube of the radius. If the external pressure is reduced due to reduced hydrostatic pressure during ascent, the bubble will also grow, and conversely, an increased external pressure will cause the bubble to shrink, but may not cause it to be eliminated entirely if a compression-resistant surface layer exists.|$|E

500|$|When a diver descends in {{the water}} the {{hydrostatic}} pressure, and therefore the ambient pressure, rises. Because breathing gas is supplied at ambient pressure, [...] some of this gas dissolves into the diver's blood and is transferred by the blood to other tissues. Inert gas such as nitrogen or helium continues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver {{is in a state}} of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver's lungs, at which point the diver is saturated for that depth and breathing mixture, or the depth, and therefore the pressure, is changed. [...] During ascent, the ambient pressure is reduced, and at some stage the inert gases dissolved in any given tissue will be at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state and start to <b>diffuse</b> <b>out</b> again. If the pressure reduction is sufficient, excess gas may form bubbles, which may lead to decompression sickness, a possibly debilitating or life-threatening condition. It is essential that divers manage their decompression to avoid excessive bubble formation and decompression sickness. [...] A mismanaged decompression usually results from reducing the ambient pressure too quickly for the amount of gas in solution to be eliminated safely. [...] These bubbles may block arterial blood supply to tissues or directly cause tissue damage. [...] If the decompression is effective, the asymptomatic venous microbubbles present after most dives are eliminated from the diver's body in the alveolar capillary beds of the lungs. If they are not given enough time, or more bubbles are created than can be eliminated safely, the bubbles grow in size and number causing the symptoms and injuries of decompression sickness. The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver, and the long-term goal is to avoid complications due to sub-clinical decompression injury.|$|E
