5|$|A country's <b>external</b> {{wealth is}} {{measured}} by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in <b>external</b> wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's <b>external</b> wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive <b>external</b> wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative <b>external</b> wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

40|$|Twenty-three {{undergraduate}} {{college students}} participated in four weekly frontalis EMG biofeedback sessions. Subjects were initially divided into internals and <b>externals</b> by the Health Locus of Control scale, and assigned to a biofeedback or control condition. Training {{was followed by a}} post-test with the Health Locus of Control scale. It was predicted that internals would achieve greater EMG decreases than <b>externals.</b> It was also hypothesized that biofeedback <b>externals</b> would achieve great er pretest to post-test (internally directed) changes in health locus of control scores than the control <b>externals.</b> Pretest to post-test EMG levels were obtained {{for each of the four}} sessions for both the biofeedback and control conditions. Some support for the fir s t hypothesis was indicated by a significant interaction between condition and health locus of control group, based on EMG change scores (pretest session one minus post-test session four). Results of a Scheffe test on mean pairs indicated significant differences between biofeedback internals and control internals, and biofeedback internals and control <b>externals.</b> Thus, among the internals, those in the biofeedback condition achieved greater EMG decreases than those in the control condition, and under the biofeedback condition, internals exhibited greater EMG decreases than <b>externals.</b> A nonparametric sign test on the health locus of control regressed change scores was nonsignificant, failing to support the second hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to the post–World War II baby boom, the New South Wales Department of Education, under Bob Heffron, queried the University of Sydney in 1951 on its thoughts about training and certifying schoolteachers by <b>external</b> studies and/or correspondence courses.

Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about its willingness to conduct <b>external</b> studies.

Internals and <b>externals</b> {{with differing}} {{self-esteem}} dispositions were administered {{a series of}} personality tests and subsequently provided with bogus reports by a clinical psychologist containing either positive or negative information about their personalities.

A study by Phares, Ritchie, and Davis (1968) was conducted to assess the reactions of internals and <b>externals</b> to positive and negative informa-tion about their personalities.

Although we found that <b>Externals</b> were more likely to blame the partner than Internals, we also found that Internals reported more anger than <b>Externals.</b> However, anger reported by Internals was primarily directed at the self, whereas anger reported by <b>Externals</b> was often directed at the interaction partner.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether auditors' job stress, job satisfaction, {{and performance}} {{are affected by}} the congruence (or fit) between auditors' personality and characteristics of the work environment they face. The personality measure used in this study is locus of control, which classifies individuals as either "internals" or "externals. " The work environment is measured by using auditor assessments of role stress and imposed control and by noting whether the auditors work for a more or less structured auditing firm. Locus of control theory and prior research suggest that internals adapt better to environments that impose relatively little control on the individual or that are high in role stress. Conversely, <b>externals</b> adapt better to environments that impose high levels of control or that are low in role stress. In order to obtain the necessary data, a questionnaire was distributed to staff and senior-level auditors from four of the "Big 6 " accounting firms (the two most structured and the two most unstructured as defined by prior research). The principal results can be summarized as follows. First, auditors' job stress was affected by the congruence between their locus of control and the amount of role conflict they perceived. Internals reported less job stress than <b>externals</b> when role conflict was high, and <b>externals</b> reported less job stress than internals when role conflict was low. Second, auditors' job satisfaction was affected by the congruence between (1) their locus of control and the amount of role ambiguity they perceived and (2) their locus of control and the amount of role conflict they perceived. In each case, internals reported higher job satisfaction than <b>externals</b> when role stress was high. On the other hand, when role stress was low, internals and <b>externals</b> reported similar levels of job satisfaction. Finally, auditors' self-reported performance was affected by the interaction between auditors' locus of control and audit firm structure. At relatively unstructured firms, internals reported higher performance than externals; at relatively structured firms, internals and <b>externals</b> reported similar performance levels. The interaction also reveals that internals reported higher performance at unstructured firms than at structured firms and that <b>externals</b> reported higher performance at structured firms than at unstructured firms...|$|R
