When students were trading cash-equivalent tokens, the negotiations resulted in the students who would receive the most cash from a token (as told by the researchers) holding the tokens, as would be predicted by the Coase Theorem. However, when the students were trading property (mugs in this case) that were not directly equivalent to cash, proper Coasean bargaining did not occur as depicted in the diagram to the right. This is because people generally exhibit an endowment effect, in which they value something more once they actually have possession of it. Thus, the Coase Theorem would not always work in practice because <b>initial</b> <b>allocations</b> of property rights would affect {{the end result of}} the negotiations.|$|E

This was modified by agreement by the International Bureau at Berne and published on April 23, 1913. Although <b>initial</b> <b>allocations</b> were not specifically for aircraft but for any radio user, the International Air Navigation Convention held in Paris in 1919 (Paris Convention of 1919) made allocations specifically for aircraft registrations, based on the 1913 callsign list.

5000|$|In microeconomics, the {{contract}} curve is {{the set of}} points representing final allocations of two goods between two people that could occur {{as a result of}} mutually beneficial trading between those people given their <b>initial</b> <b>allocations</b> of the goods. All the points on this locus are Pareto efficient allocations, meaning that from any one of these points there is no reallocation that could make one of the people more satisfied with his or her allocation without making the other person less satisfied. The contract curve is the subset of the Pareto efficient points that could be reached by trading from the people's initial holdings of the two goods. It is drawn in the Edgeworth box diagram shown here, in which each person's allocation is measured vertically for one good and horizontally for the other good from that person's origin (point of zero allocation of both goods); one person's origin is the lower left corner of the Edgeworth box, and the other person's origin is the upper right corner of the box. The people's initial endowments (starting allocations of the two goods) are represented by a point in the diagram; the two people will trade goods with each other until no further mutually beneficial trades are possible. (Contrary to this claim neither the point of initial endowments, nor {{the contract}} curve is displayed in the actual diagram shown here.)
