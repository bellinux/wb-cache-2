5|$|Many Egyptologists and {{anthropologists have}} {{suggested}} theories {{about how the}} gods developed in these early times. Gustave Jéquier, for instance, thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes, then deities in animal form, and finally deities in <b>human</b> <b>form,</b> whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in <b>human</b> <b>form</b> from the beginning. Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic, and more current ones, such as Siegfried Morenz' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment, are difficult to prove.|$|E

5|$|A kitsune {{may take}} on <b>human</b> <b>form,</b> an ability learned {{when it reaches}} a certain age—usually 100 years, {{although}} some tales say 50.

Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys. Sometimes young adult males These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate {{the appearance of a}} specific person. Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox.
