5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips the <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> red dress {{in a manner that}} recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
500|$|Izabel: Izabel is {{the ghost}} of a teenage girl from the planet Cleave who was killed by a landmine. She manifests as a reddish torso with her {{intestines}} hanging out from under the <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> T-shirt. She comes from a family of resistance fighters who built tunnels to escape people who invaded Cleave. She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko's life in exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet, but to do so has to bond her soul to Hazel's. Although Alana is initially reluctant to allow this, she finally relents and soon comes to appreciate Izabel's presence since she can act as a [...] "babysitter" [...] at night and allow Alana and Marko to rest. She has the ability to create realistic illusions with which she can disguise her appearance, although these do not work on machines such as the Robots.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Rix Nicholas created {{one of her}} most {{extraordinary}} works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost [...] high, and [...] wide, Les fleurs dédaignées ('The despised flowers') is an [...] "unnerving" [...] and [...] "arresting" [...] portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was [...] "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: ...|$|E
50|$|The local {{image of}} the Virgin Mary under the titular of the Immaculate Conception {{is known as the}} Nuestra Señora del Aguas Santas (also Virgin of the Holy Waters). The image of Immaculate Concepcion was said to be miraculous. Some of the miracles {{includes}} the wetting of the Virgin’s robes up to the shoulders, amor seco growing from the <b>hems</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garments and mysterious footprints all over the church leading to her altar. Due to the popular devotion to the Virgin and miracles attributed to her, the church is currently petitioning to become a diocesan shrine.|$|R

500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has heard of such a thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on the <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E

2500|$|According to Rosemarie Bodenheimer, North and South {{narrative}} {{may sometimes}} appear melodramatic and sentimental ("But, for all that—for all his savage words, {{he could have}} thrown himself at her feet, and kissed the <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garment" [...] in chapter 29)—particularly in the riot scene—but she sees Gaskell's best writing as [...] "done with the unjudging openness to experience" [...] Which the author shares with D. H. Lawrence (Bodenheimar 1979, pp.296–300). Jill L. Matus finds Gaskell's vocabulary [...] "Gothicized" [...] in its descriptions of the characters' agonised inner life—their responses to suffering and pain—which may appear melodramatic out of context. [...] However, [...] "the language of shock and horror is absorbed into the realist texture of the novel's narration" [...] and {{is consistent with the}} extreme conditions of the novel's external world (Matus, 2007, p.39).|$|E

40|$|Ms. I. 33 is {{not only}} the oldest of the known fencing treatises in European context, it is also the only one showing a woman {{fighting}} equally with contemporary men. The author presents her research about the garments this female fencer wears, including her shirt, dress and overdress, hairstyle and footwear. Special consideration is given to the questions whether Walpurgis wears a belt, the length and <b>hem</b> circumference <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garments as well as the methods of draping them in the way depicted. The results of the analysis are compared with contemporary pictorial and archaeological sources of the early 14 th century. Some personal insights gathered by the author while fighting in this kind of clothes shed light on the possibilities of moving without being disturbed by them. The clothes and hairstyle worn by Walpurgis, give clues about her social status and thus help to understand the context and dating of the whole manuscript...|$|R
