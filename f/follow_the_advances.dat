5000|$|Policy {{learning}} {{will not}} always be embraced {{in some parts of}} the world because some countries that were colonialized fear that embracing policies from international institutions will lead to other countries exploiting their resources. Rockefeller (1966) explained that in Latin America in the early 1960s free market policies were starting to be embraced, when communist propaganda start to spread across different Latin American countries that American business were exploiting the people and their resources. However, American private companies like Chase Manhattan Bank had launched a program in Panama to improve cattle raising by training cattlemen to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>advances</b> of scientific programs of seeding, feeding and breeding cattle in a more effective manner. This process improved the quality of beef, which encouraged higher meat consumption, improved the people dietary standards and made Panama a beef exporter (Rockefeller, 1966).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication {{satellites}} must <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>advances</b> {{of terrestrial}} network capacities and increase their total throughputs {{in order to}} remain competitive. This paper shows how the terrestrial fibre technology at 1550 -nm wavelength can be extended to support an optical feeder link between ground and a GEO satellite. With 100 Gb/s in a single direction, an optical uplink would outperform the near-term Ka-band systems. Mitigation techniques against clouds and turbulence are described. The impact of satellite transparency on the optical transmission system is discussed. To increase the profitability of the optical solution, cost and link availability associated with various ground station networks should be carefully assessed...|$|E
40|$|Cathepsin K (CTSK) is {{a member}} of the papain-like {{cysteine}} protease family. Mutations in the CTSK gene cause a rare autosomal recessive bone disorder called pycnodysostosis (OMIM 265800). In order to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>advances</b> in the research about CTSK and pycnodysostosis, we performed a literature retrospective study of 159 pycnodysostosis patients reported since 1996 and focused on the genetic characteristics of CTSK mutations and/or the clinical phenotypes of pycnodysostosis. Thirty three different CTSK mutations have been found in 59 unrelated pycnodysostosis families. Of the 59 families, 37. 29 % are from Europe and 30. 51 % are from Asia. A total of 69. 70 % of the mutations were identified in the mature domain of CTSK, 24. 24 % in the proregion, and 6. 06 % in the preregion. The hot mutation spots are found in exons 6 and 7. CTSK mutations result in total loss or inactivity of the CTSK protein, which causes abnormal degradation of bone matrix proteins such as type I collagen. Skeletal abnormalities, including short stature, an increase in bone density with pathologic fractures, and open fontanels and sutures, are the typical phenotypes of pycnodysostosis. Research on Ctsk-/- mouse models was also reviewed here to elucidate the biological function of Ctsk and the mechanism of pycnodysostosis. New evidence suggests that Ctsk plays an important role in the immune system and may serve as a valid therapeutic target in the future treatment of pycnodysostosis...|$|E
