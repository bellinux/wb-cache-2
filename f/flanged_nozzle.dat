40|$|The main {{objective}} of acoustic excitation studies is {{to gain a}} high level of control over processes governing free shear flow characteristics. The basic premise is that inherent instability waves in free shear flows are excitable by external perturbations with frequencies close to the natural instability frequency of the flow. An 8. 89 cm diameter axisymmetric jet was acoustically excited by four loudspeakers placed upstream of the nozzle exit. Measurements were made at Mach numbers of 0. 435 and 0. 2. A single hot-wire probe was used to obtain turbulence levels at the nozzle exit and along the centerline, and a microphone at the nozzle exit was used to study the resonance characteristics of the rig. A Pitot probe was stationed at X/D = 9 downstream along the nozzle axis to study the Strouhal number dependence and to look at threshold levels for excitation. The test results were obtained after a preliminary evaluation and facility improvement. Excitation at the correct Strouhal number enhanced mixing significantly. The effects were most prominent in the Strouhal number range between 0. 4 and 1. 0. The effects of acoustic excitation also depend considerably on the sound pressure level at the nozzle exit and were more pronounced at higher sound levels. Other factors which influenced the excitability were valve noise, exit turbulence levels, extraneous noise, and a <b>flanged</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Analysis of the hot-wire signal, in conditions of optimum jet mixing, showed vortex pairing to occur between 2 and 3 diameters downstream...|$|E
40|$|Axisymmetric {{synthetic}} jet actuators {{based on}} a loudspeaker and on two types of <b>flanged</b> <b>nozzles</b> were tested and compared experimentally. The first type of the nozzle was a sharp-edged circular hole. The second one had a special design with fillets at inner and outer nozzle exit and with a small step {{in the middle of}} the nozzle. The function of the step was to prevent the flow reattachment during the extrusion stroke. The actuators with the two types of nozzles were operated at resonance and were compared first qualitatively using a simple phase locked flow visualization. Then the hot-wire anemometer was used to measure velocity along nozzle axis and velocity profiles at the nozzle exit. Comparison of the nozzles was based on evaluation of the characteristic velocity and integral quantities (volumetric, momentum, and kinetic energy fluxes). It was found out that these quantities, which were evaluated at the nozzle exit, differ substantially for both nozzles. On the other hand the velocity flow field in farther distances from the nozzle exit area did not exhibit such prominent differences...|$|R
