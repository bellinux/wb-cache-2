500|$|Time {{ranked the}} album number nine, with the publication's Claire Suddath writing that [...] "It's {{an amalgam of}} beats, chants and raps mixed {{together}} with exacting precision. Big Boi deftly jumps between musical styles [...] and his raps come so fast, he seems to never pause for breath". Pitchfork Media named it the fourth best album of 2010 and stated [...] "he sound of Sir Lucious Left Foot {{is an exercise in}} recognizing traditions and pushing them miles ahead. Big Boi crowns <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>with</b> a lyrical acumen so detailed and charismatic—acting as benevolent hustler, knuckle-dusting elder statesman, trickster smartass and street-level philosopher". It was voted the sixth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010, while 11 songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Shutterbugg" [...] (number seven), [...] "Shine Blockas" [...] (number 95), and [...] "Follow Us" [...] (number 316).

500|$|The guest {{performances}} made by Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine {{were met}} with mixed reception from several critics. Amy Reiter was more critical on Griffin's performance as Tammy Jean Albertson, and noted [...] "while Kathy Griffin was sight-gag funny as local tea party candidate Tammy Jean Albertson [...] her lines fell a bit flat." [...] She went on to praise Devine's performance as Sister Mary Constance, saying that her lines [...] "totally hit the bull's-eye." [...] Robert Canning praised both performances, {{saying that it was}} {{the best part of the}} episode. He continued, [...] "I love how the guest judge segments of these contest episodes are beginning to become mini-series unto themselves. I hope that tradition continues." [...] James Poniewozik had mixed feelings regarding Griffin's performance. He went on to write, [...] "Glee can be sharp and topical enough that I thought it could actually do something clever with the much-publicized cameo. Instead, the performance hinged on expected gags [...] and Griffin delivered <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>with</b> a stiffness that felt more like a recitation than a performance." [...] Todd VanDerWerff reacted negatively to both performances. In his review of the episode, he opined, [...] "That judges’ scene [...] was a pale retread of the original, only this time, it had Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine, as well as a bunch of tired Tea Party gags that were tired when this episode was written." ...|$|E

Far from diminishing the project, the end product is another outstanding record, executed with fearlessness and grace." [...] Spectrum Cultures John Paul praised the album, writing, [...] "Music for People in Trouble {{is nothing short of}} a personal and professional triumph for Susanne Sundfør." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{show had}} its first Broadway revival in 1966 at the Music Theater of Lincoln Center. This {{production}} opened on May 31, 1966 and ran until July 9, {{followed by a}} short 10-week U.S. Tour. It returned to Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on September 21 for 78 performances. Ethel Merman reprised her original role as Annie with Bruce Yarnell as Frank, Benay Venuta as Dolly, and Jerry Orbach as Charles Davenport. The libretto and score were revised: The secondary romance between Tommy Keeler and Winnie Tate was completely eliminated, including their songs [...] "I'll Share <b>it</b> <b>All</b> <b>With</b> You" [...] and [...] "Who Do You Love, I Hope?", and the song [...] "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" [...] was specially written for the revival and added to the second act.

2500|$|Graeme - [...] "I'd got {{in touch}} with the {{professor}} of electronics at Sussex University, Brian Groves. We worked up an electronic drum kit, a marvellous idea. I had the control panel in front of me, it's old hat now but we were the first to do it. There were pieces of rubber with silver paper on the back with a silver coil that moved up and down inside a magnet that produced a signal, so it was touch sensitive. I had 5 snares across the top and then ten tom-toms and then a whole octave of bass drums underneath my feet and then four lots of 16 sequencers, two on each side. There was a gap — to play a space — a tambourine, ebony stick, snare and three tom-toms. This was pre-chip days, back then you did <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>with</b> transistors.

2500|$|In 1990, Jones {{released}} his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta Be Here With Me. [...] Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single [...] "Hell Stays Open All Night Long" [...] and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made {{the switch to}} MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. [...] His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. [...] However, two singles, [...] "You Couldn't Get The Picture" [...] and [...] "She Loved A Lot In Her Time" [...] (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. [...] His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song [...] "Finally Friday" [...] and [...] "I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair," [...] a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. [...] Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. [...] In 1996, Jones {{released his}} autobiography I Lived To Tell <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>with</b> Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, [...] "I also {{know that a lot of}} my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. [...] So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. [...] I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing." [...] He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the Association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. [...] On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host. [...] The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. [...] Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others.|$|E
