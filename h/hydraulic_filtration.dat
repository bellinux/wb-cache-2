40|$|Biologically treated {{municipal}} effluent {{contains a}} wide range of organic components which play important roles in fouling filtration membranes. The effect of ultrasound (US) on feed pre-treatment for fouling mitigation in the microfiltration (MF) of an activated sludge-lagoon effluent was investigated at lab-scale. Two minutes sonication of the feed led to reduced irreversible membrane fouling, with an increase in flux recovery of 30 %. However, considerable reduction in membrane permeability was observed. The coupling of US pre-treatment with Al 3 +-based coagulation improved the permeate flux more than using coagulation alone. This was attributed to the fragmentation of the particles and altered physico-chemical properties of the effluent organic matter, particularly biopolymers, after sonication leading to enhanced coagulation and hence the formation of a cake layer with less <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filtration</b> resistance...|$|E
30|$|Schematically, two {{principal}} mechanisms can work toward {{an increase in}} pulmonary water and possibly alveolar flooding: on the one hand, an increase in pulmonary microvascular pressure {{and on the other}} hand, an increase in alveolocapillary barrier permeability. During ARDS, an increase in endothelial permeability is a fundamental element in the formation of pulmonary edema [12]. On a hydrodynamic level, the capillary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filtration</b> coefficient increases and the reflection coefficient of oncotically active substances diminishes or even goes to nearly zero in certain zones. Thus, the oncotic pressure gradient, which normally opposes the formation of edema, is little or no longer effective. Consequently, a given augmentation in hydrostatic pressure will trigger a greater augmentation in fluid efflux if alveolocapillary barrier permeability is increased. This has been well illustrated in experimental studies by Guyton [13], showing that edema forms faster and at a lower hydrostatic pressure threshold when one has first damaged the alveolocapillary barrier before progressively increasing the left atrium pressure. Moreover, other experimental studies have shown that even a modest decrease in pulmonary capillary pressure by vasodilatation or early reduction of volemia in a lesional edema model can limit the formation of pulmonary edema [14 – 16].|$|E
30|$|Under {{physiologic}} conditions, {{there is}} a transfer of fluid from the capillary lumina toward the interstitium. In fact, on the one hand, the endothelium presents some permeability, {{the consequences of the}} forces acting {{on both sides of the}} endothelium favor an extravasation of fluid [11]. Fluid flux through the pulmonary endothelium is quite correctly estimated by Starling's equation, which expresses the fact that net filtration flux is the product of the hydraulic conductance of the exchange surface barrier by effective filtration pressure. The equation is expressed as follows: Jv = K [(Pc - Pi) - S (πc-πi)], where Jv is the flow of fluid through the capillary wall, K is the capillary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filtration</b> coefficient reflecting endothelial water permeability, Pc is capillary hydrostatic pressure, Pi is interstitial hydrostatic pressure, S is the oncotic reflection coefficient, πc is the capillary oncotic pressure, and πi is the interstitial oncotic pressure. The first part of the equation represents the hydrostatic pressure gradient, which tends to produce a flow of fluid out of the vessels. The second part represents the oncotic pressure gradient, which opposes this transudation of fluid. The influence of oncotic pressure on fluid flux through the endothelium is modulated by the oncotic reflection coefficient (S), which represents the permeability of the endothelium to oncotically active substances.|$|E

40|$|Constrictions in {{the void}} space between soil {{particles}} govern hydraulic conductivity, internal stability, and filtration performance of sands and gravels. Various analytical, numerical, and image-based methods have been proposed to measure void constrictions based solely on analysis of particle and void geometry. These geometric constrictions are increasingly being used in models to predict <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity or <b>filtration</b> performance. However, both of these phenomena depend {{not only on the}} void geometry, but also on the directions and magnitudes of fluid velocities with{{in the void}} space. This paper presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations performed on microcomputed tomography (microCT) images of voids in real sands, as well as idealized materials generated by discrete element modeling (DEM). Laminar flow conditions are considered and an alternative definition of a void constriction is presented, the hydraulic constriction, which is based on fluid velocities rather than void geometry. The data show that for laminar flow, where Darcy’s law is applicable, the position, size, and orientation of hydraulic and geometric constrictions share many similarities, but there are measurable differences, which should be considered in <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity and <b>filtration</b> analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{long-term}} (> 2 years) biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment for mitigating organic fouling in the microfiltration of biologically treated secondary effluent was investigated. Correlation between the organic constituents and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filtration</b> resistance was investigated {{to identify the}} major components responsible for fouling. Over two years operation, the removal efficiency for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by the BAC treatment was fairly consistent (30 ± 3 %), although the reduction in UVA 254 gradually decreased from 56 to 34 %. BAC treatment effectively decreased the organic foulants in the effluent and so contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling as shown by reduction in the unified membrane fouling index (UMFI). BAC consistently removed biopolymers whereas the removal of humic substances decreased from 52 to 25 % {{after two years of}} BAC operation, and thus led to a gradual decrease in UMFI reduction efficiency from 78 to 43 %. This was due to gradual reduction in adsorption capacity of the activated carbon as confirmed by analysis of its pore size distribution. Hence humics also {{played an important role in}} membrane fouling. However, there was a good correlation between protein and carbohydrate contents with hydraulically reversible and irreversible filtration resistance, compared with UVA 254, turbidity and DOC. Although the mitigation of membrane fouling decreased over time, this study demonstrated that the long-term use of BAC pre-treatment of biologically treated secondary effluent prior to microfiltration has potential to reduce the need for frequent chemical cleaning and so increase membrane life span...|$|E

However, a major drawbackof membrane technology is that biofilmformation alters membraneperformances. Preventing biofilm formation is thus apivotal challenge for larger-scale development of membraneprocesses. Here, we studied the comparative antibacterial activitiesof different inorganic membranes (ceramic and zeolitecoatedceramic with or without copper exchange) using severalbacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcusaureus, and Bacillus subtilis). In static conditions, aluminaplates coated with Cu-exchanged zeolite showed significantbactericidal activity.

40|$|Determinants of glomerular hypo{{filtration}} in aging humans. BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to confirm the extent to which glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is depressed in healthy, aging subjects and to elucidate the mechanism of such hypofiltration. MethodsHealthy volunteers aged 18 to 88 years (N = 159) underwent a determination of GFR, renal plasma flow (RPF), afferent oncotic pressure, and arterial pressure. Glomeruli in renal biopsies of healthy kidney transplant donors aged 23 to 69 years (N = 33) were subjected to a morphometric analysis, so as to determine glomerular <b>hydraulic</b> permeability and <b>filtration</b> surface area. The aforementioned GFR determinants were then subjected to mathematical modeling to compute the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) for two kidneys and individual glomeruli. ResultsGFR was significantly depressed (P < 0. 0001) by 22 % in aging (≥ 55 years old) compared to youthful subjects (≤ 40 years old). Corresponding reductions of the following GFR determinants in the aging vs. youthful subsets were RPF by 28 % (P < 0. 0001), two-kidney Kf by 21 % to 53 % (P < 0. 005), glomerular hydraulic permeability by 14 % (P = 0. 03), and the single-nephron Kf (SNKf) by 30 % (P = 0. 09). There were no significant differences between aging and youthful subsets for afferent oncotic pressure and filtration surface area per glomerulus. ConclusionWe conclude that a reduction in overall, two-kidney Kf contributes to GFR depression in aging subjects. We infer that this is due in part to structural changes that lower SNKf, and in part to the reduction in the actual number of functioning glomeruli that has been demonstrated by others at autopsy...|$|R
40|$|The term biosolids {{refers to}} the nutrient-rich organic {{materials}} resulting from the treatment of domestic sewage at a wastewater treatment facility. It is a widely acceptable term for sewage sludge that has been treated at a wastewater treatment plant and is beneficially recycled. Biosolids inherently come from sewage sludge, so {{they have the same}} origin and biological nature, but a different applicability. The quantity of municipal biosolids produced increases annually in the United States. The production of biosolids has increased because of both the advance of sanitation and wastewater treatment and the growth of population. Sludge or biosolids are contaminated by varying amounts of heavy metals or hazardous organic compounds from industrial and commercial wastewater. Therefore, society has to face the potential for increased negative impacts on the environment from the increasing volume of biosolids being produced. Public concerns about applied biosolids treatment or reuse methods are potential health, environmental, or aesthetic impacts (such things as disease, odors), because of the pollutants in the biosolids. The most commonly used methods for biosolids treatment and recycling are briefly reviewed in the first two chapters of this thesis. However, the current biosolids treatment or recycling options have their own defects. A new and innovative technology, deep biosolids injection, is proposed for the treatment of biosolids and is to be implemented by Los Angeles where the City has been granted underground solids injection control permits under Class V wells by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Deep biosolids injection is a process referred to as one type of several deep underground injection techniques. It shares many similarities with slurried solids injection above the fracture pressure, which has been successfully used for the treatment of slurried non-hazardous solid materials produced in the oil industry such as drill cuttings, viscous emulsions with clay, oily sand, NORMs (naturally occurring radioactive materials), pipe scale, tank bottoms, soil from spill clean-up, and so on. The distinctive biosolids properties result in injection mechanisms different from other slurry injection processes. Filtration and consolidation processes occur simultaneously along with injection of biosolids, and these must be understood in order to properly design and manage a biosolids injection operation. <b>Hydraulic</b> fracture mechanisms, <b>filtration</b> theory and consolidation principles provide the basis for the interpretation of biosolids injection process. A semi-analytical hydraulic fracture model for injection of a compressible substance (biosolids) is developed as a modification of the Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) hydraulic fracture model. The PKN model is modified with a pseudo-dynamic leak-off function that describes the deposition of biosolids (filtration) and plugging effect of biosolids on the fracture wall in a porous medium. The pseudo-dynamic leak-off function is given in terms of the net pressure and the resistance of the filter cake to flow. The hydraulic fracture model is employed to compute the volume of biosolids slurry remaining in an open induced fracture. The consolidation process in the closure phase of deep biosolids injection is described using the biosolids properties under different stress conditions. A Terzaghi-type relationship is used to compute the volume change in the closure phase using compressibility data available from published literature. In contrast to the conventional PKN leak-off model, simulation results using the new model show that the induced fracture volume is much larger because of the impaired leak-off and because of the volumetric effects and consolidation of the biosolids in the fracture. Solids contents and biosolids compaction behavior have significant impacts on the geometry of fracture (width, length, volume) over time. The model was developed to help guide large-scale injection of municipal and animal biosolids as an environmentally more secure method of treatment than surface approaches...|$|R
40|$|Biologically active filters, or {{biological}} filters, remove particles and harness the metabolic capacity of bacteria attached to filtration media, {{in the form}} of a biofilm, to metabolize biodegradable organic matter (BOM). Pilot-scale biological filtration experiments were carried out at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada to evaluate the impact of capping material selection and nutrient amendments for granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, on both traditional and biological filtration performance parameters. Traditional filtration parameters included filter effluent turbidity, head loss development, and filter run time. Biological filtration performance was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) removal. The top 20 cm layer of GAC (d 10 = 1. 3 mm) was replaced by a capping material with a larger effective size in three of the five pilot-scale filter columns—such use of capping layers in rapid biological filtration for drinking water treatment has not been reported previously. The capping materials that were investigated were an expanded clay (EC) aggregate (d 10 = 1. 7 mm) and a plastic “pinwheel” style medium (diameter = 2. 5 cm). A stoichiometric carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C:N:P) ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 is most commonly referenced in the drinking water industry as being ideal for microbial growth in distribution systems and biological filters. The nutrient amendment experiments studied the impact of amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 and 100 : 20 : 2, in a systematic and controlled manner. The monitoring and experimental program was conducted over 14 months to account for seasonal water quality and temperature effects. The results of this study have several implications for optimizing the design and operation of biological filters for drinking water treatment. The capping materials delayed terminal head loss by 10 - 40 hours, compared to the control GAC filter, and significantly reduced the rate of head loss accumulation at all temperature ranges without negatively impacting filter effluent turbidity or BOM removal. There were no significant differences in filter run time at cold water conditions between each of the filter configurations; however, both capping layers extended filter run time at warm water conditions. Replacing a relatively small layer of media with one that has a larger effective size can lead to more robust filter operation. At cold water conditions, amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 or 100 : 20 : 2 of the GAC or EC capped filters did not yield significant differences in either traditional {{or biological}} filtration performance. The observed reduction of SRP and no reduction in NH 3 -N concentrations suggest that the system was phosphorus limited but not nitrogen limited; however, the performance of the filters was not nutrient limited. The maximum stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of consumed nutrients by the biological filters was 100 : 0 : 10; thus, it was concluded that a C:N:P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was not optimal for performance enhancement at cold water conditions. At warm water conditions, amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of the GAC filter to either 100 : 10 : 1 or 100 : 20 : 2 did not yield any improvements in traditional or biological filtration performance. Reductions in the NH 3 -N and SRP concentrations at the effluent of the nutrient-amended GAC filter suggests that it was both nitrogen and phosphorus limited, but not with respect to operational performance or BOM removal. Amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 of the EC capped filter led to a significant increase in its filter run time, while increasing the influent ratio to 100 : 20 : 2 improved both filter run time and rate of head loss accumulation; however, no improvements in BOM removal were observed. The long length of time required to observe improvements in filter performance at warm water conditions indicates that nutrient enhancement strategies may not be suitable for biological filters that operate in climates that experience short, or no periods of warm water conditions. Similar to the nutrient-amended GAC filter, reductions in the NH 3 -N and SRP concentrations at the effluent of the nutrient-amended EC capped filter suggest that it was also nitrogen and phosphorus limited. The observed improvements in performance of the nutrient-amended EC capped filters, but not the GAC filter, suggests that nutrient enhancement strategies can be beneficial but at certain conditions only. The stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of consumed nutrients by the biological filters ranged between 100 : 67. 3 : 6. 0 to 100 : 153. 3 : 7. 4; thus, it was concluded that a C:N:P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was not optimal for performance enhancement at warm water conditions. Residual amounts of SRP measured at the effluent of the nutrient-amended filters at all temperature ranges and nutrient dosing rates, suggests that there is a maximum amount of phosphorus can be metabolized by the biological filters. The plastic capped filter outperformed or matched the performance of the nutrient-amended filters in terms of the rate of head loss accumulation and filter run time, without any loss in performance in terms of turbidity trends or DOC removal at cold or warm water conditions. This suggests that using capping materials can be a cost effective way to improve biological <b>filtration</b> <b>hydraulic</b> performance, and is operationally less complicated than a nutrient addition system. However, adding capping layers to existing filters may require modifications to their operation...|$|R
