5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. <b>Her</b> <b>slender</b> fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
25|$|Mother and {{daughter}} both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, {{which also includes}} a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, {{is typical of the}} fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes <b>her</b> <b>slender</b> silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast {{with the rest of the}} dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter. Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.|$|E
2500|$|One famous Han dynasty dancer is Zhao Feiyan, a {{great beauty}} who rose from a humble {{beginning}} {{to become an}} Empress. She was named Feiyan or [...] "Flying Swallow" [...] after <b>her</b> <b>slender</b> figure and lithe dance steps, so light that {{she appeared to be}} quivering like a flower in the hand. Professional dancers of the period were of low social status and many entered the profession through poverty, although some such as Zhao Feiyan achieved higher status by becoming concubines. Another dancer was Wang Wengxu (...) who was forced to become a domestic singer-dancer but who later bore the future Emperor Xuan of Han.|$|E

2500|$|The Chicago Times-Herald did {{a profile}} of Ford in November and it was echoed widely through December.

[...] Then she spoke before the Englewood Woman's club, then in a week she was profiled in Trenton, New Jersey, and spoke before the Arché club back in Chicago, and contributed to a benefit reception. Talks continue to the end of November.|$|E
