5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

40|$|The single-breath {{maneuver}} used {{to measure}} nitric oxide (NO) in adults cannot be performed by young children. We, therefore, developed a method of measuring NO in mixed exhaled gas collected during tidal breathing. NO was measured in mixed exhaled gas during 5 min of tidal breathing in 113 children 4 - 14 years of age: 22 nonasthmatics, 21 asthmatic children not taking inhaled corticosteroids, and 70 asthmatic children using inhaled corticosteroids. Exhaled NO levels (median, range) were significantly lower in nonasthmatic controls (median, range: 7, 2 - 10 ppb) than in asthmatic children on inhaled corticosteroids (8, 3 - 25 ppb; 95 % CI <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> medians with those of controls, 0 - 4 ppb), and in those not on inhaled corticosteroids (13, 6 - 37, ppb; 95 % CI <b>for</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> medians, 5 - 17 ppb).

25|$|In 1875, Herbert Spencer {{said that}} women were {{incapable}} of abstract thought and could not understand issues of justice and had only the ability to understand issues of care. In 1925, Sigmund Freud also stated {{that women were}} less morally developed {{in the concept of}} justice and, unlike men, were more influenced by feeling than rational thought. Early brain studies comparing mass and volumes between the sexes concluded that women were intellectually inferior because they have smaller and lighter brains. Many believed that the size difference caused women to be excitable, emotional, sensitive, and therefore not suited for political participation.

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive.

25|$|Originally, electorates {{were drawn}} up based on {{political}} and social links, with little consideration <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> population. The New Zealand House of Representatives was originally modelled on the electoral procedures used for the British House of Commons, where there were both single-member electorates (electorates returning just one MP) and multi-member electorates (electorates returning more than one MP). Each electorate was allocated a different number of MPs (up to three) in order to balance population differences. All electorates used a plurality voting system. From 1881, a special country quota meant that rural seats were allowed to contain fewer people than urban seats, preserving the inequality and over-representing farmers. For the 1905 election the multi-member electorates were abolished. The quota system persisted until 1945.|$|E
25|$|What {{is clear}} is that Harappan society was not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E
