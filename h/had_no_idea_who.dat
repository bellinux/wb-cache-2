5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was.|$|E

He also sang frequently with a karaoke machine at Cooper's Emporium and the Old Roan pub near the home he shared with his mother when the Searchers first started. Many of his audience <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was, but he had kept his skill and delighted to tell of someone stopping him in the supermarket {{to say how much}} they had liked his singing at the Old Roan.|$|E

According to The Daily Telegraph, before her marriage, Susan was [...] "a beauty queen turned lingerie model" [...] who [...] "launched a fashion business". The couple met in Spain, where Susan had a bridal wear company, when Gunn was there on holiday. She told the Telegraph, [...] "When I first met Bryan, I knew nothing about football and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was because {{he told me he}} was a joiner." ...|$|E

500|$|Stefanie {{stated in}} later {{interviews}} {{that she was}} unaware of Hitler at the time, but that she had received an anonymous love letter asking her {{to wait for him}} to graduate and then to marry him, which she only realised after being questioned about him, must have been from Hitler. She recalled: [...] "I once received a letter from someone who said they were to attend the Academy of Arts, and that I should wait for him; he could come back and marry me! I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> the letter might have been from or who I should have send it to." ...|$|E
500|$|Best's replacement, Ringo Starr, {{accompanied}} the band on their second recording session with EMI at Abbey Road studios on 4 September 1962. George Martin initially {{refused to let}} Starr play, {{due to the fact}} that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was at that time, and to avoid any risks of his drumming still not being good enough. On 11 September 1962 at the third EMI recording session Martin used session musician Andy White on the drums for the whole session and not Starr, as Martin had already booked White after the first session with Best. Starr played tambourine on some songs while White played drums. Starr told Hunter Davies years later that he had thought, [...] "That's the end. They're pulling a Pete Best on me." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon was sampled {{on another}} {{song from the}} album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] and appears on vocals on [...] "Monster". While there during {{recording}} sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed {{for a lot of}} fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to me, where he just does shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how did you do that? How did that happen?' He's just a really cool guy to be around." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} she was cast as Lana, Kreuk <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> the {{character}} was in Superman lore. Her uncle, who owned a comic book shop, filled her in on the details and she learned more from the producers. Kreuk realized that the character in the comics and her character on the show were two different people. As a result, Kreuk learns about the development of Lana as Lana is learning in the show, just as Welling does with Clark Kent. When asked if her being cast as a traditionally red haired character caused outcry from fans, Kreuk believes that whoever did [...] "got over it pretty fast". By season three, Kreuk had decided to [...] "invest" [...] herself less in her character, as she felt that her character's ultimate development was entirely {{in the hands of the}} producers. She no longer became frustrated when the producers had Lana doing things that Kreuk felt were out of character, instead trusting that they would find the right direction for the character.|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, the Global Times {{published}} {{the results of}} a telephone poll of 866 Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou residents, who, the journal said, were chosen at random: 507 of the respondents felt the committee owed the Chinese people an apology and should cancel the award to Liu; more than half agreed Liu should remain incarcerated until he is paroled. The survey also showed [...] "a low recognition of Liu among the public in China, as more than 75 percent of respondents <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize was." [...] The Beijing Daily published an editorial {{on the day of the}} award ceremony entitled [...] "Why not give the peace prize to Julian Assange?". It suggested that Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, was not awarded the prize because he could not [...] "become a tool for Western forces in attacking countries with different ideologies... even if this tool is serving out a prison sentence for violating the law.""] [...] Beijing Daily. 10 December 2010. as translated in Bandurski, David (10 December 2010)[...] Journalism and Media Studies Centre (University of Hong Kong).

500|$|After Garza {{confessed to}} police {{in a written}} {{statement}} on March 31, 1993, he was not arrested immediately because he agreed to cooperate with them in their efforts to apprehend Martínez. Garza reached out to Martínez and told her that the assassins wanted more money. He met with her three times in April 1993 wearing a wire, and had Martínez agree to contact Cisneros to give Garza the money. Police arrested Martínez on April 6 and agreed to work with them to incriminate Cisneros. The next morning, she scheduled a meeting with Cisneros and told her that the assassins requested more money, and she needed to pay. They rode around Brownsville and Cisneros's voice was recorded. The police kept close to the car to stay within the transmitter's signal range. Only portions of the conversation were recorded because the police were unable to remain within range all the time. While in the car, Cisneros gave Martínez an envelope with US$500. Cisneros then asked Martínez if there was any evidence that she had orchestrated the murder. Cisneros mentioned Garza and a man known as [...] "El Cortado," [...] though investigators <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was. In the recorded conversation, there was no incriminating evidence against the gunmen. since {{there was no evidence that}} Cisneros employed them, or that the assassins murdered Fischer. The meeting concluded when police pulled the vehicle over and arrested Cisneros. She told a police officer that she owed Martínez some money, which Martínez later admitted was not the case.|$|E
500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become {{a staff writer for}} the show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, he was forced to go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E
500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> they were. Imagine the terror and the fear of being surrounded by these people who tell you that they are your family. But you feel nothing." ...|$|E

Swenson's 1941 translation) {{under his own}} name on 29 April, and Stages on Life's Way edited by Hilarius Bookbinder, 30 April 1845. The Stages is a rewrite of Either/Or which Kierkegaard did not think had been adequately read by the public and in Stages he predicted [...] "that two-thirds of the book's readers will quit before they are halfway through, out of boredom they will throw the book away."

Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, [...] "I wasn't even sure at that point – really, I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it.

Shannon described the tour as [...] "glorious": [...] "Our record hadn't become that successful yet, but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people.

I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
