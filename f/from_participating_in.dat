5|$|HMS Orion was {{the lead}} ship of her class of four {{dreadnought}} battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, generally serving as a flagship. Aside <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to high-profile lawsuits against Chinese officials and corporations, Falun Gong practitioners {{have filed a}} number of complaints and civil suits alleging discrimination outside China, most of them centered within the Chinese diaspora community. Several complaints have been made after Falun Gong groups were barred <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> parades or events, with mixed results. In Canada and in New York, Falun Gong practitioners won judgments against Chinese businesses or community organizations for discriminating against them {{on the basis of}} their religious creed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1982, Clemson University was put on {{probation}} by the NCAA for recruiting violations. The probation forbade the team <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> any bowl games, reduced the scholarships available to the team, and rendered the team ineligible for ACC football championship competition. Though the team still played its full slate of games during the 1983 season and finished 911, Maryland, which finished with an 84 record, was awarded the ACC football championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, Virginia Tech was placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits. The probation's main effect was to ban the players who received the benefits <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> any postseason game following the 1984 season. Seven of the eight players involved in the scandal either left Virginia Tech or had the probation lifted {{as a result of}} appeals to the NCAA. The eighth, Bruce Smith, did not.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E

5|$|The {{conscription}} law of World War I {{provided for}} noncombatant service {{for members of}} a religious organization whose members were forbidden <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> war of any form.

The law gave the President authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{competed in}} the UEFA Cup in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons and {{departed}} {{in the first and}} second round to FC Winterslag and Spartak Moscow respectively. The Heysel Stadium disaster of May 1985, during the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus resulted in UEFA, and later FIFA, imposing a 'worldwide' ban on English teams <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> European club competitions, initially for an indefinite period. Under George Graham, Arsenal returned to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, having won the league championship a season earlier. They went out in the second round to Portuguese team Benfica in November 1991. The ban arising from the Heysel disaster had prevented Arsenal from competing in the European Cup when they won the league title two years previously, as well as preventing them from competing in the UEFA Cup on two occasions.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond met Philip, Count of Flanders, who {{had come}} to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in September 1177. According to the {{contemporaneous}} William of Tyre, many crusaders blamed Bohemond and RaymondIII of Tripoli for dissuading Philip <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> a military campaign against Egypt, preferring instead to take advantage of Philip's presence in their own realms. Indeed, in December Philip and Bohemond jointly laid siege to Harenc, a fortress of As-Salih Ismail al-Malik, Emir of Damascus, seizing the opportunity following a mutiny of the garrison. They lifted the siege soon after As-Salih informed them that Saladin (the common enemy of both As-Salih and Bohemond) had left Egypt for Syria. As-Salih paid 50,000 dinars and renounced half of the nearby villages in favor of Bohemond.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> paid games, under a presumption that DFS is illegal {{in these states}} due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, she {{received}} death threats upon returning to Somalia, and after being confronted by Al-Shabaab, {{she began to}} deny {{that she was an}} athlete. The organisation banned woman <b>from</b> <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> sports, and Omar eventually made her way to Ethiopia in order to pursue the hope of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She attempted to make her way to Europe, travelling to Libya in September 2011. Alongside other refugees, she attempted to cross the Mediterranean by sea in 2012; she drowned while attempting to board an Italian naval vessel when the boat she was on was intercepted off the coast of Libya. Omar's life story was later dramatised as the graphic novel An Olympic Dream: The story of Samia Yusuf Omar by German artist Reinhard Kleist.|$|E
