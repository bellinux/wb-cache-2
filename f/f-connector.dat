5000|$|... #Caption: A {{optical fibre}} LNB (with fibre {{connection}} and conventional <b>F-connector</b> for power input) ...|$|E
50|$|The optical LNB {{requires}} two cables connected - the fibre {{signal cable}} {{and a separate}} <b>F-connector</b> cable to supply the 12V supply to power the LNB electronics. If the installation is a conversion from an electrical system to fibre, an existing redundant coaxial signal cable {{can be used for}} the power supply.|$|E
50|$|Each ComController had one HF Downstream module. The {{downstream}} controller had two <b>F-connector</b> interfaces {{to connect}} a coax cable towards the distribution {{section of a}} hybrid fibre coax cable TV network. Below the primary interface a test interface connector was available, {{making it possible to}} connect test equipment without having to disconnect the main downstream signal from the network. The frequency of the downstream signal was configurable via the management interface.|$|E
40|$|<b>F-connectors</b> of a {{conventional}} design have gained wide acceptance in the cable TV industry due to their low cost and simplicity. However, at higher frequencies their impedance degrades. Failures of conventional <b>F-connectors</b> generated interest in a similar product but of increased quality. Advances in connector technology {{made it possible to}} provide a higher quality connector. This paper describes steps taken to develop the AMP High Quality F (HQF) connectors. In addition to improvement of performance, a major design goal was mechanical compatibility with conventional <b>F-connectors...</b>|$|R
5000|$|RF IN and RF OUT: 75 ohms; either PAL aerial {{connectors}} {{tuned to}} channels 32-40 or NTSC <b>F-connectors</b> tuned to channel 3 or 4 ...|$|R
50|$|Composite {{video and}} RF (channel 3/channel 4) <b>F-connectors</b> were {{two ways of}} {{connecting}} entertainment devices to television sets. This {{was not so much}} of a format as the RF option was an adaptation necessary for plugging in such devices on television sets that did not come equipped with a composite video input. RF was a noticeably inferior substitute. The competition between options mainly manifested itself as competition between television set manufacturers and their individual models that offered composite video.|$|R
50|$|The {{single mode}} fibre cables use an 8Î¼m fibre {{armoured}} with a steel wrap and Kevlar strands inside a plastic jacket. Fibre cable cannot be easily joined (an expensive fusion splicer {{is required for}} reliable joints) but pre-made cables with FC type screw-on connectors (mechanically similar in use, but smaller, to the <b>F-connectors</b> used for electrical satellite IF) are available in lengths from 1m to 100m. The same connectors are used on all the optical components of a system, including the optical LNB, splitters, cable joiners, virtual LNB units, etc.|$|R
50|$|All {{the outdoor}} parts on the dish are collectively called the ODU (Outdoor Unit), i.e., OMT to split signal between BUC and LNB. The IDU is {{effectively}} a modem, usually with ethernet port and 2 x <b>F-connectors</b> for the coax to BUC (Transmit) and from LNB (Receive). The Astra2Connect has an all-in-one OMT/BUC/LNA {{that looks like}} a Quad LNB in shape and size which mounts on a regular TV satellite mount. As a consequence it is only 500 mW compared with the normal 2W, thus is poorer in rain. Skylogic's Tooway system also uses an integrated OMT/BUC/LNB assembly called a transmit and receive integrated assembly (TRIA), which is 3W.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of using an LNB are that cheaper cable {{can be used}} to connect the indoor receiver to the satellite television dish and LNB, and that the technology for handling the signal at L-band and UHF was far cheaper than that for handling the signal at C-band frequencies. The shift to cheaper technology from the hardline and N-connectors of the early C-band systems to the cheaper and simpler 75-ohm cable and <b>F-connectors</b> allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified UHF television tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to a lower intermediate frequency centered on 70 MHz, where it was demodulated. This shift allowed the satellite television DTH industry to change from being a largely hobbyist one where only small numbers of systems costing thousands of US dollars were built, to a far more commercial one of mass production.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} using the LNB to do the {{frequency}} translation at the dish is so that the signal can be carried into the residence using cheap coaxial cable. To transport the signal into the house at its original Ku band microwave frequency would require an expensive waveguide, a metal pipe to carry the radio waves. [...] The cable connecting the receiver to the LNB are of the low loss type RG-6, quad shield RG-6, or RG-11. RG-59 is not recommended for this application as it is not technically designed to carry frequencies above 950 MHz, but will work in many circumstances, depending {{on the quality of}} the coaxial wire. [...] The shift to more affordable technology from the 50 Ohm impedance cable and N-Connectors of the early C-Band systems to the cheaper 75 Ohm technology and <b>F-Connectors</b> allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified UHF television tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to another lower intermediate frequency centered on 70 MHz where it was demodulated.|$|R
