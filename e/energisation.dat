Particles of size less than two-and-a-half micrometers (PM 2. 5) have recently started to attract attention as they can be carried long distances, can stay airborne {{for long periods of time}} and can penetrate deep into the lungs. As a result, manufacturers of air cleaning systems for domestic and commercial use are continuously looking for more effective methods to reduce the concentration of PM 2. 5 airborne particulate matter. The present paper discusses the development of the scientific and engineering basis for the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation technology, which will use superposition of sub-microsecond high field pulses and DC electric field. Such short HV impulses allow application of significantly higher voltages to the active ionisation electrodes of the precipitation system without the initiation of spark breakdown. The breakdown properties of atmospheric air show that the reduction of the impulse duration from  2 µs to  200 ns results in a  2 -fold increase in the breakdown voltage. Higher levels of electric field will help to generate higher ionic concentrations, resulting in efficient charging of the airborne particles and improved removal efficiency. This paper reports initial results on the development of the micro-ESP system and analysis of its efficiency. A coaxial micro-ESP precipitation chamber composed of plasma-generation and particle-collection electrodes has been designed. The transmission-line based impulse energising system is able to generate square sub-microsecond impulses with frequency up to 100 Hz and magnitude of a few tens of kV.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{new models}} and investigations into switching transient phenomena {{related to the}} shunt reactors and the Mechanically Switched Capacitor with Damping Network (MSCDN) operations used for reactive power control in the transmission system. Shunt reactors and MSCDN are similar in that they have reactors. A shunt reactor is connected parallel to the compensated lines to absorb the leading current, whereas the MSCDN is a version of a capacitor bank that has been designed as a C-type filter {{for use in the}} harmonic-rich environment. In this work, models have been developed and transient overvoltages due to shunt reactor deenergisation were estimated analytically using MathCad, a mathematical program. Computer simulations were then undertaken using the ATP/EMTP program to reproduce both single-phase and three-phase shunt reactor switching at 275 kV operational substations. The effect of the reactor switching on the circuit breaker grading capacitor was also examined by considering various switching conditions. The main original achievement of this thesis is the clarification of failure mechanisms occurring in the air-core filter reactor due to MSCDN switching operations. The simulation of the MSCDN <b>energisation</b> was conducted using the ATP/EMTP program in the presence of surge arresters. The outcome of this simulation shows that extremely fast transients were established across the air-core filter reactor. This identified transient event has {{led to the development of}} a detailed air-core reactor model, which accounts for the inter-turn RLC parameters as well as the stray capacitances-to-ground. These parameters are incorporated into the transient simulation circuit, from which the current and voltage distribution across the winding were derived using electric field and equivalent circuit modelling. Further analysis of the results has revealed that there are substantial dielectric stresses imposed on the winding insulation that can be attributed to a combination of three factors. (i) First, the surge arrester operation during the MSCDN <b>energisation,</b> which causes steep voltage change at the reactor terminal. (ii) Second, the nonuniform voltage distribution, resulting in high stresses across the top inter-turn windings. (iii) Third, the rapid rate-of-change of voltage in the assumed worst-case reactor winding location. This is accompanied by a high dielectric (displacement) current through the inter-turn winding insulation. Work within this investigation proposes that a synergistic effect of high electric field and high dielectric current occurring at worst <b>energisation,</b> followed by the thermal effects of steady state operation contributes to the failure of air-core reactors used on the 400 kV MSCDN...|$|E

It has been shown that Midel 7131 has a higher ac breakdown voltage (27. 6 kV) as compared with Diala D oil (26. 4 kV) and rapeseed oil (24. 6 kV).

40|$|Corona {{discharges}} in electro-negative gases {{can generate}} space charge which re-distributes the electric {{field in the}} inter-electrode gap. In the case of negative <b>energisation</b> of the sharp high-voltage (HV) electrode in atmospheric air, negative space charge reduces the ideal Laplacian electric field {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode, which may result in an increase in the breakdown voltage (corona stabilisation effect). Such stabilisation can be used in repetitive plasma closing switches to maintain the same voltage level between HV impulses generated by pulsed power systems. Positive <b>energisation</b> of the HV electrode in air demonstrates lower breakdown voltage due to less pronounced space charge effects, resulting in a reduced field-grading effect. The present paper reports on an investigation into breakdown characteristics in point-plane electrode topologies stressed with positive and negative DC voltages, and HV impulses produced by a Marx generator with maximal voltage of 100 kV and rise time of ~ 800 ns. It has been shown that the corona stabilisation effect strongly depends upon the polarity of HV <b>energisation</b> and electrode topology: radius of curvature of the point electrode and inter-electrode distance. In the present paper stainless steel electrodes with three different curvatures have been used: 0. 115 mm, 1. 0 mm and 2. 5 mm. The gap width has been varied from 2 to 20 mm. At shorter distances the stressed air gap demonstrated the same values of positive and negative breakdown voltages. However, the critical gap could be identified at which the negative breakdown voltage becomes higher than the positive one, and with an increase in the inter-electrode distance this difference in the breakdown voltages continues to grow. This identification of the critical gap width and corresponding critical breakdown voltage allows the development of switch topologies with well pronounced corona stabilisation effect. In the case of impulse stresses, the critical breakdown time has been obtained as a maximum pre-breakdown time, which is identical for impulses of both polarities. With further increase in the gas spacing, the pre-breakdown time for negative impulses increases significantly as compared with the time to breakdown for positive impulses (~ 3 fold increase has been observed for the point electrode with the radius of 2. 5 mm, from ~ 500 ns to ~ 1500 ns). This systematic study provides valuable information on corona stabilisation effect as a function of the electrode curvature, inter-electrode distance and HV polarity. Based on the obtained results, an algorithm for the development of corona stabilised electrode topologies has been established. This may help in the design of advanced plasma closing switches for pulse power systems which require a high level of operational stability...|$|E

The impacts of these transients on such cables are measured based on the stress arising as a result of the voltage and current peaks and the frequency of oscillatory transients. These quantities are typically obtained from a simulation by using a suitable cable model, normally with the capability to predict the transient behaviour in the range up to several 10 kHz. To obtain a cable model that enables the accurate determination of the switching transient behaviour of a cable system in service, comparison of simulated data with actual measured data is a vital process before the cable model is selected and then used for further transient analysis. Statistical studies are then carried out to simulate the stress experienced by the underground cable under study.

Modelling of this behaviour on a suitable simulation platform is an attractive approach, in many cases, provided that the results closely match real-world behaviour. This thesis presents modelling and analysis of transients resulting from <b>energisation</b> of an unloaded cable using PSCAD®/EMTDC™ simulation software. An assessment of the applicability of existing frequency-dependent (FD) cable models is given. The impact of transients on a simulated cable system is also presented and discussed. In cable system modelling, system components must be accurately modelled, primarily the underground cable. Two common frequency-dependent cable models are based on the travelling wave method, namely the FD-Mode and FD-Phase models. These models are investigated by comparing their ability to predict <b>energisation</b> current transients resulting from the switching of an unloaded 132 kV underground cable. The simulated results are validated by comparison with the measurement data. It was found that, the FD-Phase model provides more accurate results compared to the FD-Mode model. This model is widely applicable and suitable for use in modelling a wide range of frequencies. The FD-Phase model was used in this study to analyse the distribution of overvoltages at sending and receiving ends of the cable system. Specifically, statistical analysis has been carried out correlating the overvoltage magnitudes induced and the closing behaviour of the circuit breaker (CB). Two statistical switching techniques have been applied, namely the deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Based on the approaches studied, results from probabilistic techniques are recommended owing {{to the fact that it}} is closer to reality...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{response}} plays a {{key role}} in the evaluation of the performance of grounding systems and for the protection of electrical installations under lightning strikes. The frequency spectrum of the lightning impulse contains harmonics components up to the megahertz range. The measured transient response of grounding systems under test may be distorted by spurious high frequency interference in the acquired signals, which presents challenges for the accurate analysis of high frequency performance of such systems. In this paper, the high frequency performance of a rod electrode is investigated based on measurements of its transient response under impulse <b>energisation.</b> A practical method is implemented to eliminate the high frequency noise in the measured voltage and current shapes, which allows a frequency domain analysis based Fast Fourier Transforms...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation technology (μ-ESP), which uses superposition of sub-microsecond high field pulses and DC electric field. Short impulses allow the application of higher voltages to the ionisation electrodes of a precipitation system without the initiation of breakdown. These higher levels of electric field generate higher ionic concentrations, resulting in more efficient charging of the airborne particles and can potentially improve precipitation efficiency. The present work is focused on analysis of the behavior of impulsive positive corona discharges in coaxial reactor designed for precipitation studies. The efficiency of precipitation of coarse and fine particles has been investigated using the different DC and impulse voltage levels in order to establish optimal <b>energisation</b> modes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop the use of {{fluorescent}} probes for studying structural changes in biochemical systems. The investigation {{was carried out in}} two major ways:- 	 chromophoric molecules with different structures and fluorescence 	properties were used in an attempt to discover the structural 	characteristics needed to make a fluorescent molecule behave 	as a probe. 	 biochemical systems of differing complexity were studied using 	ANS (1 -anilino-naphthalene- 8 -sulphonate) and other probes to see 	what sort of information this probe technique could give. The 	two main biochemical systems used were:- (i) the ligand induced 	conformational change of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and, 	(ii) energy dependent structural changes in submitochondrial 	particles (SMP). (i. e. those changes induced in mitochondrial 	membrane fragments by oxidisable substrate which could be 	reversed by uncoupling agents). a) MNS (2 -(N-methyl anilino) -naphthalene- 6 -sulphonate) and MNS-Cl were synthesised in an attempt to label GDH covalently with an ANS type molecule. MNS was shown to behave {{in the same way as}} ANS, but with a larger blue shift of fluorescence on binding, and a larger enhancement accompanying the conformational change (3 fold instead of 2 fold). MNS-Cl denatured the enzyme even under mild conditions of modification. A variety of dansyl (l-dimethylamino-naphthalene- 5 -sulphonyl) amino acids were used to probe the conformational change of GDH. The dansyl derivatives of glutamate and inhibitors of the enzyme had their fluorescence quenched by NADH + GTP. In contrast the dansyl derivatives of the monocarboxylic amino acids (whose oxidation is activated by the conformational change) had their fluorescence enhanced by NADH + GTP. Despite this specificity there were large numbers of dansyl amino acid binding sites on GDH (ca 35 per oligomer). Comparison of these responses with those of the MNS-amides showed that in order to detect the structural change in GDH, a probe needed to be negatively charged and to have the negative charge close to the aromatic part of the probe. In order to detect energy dependent changes in SMP a probe again needed to be negatively charged. However, in this case the negative charge did not have to be as close to the aromatic part of the probe as with the GDH system. Neutral, non-polar probes bind in the lipid phase of the membrane where they cannot sense energy dependent changes in SMP or ionic strength changes in erythrocyte stroma. The negative charge is important in directing the probe to the area of the membrane where it can sense structural changes. In order to test what type of negative charge was required, three 9 -anilino acridine derivatives with different acidic groups in the aniline ring were synthesised. Only the sulphonate derivative responded to energy dependent changes in SMP, indicating a preference for this group rather than carboxylate or arsonate. b) (i) A limited amount of information was obtained concerning GDH. L-Glu enhanced the fluorescence of bound NADH, while D-Glu had no effect and andalpha;Kg was a potent quencher. These sharp differences are difficult to explain since all three molecules bind at the same site on GDH. andalpha;Kg also shifted the conformational equilibrium, making GTP much more effective at inducing the conformational change. The reason for this is as yet unclear. (ii) The responses of the polarity sensitive probes ANS and MNS, and of the excimer forming probe PS (pyrene- 3 -sulphonate) to the energy dependent changes in SMP were studied and compared. ANS and MNS bound rapidly to the membrane surface and slowly diffused to internal sites. The energy dependent response was a property of the internal sites only. On binding to SMP no excimer formation by PS was detectable. However, on <b>energisation</b> excimer fluorescence appeared, accompanied by a decrease in monomer fluorescence. This must be due to either an increase in PS concentration within the membrane or to decreased viscosity. Comparison of the rates of fluorescence decrease following uncoupling revealed a common fast phase (t andfrac 12; = 2 sec) with a slow phase characteristic of each probe (t andfrac 12; = 12 (ANS), 30 (PS), 60 (MNS) secs). The rates of the slow phases of ANS and PS correlated well with those measured for probe efflux by independent methods. This suggested that the fast phase was a rapid membrane change, followed by a efflux of probe from the membrane (slow phase). Binding parameters for ANS and MNS were measured by conventional fluorescence techniques. There was an increase in binding and in quantum yield of bound ANS and MNS on <b>energisation</b> of SMP. A novel filtration method was developed for measuring PS binding and showed a two fold increase in PS bound to SMP after <b>energisation.</b> However, this increase was not large enough to account for the observed excimer fluorescence. The technique was also used to verify the fluorescence results for ANS binding. By measuring fluorescence polarisation and life-times of ANS and MNS in resting and energised SMP, it was possible to rule out viscosity changes as a cause of the PS fluorescence changes. It was therefore proposed that all the probe effects could be explained if <b>energisation</b> involved expulsion of water from the membrane. This hypothesis was tested by examining the energy dependent responses of ANS and MNS in D 2 O and H 2 O. in free solution D 2 O quenches ANS (and MNS) fluorescence less than H 2 O giving an isotope effect of 2. 8 (2. 4). This effect was lowered for both probes on binding to SMP. On <b>energisation,</b> there was a further lowering of the isotope effect on MNS. This suggested that the internal sites at which ANS and MNS bind are partially excluded from water and that on <b>energisation</b> this exclusion increases. By comparing ANS with NPN (N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine) and other neutral probes, it was shown that the probe binding sites are close to the membrane protein, and are probably at interfaces between hydrophobic and aqueous regions within the membrane, i. e. in an area where the probe could easily sense water exclusion. A theory of the energised state of SMP was proposed, based on the suggestion that <b>energisation</b> involves water expulsion. The theory accounted for the observed probe responses, as well as for proton uptake, and provided a driving force for phosphorylation. One probe ABS (2 -methoxy, 6 -chloro, 9 -acridinyl-p-amino benzene sulphonate) had an electron transport dependent response (as well as an energy dependent one), which appeared to follow the rate of oxidation of coenzyme Q. </p...|$|E
