40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an investigation on cold bending process using simulation and experimental study. The experimental and simulation {{were performed on}} stainless steel 304 sheet metal in air V-bending. The factors {{involved in the process}} are punch radius, die radius, die gap, punch travel and punch velocity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the factors that affect the springback behavior of stainless steel in air V-bending using Finite Element Method (FEM) software Simufact-FormingTM version and material database MatILDa. The simulation parameters followed the actual setting under consideration of the machine characteristic and friction. The simufact. formingTM simulation was further verified using hydraulic press machine which determine the desired speed of the <b>forming</b> <b>punch.</b> As the final result, comparison effect of springback between simulation and experiment is presented. The simulated data from simufact. formingTM are in good agreement with experimental. Introduction. One of the most widely used process in sheet metal forming is bending. Bending of sheet metal forming is command and important process in the manufacturing industries to produce a various of automobiles, aircraft and casing of electronic parts.

40|$|In impact {{resistance}} of reinforced concrete (RC) panels against projectiles {{the contribution of}} the orthogonal mesh reinforcement has been ignored. In this study the contribution of mesh reinforcement to {{impact resistance}} and itseffect on the nature of local damage caused by impact of non-deformable projectiles are investigated. The investigation included a combination of 53 experiments and series of finite-element based numerical simulations. Three levels of local damage modes were investegated based on the severity of the degree of damage in the impacted panels. Mesh reinforcement ratio within the range of reinforcement ratio considered, namely 0. 19 % to 0. 48 %, was irrelevant to the impact behavior of RC panels under different impact velocities, while bar spacing was to be a controlling parameter for the degree of damage. RC panels reinforced with bar spacing greater than 1. 5 times the panel thickness have a tendency to spall concrete from the back face more than RC panels with closely spaced bars. RC panels reinforced with bar spacing greater than 1. 5 time the panel thickness <b>formed</b> <b>punching</b> shear crater, while panels reinforced with less than that limit distributed the damage over a wider area without <b>forming</b> the <b>punching</b> shear crater on the back face. Orthogonal mesh reinforcement with bars spaced no wider than one-third of the projectile diameter were able to prevent the projectiles from perforating the panels. Offseting the reinforcing meshes did not improve the impact resistance of RC panels. An equation was developed to estimate the perforation resistance of an RC panel under impact of non- deformable projectile with given mass, diameter, and impact velocity. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For the {{fabrication}} of lightweight components such as hollow components, {{we proposed a}} cold extrusion method for forming of deep holes that utilizes a punch with an internal channel for the supply of liquid lubricant using a servo press. The relationship between the punch ram motion and the punch wear in the proposed forming method is investigated by the finite element analysis in this study. The punch wear is determined by using the Archard’s equation. Although low friction at specimen–punch interface realizes in the <b>forming</b> with pulse <b>punch</b> ram motion (proposed <b>forming</b> method), the <b>punch</b> wear in the backward extrusion with pulse punch ram motion is 1. 1 – 2. 4 times larger than that with no pulse punch ram motion (conventional forming method).

First, electrotyping allowed matrices to be <b>formed</b> around <b>punches</b> of any metal, so punches increasingly began {{to be made in}} soft typemetal. In addition, the arrival of pantograph engraving allowed punches (or matrices) themselves to be cut by machine from large working drawings, allowing more precise results and transferring the place of individual craftsmanship from the engraving stage to a drawing office. Some punchcutters did continue to hold prestige for their work, for example Malin in Paris and P. H. Raedisch in Haarlem, into the early or mid-twentieth century.|$|R
