5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French faction, twenty-two in the Imperial faction, and four neutral; thus Guise judged {{it impossible for}} either faction to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French faction were only likely {{to vote for a}} fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would then have been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely unacceptable to the Imperial faction and the Farnese.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E

25|$|Christian Zionists often {{support the}} State of Israel {{because of the}} ancestral right of the Jews to the Holy Land, as suggested, for instance, by the apostle Paul <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the , in the Bible.

25|$|Although the Soviet Union's {{position}} in the crisis was as helpless as was the United States' regarding Hungary's uprising, Premier Nikolai Bulganin threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side, and to launch rocket attacks on Britain, France and Israel.

The Greek church commemorates this miracle on the 7th of May.

25|$|Moreover, Marx's {{rejection}} {{of the necessity of}} bourgeois revolution and appreciation of the obschina, the communal land system, in Russia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> Vera Zasulich; respect for the egalitarian culture of North African Muslim commoners found in his letters from Algeria; and sympathetic and searching investigation of the global commons and indigenous cultures and practices in his notebooks, including the Ethnological Notebooks that he kept during his last years, all point to a historical Marx who was continuously developing his ideas until his deathbed and does not fit into any pre-existing ideological straitjacket.|$|E

25|$|During the Russo-Turkish War, Senyavin {{was present}} at Fidonisi and Ochakov and went to Saint Petersburg to inform the Empress about the former victory. He was {{promoted}} to adjudant general in 1788. Although he distinguished himself {{in command of the}} battleship Navarchia during the Battle of Caliacria, he had no patience with Ushakov's cautious and cunctatory approach and paid little attention to his authority, which resulted in his confinement to a guardhouse and the threat of his reduction in rank.

25|$|Arius {{objected to}} Origen's doctrine, {{complaining}} about it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> the Nicomedian Eusebius, {{who had also}} studied under Lucian. Nevertheless, despite disagreeing with Origen on this point, Arius found solace in his writings, which used expressions that favored Arius's contention that the Logos was of a different substance than the Father, and owed his existence to his Father's will. However, because Origen's theological speculations were often proffered to stimulate further inquiry rather than {{to put an end}} to any given dispute, both Arius and his opponents were able to invoke the authority of this revered (at the time) theologian during their debate.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> David Ben-Gurion dated 9 January 1968, he {{explained}} that he was convinced that Israel had ignored his warnings and overstepped the bounds of moderation by taking possession of Jerusalem, and Jordanian, Egyptian, and Syrian territory by force of arms. He felt Israel had exercised repression and expulsions during the occupation and that it amounted to annexation. He said that provided Israel withdrew its forces, it appeared that {{it might be possible to}} reach a solution through the UN framework which could include assurances of a dignified and fair future for refugees and minorities in the Middle East, recognition from Israel's neighbours, and freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal.|$|E
