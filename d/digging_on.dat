25|$|In 1928, Frederick M. Smith, {{president}} of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) and grandson of Joseph Smith, feared that rising water from the Mississippi River would destroy the grave site. He authorized civil engineer William O. Hands to conduct an excavation to find the Smiths' bodies. Hands conducted extensive <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> the Smith homestead, and located the bodies, as well as finding the remains of Joseph's wife, Emma, who {{was buried in the}} same place. The remains—which were badly decomposed—were examined and photographed, and the bodies were reinterred close by in Nauvoo.|$|E
25|$|Leeman, {{who kept}} a journal, rallied his crew. They found water by <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> an {{offshore}} islet, and then killed seals and dried the meat, using the skins {{to raise the}} sides of the boat. Leeman even constructed his own compass. They then set sail for Java. They made their way up the Western Australian coast, and after a voyage of 2500km reached the eastern end of Java with the loss of only one man. In endeavouring to land their boat was wrecked and many of the men ran off into the jungle. Leeman and his three remaining companions then walked the full length of the south coast of Java, through jungle, volcanic country, braving marauding tigers along the way. Upon getting to the western end of Java they were captured by a Javanese prince and held for ransom. The Dutch then paid the ransom and Leeman and his compatriots finally made it to Batavia (Jakarta) on 23 September 1658.|$|E

25|$|German {{analysis}} of the battle was collected in a memorandum of June 1915 and led to renewed emphasis on providing shelters for the infantry, which were deep enough to resist heavy artillery and {{to increase the number}} of defensive positions behind the front, which would slow an advance and delay subsequent attacks, by forcing the attacker to move artillery into range. On 7 June a copy of Note 5779 was captured on the Artois front and the local corps commander ordered that intensive digging be undertaken and stipulated that reserve positions were to be as solidly built as front line defences. Much of the new <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> the rest of the Western Front was done on reverse slopes, invisible to ground observers and capable of being engaged only by howitzer-fire. The French methods of attack had been made obsolete, by the time of the resumption of the offensive in September 1915, when many French troops were killed on such slopes, in front of uncut wire before an undamaged second position.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of March 4, 1866, Libelle struck the eastern reef of Wake Island during a gale. Commanded by Captain Anton Tobias, the ship was en route from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Among its {{passengers}} were the 50-year-old English-born opera singer Madame Anna Bishop (on {{the first leg of}} a Far East tour), her second husband and New York diamond merchant Martin Schultz, pianist and vocalist Charles Lascelles, Eugene Van Reed who was the first Consul General of the then independent Kingdom of Hawaii to the Court of the Emperor of Japan, and Imperial Japanese military officer Yabe Kisaboro. After a night on board the vessel now stuck on the reef, the passengers and crew reached the shore with very limited supplies such as some bedding, a barrel of beef, several bags of flour and some kegs of wine. After three days of searching and <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> the island for water the crew was able to recover a 200-gallon water tank from the wrecked ship. Valuable cargo was also recovered and buried on the island including some of the 1,000 flasks of mercury (quicksilver), as well as coins and precious stones valued at $93,943.08. After three weeks with a dwindling water supply and no sign of rescue, the passengers and crew decided to leave Wake and attempt to sail to Guam (the center of the then Spanish colony of the Mariana Islands) on the two remaining boats from Libelle. The 22 passengers and some of the crew sailed in the 22 foot longboat under the command of the first mate Rudolf Kausch and the remainder of the crew sailed with Captain Tobias in the 20 foot gig. On April 8, 1866, after thirteen days of frequent squalls, short rations, and tropical sun, the longboat reached Guam. The gig, commanded by the captain, was lost at sea.|$|E

A Bedouin tribe was digging through a mound called Tell Hariri for a gravestone {{that would be used}} for a recently deceased tribesman, when they came across a headless statue. After the news reached the French authorities currently in control of Syria, the report was investigated, and <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> the site was started on December 14, 1933 by archaeologists from the Louvre in Paris. The location of the fragment was excavated, revealing the temple of Ishtar, which led to the commencing of the full scale excavations.

It also houses the tourist information centre. Also in Glastonbury, the Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum {{of the social and}} agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey.

It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a Scheduled monument. The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian and early 20th century periods. Other exhibits show local crafts, including willow coppicing, mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay, peat <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> the Somerset Levels and the production of milk, cheese, and cider. In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh, the story of one farm worker, John Hodges, is told from cradle to grave. Outside, there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep in the cider apple orchard.|$|E
2500|$|Violation {{of these}} rules {{was thought to}} cause illness. This system of taboos, known as awem in the Urapmin language, was {{well-developed}} and shaped everyday life. Those who became ill due to disrespecting the land or animals of the motobil would pray for the spirits to [...] "unhand" [...] them, or if this did not work they would sacrifice pigs in order to appease the spirits. Recently, the Urapmin required gold prospectors to sacrifice to these spirits before <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> their land, although this pre-emptive use of sacrifice is new to the Urapmin.|$|E

2500|$|In {{subsequent}} years the legal position became unclear {{as a series}} of English and American cases decided that landowners were entitled to buried valuables. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court reconsidered the rule in 1908. The case before it involved three workers who had found coins while <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> their employer's land. The Court decided {{along the lines of the}} 1904 Oregon case and awarded the coins to the finders. For the next 30 years, the courts of a number of states, including Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin, applied this modified [...] "treasure trove" [...] rule, most recently in 1948. Since that time, however, the rule has fallen out of favour. Modern legal texts regard it as [...] "a recognized, if not controlling, rule of decision", but one commentator has called it [...] "a minority rule of dubious heritage that was misunderstood and misapplied in a few states between 1904 and 1948".|$|E

60|$|On the whole, we {{will say}} our new Mayor Bailly; our new Commander Lafayette, named also 'Scipio-Americanus,' have bought their preferment dear. Bailly rides in gilt state-coach, with beefeaters and sumptuosity; Camille Desmoulins, and others, {{sniffing}} {{at him for}} it: Scipio bestrides the 'white charger,' and waves with civic plumes in sight of all France. Neither of them, however, does it for nothing; but, in truth, at an exorbitant rate. At this rate, namely: of feeding Paris, and keeping it from fighting. Out of the City-funds, some seventeen thousand of the utterly destitute are employed <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> Montmartre, at tenpence a day, which buys them, at market price, almost two pounds of bad bread;--they look very yellow, when Lafayette goes to harangue them.

That apart from the 'seventeen thousand utterly necessitous, <b>digging</b> <b>on</b> Montmartre,' most of whom, indeed, have got passes, and been dismissed into Space 'with four shillings,'--there is a strike, or union, of Domestics out of place; who assemble for public speaking: next, a strike of Tailors, for even they will strike and speak; further, a strike of Journeymen Cordwainers; a strike of Apothecaries: so dear is bread. (Histoire Parlementaire, ii. 359, 417, 423.)
