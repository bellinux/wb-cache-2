In this paper, we newly define code smells by using specification language OCL and use these models in auto detection. To construct our new code smells model, we first transform java source into XMI document format based on JavaEAST metamodel which is expanded from JavaAST meta-model. The prepared OCL will be run through OCL component based on <b>Eclipse</b> plug-in.
