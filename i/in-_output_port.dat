40|$|An {{innovative}} {{design is}} presented enabling fine positioning {{of each individual}} fibre in a fibre array used in multi <b>in-</b> and <b>output</b> <b>ports</b> photonic integrated circuits. With this technology, the performance of fibre arrays can improve by eliminating the eccentricities of the lenses deposited on the individual fibres and the inaccuracies of the supporting Vgroove substrates. The alignment accuracy is in the sub-micron range and this concept is based on metal deformation by laser-welding induced local heat. It enables us to precisely introduce stepby-step deformations in the constructions (despite the already secured position of the fibre tips and the adjustment construction). The smallest fine-tuning step is 0. 05 µm and the fibres are aligned over a range of 10 µm – 25 µm. The performance {{of different types of}} regular commercially fabricated fibre arrays, with fibres mounted in silicon V-groove substrates has been determined in order to compare these with the performance of the proposed fibre array design...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for enhancing the modifiability and reuse of telecommunications software systems is described. The problem domain is first partitioned into {{tasks that are}} assigned to distinct software program modules (901, 902). In one embodiment, each of the software modules (901, 902) have multiple <b>output</b> <b>ports</b> (911, 912). Each <b>output</b> <b>port</b> (911, 912) provides a mechanism to link the software module (901, 902) to a specific version of a different program module (903, 904). The multiple <b>output</b> <b>ports</b> are used to selectively link the module to one of several versions of a different program module. The linking is performed as early as system design time or as late as run-time, or at any intermediate time between the two. The use of <b>output</b> <b>ports</b> makes software modules less dependent on each other and also simplifies the 'hot-swapping' or dynamic replacement of one module by another at run-time. In an alternative embodiment, each of the software modules (800) has a unitary <b>output</b> <b>port</b> (802) where each <b>output</b> <b>port</b> comprises an array of linking records.
