Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back to the world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money {{in order to create a}} conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|While critics often praised The West Wing for its writing, others faulted {{the show}} as unrealistically optimistic and sentimental.

40|$|First, 2050 is {{very far}} away. Here are two quotes about change which frame my {{decision}} to take a modest view of developments within the next 5 – 10 years. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> bankrupt? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly. – Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises We tend to overestimate {{the effect of a}} technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. – Amara’s Law. Second, while some of my remarks are reasonably general, they are influenced by a library perspective. And third, a note about technology and networking: we often tend to talk about the impact of network-ing or technology on features of the environment, rather than on the environment as a whole. The most interesting questions about impact though are often systemic, about how the environment as a whole may change as the interactions between the parts change. For example, changes in research and learn-ing behaviors and expectations are more important for the academic library than any library technology changes per se. Similarly, how networking reshapes library organization, collaboration and scope will have more impact in the medium term than any particular local technology adoption. My plan of action is to discuss four very general themes and then to make some general observations about library change and LIS (Library and Information Science) education in this context.

As part of the curriculum designed for an actor getting into character, I try to imagine what’s going to really help bring this actor more fully into character. And so I try to imagine what experiences are going to make more dimensional his intake of Frank, so that he is Frank spontaneously when I’m shooting. So one of the most obvious things is it’d be pretty good if Caan was as good at doing what Frank does as is Frank.Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronnie Caan served as the film's producers.|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} a first attempt to measure and explain, from an {{economic}} perspective, the religious behavior of uruguayans (women in this stage), and compare the results with those obtained for some Latin American and developed countries. In this first stage, the efforts were concentrated {{in the interpretation of}} the religious behavior from an microeconomic perspective, considering the individual decision about church attendance and its frequency. With this aim, we analyze the relation between the religious degree of the individuals (measured through a variable created combining two questions of the used surveys Are <b>you</b> religious? <b>How</b> often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the temple?) and diverse personal characteristics such as age, education, marital status, among others (solely for women from 25 to 54 years old in the case of Uruguay). We confirmed that uruguayans are less religious than the people of the other countries considered (Chile, Spain, Mexico and the United States), that the religious activity is more intense for women and older people, and that the education level have an ambiguous effect on the intensity of the religious activity. In addition, in the case of Uruguay, greater levels of deprivation imply greater levels of religious activity. church attendance, religion, religious activity, religion and socioeconomic variables. ...|$|R
