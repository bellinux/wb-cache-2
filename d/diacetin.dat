50|$|Females {{will feed}} {{themselves}} with nectar {{of a variety}} of flowers, but will only use oil and pollen from Lysimachia plants for provisioning. Females are found around Lysimachia plants in times of full sun and collect oil and pollen simultaneously. Because Lysimachia plants produce fatty oils in the place of nectar, oil-bees like Macropis nuda are the main pollinators of these plants. Little was known about the chemical communication for how Macropis bees find Lysimachia plants until a 2007 study of Lysimachia chemical indicators. Flower-specific chemicals were identified by gas chromatography, then Macropis species were used to test if these flower-specific chemicals were the source of attraction. The identified compounds in Lysimachia plants were found to be strong attractors of Macropis bees, and are seldom found in other plants. The interaction between floral oil secreting plants and oil-collecting bees {{is one of the most}} specialized of all pollinating systems. A 2015 study identified <b>diacetin,</b> a volatile acteylated glycerol, as a key volatile used by oil-collecting bees like M. nuda to locate food sources. <b>Diacetin</b> is the first demonstrated private form of communication between plant and pollinator.|$|E

Ethyl acetate {{was used as}} reactant and entrainer to remove the produced ethanol during the reaction, through azeotrope formation. Since the azeotrope of ethyl acetate and ethanol forms at 70 oC, all the experiments were performed at this temperature. Para-toluene sulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, and Amberlyst 36 were used as catalyst. The effect of process parameters including ethyl acetate to glycerol molar ratio (6 - 12), reaction time (3 - 9 h), and the catalyst to glycerol weight (2. 5 - 9. 0 %), on the conversion and products selectivities were investigated. Under reflux conditions, 100 % glycerol conversion was obtained with 45 %, 44 %, and 11 % selectivity to monoacetin, <b>diacetin,</b> and triacetin, respectively. Azeotropic reactive distillation led to 100 % conversion of glycerol with selectivities of 3 %, 48 % and 49 % for monoacetin, <b>diacetin,</b> and triacetin. During the azeotropic reactive distillation, {{it was possible to}} remove ethanol to shift the equilibrium towards <b>diacetin</b> and triacetin. Therefore, the total selectivity to <b>diacetin</b> and triacetin was increased from 55 % to 97 % through azeotropic distillation...|$|E

One of the most important functions of the cover is to protect the burned surfaces from drying out and to constitute the first defence against microbial invasion. In this study composite sheets crosslinked either in presence of glicerol or <b>diacetin,</b> obtained by reinforcing PHEMA with a tricot PET net have been implanted subacute in rabbits, to test their biocompatibility.

Triacetin and <b>diacetin</b> were tested to improve CDA processing versus conventional phthalate as environmentally sustainable plasticizers, because of their low toxicity and fast biodegradability. The addition of triacetin and <b>diacetin</b> allowed melt processing of CDA {{and the results of}} tensile tests outlined their effect as plasticizers. The values of mechanical properties were compatible with the requirements for applications in rigid packaging. From the results of biodegradation tests it can be concluded that for pure cellulose acetate, complete biodegradation was obtained within 200 days of testing after reinoculation.

It was observed that the catalytic activity increases with the amount of PW immobilized into silica, either by the sol–gel method or by the impregnation method. High values of selectivity to <b>diacetin</b> were obtained with all catalyst. The effect of various parameters, such as, reaction temperature, catalyst loading, molar ratio of glycerol to acetic acid and reusability of PW-in-S 2 were studied to optimize the reaction conditions.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{polypyrrole}} supported WO 3 were fabricated and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, XPS, BET, TGA, and FESEM-EDX. The {{activity of the}} catalysts was tested in glycerol esterification with acetic acid, and it found that WO 3 -Ppy- 20 (nanocomposite with 20 % WO 3 loaded) showed the maximum catalyst activity with 98 % and selectivity of 70 % to triacetin at 110 °C with a reaction duration of 10 [*]h and also recorded the highest selectivity (75 %) for acetylation of glycerol to monoacetin with about 59 % conversion only. The highest acidity of WO 3 -Ppy- 20 is also confirmed using TPD-NH 3 analysis. The activity and selectivity to triacetin of the catalyst were enhanced by increasing WO 3 loading amount, resulting in 82 % conversion for WO 3 -Ppy- 5 with about 32 and 50 % selectivity to monoacetin and <b>diacetin</b> and about 18 % selectivity to triacetin; in case of WO 3 -Ppy- 20, these amounts were changed to 5, 25, and 70 % selectivity to monoacetin, <b>diacetin,</b> and triacetin, respectively with the conversion of 98 %. TPD-NH 3 analysis found that polypyrrole supported WO 3 increases the catalyst acidity of WO 3. BET and FESEM analyses revealed that WO 3 particles were well dispersed with the smallest average size in nanocomposite compared to pure WO 3, which could contribute to the high activity of WO 3 -Ppy catalyst for esterification of glycerol...|$|E

30|$|Importantly, {{the scope}} of the {{reaction}} was also extended to the valorization of crude glycerol (GlyBio) from a biodiesel company [27]. The biocatalyst selectively converted crude glycerol into monoacetin with moderate conversion at low flow rate (0.5  mL.min- 1, 4.8  min of residence time) in the presence of ethyl acetate at 60 °C. Promisingly, the use of vinyl acetate promoted triacetin production (84 %) at low flow rate (0.5  mL.min- 1, 4.8  min of residence time), with only small quantities of diacetins observed under the investigated conditions. <b>Diacetin</b> production increased to 70 % and 60 % (1.5  mL.min- 1 and 3.0  mL.min- 1, respectively) at higher residence times (14.4 and 28.8  min for 1.5  mL.min- 1 and 3.0  mL.min- 1, respectively).|$|E

40|$|International audiencePotentially {{effective}} glycerol-based solvents for nitrocellulose {{have been}} designed using a top-down in silico procedure that combines Computer Assisted Organic Synthesis (CAOS) and Molecular Design (CAMD). Starting from a bio-based building block – glycerol – {{a large number of}} synthetically feasible chemical structures {{have been designed}} using the GRASS (GeneratoR of Agro-based Sustainable Solvents) program. GRASS applies well-selected industrial chemical transformations to glycerol together with a limited number of relevant co-reactants. Then, the most promising structures are considered as lead compounds for further modification in silico thanks to the IBSS (InBioSynSolv) program, which generates derivatives with alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkene, cycloalkene or phenyl substituents. Finally, IBSS ranks all the candidates according to the value of their overall performance function to best fit the predefined specifications, i. e. (i) high solubilisation of nitrocellulose, (ii) slow evaporation and non-flammability (iii) low toxicity and environmental impact. This general strategy enables the highlighting of the most relevant solvent candidate derived from any building block for a given application. To validate the approach, 15 commercially available solvents derived from glycerol were confronted with nitrocellulose and led to highlight <b>diacetin</b> as an effective and safe solvent...|$|E
30|$|Karinen and Krause {{reported}} the etherification of glycerol with isobutene over acid exchange resin catalyst [6, 7]. Etherification of glycerol with tert-butanol over acid exchange resin or zeolite catalysts are also reported [8, 9]. Reddy et al. [10], and coworkers reported sulphated ceria-zirconia and ceria alumina type solid acid catalyst for glycerol acetylation to replace mineral acid based catalyst. Bagheri and Muhd [20], reviewed the various value added product formation from glycerol by bimetallic catalysts. Hence, utilization of glycerol by acetylating agent via catalytic method is another alternative methodology. The present study deals with bimetallic particle doped silica-alumina type solid acid catalyst preparation and tested for glycerol acetylation. The glycerol acetylaiton {{products such as}} mono, di and triacetyl esters have great industrial applications. The triacetylated derivative is known as triacetin and has application going from cosmetics to fuel additive [11, 12]. The mono and diacetylated esters (monoacetin and <b>diacetin)</b> are used in cryogenics and as raw material for production of biodegradable polyesters [13]. The aim of the present work deal with acetylation of glycerol over silver and copper incorporated rice husk silica-alumina solid acid catalyst to produce di and triacetylated glycerols with good selectivity under mild reaction conditions.

40|$|Glycerol is a {{low value}} {{molecule}} obtained as a sub-product from the manufacture of first generation biodiesel. The surplus of glycerol can be revaluated by its acetylation, forming high value molecules (monoacetin, <b>diacetin</b> and triacetin) {{which can be used}} in the polymer industry and as a biodiesel among other possibilities. This work provides a comparative study of the catalytic performances of a large scope of acid solids in the esterification of acetic acid with an excess of glycerol. Aluminium containing formulations (niobium oxide supported on commercial silica-alumina, aluminium phosphate) presented an inhibitory effect probably due to the amphoteric character of aluminium-bonded hydroxyl groups and the presence of basic sites where the limiting reagent (acetic acid) could be strongly adsorbed being unavailable for the reaction. Tungstated zirconia samples presented an inert behaviour, due to the deactivation of active sites by strong adsorption of water or glycerol. Tungstophosphoric acid immobilised by sol-gel technique in zirconia and silica, presented a high resistance to leaching. The strong interaction between the heteropolyacid and the matrixes led, however, to the lowering of the heteropolyacid acid strength, resulting in an absence of catalytic activity. Sulphated zirconia synthesised by sol-gel showed good catalytic activity. The lower the density of acid sites, the higher the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, these solids were undesirably deactivated due to sulphur leaching, thus also bringing an undesired contamination of the final products. Commercial ion exchange resins with strong Brønsted acid sites also exhibited very high catalytic performances. The lower the crosslinkage, the higher the resin swelling in the reaction medium, and thus the higher the catalytic activity. These solids were recyclable and active even in presence of water.

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} ever {{increasing}} quantities of glycerol produced as {{a by-product of}} the process of manufacture of bio-diesel serve as a fuel for research about the alternative uses of glycerol. The esterification of glycerol with acetic acid over Cesium supported heteropolyacid (CsPWA) serving as the catalyst was carried out. The products obtained were mono, di and tri acetins which have wide application as biofuels. A series of experiments were carried out with CsPWA as catalyst and parameters considered for studies were temperature, molar ratio of reactants (acetic acid:glycerol) and the catalyst loading weight percent. Each parameter was varied keeping the other two constant and the results were recorded. Temperature was varied from 80 °C to 110 °C; molar ratio of glycerol to acetic acid is between 3 : 1 and 9 : 1 and catalyst loading of 3 %w/w to 7 %w/w. The yield and conversion varied for different conditions, but in general, the yield of <b>diacetin</b> and triacetin increased with time. Optimum parameters were adjudged to be 110 °C with a molar ratio of 9 : 1 of the reactants and catalyst loading being 5 % weight of reaction mixture where maximum glycerol conversion of 98 % was obtained. The results obtained indicate that the esterification of glycerol with acetic acid is a consecutive reaction and the kinetic model was developed based on homogeneous first order reaction series by optimization method using MATLAB, and rate constants (k 1, k 2 and k 3) were determined. From the rate constants at different temperatures, using Arrhenius equation the activation energies (E 1, E 2 and E 3) were also determined...|$|E

40|$|The {{spread of}} breast cancer {{worldwide}} {{and the need for}} new technologies to improve breast cancer detection present a challenge to the standard medical screening methods. Tumour detection, in the early stages, is crucial if patients are to be treated effectively and with minimally invasive procedures. Thus, any technique that can improve on, or add to, existing breast tumour detection methods is welcome. In this thesis just such a technique based on near-field microwave imaging is investigated, both theoretically and experimentally. The electromagnetic waves interaction with dielectric structure is fundamental for any microwave application. Thus it is essential to understand the interaction of the microwaves radiated from the sensor (open-ended rectangular waveguide) with the breast structure under investigation. A detailed mathematical model describing the interaction of microwaves emitted from an open rectangular wave-guide with an N-layer dielectric structure is developed, using the Fourier Transform Matching method. The model is capable of calculating the electric field properties anywhere within the N-layer structure, as well as the complex reflection coefficient existing at the waveguide aperture. Computer simulations, based on the mathematical formulations derived using the Fourier Transform Matching method, of the near-field radiation patterns in a 3 -layer approximation to the general N-layer model are presented. Such simulations are most useful in assessing the suitability of near-field microwave non-invasive testing and evaluation (NIT&E) technique for breast tumour detection. In addition, simulated 1 -D and 2 -D reflection phase and magnitude images are calculated and presented for the 3 -layer structure with an inclusion to represent the presence of a tumour. Parameters controlling the detection sensitivity, specifically the frequency of operation, waveguide filling, and standoff distance dielectric filling, are investigated to obtain the optimal - 2 - parameters for the inspection system. The theoretical simulations show that a high sensitivity in both reflection coefficient magnitude and phase should be obtainable. Experimental measurements of the reflection coefficient magnitude and phase when imaging a breast phantom that imitates real breast dielectric properties contrast are also presented. The phantom comprises a plexiglass container filled with soybean oil to represent normal breast tissue, with a small balloon filled with <b>diacetin</b> solution to represent the tumour. Both uncalibrated and calibrated measurements of reflection coefficient magnitude and phase were performed. The microwave source comprised an open-ended rectangular waveguide operating in the frequency range of approximately 8. 2 to 12. 4 GHz. Calibrated measurements were performed using a slotted waveguide system. An in-depth analysis between calibrated measurements and simulation results for a simple dielectric structure is illustrated to verify the simulation results. Then, calibrated measurements for breast phantom are obtained. Finally, a theoretical-versus-experimental qualitative assessment for the breast phantom verifies the mathematical model developed in the thesis. Thus, a near-field microwave non-invasive detection prototype is designed to experimentally detect tumour presence via measuring the sensor’s aperture reflection coefficient.
