5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a <b>glass</b> <b>electrode</b> and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ambulatory {{oesophageal}} pH-impedance monitoring is {{a widely}} used test to evaluate patients with reflux symptoms. Several types of pH electrodes are available: antimony, ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET), and <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes.</b> These pH electrodes have not been compared directly, and it is uncertain whether these different types of pH electrodes result in similar outcome. METHODS: In an in-vitro model the response time, sensitivity, and drift of an antimony, ISFET, and <b>glass</b> pH <b>electrode</b> were assessed simultaneously after calibration at 22 degrees C and at 37 degrees C. All measurements were performed at 37 degrees C and repeated five times with new catheters of each type. Fifteen patients with reflux symptoms underwent 24 -h pH monitoring off PPI therapy using antimony, ISFET, and <b>glass</b> pH <b>electrodes</b> simultaneously. RESULTS: After calibration at 22 degrees C, pH electrodes had similar response times, sensitivity and drift. In contrast to <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes,</b> antimony electrodes performed less accurately after calibration at 37 degrees C than after calibration at 22 degrees C. Calibration temperature did not affect ISFET electrodes significantly. During in-vivo experiments, {{significant differences were found}} in acid exposure times derived from antimony (4. 0 +/- 0. 8 %), ISFET (5. 7 +/- 1. 1 %), and <b>glass</b> pH <b>electrodes</b> (9. 0 +/- 1. 7 %). CONCLUSION: In vitro, antimony and <b>glass</b> pH <b>electrodes</b> are affected by different buffer components and temperature, respectively. In vivo, significant higher acid exposure times are obtained with <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes</b> compared with antimony and ISFET pH electrodes. ISFET electrodes produce stable in-vitro measurements and result in the most accurate in-vivo measurements of acid exposure tim...|$|R

25|$|Very precise {{measurements}} necessitate {{that the}} pH meter is calibrated before each measurement. More typically calibration is performed once per day of operation. Calibration is needed because the <b>glass</b> <b>electrode</b> {{does not give}} reproducible electrostatic potentials over longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{potential}} of the reference electrode need not be known accurately for most purposes and usually any electrode may be used provided its potential remains constant throughout the titration. The indicator electrode must be suitable for the particular type of titration (i.e. a <b>glass</b> <b>electrode</b> for acid-base reactions and a platinum electrode for redox titrations), and should reach equilibrium rapidly.|$|E
25|$|High-frequency {{treatment}} uses low-current high-frequency alternating currents, delivered via a <b>glass</b> <b>electrode.</b> Because {{the high}} frequency current converts {{some of the}} oxygen in the air into ozone, the treatment has a germicidal action, and is also drying and warming. Consequently, the treatment is used to aid healing and also to help desquamation (the skin's natural exfoliation) and stimulate sweat and sebaceous glands.|$|E

25|$|Potentiometric pH meters {{measure the}} voltage between two {{electrodes}} and display the result converted into the corresponding pH value.

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The <b>glass</b> <b>electrode</b> for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E

The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0. 90).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of combined glass microelectrodes with monocrystalline and polycrystalline antimony electrodes with external reference in a 24 -h dynamic in vitro study. DESIGN AND METHODS: In an artificial stomach, the pH of the contents titrated from pH 1 - 7 and back by NaOH and HCI was simultaneously measured at 37 degrees C with antimony and glass probes connected to three recording devices. The recorded data were compared with data monitored continuously by a laboratory pH measurement system. The sensitivity and drift of glass microelectrodes were also analysed in intensive-care unit patients during intragastric pH monitoring for up to 96 h. RESULTS: The sensitivities of antimony polycrystalline, monocrystalline and of <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes</b> were 54. 6, 55. 3, and 61. 8 mV/pH, respectively. The hysteresis was 6. 4, 7. 2 and 2. 75 mV for antimony polycrystalline, monocrystalline and for <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes,</b> respectively. The drift in 24 h was - 0. 1 pH for glass over the pH range 1 - 7, and + 0. 3 pH over pH 1 - 2. 5, and + 0. 15 pH over pH 2. 5 - 7 for both of the antimony electrodes. The response times of both antimony and <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes</b> were similar over the pH range 2. 5 - 7. The difference in the percentages of time below pH 1. 5 was significant: 28. 2 % for glass, 17. 3 % for antimony polycrystalline and 18. 1 % for monocrystalline electrodes, respectively (P < 0. 05). However, {{the difference in the}} percentages of time below pH 4 was not significant. After 96 h intragastric pH monitoring in six intensive-care unit patients, the mean drift of <b>glass</b> <b>electrodes</b> was 0. 15 pH (range, pH 0. 1 - 0. 2) and the mean change in sensitivity 1. 2 %.
