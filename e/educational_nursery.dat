El bajo desempe?o en las competencias lecto-escritoras identificado en el grado Sexto de la IE Domingo Savio motiv? la propuesta de investigaci?n orientada a fortalecer la comprensi?n lectora de textos narrativos a trav?s de la red social Facebook como alternativa que capte la atenci?n e inter?s de los educandos. Para desarrollar esta iniciativa en la IE Domingo Savio del municipio San Vicente del Cagu?n, se realiz? un estudio cualitativo analizando dos variables: la influencia de las TIC?s y las TIC?s como herramienta did?ctica en el mejoramiento de la comprensi?n lectora. La poblaci?n objetivo fue de 83 estudiantes de grado Sexto y una {{muestra de}} 20 j?venes quienes participaron activamente durante siete semanas, en sesiones de 2 horas del ?rea de Lenguaje realizadas en la sala de c?mputo del plantel educativo. Para evidenciar el impacto de esta propuesta, se aplicaron pruebas de entrada y salida (pre test y post test) y entrevistas a docentes y estudiantes en la fase inicial y final. El resultado de la prueba diagn?stica evidencia la dificultad de los estudiantes de interpretaci?n a nivel inferencial, presentando dificultades para reconocer elementos del cuento, tipo de narrador, la intenci?n del autor; entre otros. La implementaci?n de la propuesta pedag?gica con actividades de comprensi?n lectora en Facebook, junto a la retroalimentaci?n conjunta permite al estudiante identificar elementos como la intencionalidad del texto, sin?nimos y ant?nimos, tipo de narrador, elementos de la narraci?n; evidenciando una mejora significativamente con respecto a la prueba inicial; adem?s de fortalecer el uso de las TIC?s, el trabajo aut?nomo y colaborativo haciendo m?s consiente al estudiante de su propio avance en el aprendizaje. La aplicaci?n de herramientas did?cticas con las TIC?s es una estrategia atractiva para docentes y estudiantes que contribuyen a mejorar los procesos de comprensi?n lectora. Los resultados permiten al docente reflexionar sobre su labor, reconociendo la importancia de innovar en su pr?ctica pedag?gica implementando nuevas estrategias para que el estudiante se sienta motivado a aprender. The reading comprehension like skill of {{interpretation of what}} is read is fundamental in to develop satisfactorily the processes of education - learning in all {{the areas of the}} knowledge; for such a reason, the pedagogic strategies are diverse directed when students develop and to promote this capacity in. The low performance in the competitions lecto-writers identified in the Sixth degree of the IE Domingo Savio motivated the offer of investigation orientated to strengthening the reading comprehension of narrative texts across the social network Facebook as alternative that catches the attention and interest of the pupils. To develop this initiative in the IE Domingo Savio of the municipality San Vicente of the Cagu?n, a qualitative study was realized analyzing two variables: The influence of the TIC's and the TIC's like didactic tool in the improvement of the reading comprehension. The population I target it was 83 students of Sixth degree and a sample of young 20 those who took part actively for seven weeks, in meetings of 2 hours of the area of Language realized in the room of calculation of the <b>educational</b> <b>nursery.</b> To demonstrate the impact of this offer, there were applied tests of entry and exit (pre test and post test) and you interview teachers and students in the initial and final phase. The result of the diagnostic test demonstrates the difficulty of the students of interpretation to level inferencial, presenting difficulties to recognize elements of the story, type of narrator, the intention of the author; between others. The implementation of the pedagogic offer with activities of reading comprehension in Facebook, close to the joint feedback allows to the student to identify elements as the premeditation of the text, synonymous and antonyms, type of narrator, elements of the story; demonstrating one it improves significantly with regard to the initial test; beside strengthening the use of the TIC's, the autonomous and collaborative work doing more he consents the student of his own advance in the learning. The application of didactic tools with the TIC's is an attractive strategy for teachers and students who help to improve the processes of reading comprehension. The results allow to the teacher to think about his labor, recognizing the importance of innovating in his pedagogic practice implementing new strategies in order that the student feels motivated to learning...|$|E

The following two chapters deal with the rewards, punishments and {{the risks associated with}} them. The next chapter concentrates on preschool children´s development and preschool education as well as the characteristics of nursery schools. Last chapter focuses on children with special educational needs, special needs education and special education consulting. The practical part deals especially with the research results which were gained through the qualitative research, an in-depth interview consisting of eight questions. The questions were answered by six respondents, the pedagogical workers in nursery schools for children with special educational needs in České Budějovice. The aim of this Bachelor´s thesis is to find out which rewards and punishments are used in the <b>educational</b> process in <b>nursery</b> schools for children with special educational needs, what are their effects, how often they are used and the reasons why they are used. The research shows that almost the only and the most used reward is a praise and the most used punishments are mainly an oral rebuke or the restriction of some activities for {{a certain period of time}} until the child realizes their bad behaviour. Children are pleased and are positively motivated when they are praised but soon they forget about it. Rebukes are also not effective from the same reason. However, these are common educational ways used by everybody pedagogical worker all the time. Application of other educational ways of rewards and punishments are very limited in nursery schools and another problem might also be the way of raising the child in the family itself. The children are mostly used to a completely different approach to their behaviour in their family than in the nursery school. The pedagogical workers use the mentioned rewards and punishments in the nursery school daily and most of the teachers regard them as essential. This Bachelor´s thesis might be benefitial for the pedagogical workers who raise and educate children in the nursery schools for children with special educational needs and for students who deal with these issues...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis of}} mine {{is divided into}} two parts. The initial, {{speculative}} section, is aimed at defining the most frequently used alternative methods. The second section inc-ludes those methods that give enough scope to be applied within <b>educational</b> activities of <b>nursery</b> school children. The objective of the speculative section is to present complete information trying to find out about the way of using alternative methods that can be ap-plied to teaching children or informing parentsThe functional section provides the results of qualitative research activities. The main objective of this was to gain some knowledge of alternative methods and their consequential contacts both with children and parent-sThe aim of this thesis is to discern the true extent of the teachers´ knowledge of the way the alternative approach is made use of with children and the scope within which they cooperate both with children and their parents. To reach this goal, a semi structured talk to the teachers was used. Some of the nursery school teachers working in the South Bohe-mian region made up a research group. Both an audio recording and a written account were made for further processing the interviews. As a follow-up a detailed date analysis was made using a method of information coding. An enquiry based on this research provided the fact that teachers might unconsciously know something about all these methods and are making use of them in their everyday activities but they are often not able to give them their proper denotations. Most teachers show real interest in alternative methods and are using them in their life which is the easiest route to success in their educational activities. Another interesting result of this exploration was lack of interest with parents in alternative methods leading both to possible support of the process of their children´s development and their more effective education. The knowledge thus obtained can supply nursery school teachers with a higher grade of teaching skills awareness and could bring about new ideas for the work they are doing. They can also open up new alternatives in the area of both their approach to children and their cooperation with parents...|$|R
40|$|Czesław Miłosz {{was born}} in the {{vicinity}} of Kėdainiai, a multi-cultural region {{at the start of the}} 20 th century, which was populated by Lithuanians, Jews, Poles and Russians along with the faithful of a number of different religions. Kėdainiai, nonetheless, had been renowned as the primary centre of Protestantism in Lithuania since the 16 th century. The aim of this article is to depict the changes in the nation and religion, taking place in Kėdainiai and its vicinity during the latter half of the 20 th and beginning of the 21 st century. This paper is based on contemporary theories of collective identity. In the social sciences, a transition from an orientation towards individual identity to collective identity has been observed. Ethnic and national identity has been key to such studies, evolving to investigations about behavioural changes in different ethnic groups. Conditional to such changes are cultural changes currently occurring in contemporary society. Ethnic identity results from individual choice, not only from the heritage of traditions, which can be viewed in a positive manner. Lithuanian identity itself may be undergoing changes, seemingly due to decreasing pride and practicality in national identity. Considerable changes in the national makeup of Kėdainiai took place during the Soviet occupation. The population of Russians increased by 55 percent and Lithuanians by 20 percent. Meanwhile, the number of Poles decreased by 71 percent and Jews by 44 percent. The explanation for this lies in the national policies enacted during that period. The 2001 census was the first taken since the 1990 declaration of Lithuania’s independence. It showed a decrease in the population of Kėdainiai from 69, 461 to 65, 727 residents. This relates to the demographic processes in Lithuania, the aging of the society and emigration. Meanwhile, the Russian-speaking population, Russians, Byelorussians and other nationalities had decreased by more than 50 percent. The number of Polish residents has been constantly falling, and Jews have nearly disappeared; only 4 people declared this nationality. Only the architecture reflects that Kėdainiai had formerly been multi-cultural, home to ethnic groups that never entirely assimilated for generations. The statistics on <b>educational</b> institutions, <b>nurseries</b> and secondary schools, are also reviewed. In Kėdainiai, during the school year 2004 - 2005, all the nurseries were Lithuanian. Pupils studying in the Lithuanian language comprised 99. 8 percent, and only 0. 2 percent in Russian. Basic Polish language is taught at Sunday schools alone. Changes in the religious makeup of the society also relate to national changes. The 2001 census showed that Lithuanian society is rather homogenous-more than 83 percent are Lithuanians and most are Catholics. Notwithstanding that the Kėdainiai region was once the capital of Reformation in Lithuania, there are very few members of this religious confession still residing in the vicinity today. This trend is country-wide and Kėdainiai is no exception. Gradually Kėdainiai is becoming an ethnically homogenous region, with the Lithuanian culture predominating. To retain the multi-culturalism of the region, which was characteristic of Kėdainiai during the interwar period, national and religious identities must be made “attractive” to the members of the community. The opinion of the majority must be shaped to accept that investments for a multi-cultural environment are worthwhile, not for the ethnic minorities themselves but for the benefits that the majority will gain by being involved with “many cultures”. To restore the status of multi-culturalism to the region, a national programme must be developed to attract European Union funds and make use of the national heritage this vicinity offers, promoting it on the international arena...|$|R

In 1996, in St Vincent Region in Belgium, instruction was given in 33 schools for mainstream nursery and primary education serving 8781 pupils with 820 staff; 15 mainstream secondary schools serving 7121 students with 1278 staff; and 7 special primary schools and 8 special trade schools serving 1253 students with 316 staff. The brothers are also involved in educational projects in other countries.Care for people with a physical disability:In 1823 two Brothers were sent to Prof. H.D. Guyot’s institute in Groningen in order to prepare the start of the school for the deaf at the Byloke. In 1825 and 1835, education for deaf children was started in Ghent and in Brussels respectively. Bro Cyril Piot wrote a manual for reading in 1872.From the very beginning, the Brussels institute also admitted blind children. From 1877, children with an intellectual disability (cared for by the BOC since 1840) were accommodated in a special institute in Ghent. Around the 2000 BOC had eight orthopedagogical institutes in Belgium: two for people who had a serious intellectual disability, four for people with a mild intellectual disability, one for people who were hearing-impaired and physically disabled, and another one for blind, deaf and hearing-impaired people. A total of 1700 staff care for 2600 people with some form of physical or intellectual disability.In mission countries, as well as in Ireland and the U.K., the Brothers of Charity Services are responsible for the administration of several support services for people with an intellectual disability. Bro Ebergist De Deyne published a book on “L’éducation sensorielle chez les enfants anormaux” in 1922; it broke new ground in special education.|$|R
