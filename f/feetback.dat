40|$|The lineary {{stationary}} and nonlinear autonomous {{systems of}} ordinary differential equations with control are considered. A method of providing control using auxilliary systems for data processing, {{solving the problem}} of stabilization {{with the use of}} nonfull <b>feetback</b> has been described. A problem of stabilizing linear and quasi-linear systems with the use of dynamic regulators has been solved. A problem of stabilization using nonfull <b>feetback</b> for one class of nonlinear systems of automatic control has been solved. The developed methods are applicable for provision of the given mode of the object functioning based on the current data. The obtained results make it possible to perform a procedure of construction of stabilized control using nonfull feetbackAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
