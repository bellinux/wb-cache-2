5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Greek advance, the fortresses of Bizani and Kastritsa were cut off by 16h and isolated {{from the rest of the}} Ottoman army and its headquarters in <b>Ioannina.</b> As night fell, the forts ceased firing, and their garrisons abandoned them, trying to cut through the rather loose Greek encirclement to <b>Ioannina.</b> In their attempt to withdraw towards <b>Ioannina,</b> a significant number of Ottoman troops, totaling 35 officers and 935 soldiers, were captured by the Greek units positioned on the city's southern outskirts. Several Ottoman positions capitulated the next morning, although Bizani and Kastritsa continued to resist until after the surrender. Meanwhile, Esat Pasha realized that the battle was lost, and tried to evacuate as many troops and wounded as he could to the north. As the Greeks pressed their advance however, he contacted the city's foreign consulates to seek help in negotiating a surrender. At 23:00 on , he agreed upon the unconditional surrender of <b>Ioannina</b> and the Ottoman garrison to the Greeks. The following day the Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine were parading through the flag-covered streets of the city. On the other hand, Esat Pasha upon arriving in Turkey was welcomed as a national hero.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north {{in the direction of}} <b>Ioannina,</b> repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of <b>Ioannina,</b> thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E
5|$|The park lies on {{the borders}} of Grevena and <b>Ioannina</b> {{regional}} unit, north {{of the town of}} Metsovo and near the villages of Vovousa, Perivoli and Milea. There are no settlements or any facilities inside the protected area's borders.|$|E
5|$|In March 1913, {{during the}} First Balkan War, the Greek Army entered <b>Ioannina</b> after {{breaching}} the Ottoman fortifications at Bizani, and soon afterwards advanced further north. Himarë {{had already been}} under Greek control since 5 November 1912, after a local Himariote, Gendarmerie Major Spyros Spyromilios, led a successful uprising that met no initial resistance. By {{the end of the}} war, Greek armed forces controlled most of the historical region of Epirus, from the Ceraunian mountains along the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa in the east.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{artillery}} began {{firing a}} preparatory bombardment on March 4, continuing through the day. It {{is estimated that}} the Greeks fired 150 rounds per gun in this bombardment, while Ottoman counter-fire was hampered by lack of ammunition. The assault was launched on , with three Greek infantry divisionsthe 4th, 6th and 8th Infantry Divisionsthrusting against the eastern and western sectors of the defensive perimeter. At {{the same time the}} Metsovon Joint Brigade launched a diversionary attack from the north. The first Greek units, under heavy artillery support, breached the defensive line in Tsouka sector at morning, and during the following hours the Ottoman defenses were broken in five locations. As a result, the defending Ottoman units from Tsouka to Manoliasa retreated immediately to <b>Ioannina</b> in order to avoid encirclement. Moreover, as these breakthroughs from different axes threatened to collapse the entire defensive perimeter and to cut off his front echelons, Esat Pasha was forced to keep his reserve troops back and engage them in a defensive role. By 18h, the Greek 1st Evzone Regiment, together with the 9th Battalion commanded by Major Ioannis Velissariou, entered the village of Agios Ioannis on the southern outskirts of <b>Ioannina.</b>|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{south of}} <b>Ioannina</b> {{provided}} excellent defensive ground. Moreover, the Ottoman forces further reinforced their positions with permanent fortifications, constructed {{under the direction}} of the German General Rüdiger von der Goltz. These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements, bunkers, trenches, barbed wire, searchlights and machine gun positions. The <b>Ioannina</b> fortress area included two major fortresses, those of Bizani and Kastritsa, guarding the main southern approaches, along with five smaller forts in a ring around the city, covering the western and northwestern approaches. The forts were well supplied with artillery, totaling some 102 pieces (most of them 87mm). By December 1912, both sides were reinforced: the Ottomans received part of the Vardar Army, retreating after the Battle of Monastir, bringing their forces up to some 35,000, while the Greeks also brought up the 2nd Division from Macedonia and a number of volunteer regiments, for a total of 25,000 men. The Greeks launched a first attack on the fortress area on December 14. The Ottomans succeeded in repelling it in a series of actions that lasted until December 22, and even gained some ground, albeit at the cost of high casualties which depleted their numbers to some 26,000 men.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Pitești, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești {{was the son}} of a {{landowner}} from Olt, and, on his father's side, the descendant of immigrants from the Epirote area of <b>Ioannina,</b> whose ethnicity was either Aromanian or Albanian. His father became a local leader of the Conservative Party. His mother was a boyaress, and, as art collector and memoirist Krikor Zambaccian recounted, may have been a descendant of the Balotescu boyar clan. Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death. As one of his eccentricities, Bogdan-Pitești encouraged the—unsustainable—rumor that he was a direct descendant of an ancient Wallachian ruling house, the Basarab Princes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Thessalonica, the Ottomans went on to extend their rule over western Greece. A {{few months after the}} fall of the city, <b>Ioannina</b> {{surrendered}} to Hamza Bey and Carlo II Tocco accepted Ottoman suzerainty over the southern remnant of the Despotate of Epirus around Arta, while Venice moved to place Tocco's island possessions of Zante, Cephalonia, and Leucas under her protection. As a result, for the next half-century, until the end of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1479, the main arena of confrontation between Venice and the Ottomans was to be Albania, an area of vital importance to both powers, as from there the Ottomans could threaten Italy herself. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until October 1912, when it was captured by the Kingdom of Greece during the First Balkan War.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër Fortress {{dominates the}} town and overlooks the {{strategically}} important route along the river valley. It is open to visitors and contains a military museum featuring captured artillery and memorabilia of the Communist resistance against German occupation, {{as well as a}} captured United States Air Force plane, to commemorate the Communist regime's struggle against the imperialist powers. Additions were built during the 19th and 20th centuries by Ali Pasha of <b>Ioannina</b> and the government of King Zog I of Albania. Today it possesses five towers and houses a clock tower, a church, water fountains, horse stables, and many more amenities. The northern part of the castle was turned into a prison by Zog's government and housed political prisoners during the communist regime.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of <b>Ioannina,</b> {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and <b>Ioannina</b> was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis {{made the mistake of}} threatening a mobilization of the Hellenic Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is home to}} the Eqrem Çabej University, {{which opened}} its doors in 1968. The {{university}} has recently been experiencing low enrollments, and as a result the departments of Physics, Mathematics, Biochemistry, and Kindergarten Education did not function during the 2008–2009 academic year. In 2006, the establishment of a second university in Gjirokastër, a Greek-language one, was agreed upon after discussions between the Albanian and Greek governments. The program had an attendance of 35 students , but was abruptly suspended when the University of <b>Ioannina</b> in Greece refused to provide teachers for the 2010 school year and the Greek government and the Latsis foundation withdrew funding.|$|E
5|$|Alexios, {{desperate for}} money, ordered the {{confiscation}} {{of all the}} church's treasure. With this money, Alexios mustered an army near Thessalonica and went to fight Bohemond. However, Bohemond defeated Alexios in two battles: one near Arta and the other near <b>Ioannina.</b> This left Bohemond in control of Macedonia and nearly all of Thessaly. Bohemond advanced with his army against the city of Larissa. Meanwhile, Alexios had mustered a new army and with 7,000 Seljuk Turks sent by the Sultan, he advanced on the Normans at Larissa and defeated them. The demoralised and unpaid Norman army returned to the coast and sailed back to Italy. Meanwhile, Alexios granted the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople, as well as exemption from trading duties {{in return for their}} renewed aid. They responded by recapturing Dyrrhachium and Corfu and returning them to the Byzantine Empire. These victories returned the Empire to its previous status quo and {{marked the beginning of the}} Komnenian restoration.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became alienated from them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over Epirus {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of <b>Ioannina.</b> Within a short time, the Nicaeans had been evicted from Epirus. John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as playing a role in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, which seem rather to have been under the control of Nikephoros.|$|E
5|$|Meksi {{was born}} in 1770 in Labovë, a village near Gjirokastër, and pursued {{secondary}} studies in <b>Ioannina,</b> then an important Ottoman provincial center (now in Greece). His first employment was as a folk physician {{to the court of}} Ali Pasha, the Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, a position he held until 1803. Armed with a letter of recommendation from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the University of Naples in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of San Giovanni a Carbonara. After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians. His colleagues were Dr. Metaxa, (degree in medicine from the University of Paris), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the University of Vienna), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of Thanasis Vagias, with a degree in medicine from Leipzig University).|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Gjirokastër {{became part}} of the Pashalik of Yanina, then led by the Albanian-born Ali Pasha of <b>Ioannina</b> and was {{transformed}} into a semi-autonomous fiefdom in the southwestern Balkans until his death in 1822. After the fall of the pashalik in 1868, the city was the capital of the sanjak of Ergiri. On 23 July 1880, southern Albanian committees of the League of Prizren held a congress in the city, in which was decided that if Albanian-populated areas of the Ottoman Empire were ceded to neighbouring countries, they would revolt. During the Albanian National Awakening (1831–1912), the city was a major centre of the movement, and some groups in the city were reported to carry portraits of Skanderbeg, the national hero of the Albanians during this period. Gjirokastër {{from the middle of the}} nineteenth century also prominently contributed to the wider Ottoman Empire through individuals that served as Kadıs (civil servants) and was an important centre of Islamic culture. The pro-Albanianists of the city during 1909-1912 were split between two groups: the urban liberals who wanted to cooperate with the Greeks and Albanian nationalists who formed guerilla bands operating in the countryside. During the 19th and early 20th century, Albanian speaking Muslims were the majority population of Gjirokastër, while only a few Greek-speaking families lived there.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} {{is located at}} the Zagori region and the nearest settlements are mainly villages. Iliochori, Vrysochori and Laista lie to the east, Skamneli and Tsepelovo to the south, and Papingo and Vikos to the west and southwest respectively. Facilities in the aforementioned villages vary, but most of them offer restaurants and accommodation services. The nearest town is Konitsa to the northwest. The closest city with an airport is <b>Ioannina,</b> approximately 60km south of Papingo. The coach service from <b>Ioannina</b> offers seven daily coaches to Konitsa and two weekly services to Papingo (on Fridays) as of 2011. The GR-20 (Kozani - Siatista - <b>Ioannina)</b> passes close to the western, northwestern and north sides of the mountain.|$|E
25|$|He married Hayriye Hanım (later {{known as}} Hayriye Talaat Bafralı), {{a young girl}} from <b>Ioannina</b> on 19 March 1910.|$|E
25|$|After Sarantaporo he {{was placed}} as {{commander}} in the 9th Battalion of the 1st Evzone Regiment. Velissariou then {{was transferred to the}} Epirus front and was deployed at the east flank, in Aetorachi sector. On February 19, 1913, the Greek headquarters ordered a general attack against the Ottoman fortifications in Bizani, which covered the city of <b>Ioannina.</b> The Evzone battalions of Velissariou and Georgios Iatridis penetrated rapidly north and managed to cut off the only escape route of the enemy troops with the capture of the village of Aghios Ioannis, between Bizani and <b>Ioannina.</b> Soon the Ottoman headquarters in <b>Ioannina,</b> was unable to transmit any communication message to the Ottoman forts, causing major panic. At the following night the units of Velissariou and Iatridis managed to capture 37 officers and 935 soldiers in their attempt to withdraw north. As a result, the next day, the Ottoman commander Esad Pasha surrendered, while Velissariou personally led the Ottoman delegation to the Greek headquarters.|$|E
25|$|The main {{settlements}} in which Chams originally resided were: Paramythia, Filiates, Igoumenitsa, Parapotamos, Syvota, Sagiada, Perdika, and Margariti.

25|$|In {{order to}} contain Tocco, Maurice {{turned to his}} {{northern}} neighbour, the Despot of <b>Ioannina,</b> Esau de' Buondelmonti. Relations between them were tense because Esau, who in 1396 had taken Maurice's mother Irene as his wife, had divorced her in 1402 to marry Eudokia Balšić. Nevertheless, the common threat brought the two together, and in ca. 1410, an alliance was concluded between them, sealed by the marriage of Maurice's daughter to Esau's son, Giorgio. The war between Maurice and Carlo Tocco was a war of raids and counter-raids, punctuated by battles that ended now in defeat and now in victory, with intermittent truces sealed by marriage alliances, such as when Charles Marchesano was wed to a natural daughter of Carlo Tocco. It was {{on the occasion of}} the latter, which was held at Rogoi, that Maurice and his guests were informed of Esau's death on 6 February 1411. This event triggered a contest between Tocco and the Albanian lords to secure possession of <b>Ioannina,</b> left in the hands of the infant Giorgio and his mother, for themselves. The major role in subsequent developments was played by the inhabitants of <b>Ioannina</b> themselves, who soon deposed Eudokia Balšić and Giorgio. Allied with the lord of Gjirokastër, Gjon Zenebishi, Maurice unsuccessfully besieged the Epirote capital twice and plundered its environs. The Ioannites, who utterly opposed the idea of having an Albanian or Serbian ruler over them, opted to surrender their city to Tocco instead, who entered the city in triumph on 1 April.|$|E

The remaining section of Olympia Odos, connecting Patras with Pyrgos, is under planning.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{discussion}} about {{the reasons for the}} high percentage of Jewish losses in Thessaloniki have been advanced in contrast to the case of Athens, where a large proportion of Jews managed to escape death. However, this only gives a partial picture as other Jewish communities in Greece, with different characteristics such as <b>Ioannina,</b> Corfu and Rhodes, also experienced very heavy losses.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} events of {{vandalism}} has occurred throughout the country - in 2002, 2003 and in 2010, the Holocaust memorial in Thessaloniki was vandalized, in 2009 the Jewish cemetery in <b>Ioannina</b> was attacked several times {{and in the same}} year the Jewish cemetery in Athens was also attacked. In 2012 in Rhodes the city's Holocaust monument was spray-painted with swastikas.|$|E
25|$|Chams {{account for}} the {{greatest}} part of the erstwhile substantial Albanian minority in the wider area of the Epirus region; outside Chameria proper, {{there are only two}} Albanian-speaking villages further northeast (near Konitsa in <b>Ioannina</b> regional unit), whose inhabitants belong to a different Albanian sub-group, that of the Labs. Today, in the Greek context {{the use of the term}} has become largely associated with the former Muslim minority.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{campaign}} in Macedonia was completed, {{a large part of}} the Greek army under the Crown Prince was redeployed to Epirus, and in the Battle of Bizani the Ottoman positions were overcome and <b>Ioannina</b> taken on 22 February 1913. Meanwhile, the Greek navy rapidly occupied the Aegean islands still under Ottoman rule. After two victories, the Greek fleet established naval supremacy over the Aegean preventing the Turks from bringing reinforcements to the Balkans.|$|E

Following his death, the magnates of Arta seized control from Yaqub's mother, and offered to surrender the city to Carlo if their existing rights and privileges were respected. Carlo accepted, and entered Arta on 4 October. At the same time, Leonardo took over Rogoi.|$|E
