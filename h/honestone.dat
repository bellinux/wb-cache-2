60|$|Secondly: a thick mass of smooth-grained, calcareo-aluminous, shaly rock, often {{marked with}} {{dendritic}} manganese, and having, where most compact, the external appearance of <b>honestone.</b> It is easily fusible. I shall for the future, for convenience' sake, call this variety pseudo-honestone. Some of the varieties are quite black when freshly broken, but all weather into a yellowish-ash coloured, soft, earthy substance, precisely {{as is the}} case with the compact shaly rocks of the Peuquenes range. This stratum is of the same general nature with many of the beds near Los Hornos in the Illapel section. In this second bed, or in the underlying red sandstone (for the surface was partially concealed by detritus), there was a thick mass of gypsum, having the same mineralogical characters with the great beds described in our sections across the Cordillera.|$|E
50|$|Bideford has {{a number}} of churches. St Mary's Church is a Church of England church, and {{one of the largest in}} the town: the clock on the tower is visible {{throughout}} the town. The church enjoys a healthy relationship with the St. Mary's C of E Primary School, which is in the town: children from the school attend a number services at the church during school time. Bideford Baptist Church is another church in the town: services are on Sundays are at 10.30, and include Communion on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of each month. The Abundant Life Church meets at the Bideford Youth Centre on the Pill, and holds a number of events. The Lavington United Reformed Church is in Bridgeland Street, the current building opened in 1869. The Sacred Heart Catholic Church is situated on Northam Road. The Bethel Free Church is located in East-the-Water. There is also a Methodist church in Bideford High Street. In North Road there is an Evangelical Chapel. The Religious Society of Friends has a Quaker Meeting House in <b>Honestone</b> Street opposite the entrance to the Pannier Market car park. There is also St Peter's Church in East-the-Water, which was built over 130 years ago, but has not been worshipped in for 10 years. In 2011 61.8% of people in Bideford and nearby Northam described themselves as Christian, 0.3% as Buddhist, 0.2% as Muslims and 0.7% were classed as part of the other religion category. The number of religious people in the area is higher than the average in Devon.|$|E
60|$|Near Illapel, {{after passing}} for some {{distance}} over granite, andesite, and andesitic porphyry, {{we come to}} a greenish stratified feldspathic rock, which I believe is altered clay-slate, conformably capped by porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate of great thickness, dipping at an average angle of 20 degrees to N.E. by N. The uppermost beds consist of conglomerates and sandstone only a little metamorphosed, and conformably covered by a gypseous formation of very great thickness, but much denuded. This gypseous formation, where first met with, lies in a broad valley or basin, a little southward of the mines of Los Hornos: the lower half alone contains gypsum, not in great masses as in the Cordillera, but in innumerable thin layers, seldom more than an inch or two in thickness. The gypsum is either opaque or transparent, and is associated with carbonate of lime. The layers alternate with numerous varying ones of a calcareous clay-shale (with strong aluminous odour, adhering to the tongue, easily fusible into a pale green glass), more or less indurated, either earthy and cream-coloured, or greenish and hard. The more indurated varieties have a compact, homogeneous, almost crystalline fracture, and contain granules of crystallised oxide of iron. Some of the varieties almost resemble <b>honestones.</b> There is also a little black, hardly fusible, siliceo- calcareous clay-slate, like some of the varieties alternating with gypsum on the Peuquenes range.|$|R
