5|$|The sixth film, The Signalman, is an {{adaptation}} of a story by Charles Dickens published in <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> All the Year Round in 1866. In its original context {{it was one of}} eight stories set around the fictional Mugby Junction and its branch lines. It was inspired by the Staplehurst rail crash of June 1865, which Dickens himself survived, having attended to dying fellow passengers. He subsequently suffered panic disorders and flashbacks as a result.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may {{have been based on}} painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E
5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported himself with {{a job at a}} bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. <b>His</b> <b>magazine</b> drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E

5|$|Mateiu Caragiale had {{his first}} {{thoughts}} on Craii de Curtea-Veche in 1910. Two years later, {{during a trip to}} Iași, he published his first 13 poems in the literary magazine Viața Românească, winning the praise of poet Panait Cerna and the ridicule of writer Tudor Arghezi. Literary critic Șerban Cioculescu stressed that these had been printed following his father's interventions with the magazine's staff, and, according to the contemporary account of Luca's brother-in-law, philosopher Ionel Gherea, Ion Luca admired his son's contributions, his criticism being minimal, constructive, and welcomed by Mateiu. This led Gherea to conclude that, copying in real life a Symbolist cliché, Caragiale-son fabricated an unfair image of his father. In later years, Mateiu continued to write poetry, published by literary promoter Constantin Banu in <b>his</b> <b>magazine,</b> Flacăra.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|The previews of {{the film}} were held at various places, where it was well {{received}} by critics and audiences. Noted writer M. Govindan wrote a cover story in <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> Sameeksha, and organised a seminar on the film in Chennai, then known as Madras. Various intellectuals and writers took part in it, including noted film experts like P. Bhaskaran and director Balu Mahendra. Noted critic and film director Vijayakrishnan mentioned that Devadas's sound mixing work {{was one of the}} major attractions {{of the film}}. Considerable use of natural sound, apart from background music, was new for Malayalam cinema. Cast performances were also praised by critics. Bharath Gopi received considerable attention even for his minimal screen appearance. Though Madhu had acted previously in several films, including Ramu Kariat's National Award-winning film, Chemmeen (1965), Swayamvaram marked a turning point in his career.|$|E

In 1971, {{he took over}} the adult title Men Only; <b>his</b> other <b>magazines</b> eventually included Razzle and Mayfair. Among the models featured in <b>his</b> <b>magazines</b> was Fiona Richmond, who became Raymond's girlfriend towards the end of his marriage to Jean Bradley (1951-74).|$|R

5|$|On 6 August 1915, Mackay was {{involved}} in the Battle of Lone Pine. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. He ignored the first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible {{for the rest of the}} party to join Mackay. The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant Jack Massie was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher, sociologist, {{town planner}} and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932) coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance in <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> Evergreen. He argued that {{technological}} development {{needed to be}} in parallel with the arts. These ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet Hugh MacDiarmid who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art {{and the creation of}} a distinctive national art. These ideas were expressed in art in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), William McCance (1894–1970), William Johnstone (1897–1981) and Fergusson. Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princess Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like Damaged Destroyer (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal Scottish Art and Letters and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.|$|E

25|$|Ainsworth {{hoped to}} start {{publishing}} Windsor Castle in <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> by April, {{but he was}} delayed when his mother died on 15 March 1842. John Forster wrote to Ainsworth to offer assistance in writing the novel, {{but there is no}} evidence that Ainsworth accepted. The work was soon finished and started appearing in the magazine by July 1842, where it ran until June 1843. George Cruikshank, illustrator for The Miser's Daughter, took over as illustrator for Windsor Castle after the first one finished its run. A play version of The Miser's Daughter by Edward Stirling appeared in October 1842, with another version by T. P. Taylor in November. During this time, Ainsworth had many well-known contributors to <b>his</b> <b>magazine,</b> including the wife of Robert Southey, Robert Bell, William Maginn in a posthumous publication, and others. By the end of 1843, Ainsworth had sold his stake in Ainsworth's Magazine to John Mortimer while remaining as editor. The next work that Ainsworth included in <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> was Saint James's or the Court of Queen Anne, An Historical Romance, which ran from January 1844 until December 1844. The work was illustrated by George Cruikshank, which marks the last time that Ainsworth and Cruikshank collaborated on a novel.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{invasion}} and takeover of Manchuria in September 1931 galvanized {{criticism of the}} government. Zou used <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> {{not only as a}} forum to urge the Nationalist Government offer stronger resistance but to launch a campaign to raise money for armies that were more resolute. These included Ma Zhanshan's troops in Manchuria and the independent-minded 19th Route Army in Fujian, which would stage a rebellion in 1934. The circulation of Zou's magazine grew to 155,000, but when the government began to crack down on opposition figures, Zou left China for Europe. He departed just as the government decided to close <b>his</b> <b>magazine</b> in December 1933. Zou's journey took him through Europe, then to the Soviet Union, where he attended a summer session at Moscow University, and finally to the United States, where he traveled May through July 1935.|$|E

60|$|At {{crossing}} of the Eger, Friedrich's Column had some chasing of poor D'Ahremberg; attempting to cut him off from his Bridges, Bridge of Koschlitz, Bridge of Budin; but he made good despatch, Browne and he; and, except a few prisoners of Ziethen's gathering, and most of <b>his</b> <b>Magazines</b> unburnt, they did him no damage. The chase was close enough; more than once, the Austrian head-quarter of to-night {{was that of the}} Prussians to-morrow. Monday, May 2d, Friedrich's Column was on the Weissenberg of Prag; Browne, D'Ahremberg, and Prince Karl, who is now come up to take command, having hastily filed through the City, leaving a fit garrison, the day before. Except <b>his</b> <b>Magazines,</b> nothing the least essential went wrong with Browne; but Konigseck, who had not a Friedrich on his heels,--Konigseck, trying more, as his opportunities were more,--was not quite so lucky.|$|R
