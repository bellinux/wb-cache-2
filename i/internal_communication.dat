40|$|Objective of {{the study}} The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the purpose of <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> in the strategy sensemaking process, including the role of visual and multimodal <b>communication</b> in <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication.</b> Previous research did not sufficiently explore the role of <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> in the strategy sensemaking process, nor did it review practical knowledge about the use and role of visual and multimodal <b>communication</b> in <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication.</b> This research project thus examined the hypothesis that a successful strategy communication process increases the level of strategy sensemaking in an organization. Another hypothesis {{of the study}} was that <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> benefits from the use of visual and multimodal communication and promotes strategy sensemaking by increasing interest in and encouraging employees’ motivation toward achieving strategic goals. Research methods This study was a qualitative research project deployed as a multi-method case study. Two sets of research data were collected for this study: interview data and <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> materials. Semi-structured individual and group interviews were completed during fall 2016. The <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> materials comprised a set of PowerPoint slides offered for the case study by the case company. Visual analysis was conducted on these materials, while the interviews were analyzed narratively. The results of the empirical study were reviewed through the lens of a theoretical framework consisting of theories of strategy work, change communication, and visual and multimodal communication. Findings of the study The results of the study demonstrate that a strategy must be transformed into daily actions and operations to be effective; moreover, the strategy must make sense. <b>Internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> plays an essential role in ensuring that the strategy is transformed into daily tasks and actions. Likewise, successful <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> is critical to strategy sensemaking. This study also confirms that <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> benefits from the use of visual and multimodal communication techniques, such as PowerPoint, because they increase interest toward the topics, clarify the strategic message, and heighten understanding. Visual and multimodal forms of <b>internal</b> strategy <b>communication</b> consequently increase strategy sensemaking in an organization, and are therefore highly recommended...|$|R

The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

The Blackstone Canal, (1823–1828) in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the Morris Canal across northern New Jersey (1824–1924) soon followed, along with the Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River(1824–1848).|$|E

Scotland has between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land of England and Wales, mostly located in the south and east. Heavy rainfall encouraged the spread of acidic blanket peat bog, which with wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and agriculture difficult. Most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. The early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration resulting in more land becoming unproductive. Farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family and cattle were the most important domesticated animal.|$|E

40|$|As much as {{the mining}} and {{construction}} industries in South Africa have been {{the backbone of the}} South African economy since the discovery of gold {{at the turn of the}} 19 th century, so too have they been responsible for most work-related deaths in their employee population, due to their inherent hazardous working conditions. It is for this reason that the governing bodies of these industries have started to clamp down on safety in organisations, legislatively ensuring that all organisations adhere to comparatively stringent and austere regulations, or face possible shutdown. <b>Internal</b> safety <b>communication</b> is, therefore, not only literally a matter of life and death, but also forms part of complying with the laws of the country. Notwithstanding its importance, this inimitable form of <b>internal</b> organisational <b>communication</b> has yet to be widely researched. Positioned within this void, this study proposes the first model for <b>internal</b> safety <b>communication</b> within the context of the South African mining and construction industries, as well as a measuring instrument for its evaluation. The research into these two contributions is based on a sound and rigorous literature review, focusing on the chronological development of germane theories, onwards from the systems theory – the meta-theory of this research. Subsequently, the empirical research of the study was done at two organisations seated within the mining and construction industries of the country, and comprises interviews, focus group discussions and a questionnaire. In this way, the research took the form of a longitudinal study, in terms of the testing of the two contributions, but specifically the measuring instrument. This testing was done during the first stage of the empirical research at the Gautrain project and after the research intervention yielded from the findings of this first stage, the Abstract contributions were reworked and tested again in the second empirical stage of the research, at Diesel Power Opencast Mining. The model and the empirically tested and validated measuring instrument for <b>internal</b> safety <b>communication</b> – both for the context of the South African mining and construction industries – expand and contribute to the field of <b>internal</b> organisational <b>communication</b> in an imperative and relevant way, providing new theory from the South African context.
