5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity {{from the site of}} the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed {{as the head of}} an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E

25|$|Belfast West has {{historically}} been the most nationalist of Belfast's four constituencies, though it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few decades that the votes for unionist parties have plunged to tiny levels.

25|$|This {{leads to}} {{decision}} making by the parents. Rightful parental ownership over the embryo <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short-run and {{means that they}} control the embryos biological future. Consent over tissue ownership has been an issue for decades and can have legal repercussions. In the case of Henrietta Lacks, researchers lacked patient consent to use her tissues in genetic research, and this led to many legal issues on the family’s right {{to profit from the}} use of her cells. Decisiveness over autonomy is necessary in the case of IVF to avoid long run issues and give people their full rights of humanity.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{claim that}} the stained glass was {{designed}} and manufactured by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his firm in New York City. Historians Sharon Gregor and G. E.

In 2016, historic preservationist Karl Brunjes discovered extensive evidence that the designer was Nicola D'Ascenzo, a Philadelphia-based artist whose works include stained glass at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine and Riverside Church in New York City and Folger Shakespeare Library and Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|This high Mass is the norm; it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{complete}} rite with deacon and subdeacon {{that the}} ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the Ordinary of the Mass always {{suppose that the}} Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant {{goes over to the}} north side of the altar to read the Gospel, because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the right, because at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on.|$|E

Conversely, in the same musicals {{she is able to}} combine her powers with Sailor Moon for multiple powerful attacks that damage/heal enemies. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth season of the anime that she gains a more relevant role as Pegasus gives her a new compact to become Super Sailor Chibi Moon for the first time, and she becomes the only one able to summon him to give assistance to Sailor Moon in performing the attacks that defeat the enemies' minions.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no {{prohibition}} {{in the area of}} the didgeridoo's origin, such restrictions have been applied by other Indigenous communities. The didgeridoo was introduced to the Kimberleys almost a century ago but it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last decade that Aboriginal men have shown adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibitions are especially evident in the South East of Australia. The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the Taboo belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial agendas and marketing. Tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a didgeridoo. Additionally, the majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginals playing a New Age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument's spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo's secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.|$|E
25|$|The first {{language}} that was recorded to be spoken in the Armenian Highland is the Hurrian language, which was spoken in the Mitanni {{and parts of}} the Armenia from around 2300 BC and had mostly vanished by 1000 BC. The Urartian language followed and was spoken by the inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of Urartu that was located in the region of Lake Van, with its capital near the site of the modern city of Van in the Armenian Highland, modern-day Turkey. It is argued on linguistic evidence that proto-Armenian came in contact with Urartian at an early date (3rd-2nd millennium BC), before the formation of the Urartian kingdom. It was probably spoken by {{the majority of the population}} around Lake Van and in the areas along the upper Zab valley. First attested in the 9th century BCE, Urartian ceased to be written after the fall of the Urartian state in 585 BCE, and presumably it became extinct due to the fall of Urartu. Some speculate it have been replaced by an early form of Armenian, although it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth century CE that the first written examples of Armenian appear.|$|E
