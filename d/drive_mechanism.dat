5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which raises and lowers the gate, and pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195million in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Rod {{sticking}} {{has been}} attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, bearing wear, clutch wear, and <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like bearing and clutch wear) would only apply to a movement performed by the control rod <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine if there had been any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had ever felt a control rod stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission {{stated that}} it would revise its safety {{guidelines}} and would require the installation of additional power sources. On 29 December 2011, TEPCO admitted all these facts: its report mentioned that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables, but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding, and the reactor was stopped for one day. One of the two power sources was completely submerged, but its <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> had remained unaffected.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, link <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> [19, 20] and {{parallel}} link mechanisms [21 – 23] are proposed. Ishii and Kobayashi propose a parallel link mechanism using double-screw-drive mechanism [24]. Arata et al. [25] proposed a parallel link mechanism using spring links. It {{is difficult to}} obtain wide motion range of about ±[*] 90 ° for each joint by the link <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Also, link <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{need a lot of}} components and manufacturing accuracy of parts to reduce link backlash, and the cost increases.|$|R

25|$|Focusing can be manual, by {{twisting}} {{the focus on}} the lens; or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on the shutter release or a dedicated AF button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards {{in the direction of the}} arrow, the focal-plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor (4), after which actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built in <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 it was {{selected}} as the site for the Algonquin 46m radio telescope, which has been the site's primary instrument through most of its history. An earlier 10m instrument was set up in 1961 though was not equipped with a <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> until 1964. The site also hosts a hydrogen maser, a standard feature for radio telescopes that can also serve to receive telemetry from deep space missions. Other instruments formerly at the site included a solar-observing array of thirty-two 10ft (3m) dishes, and a single 1.8m solar flux monitor observing at 10.7cm wavelength, and a 18m radio telescope from the University of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|Another feature gives {{players the}} ability to create Avatars. Players are able to {{customize}} avatars by changing body shape, facial features, hair and clothes, as well as new clothing being released from time to time. Xbox Live requires that users select an avatar. Another feature is {{the ability to}} install an entire game disc onto the Xbox 360's hard drive, which decreases loading times, and significantly reduces noise due to the game being read from the hard drive and not the louder disc drive (similar to the PS2 HD LOADER Feature). For most games this feature also reduces {{the amount of time spent}} reading the disc, thereby helping to extend the life-span of the optical <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 2004, Emirates Flight 764, an Airbus A340-300 {{operating}} {{a flight from}} Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it failed to become airborne {{before the end of}} the runway, striking 25 approach lights, causing four tires to burst which in turn threw debris into various parts of the aircraft, ultimately damaging the flap <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This rendered the flaps immovable in the takeoff position. The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage. The aircraft was brought to a stop only 250 meters from the end of the 3,400 meter runway using reverse thrust and the alternative braking system. In their report, South African investigators found that the captain had used a wrong take-off technique, and criticized Emirates training and rostering practices.|$|E
25|$|Because the sectors have {{constant}} angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more {{near the}} disk's center. A more space-efficient technique {{would be to}} increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is zone bit recording. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 160 KB on a double-sided disk. This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers. Apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on HD floppy disks with their later machines, still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable-speed formats.|$|E

25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone bad, when it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E
500|$|Three Model C {{instruments}} were then built, improving the instrument's wavelength resolution. The [...] Model B's rotary cell compartment {{was replaced with}} a linear [...] sample [...] chamber. The tangent bar mechanism {{was replaced by a}} scroll <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which could be more precisely controlled to reset the quartz prism and select the desired wavelength. With this new mechanism, results could be more easily and reliably obtained, without requiring a highly skilled operator. This set the pattern for all of Beckman's later quartz prism instruments. [...] Although only three Model B prototypes were built, all were sold, one to Caltech and the other two to [...] companies in the food industry.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{theoretical}} benefits, especially a simplified front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{attempts have been made}} to construct a rideable rear-wheel steering bike. The Bendix Company built a rear-wheel steering bicycle, and the U.S. Department of Transportation commissioned the construction of a rear-wheel steering motorcycle: both proved to be unrideable. Rainbow Trainers, Inc. in Alton, Illinois, offered US$5,000 to the first person [...] "who can successfully ride the rear-steered bicycle, Rear Steered Bicycle I". One documented example of someone successfully riding a rear-wheel steering bicycle is that of L. H. Laiterman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on a specially designed recumbent bike. The difficulty is that turning left, accomplished by turning the rear wheel to the right, initially moves the center of mass to the right, and vice versa. This complicates the task of compensating for leans induced by the environment. Examination of the eigenvalues for bicycles with common geometries and mass distributions shows that when moving in reverse, so as to have rear-wheel steering, they are inherently unstable. Other, purpose-built designs have been published, however, that do not suffer this problem.|$|E

500|$|A {{separate}} model, approximately [...] long, {{was created}} for the Nostromo underside from which the Narcissus would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial shroud out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small catapult and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing. Only one shot was filmed using blue-screen compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the Nostromo. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via double exposure. Though motion control photography technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2½ frames per second, giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. For the scene in which the Nostromo detaches from the refinery, a [...] docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The Nostromo was {{pushed away from the}} refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The paper reviews simplified equivalent torsional {{models as}} an efficient approach to modelling and simulating dynamic behaviour of electric motor <b>driven</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The focus {{is put on}} preliminary design phase. Motion of the masses is described by a system of second-order non-homogeneous differential equations. The solution yields the law of motion {{as well as the}} torque function in the elastic bonds between the masses. Special attention is dedicated to accurate modelling of electric motor characteristics and resistant forces acting on executive parts of <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Stochastic nature of resistant forces is also considered. The aim is to demonstrate that the combination of a simplified model with an accurate description of drive and load torques produces satisfactory results, which are, therefore, useful in furthering the design process.
