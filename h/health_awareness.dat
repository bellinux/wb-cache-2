40|$|Objective To {{analyze and}} assess <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness</b> of youth {{migrants}} in China and {{the factors that}} influence it, and to provide evidence for making health promotion interventions and decreasing health risks among Chinese youth migrants. Method This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2009 among rural-to-urban migrants aged 15 - 24 years in Tianjin and Xi'an, China. A total of 1, 838 youth migrants were enrolled by the stratified cluster sampling method. An anonymous questionnaire was self-administered to investigate <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness.</b> The t test and v 2 test were used to analyze differences between different groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the influence of various sociodemographic, living condition, and occupational factors. Results The smoking rate of men (66. 8 %) was higher than that of women (6. 8 %; P/ 0. 05), the rate of sexual intercourse in men was higher than in women (56. 8 vs 27. 7 %; P/ 0. 05), and 75. 7 % of participants had written into medical care systems with 40. 4 % of them having undergone a physical examination during the last year. Only 438 of the participants (26 % of 1, 647) were considered to have a satisfactory level of <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness</b> [273 (32. 4 % of 958) from Tianjin and 165 (28. 8 % of 689) from Xi'an]. No significant difference was found between the youth migrant populations of the two cities. The percentage of youth migrants with a satisfactory level of <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness</b> who thought they had a good health status was higher than that with an unsatisfactory <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness</b> who thought they had a good health status (P/ 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, education, reading the newspaper, and occupation significantly influenced on <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness.</b> Conclusion Youth migrants in China have a low <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness.</b> Combined and targeted health education interventions should be promoted to increase their <b>health</b> risk <b>awareness.</b> Keywords Youth, Migrant, Health risk, Health education, Health promotionNo Full Tex...|$|R

25|$|Widespread child {{malnutrition}} in slums {{is closely related}} to family income, mothers' food practice, mothers' educational level, and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers' faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.'s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children three meals everyday. Mothers' lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don't have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children's nutritional status. For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished. These children are likely to be neglected by their mothers or sometimes not carefully looked after by their female relatives. Recent study has shown improvements in <b>health</b> <b>awareness</b> in adolescent age group of a rural slum area.|$|E
