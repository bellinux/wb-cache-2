50|$|Keystone correction, colloquially {{also called}} <b>keystoning,</b> is a {{function}} that allows multimedia projectors that are not placed perpendicular to the horizontal centerline of the screen (too high or too low) to skew the output image, thereby making it rectangular.|$|E
50|$|The Reynolds-Morris House stands {{one block}} west of Washington Square in Philadelphia's Center City, {{on the east}} side of South 8th Street between St. James and Locust Streets. It is a 3-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof pierced by pedimented gable dormers. It is five bays wide, with the main {{entrance}} at the center, framed by pilasters and a half-round transom topped by a gable. The walls are laid in Flemish bond, with projecting stringcourses between the floors. Sash windows are set under heavy splayed stone lintels with scoring that is intended to resemble <b>keystoning.</b> The interior spaces are adorned with high quality Federal period woodwork.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{projectors}} {{keystone correction}} technology is performed digitally (rather than optically) via the internal (LCD) panels or (DLP) mirrors of the projector, {{depending on the}} technology used. Thus, when applying keystone correction to an image, the number of individual pixels used is reduced, lowering the resolution and thus degrading {{the quality of the}} image projected. Home theater enthusiasts would argue that <b>keystoning</b> should not be used because of the impact it has on image quality. However, it is a useful technology in cases where the projector cannot be mounted {{directly in front of the}} screen, or on projectors utilizing lens shift technology where the projector must be mounted outside the frame of the screen.|$|E

50|$|<b>Keystones</b> (which {{are large}} Sunstones) {{are placed in}} each tower (e.g. the orange tower has an orange <b>keystone)</b> and {{maintain}} the Veil. A Chosen from each Order is assigned as a guardian to protect their Order's <b>Keystone.</b> The <b>Keystones</b> must be unsealed for periodic renewal or tuning by the guardian, and if all <b>Keystones</b> are unsealed at one time the Veil will shut down. A single <b>Keystone</b> can power the Veil {{for a short period}} of time. The Red <b>Keystone</b> (the weakest of the seven) can power the Veil alone for seven days, though not at full strength. The Violet <b>Keystone</b> is the most powerful and is in the charge of the Emperor or Empress of the Chosen - possession of the Violet <b>Keystone</b> gives the bearer the right to take the throne.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of television, there were two types of slides for broadcast—a {{transparent}} slide or transparency, and an opaque slide, or Balop (a genericized trademark of Bausch & Lomb's Balopticon projectors.) Transparency slides were prepared as 2-inch square cards mounted in cardboard or glass, or 4" [...] by 3.25" [...] film, surrounded by a half-inch of masking on all four sides. Opaque, [...] "Balop" [...] slides were cards on 4" [...] by 3" [...] stock or larger (always maintaining the 4:3 aspect ratio) that were photographed by the use of a Balopticon. Opaque cards were popular as shooting a card on a stand often caused <b>keystoning</b> problems. A fixed size and axis would ensure no geometric distortion.|$|E
50|$|The 9 metre wide solid {{steel-framed}} screen, {{complete with}} motorised adjustable masking flies {{down from the}} roof onto the stage and fills the proscenium arch of the Great Hall, making good use of the curtains to give a traditional cinema feel to the venue, in an auditorium designed as a multipurpose staged hall with good acoustics. As the projection box is situated three floors up from ground level, the projector has a steep rake, and the screen is angled back when dropped to remove any <b>keystoning.</b> For this reason the audience for film showings are generally only invited {{to sit in the}} balcony circle rather than the stalls, seating up to 337. In the late nineties the projector was replaced with a 1950s Westrex 2001 projector, a model still in common use around the country. In 2001 the student union funded an £8,500 upgrade of the projection facilities, and the cinema was fitted with a Dolby CP55 processor, new amps and speakers including a subwoofer to bring Dolby surround to the cinema for the first time (Stereo is not commonly used in cinemas, as a central audio channel is required to centralise dialogue for any of the audience sitting off-centre). A red laser sound reader was also installed to future proof the projector for the arrival of cyan sound tracks, and improve the quality of intermediate high magenta sound tracks. The lamphouse and rectifier was also upgraded to handle 3 kW lamps. Due to the cost, new surround speakers were not fitted, and have instead been formed using older speakers placed along the rear of the balcony.|$|E
40|$|The stress {{derivative}} {{technique for}} control of <b>keystoning</b> deformation in under-integrated finte elements is based on expansion of the stress in a Taylor series about the element center and retention of additional terms beyond the constant stress term. It has the advantage over other control techniques that <b>keystoning</b> resistance is provided by actual rather than artificial material properties. Application of this technique to the quadrilateral ring elements used for modelling solids of revolution subjected to axisymmetric loads is described.

40|$|In this {{technical}} report, {{we present}} a detailed overview of PixelFlex, a multi-projector display system that combines multiple roughly aligned projectors into a unified highresolution display. We describe the current prototype, the automated calibration process, and two rendering algorithms that support interactive applications. The first rendering algorithm is a one-pass technique that assumes little or no optical projector distortions. It corrects for the linear shear distortions (<b>keystoning)</b> that result from casual projector alignment and non-orthonormal projection. The second rendering algorithm is a two-pass technique that corrects for both linear projection distortions and non-linear distortions introduced by non-planar display surfaces and projector lens distortion. ...|$|E

While it can go up to any field (limited by superconductor critical current) like a cosθ magnet, the use of rectangular rather than radial geometry allows elimination of <b>keystoning</b> of the superconductor. The mechanical stability is also significantly improved over a cosθ magnet by introducing inner support and horizontal preload...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} with {{interactive}} displays based on front-projection is that users cast undesirable {{shadows on the}} display surface. This situation is only partially-addressed by mounting a single projector at an extreme angle and warping the projected image to undo <b>keystoning</b> distortions. This paper demonstrates that shadows can be muted by redundantly-illuminating the display surface using multiple projectors, all mounted at different locations. However, this technique alone does not eliminate shadows: multiple projectors create multiple dark regions on the surface (penumbral occlusions) and cast undesirable light onto the users. These problems can be solved by eliminating shadows and suppressing the light that falls on occluding users by actively modifying the projected output. This paper categorizes various methods {{that can be used}} to achieve redundant illumination, shadow elimination, and blinding light suppression, and evaluates their performance. Index Terms — Shadow elimination, blinding light suppression, projector calibration, multiple projector displa...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} with {{interactive}} displays based on frontprojection is that users cast undesirable {{shadows on the}} display surface. This situation is only partially-addressed by mounting a single projector at an extreme angle and prewarping the projected image to undo <b>keystoning</b> distortions. This paper demonstrates that shadows can be muted by redundantly-illuminating the display surface using multiple projectors, all mounted at different locations. However, this technique alone does not eliminate shadows: multiple projectors create multiple dark regions on the surface (penumbral occlusions). We solve the problem by using cameras to automatically identify occlusions as they occur and dynamically adjust each projector's output so that additional light is projected onto each partially-occluded patch. The system is self-calibrating: relevant homographies relating projectors, cameras and the display surface are recovered by observing the distortions induced in projected calibration patterns. The resulting redundantly-projected display retains the high image quality of a single-projector system while dynamically correcting for all penumbral occlusions. Our initial two-projector implementation operates at 3 Hz. 1...|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : The {{techniques}} {{in this paper}} employ two computer-assisted optical effects: synthetic aperture photography and synthetic aperture illumination. On the left, we aim a camera at an array of planar mirrors, yielding 22 different views of a statuette partially obscured by a plant. By rectifying, shifting, and adding these views together, we simulate a camera with a wide aperture and a shallow depth of field. Using appropriate shifts, we can position the focal plane of this synthetic camera astride the statuette, blurring out the plant. On the right we replace the camera with a video projector. By shifting, <b>keystoning,</b> and projecting multiple copies of a binary pattern, we produce a real image with a similarly shallow depth of field. Using appropriate shifts, we can position this image astride the statuette. On this plane the image is well focused; elsewhere, it is blurry. Confocal microscopy is a family of imaging techniques that employ focused patterned illumination and synchronized imaging to create cross-sectional views of 3 D biological specimens. In this paper, we adapt confocal imaging to large-scale scenes by replacing the optical apertures used in microscopy with arrays of real or virtual video projectors and cameras. Our prototype implementation uses a video projector, a camera, {{and an array of}} mirrors. Using this implementation, we explore confocal imaging of partiall...|$|E
