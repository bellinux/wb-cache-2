5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison <b>Guaranty,</b> a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison <b>Guaranty</b> later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large letters {{on each side of}} her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the <b>Guaranty</b> Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 {{closing of}} Copia, {{a group of}} investors, developers, advocates, and vintners named the Coalition to Preserve Copia was formed to explore a plan to {{preserve}} the building and grounds. Part of the group's plan included forming a Mello-Roos district with participation of local hotel properties to finance bonds to purchase the property, but their effort failed. In May 2009 local developer George Altamura spoke about his interest in purchasing the property. Other developers including the Culinary Institute of America also {{expressed an interest in}} acquiring the property. Copia's bond holder, ACA Financial <b>Guaranty</b> Corporation, listed the property for sale in October 2009. Napa Valley College's upper valley campus became the home of the center's library of around 1,000 cookbooks. By late 2010, local chefs had revived the center's garden and the parking lot had become the location of a weekly farmer's market. In 2011, the museum was reported to still maintain its original furnishings, with the gift store fully stocked and the restaurant still furnished. In an April 2012 auction, most of the center's fixtures, furniture, equipment, wine collection (around 3,500 bottles), dinnerware, displays, artistic items, and antiquities were sold.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an economic analysis of insider <b>guaranties</b> in small business finance and bankruptcy, explaining {{their role in}} the panoply of legal and contractual devices used to control financial agency costs. It then uses this model to examine two areas of concern in the bankruptcy treatment of insider <b>guaranties</b> (the Deprizio preference problem and the enforceability of springing and exploding <b>guaranties)</b> and to explore some of the wider implications of insider <b>guaranties</b> for small business bankruptcy. Building on the fact that insider <b>guaranties</b> are typically used less to increase the assets available for repayment of the debt than to bond firm management to act {{in the best interest of}} the guarantied creditor, the article provides a new perspective on the insider preference dilemma, justifying the Deprizio doctrine (and critiquing amended Bankruptcy Code Section 550 (c)) by focusing on the positive effects of insider liability rather than the purported negative effects of creditor leverage. This same perspective, however, argues against the enforceability of springing <b>guaranties,</b> which create disproportionate and therefore inefficient incentives to avoid bankruptcy. The article also demonstrates that insider <b>guaranties</b> play several underappreciated roles in the functioning of small business bankruptcies. First, insider <b>guaranties,</b> by reducing the value of the cramdown threat, can significantly alter bargaining power within the bankruptcy case and may be partly responsible for the large number of small business bankruptcy failures. Second, chapter 11 provides an identical bankruptcy regime for small and large businesses, but this reorganization-focused system is inappropriate for many smaller firms. Insider <b>guaranties</b> may in part be a market-generated corrective, a means of resegmenting business bankruptcy into separate schemes for smaller versus larger firms...|$|R

40|$|The {{author of}} this article {{discusses}} two recent cases which deal with unconditional liability on nonrecourse carveouts and spring-ing <b>guaranties.</b> One potential consequence of these decisions: by essentially converting these contingent <b>guaranties</b> to unconditional <b>guaranties,</b> the threat of springing liability disappears and the <b>guaranties</b> cease to have deterrent effects. If the guarantor is li-able {{whether or not the}} single purpose entity files for bankruptcy, why not file? The result is likely to be bankruptcy filings and other 2 ̆ 2 misbehavior 2 ̆ 2 by borrowers. Moreover, the analysis used in these cases would put many performing loans into default along with triggering recourse, threatening substantial harm to borrowers and lenders alike...|$|R
