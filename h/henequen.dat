25|$|In {{the late}} {{historic}} and early modern eras, the Yucatán Peninsula {{was largely a}} cattle ranching, logging, chicle and <b>henequen</b> production area. Since the 1970s (and {{the fall of the}} world <b>henequen</b> and chicle markets due to the advent of synthetic substitutes), the Yucatán Peninsula has reoriented its economy towards tourism, especially in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Once a small fishing village, Cancún in the northeast of the peninsula has grown into a thriving city. The Riviera Maya, which stretches along the east coast of the peninsula between Cancún and Tulum, houses over 50,000 beds. The best-known locations are the former fishing town of Playa del Carmen, the ecological parks Xcaret and Xel-Há and the Maya ruins of Tulum and Coba.|$|E
25|$|The {{appropriation}} {{of land for}} both agriculture and mining placed renewed pressure on the Yaquis and other native peoples of Sonora. Previously, active resistance had given the Yaqui fairly autonomous control of {{a portion of the}} state and kept their agricultural system along the Yaqui River. Encroachment on this land led to uprisings and guerilla warfare by the Yaquis after 1887. By 1895, the federal and state governments began to violently repress the Yaquis and forcefully relocate captured Yaquis to the plantations in Mexico’s tropical south, especially the <b>henequen</b> plantations in the Yucatán Peninsula. The Yaqui resistance continued into the 20th century, with the expulsions reaching a peak between 1904 and 1908, by which time about one quarter of this population had been deported. Still more were forced to flee into Arizona.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{described}} {{the weapons of}} war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as hadzab that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian; these were similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to [...] long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree (Apoplanesia paniculata) called chulul by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were described as almost {{as high as a}} man and were made from the same chulul wood as the hadzab, with the bowstring fashioned from <b>henequen</b> fibre; the bow was called a chuhul. Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers. In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a chulul-wood handle, they were about [...] long. Maya spears were referred to as nabte; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were a similar size as those used by the Spanish.|$|E
2500|$|The War seemed {{rooted in}} the defense of Santa Cruz Indian {{communal}} lands against the expansion of private ownership, which had accompanied the boom in the production of <b>henequen,</b> or agave, an important industrial fiber used to make rope. [...] After discovering the value of the plant, from 1833 the wealthier Hispanic Yucatecos started plantations to cultivate it on a large scale. [...] Not long after the <b>henequen</b> boom, a boom in sugar production led to more wealth for the upper class. They expanded their sugar and <b>henequen</b> plantations by encroaching on Maya communal land, and typically abused their Maya workers by treating them poorly and underpaying them.

2500|$|Turner {{opens with}} a chapter titled “The Slaves of Yucatan,” and {{describes}} the terrible fate that the Yaqui Indians of the northern state of Sonora suffered {{at the hands of}} Díaz’s capitalistic imperialism—that of the <b>henequen</b> industry. Turner plainly states that “From the viewpoint of the common Mexican the government is wholly the opposite of beneficent; it is a slave-driver, a thief, a murderer; it has neither justice nor mercy—nothing but exploitation” This view contrasts starkly from Creelman’s interpretation of how the Mexican people felt about the Porfiriato.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Chunchucmil" [...] was {{originally}} used {{to name a}} freshwater well (Ch'en Chun Chukum), the central water source for the cattle ranch that eventually grew to become the historic <b>henequen</b> hacienda of Chunchucmil. [...] Most wells in this region are named after animals or plants. [...] In this case, the words Ch'en Chun Chukum literally mean [...] "the well {{at the base of}} the Chukum tree" [...] (Havardia albicans). [...] Local Maya speakers still refer to the modern village of Chunchucmil as Chun Chukum when speaking in their native tongue. [...] The ancient Maya archaeological site was given the name Chunchucmil by archaeologists in the 1970s because that was the closest modern community to the site center. [...] Local Maya villagers today do not have a single term to refer to the ruins, since the ancient city is so large that it encompasses most of their lands.|$|E
2500|$|Ceramic data {{indicate}} that the Chunchucmil region was occupied from the Middle Preclassic (Middle Formative) through the Postclassic periods of Maya prehistory. [...] However, widespread test excavations within the architectural groups of ancient Chunchucmil indicate that the city reached its apogee during {{the latter part of}} the Early Classic and the early part of the Late Classic, attaining its maximum spatial extent, population, and structural density. [...] This period is defined in some areas as the [...] "Middle Classic." [...] Chunchucmil appears to have gone into decline during {{the latter part of the}} Late Classic. [...] The Terminal Classic (or Puuc) occupation at Chunchucmil is ephemeral at best, and the Postclassic occupation at the site consisted of squatter-like settlement. [...] A few early colonial homesteads have been found, but the region was largely abandoned between the Maya Postclassic period and the beginnings of the cattle ranches and <b>henequen</b> haciendas of historic and modern times.|$|E

There was some technological progress such as a highway from San Cristóbal to the Oaxaca border and the first telephone line in the 1880s, but Porfirian era economic reforms would not begin until 1891 with Governor Emilio Rabasa. This governor took on the local and regional caciques and centralized power into the state capital, which he moved from San Cristóbal de las Casas to Tuxtla in 1892. [...] He modernized public administration, transportation and promoted education. Rabasa also introduced telegraph, limited public schooling, sanitation and road construction, including a route from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla then Oaxaca, which signaled the beginning of favoritism of development in the central valley over the highlands. He also changed state policies to favor foreign investment, favored large land mass consolidation for the production of cash crops such as <b>henequen,</b> rubber, guayule, cochineal and coffee. Agricultural production boomed, especially coffee, which induced the construction of port facilities in Tonalá. The economic expansion and investment in roads also increased access to tropical commodities such as hardwoods, rubber and chicle.|$|E

Each slave had for a day's rations a hunk of sour dough, no more. Yucatan is low, marshy, damp, hot. The Yaquis were bred on the high, dry Sonoran plateau, where the air is like a knife. They dropped dead in the <b>henequen</b> fields, and their places were taken by more. You see, the Mexicans won't kill outright in their war of extermination of the Yaquis. They get use out of them. It's a horrible thing.... Well, this Yaqui you brought in escaped from his captors, got aboard ship, and eventually reached New Orleans. Somehow he traveled way out here.

50|$|<b>Henequen</b> {{industry}} in Yucatán Peninsula is an agribusiness {{of a plant}} native to Yucatán, Mexico. After extraction from the plant, <b>henequen</b> is processed as a textile in various forms to obtain a range of products for domestic, commercial, agricultural and industrial use, as binder twine for crops such as hay. Until the mid-20th century, {{it was a major}} industrial activity, the mooring of vessels depending on it. Its decline is attributed to the industry size, its socio-economic impact, as well as the invention of synthetic fibers and the manufacturing from these of substitute products which displaced <b>henequen</b> and sisal fibers. In addition to its fiber, the juice extracted from the <b>henequen</b> plant has been industrialized as a liquor similar to tequila. Also derived from its juice are certain steroidal chemicals used in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s into the 1960s {{in an effort}} to move away from <b>henequen</b> production, the hacienda was diversified back into livestock, {{primarily}} poultry, cattle and pigs.

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the <b>henequen</b> {{industry}} grew to unprecedented {{power in the}} Yucatan. The <b>henequen</b> grown in the Yucatan was used {{around the world for}} rope and twine, and became known as sisal rope, named after the seaside town of Sisal, from where the rope was shipped. Today Sisal is a sleepy fishing village, being rediscovered by locals and visitors as a beach location for vacation homes. The <b>henequen</b> industry provided financial autonomy to the isolated Yucatán. The fiber of <b>Henequén</b> plant (known as sosquil (maya: sos kí)) was manufactured into twine and rope, used in riggings, string, sacks, rugs, and many other items. It became the chief export item of the Yucatán, making many local families very wealthy.

50|$|Korean {{immigration}} to Mexico began in 1905. The first Korean migrants settled in Yucatán as workers in <b>henequen</b> plantations. Labour brokers began advertising in {{newspapers in the}} Korean port city of Incheon in 1904 for workers {{willing to go to}} Mexico to work on <b>henequen</b> plantations for four- or five-year contracts. A total of more than one thousand were recruited and departed from Incheon on board a British cargo ship on 4 April 1905, despite efforts by the Korean government to block their departure. Once their contracts were up, most settled in Mexico, either continuing to work on <b>henequen</b> plantations or moving to various cities in the country.|$|E
50|$|In 1898, {{when the}} Spanish-American War broke out, {{the price of}} fiber {{advanced}} rapidly. The supplies of Manila hemp were interrupted {{on account of the}} war conditions in the Philippine Islands, and that caused an advance in the price of <b>henequen</b> to about US$0.10 or $0.12 a pound. That sudden advance in the price brought great wealth to Yucatán and it immediately took first rank among the Mexican States. Shortly after 1900, the State of Yucatán showed very rapid strides in education, sanitation, and in the general improvement in the well being of the people. That price, which was high at that time, brought about a boom in Yucatán and the usual consequences of a boom followed, so that there were from 1907 until 1911 a few mild panics brought about by speculation and over-extension not only by the banks but by various commercial firms.The <b>henequen</b> industry was established on a very solid and profitable basis. The state whose only product, or whose only source of revenue, was <b>henequen,</b> became one of the richest States in the Republic of Mexico. At the time of Salvador Alvarado's entry into Yucatán it was the richest State in the Republic of Mexico. The planters received an average price of about US$0.05 per pound for their fiber. There were various buyers and exporters of <b>henequen</b> in Yucatán up until 1915, when Alvarado drove them out. When Alvarado reached Mérida, he seized the railways of the State. In 1912, shortly after the inauguration of the first military governor, Nicolás Camára Vales, an organization was made of various <b>henequen</b> planters in conjunction with the government of the State. This organization was named the Comision Reguladora del Comercio del <b>Henequen</b> (CRMH), commonly known as the Reguladora. The purpose of that organization was to regulate the <b>henequen</b> industry -— that is to say, that when in the operation of the law of supply and demand any large accumulation of <b>henequen</b> took place, the Reguladora was to take this accumulation off the market and hold it until such time as the demand caught up with the supply. The governor of Yucatán was always president ex-officio of the Reguladora. The Reguladora functioned with more or less success but played no important part in the commercial or economic life of Yucatán. When Alvarado assumed power in 1915, he assumed charge of the Reguladora, appointed his own board of directors, and gave notice that he was to arrange that the Reguladora would be the only institution or firm allowed to deal in <b>henequen</b> in Yucatán. Following out this policy, he ordered his director of the railways to refuse to transport any <b>henequen</b> shipped by anybody except to the consignment of the Reguladora.|$|E
