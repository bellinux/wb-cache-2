5|$|Nevertheless, {{biologists}} still often {{write about}} evolution as if organisms had goals, and some philosophers of biology such as Francisco Ayala and biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane consider that teleological language <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable</b> in evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable</b> and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E

25|$|Some feedback, {{positive}} or negative, <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable</b> and often undesirable—introduced, for example, by parasitic elements, such as inherent capacitance between {{input and output}} of devices such as transistors, and capacitive coupling of external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce parasitic oscillation and turn an amplifier into an oscillator.|$|E
25|$|Golden Retrievers require regular {{grooming}} {{and occasional}} baths. Their coats shed somewhat during the year, but {{are known to}} shed profusely twice a year. They also need to have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear infections might occur. While shedding <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable,</b> frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or sickness.|$|E

25|$|APCI {{generally}} suffers less ion suppression than ESI, {{as discussed}} previously. Where possible, if ion suppression <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable</b> {{it may be}} advisable to switch from ESI to APCI. If this is not possible, {{it may be useful}} to switch the ESI ionisation mode from positive to negative. Since less compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, it is entirely possible that the ion suppressing species may be removed from the analysis. However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the social}} meaning and {{acceptance}} of anglicisms differs {{from country to country}} due to the differences in the historical relationship to French. In Quebec, anglicisms are never used in formal documentation (government papers, instruction sheets) and very rarely used in informal writing (magazines, journals). In 1993, the French passed the legislation Loi Toubon which forbids the use of anglicisms (or those from other languages) in common publications. In both countries, wherever the use of an Anglicism <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable,</b> it is often written in italics or in quotations.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, in {{contrast}} to classical mechanics, it <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable</b> that performing a measurement on the system generally changes its state. More precisely: After measuring an observable A, the system will be in an eigenstate of A; thus the state has changed, unless the system was already in that eigenstate. This expresses a kind of logical consistency: If we measure A twice in the same run of the experiment, the measurements being directly consecutive in time, then they will produce the same results. This has some strange consequences, however, as follows.|$|E

By one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of Planet and Beneath <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the US market, {{only the}} Prius Two, Three, Four and Five were offered.

The US 2012 model year included Toyota's Vehicle Proximity Notification System (VPNS), which emitted an artificial engine noise to alert pedestrians, the blind, and others of the vehicle's presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in all-electric mode.|$|E

500|$|Shells {{from both}} marine and land organisms consist {{almost entirely of}} calcium carbonate, either as {{aragonite}} or as calcite, or some mixture of the two. Calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallizing; the recrystallized material will contain carbon from the sample's environment, which may be of geological origin. [...] If testing recrystallized shell <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable,</b> it is sometimes possible to identify the original shell material from a sequence of tests. [...] It is also possible to test conchiolin, an organic protein found in shell, but it constitutes only 1–2% of shell material.|$|E

He argues that species higher in the food chain are less important than lower species. His ideology is drawn in part from deep ecology, and he sometimes refers to the Earth as Gaia. He notes that human extinction <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable,</b> and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals. The potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{transmission line}} power dividers were simple T-junctions. [...] These suffer from very poor isolation between the output ports – {{a large part}} of the power reflected back from port 2 finds its way into port 3. [...] It can be shown that it is not theoretically possible to simultaneously match all three ports of a passive, lossless three-port and poor isolation <b>is</b> <b>unavoidable.</b> [...] It is, however, possible with four-ports and this is the fundamental reason why four-port devices are used to implement three-port power dividers: four-port devices can be designed so that power arriving at port 2 is split between port 1 and port 4 (which is terminated with a matching load) and none (in the ideal case) goes to port 3.|$|E
