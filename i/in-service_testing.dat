These new cutting edges {{consisted}} of a variety of serrated shapes. The study also included measurement of ice scraping forces by in-service trucks. These trucks were instrumented in a similar manner as the truck used in the closed-road tests. Results from the closed-road and <b>in-service</b> <b>tests</b> were analyzed by two parameters. The first parameter is the scraping effectiveness, which is defined as the average horizontal force experienced by a cutting edge. The amount of ice scraped from the roadway is directly proportional to the magnitude of the scraping effectiveness. Thus an increase in scraping effectiveness indicates an increase in the amount of ice being scraped from the roadway. The second parameter is force angle, which is defined as tan to the - 1 power [vertical force/horizontal force]. A combination of a minimal force angle and a maximized scraping effectiveness represents a case in which the maximal amount of ice is being removed from the pavement without an exceptionally large vertical force. Results indicate that each cutting edge produced a maximal scraping effectiveness with a testing configuration of a 15 deg blade angle and a 23, 000 lb. download force. Results also indicate that each cutting edge produced a minimal force angle with a testing configuration of a 15 deg blade angle and a 10, 000 lb. download force. Results from the in-service trucks produced similar data and also similar trends within the data when compared to the results of the closed-road tests. This result is most important, as it suggests that the closed-road tests do provide an accurate measure of ice scraping forces for a given blade and configuration of that blade. Thus if the closed-road tests indicate that certain blades perform well, there is now excellent reason to conduct full scale tests of such blades...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> of complex systems and {{apparatuses}} (in particular, radio frequency ones) for avionic applications. This is a fundamental step when maintenance and/or monitoring of the system or apparatus have to be carried out without stopping its standard operation condition. Traditional approaches usually work by measuring only the signals at the output of the final stage of the system or apparatus and trying to determine the eventual fault source. Unfortunately, they often fail when complex systems or apparatuses, characterized by several multiple and sequential stages, are taken into account; singling out the specific faulty component turns out to be impossible. Moreover, most of the considered approaches require to turn off or out-of-service the system or apparatus under test. To overcome the considered limitations, the authors suggest the insertion of digital radio frequency memories between each couple of successive stages. Thanks to the available computation power, it is possible to compensate the output of first block, thus making the successive one operating with its ideal input.

40|$|SRAM-based FPGAs are {{increasingly}} relevant {{in a growing}} number of safety-critical application fields, ranging from automotive to aerospace. These application fields are characterized by a harsh radiation environment that can cause the occurrence of Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in digital devices. These faults have particularly adverse effects on SRAM-based FPGA systems because not only can they temporarily affect the behaviour of the system by changing the contents of flip-flops or memories, but they can also permanently change the functionality implemented by the system itself, by changing the content of the configuration memory. Designing safety-critical applications requires accurate methodologies to evaluate the system’s sensitivity to SEUs as early as possible during the design process. Moreover it is necessary to detect the occurrence of SEUs during the system life-time. To this purpose test patterns should be generated during the design process, and then applied to the inputs of the system during its operation. In this thesis we propose a set of software tools that could be used by designers of SRAM-based FPGA safety-critical applications to assess the sensitivity to SEUs of the system and to generate test patterns for <b>in-service</b> <b>testing.</b> The main feature of these tools is that they implement a model of SEUs affecting the configuration bits controlling the logic and routing resources of an FPGA device that has been demonstrated to be much more accurate than the classical stuck-at and open/short models, that are commonly used in the analysis of faults in digital devices. By keeping this accurate fault model into account, the proposed tools are more accurate than similar academic and commercial tools today available for the analysis of faults in digital circuits, that do {{not take into account the}} features of the FPGA technology [...] In particular three tools have been designed and developed: (i) ASSESS: Accurate Simulator of SEuS affecting the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs, a simulator of SEUs affecting the configuration memory of an SRAM-based FPGA system for the early assessment of the sensitivity to SEUs; (ii) UA 2 TPG: Untestability Analyzer and Automatic Test Pattern Generator for SEUs Affecting the Configuration Memory of SRAM-based FPGAs, a static analysis tool for the identification of the untestable SEUs and for the automatic generation of test patterns for <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> of the 100 % of the testable SEUs; and (iii) GABES: Genetic Algorithm Based Environment for SEU Testing in SRAM-FPGAs, a Genetic Algorithm-based Environment for the generation of an optimized set of test patterns for <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> of SEUs. The proposed tools have been applied to some circuits from the ITC’ 99 benchmark. The results obtained from these experiments have been compared with results obtained by similar experiments in which we considered the stuck-at fault model, instead of the more accurate model for SEUs. From the comparison of these experiments we have been able to verify that the proposed software tools are actually more accurate than similar tools today available. In particular the comparison between results obtained using ASSESS with those obtained by fault injection has shown that the proposed fault simulator has an average error of 0 : 1 % and a maximum error of 0 : 5 %, while using a stuck-at fault simulator the average error with respect of the fault injection experiment has been 15 : 1 % with a maximum error of 56 : 2 %. Similarly the comparison between the results obtained using UA 2 TPG for the accurate SEU model, with the results obtained for stuck-at faults has shown an average difference of untestability of 7 : 9 % with a maximum of 37 : 4 %. Finally the comparison between fault coverages obtained by test patterns generated for the accurate model of SEUs and the fault coverages obtained by test pattern designed for stuck-at faults, shows that the former detect the 100 % of the testable faults, while the latter reach an average fault coverage of 78 : 9 %, with a minimum of 54 % and a maximum of 93 : 16 %...|$|E
40|$|Light-duty diesel {{vehicles}} emit on {{the road}} substantially more nitrogen oxides than permitted by regulatory emissions standards. The European Commission addresses this problem by developing a complementary emissions test procedure for the type approval and <b>in-service</b> conformity <b>testing</b> of these vehicles. To facilitate the technical development, the European Commission established in January 2011 the Real-Driving Emissions - Light-Duty Vehicles (RDE-LDV) working group that {{is open to all}} stakeholders. This report presents the results of the technical assessment that was carried out by the RDE-LDV working group for two candidate procedures: (i) emissions testing with random driving cycles in the laboratory and (ii) on-road emissions testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS). Both procedures are technically feasible. However, PEMS on-road testing appears to be more effective than random-cycle testing in limiting the pollutant emissions of light-duty vehicles because it (i) allows a wider range of driving conditions to be covered and (ii) might more effectively prevent the detection of emissions tests and the use of defeat strategies. Nonetheless, PEMS on-road testing faces practical challenges, including open safety issues, the currently limited availability of PEMS equipment, and potential climatic, geographical, and seasonal constraints for the execution of emissions tests. Random-cycle testing presents advantages over PEMS on-road testing in that already established laboratory equipment and know-how to be used. The present assessment is subject to uncertainty because the implementation and running costs as well as the overall effectiveness of the two candidate procedures depend on the definition of concrete boundary conditions (e. g., permitted test temperatures, severity of driving patterns). These definitions are not yet agreed. Accounting for the resulting uncertainty, it has been decided that the JRC will develop a PEMS-based test procedure. Vehicle manufacturers are given the opportunity to develop a random cycle-based test procedure. A decision will be made regarding the implementation for type approval and <b>in-service</b> conformity <b>testing</b> based on a comparison of the two fully developed test procedures by the end of 2013.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the results of}} recent tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These tests address {{the effectiveness of the}} lubricant used on the threaded portion of the valve stem, where the stem nut turns on the stem. Recent testing indicates that an elevated temperature environment can lead to significant increases in the friction coefficient at the stem/stem-nut interface. Most valve actuator qualification tests are performed at room temperature. Similarly, <b>in-service</b> <b>tests</b> are run at ambient plant temperatures, usually 70 to 100 0;F. Since design conditions can lead to valve operating temperatures in the 200 to 300 0;F range, {{it is important to know}} whether a temperature-induced increase in friction at the stem/stem-nut interface will prevent the required operation of critical valves. Lubricant aging is another phenomenon that might have deleterious effects on the thrust output of a valve actuator. Laboratory experience and field experience both indicate that after long periods in elevated temperature environments, the lubricants may lose their lubrication qualities. The scope of the current test program includes testing of five different lubricants on four different valve stems. Pending completion of the testing, results of the tests conducted using two of the four stems are discussed. The test series included collection of baseline data at room temperature, single step temperature tests where the temperature of the test setup was elevated directly to 250 °F, and step testing where the temperature was elevated in steps to 130, 190, and 250 °F, then returned to 70 °F. All greases tested showed evidence of physical change after elevated temperature tests. Except for one particular lubricant, all of the greases tested showed increased coefficients of friction at elevated temperatures. Numerous other preliminary conclusions are presented. Recommendations for future research in the area of aged valve stem lubricant performance at elevated temperatures are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Some road {{authorities}} are required, by {{agreement with the}} Australian Government, to develop an <b>in-service</b> HV suspension <b>test</b> (Australia Department of Transport and Regional Services, 2005 a, 2005 b). Development and implementation of such <b>in-service</b> HV suspension <b>testing</b> procedures, who would perform them and field test equipment will be the outcomes of a project currently underway and managed by the National Transport Commission (NTC). This report is a background briefing on suspension testing techniques for the NTC project. The "science" of pavement and bridge behaviour is not exact. Even so, models are used to estimate heavy vehicle (HV) wheel-force damage to the road network asset. Likewise, the "science" of HV suspension performance is not exact. These shortcomings did not stop "road-friendly" air-suspended HVs being allowed greater mass as a concession in Australia and Europe. This move, whilst questionable with the clarity of hindsight, now needs to be managed {{in the light of}} better understanding of the dynamics of HV air suspensions. This management approach needs to consider that the test regime for new HV suspensions in Australia could benefit from revision, dating as it does from before HV air suspension behaviour was better understood. The role of suspension dampers (shock absorbers) is critical to the continuing health of HV air suspensions. Over 50...|$|R
