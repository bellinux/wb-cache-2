5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{structure}} of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I, but by the late thirteenth century, it <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} gun batteries, {{the crew of}} Blücher, {{including}} the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> list of 18degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship's fuel stores. The battered ship slowly began to capsize and the order to abandon ship was given. Blücher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gröner states {{that the number of}} casualties is unknown, but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|USS West Avenal (ID-3871) was a {{cargo ship}} in the United States Navy during World War I.

West Avenal was {{launched}} in October 1918 by the Western Pipe and Steel Company of San Francisco, California, and delivered to the US Navy when she was completed in February 1919. After she was commissioned and <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> load of flour, West Avenal sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned in early April.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century perhaps ten per cent of the {{population}} lived {{in one of the}} many burghs. A characteristic of Scottish burghs were long main streets of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. Many houses in Scottish towns had forms derived from those in major urban centres in Tuscany and the Low Countries, although realised with traditional Scottish techniques and materials. Timber-framed houses were common across urban centres in Europe, but, perhaps because of the shortage of large timbers and an abundance of workable stone in Scotland, houses with only timber fronts were more common. Despite the logistical problems timbered houses enjoyed a resurgence in the late sixteenth century, particularly in Edinburgh where there were large numbers of board, jettied and boarded construction. Increasingly half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. By the late seventeenth century these <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> recognisably Flemish or Dutch appearance. They were often narrow, with four stories, gabled and crow stepped, but often built in stone and harl. They sometimes had ground floor arcades or piazzas. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-story Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements.|$|E

This patient was Nicole, whose complicated relationship with her father is suggested {{as the cause of}} her breakdown. As her treatments progress, she becomes infatuated with Dick, who in turn develops Florence Nightingale syndrome. He eventually determines to marry Nicole, in part, as a means of providing her with lasting emotional stability. Strong objections are raised by Nicole's sister who believes Dick is marrying her because of her status as an heiress.|$|E

When he did recover his strength, Jennie remained with the children, (including a new son and daughter, Ernest and Amy, {{as well as the}} orphaned daughter of fellow missionary George Duncan) and in 1876 Hudson Taylor returned to China and the 18 requested missionaries followed him.

25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville.

On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8.

25|$|David Wallace (April 24, 1799 – September 4, 1859) was {{the sixth}} Governor of the US state of Indiana. The Panic of 1837 {{occurred}} {{just before his}} election and the previous administration, {{which he had been}} part of, <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large public debt. During his term the state entered a severe financial crisis that crippled the state's internal improvement projects. He advocated several measures to delay the inevitable insolvency of the state. Because of his connection to the internal improvement platform, his party refused to nominate him to run for a second term. The situation continued to detriorate rapidly and led to state bankruptcy in his successor's term. After his term as governor, he became a congressman, then chairman of the Indiana Whig party before becoming a state judge, a position he held until his death.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} torpedo strike, Captain Maund ordered the engines to full stop, but was {{discovered}} communications were down {{and had to}} send a runner to the engine room. The ship's continued motion enlarged {{the hole in the}} hull, and by the time Ark Royal stopped she <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> great deal of water and begun to list to starboard, reaching 18° from centre within 20minutes. Considering the list of the carrier, and the fact that other carriers, including Courageous and [...] Glorious, had sunk rapidly with heavy loss of life, Maund gave the order to abandon ship. The crew were assembled on the flight deck to determine who would remain on board to try to save the ship while Legion came alongside to take off the rest. [...] As a result, comprehensive damage control measures were not initiated until 49minutes after the attack. The flooding spread unchecked, exacerbated by covers and hatches left open during evacuation of the lower decks.|$|E

500|$|As {{the final}} step before their planned {{invasion}} of the Japanese mainland, Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April. The Imperial Japanese Navy's response was to organise a mission codenamed Operation Ten-Go that would see the commitment of much of Japan's remaining surface strength. Yamato and nine escorts (the cruiser [...] and eight destroyers) would sail to Okinawa and, in concert with kamikaze and Okinawa-based army units, attack the Allied forces assembled on and around Okinawa. Yamato would then be beached {{to act as an}} unsinkable gun emplacement and continue to fight until destroyed. In preparation for the mission, Yamato <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full stock of ammunition on 29 March.

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Philadelphia <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> poor reputation. People both inside and outside of the city commented that Philadelphia and its citizens were dull and contented with its lack of change. Harper's Magazine commented that [...] "The one thing unforgivable in Philadelphia is to be new, to be different from what has been." [...] Along with an image of [...] "dullness," [...] Philadelphia was known for its political corruption. The Republican-controlled political machine, run by Israel Durham, permeated all parts of city government. One official estimated that US$5 million was wasted each year from graft in the city's infrastructure programs. The majority of residents were Republican, but voter fraud and bribery were still common. In 1905 the city enacted election reforms, such as personal voter registration and the establishing primaries for all city offices. But, residents became complacent, and the city's political bosses continued in control. After 1907 Boss Durham retired and his successor, James McNichol, never controlled much outside North Philadelphia. The Vare brothers, George, Edwin, and William, had created their own organization in South Philadelphia. [...] With no central authority, Senator Boies Penrose took charge. In 1910 infighting between McNichol and the Vares contributed to the reform candidate, Rudolph Blankenburg, to be elected mayor. During his administration, he made numerous cost-cutting measures and improvements to city services, but he served only one term. [...] The machine again gained control.|$|E
