6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{have done}} it, but I was plumb mad. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> San Augustine paper {{out of my}} hip-pocket, and showed him an item. It was a half a column about the {{marriage}} of Myra Allison and Joe Granberry.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is married}} also, to her cousin, but I don't {{know that she}} has any {{children}} yet, and I never pulled her up any precipice. It was a man <b>I</b> <b>pulled,</b> <b>a</b> very heavy one. My arm isn't quite right yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, girls," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> {{paper out}} of my pocket, [...] "you must know that your father is getting to be famous by means of these 'House and Home Papers.' Here is a letter I have just received:-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Say, Lige," [...] said he, [...] "that reminds me. A {{month or}} so ago <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> fellow out of Renault's area across from there. First I {{thought he was a}} thief. After he got away I saw the Colonel and his {{daughter}} in the window." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You imply {{it depends}} on the labor one uses?" [...] Jimmy remarked. [...] "Well, I know nothing about {{chopping}} and <b>I</b> haven't <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> crosscut saw. Do you think I can make good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that was not my character, Mr. Cathro; but I hope I have changed since then, and that <b>I</b> could <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> boy {{out of the water}} without wanting to be extolled for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Thirty pounds!" [...] he said, {{as though}} <b>I</b> had <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> tooth of him. [...] "You talk as though thirty pounds {{was to be}} had for the asking. None the less," [...] he says, [...] "your draft's a fine piece of work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tush, man!" [...] said Drawslot, [...] "thou forgettest thy best auxiliaries, {{the good}} greyhounds, Help and Holdfast! I warrant thee {{that when the}} humpbacked baron caught thee by the cowl, which he hath almost torn off, thou hadst been in a fair plight, had they not remembered an old friend and come in to the rescue. Why, man, I found them {{fastened}} on him myself; and there was odd staving and stickling to make them 'ware haunch!' Their mouths were full of the flex, for <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> piece of the garment from their jaws. I warrant thee that when they brought him to ground, thou fledst like a frighted pricket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he {{answered}} with his courteous intonation and a faint smile. As <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> drawer open his suddenly aroused curiosity {{gave him a}} watchful expression. I wonder what he expected to see. A poem, maybe. All that's beyond guessing now. He was not a cold but a calm man, still more subdued by disease--a man of few words and of an unassuming modesty in general intercourse, but with something uncommon {{in the whole of}} his person which set him apart from the undistinguished lot of our sixty passengers. His eyes had a thoughtful introspective look. In his attractive reserved manner, and in a veiled sympathetic voice he asked: ...|$|E
60|$|But when I turned around, {{and peered}} over the dark waters, {{it was quite}} plain {{to me that it}} was not want of oil, but {{increased}} distance, which made those lights so dim. I could now perceive but three of them, and as the surface was agitated only by a gentle swell, I could not suppose that any of them were hidden from our view by waves. We were being left behind, that was certain, and all I could do was to row on as long and as well as I could in the direction which the other boats had taken. I had been used to rowing, and thought <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> good oar, and I certainly did not expect to be left behind in this way.|$|E
5000|$|The {{track is}} also {{mentioned}} by rapper T.I. in the worldwide smash hit single, [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] by Robin Thicke, also featuring Pharrell. The line is: [...] "In a hundred years, not dare would <b>I</b> / <b>Pull</b> <b>a</b> Pharcyde, let you pass me by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No harm in asking, your Honour," [...] {{returned}} the seaman, crushing the hat he held between two hands {{that had a}} gripe {{like a couple of}} vices, [...] "and so I hope there is none in answering. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>an</b> oar in the boat after the old man this morning, and I cannot say I like the manner in which he got from the chase. Then, there is something in the ship to leeward that comes athwart my fancy like a drag, and I confess, your Honour, that I should make but little head-way in a nap, though I should try the swing of a hammock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>pulling</b> out <b>a</b> paper. Charles, {{with his}} unerring {{business}} instinct, had anticipated the request, and {{given me a}} signed agreement to that effect.|$|R

"She never {{mentions}} her husband's name without saying, 'My husband, the Resident,' but for {{all that}} she is a kind hearted woman--a very kind hearted woman. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> child of hers through who was down with fever at Bhurtpore; he had a very close shave of it, and she has never forgotten it. She greeted me when she came on board almost with tears in her eyes at the thought of that time. I told her I had a young lady under my charge, and she said that she would be very pleased to do anything she could for you. She is a stanch friend is Mrs. Resident, and you will find her useful before you {{get to the end of}} the voyage." ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{waiting to}} reload, {{or even to}} look if {{the main body of}} the Zulus had seen the death of their two scouts, I turned my horse and drove my heels into his sides. As soon as I was down the slope of the rise <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> little to the right in order to {{intercept}} the waggons before the Zulus saw them. I had not gone three hundred yards in this new direction when, to my utter astonishment, I struck a trail marked with waggon-wheels and the hoofs of oxen. Of waggons there must have been at least eight, and several hundred cattle. Moreover, they had passed within twelve hours; I could tell that by the spoor. Then I understood; the Impi was following the track of the waggons, which, in all probability, belonged to a party of emigrant Boers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, he didn't collect {{taxes or}} water rates or {{anything}} of that sort. A Collector is a civil functionary, and frequently an important one. I used to attend her at one time {{when we were in}} cantonments at Bhurtpore, where her husband was stationed at that time. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> tooth out for her once, and she halloaed louder than any woman I ever heard. I don't mean to say, my dear, that woman holloa any louder than men; on the contrary, they bear pain a good deal better, but she was an exception. She was twelve years younger then, and used to dress a good deal more than she does now. That cloak and bonnet are meant to convey {{to the rest of the}} passengers the fact that there is no occasion whatever for a person of her importance to attend to such petty matters as dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! uncle," [...] exclaimed Pereira, [...] "did you {{see those}} birds cross each other as <b>I</b> <b>pulled?</b> That was <b>a</b> lucky one for me, but I won't count the second if the Heer Allan objects." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the fantastic}} elements, Gay {{describes}} Charlie's life as being [...] "pretty common {{in a lot}} of ways. She's not always the strongest, the smartest, or the most beautiful. She makes mistakes, wins as much as she loses, and sometimes her emotions get in the way. But one of my favorite things about Charlie is that her heart is in the right place; she’d give her last breath for those she loves." [...] The author also drew from personal experience when finding her character's voice. [...] "With Charlie, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> lot from my own feelings and emotions about being a mom and wanting the best for my kid—making good choices and sometimes making mistakes, too, all the hopes and fears, etc," [...] Gay said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel, <b>I</b> {{have just}} <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> {{man out of}} the river who says his name is Zane, or if he did not mean that, he knows you, for he surely said 'Zane.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once, {{many years}} ago, I cut the tail off a fox which had taunted me, and I stole some birds' eggs from a nest {{to make an}} omelet with, and also <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> fish from the river and left it lying on the bank to gasp for lack of water until it died. I don't know why I did those wicked things, but I did them. So the Emperor of the Winkies--who is the Tin Woodman and has a very tender tin heart--punished me by denying me any {{communication}} with beasts, birds or fishes. I cannot understand them when they speak to me, although I know that other people can do so, nor can the creatures understand a word I say to them. Every time I meet one of them, I am reminded of my former cruelty, {{and it makes me}} very unhappy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a good stone," [...] said I, and we pressed on, {{where the}} grove {{in the great}} {{excavation}} darkened again, and the brook slid secretly under {{the arms of the}} bushes and the hair of the long grass. We beat the cover almost to the road. I thought the brute had escaped, and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> bunch of mountain-ash berries, and stood tapping them against my knee. I was startled by a snarl and a little scream. Running forward, I came upon one of the old, horse-shoe lime kilns that stood {{at the head of the}} quarry. There, in the mouth of one of the kilns, Emily was kneeling on the dog, her hands buried in the hair of its throat, pushing back its head. The little jerks of the brute's body were the spasms of death; already the eyes were turning inward, and the upper lip was drawn from the teeth by pain.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was very}} easy when Amy returned, {{and the more}} because she brought with the midwife a good motherly sort of woman, who was to be her assistant, and would be very helpful on occasion; and bespoke a man midwife at Paris too, if there should be any {{necessity}} for his help. Having thus made provision for everything, the Count, for so we all called him in public, came as often to see me as I could expect, and continued exceeding kind, as he had always been. One day, conversing together upon the subject of my being with child, I told him how all things were in order, but that I had a strange apprehension that I should die with that child. He smiled. [...] "So all the ladies say, my dear," [...] says he, [...] "when they are with child." [...] "Well, however, my lord," [...] said I, [...] "it is but just that care should be taken that what you have bestowed in your excess of bounty upon me should not be lost;" [...] and upon this <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> paper out of my bosom, folded up, but not sealed, and I read it to him, wherein I had left order that all the plate and jewels and fine furniture which his Highness had given me should be restored to him by my women, and the keys be immediately delivered to his gentleman in case of disaster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he?" [...] {{interrupted}} the woman; [...] "then Dr. Battius has more sense in him than I believed! She is right, Ishmael; {{and what she}} says, shall be done. I will shoulder a rifle myself; and woe betide the red-skin that crosses my path! <b>I</b> have <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> trigger before to-day; ay, and heard an Indian yell, too, to my sorrow." ...|$|R
60|$|Mont. Orazia forced away!--what tempests roll About my thoughts, {{and toss}} my troubled soul! Can there be gods to see, and suffer this? Or does mankind {{make his own}} fate or bliss; While every good and bad happens by chance, Not from their orders, but their ignorance?-- <b>I</b> will <b>pull</b> <b>a</b> ruin on them all, And turn their triumph to a funeral.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} hear me grumbling, Bert; {{that is all}} the difference. I expect that, of the two, I am rather the worse, for my bones and muscles are more set than yours, and it is some years now since <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> at either <b>a</b> rope or an oar." ...|$|R
60|$|The voyage I {{made in the}} Edward was one of {{very little}} interest, the ship being {{exceedingly}} successful. The usage and living were good, and the whaling must have been good too, or we never should have been back again, {{as soon as we}} were. We went round the Horn, and took our first whale between the coast of South America and that of New Holland. I must have been present at the striking of thirty fish, but never met with any accident. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> mid-ship oar, being a new hand at the business, and had little else to do, but keep clear of the line, and look out for my paddle. The voyage is now so common, and the mode of taking whales is so well known, that I shall say little about either. We went off the coast of Japan, as it is called, though a long bit from the land, and we made New Holland, though without touching. The return passage was by the Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena. We let go our anchor but once the whole voyage, and that was at Puna, {{at the mouth of the}} Guayaquil river, on the coast of Chili. We lay there a week, but, with this exception, the Edward was actually under her canvass the whole voyage, or eighteen months. We did intend to anchor at St. Helena, but were forbidden on account of Bonaparte, who was then a prisoner on the Island. As we stood in, we were met by a man-of-war brig, that kept close to us until we had sunk the heights, on our passage off again. We were not permitted even to send a boat in, for fresh grub.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{so short}} a distance, and with so good a rest, I could not miss, {{and before the}} smoke cleared away I winged another, and the rest ran back hastily. I sent a shot or two among them as they were consulting, {{with the result that}} they rode off three or four hundred yards farther back. They did not attempt to return my fire, for, except when I raised my head for a moment, they could see nothing of me. They doubtless learned from the women that I had a Colt's rifle and a brace of revolvers, and that if they were to make a rush across the open not many of them were likely to reach me. After a talk two or three of them mounted their horses and rode so as to strike the river both above and below me, {{intending}} no doubt to cross if they found a place where there was a chance of doing so. I felt pretty sure that they would do nothing till it was dark, then they would crawl up and make a rush; I was certain, anyhow, that they would not give it up, as there were two of their number lying on the veldt besides the two at the farmhouse. There was, however, more pluck in them than I had given them credit for, for about mid-day they began to advance, crawling along the ground as if stalking a quarry. The men who had gone out on horseback had all returned, but just as the others started crawling up three of them galloped away down stream. I determined at once to shift my position a bit, so as to put off the evil hour. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> stone as big as my head out of the clay of the bank {{and put it on the}} edge where my head had been, and then got down into the water. It was waist-deep at a couple of feet from the bank, which above was too steep to walk along. I had gone a hundred yards when I saw, seven or eight inches above the water-level, a hole, and pushing my arm in I found it was a place where a good bit of the bank had caved in. Laying my gun and pistols down on a ledge I felt about farther. At the top it went in nearly three feet, and was higher at the back than it was at the water's edge. At any rate it afforded a good chance of safety. Holding the revolvers, the chamber of the rifle, and my ammunition above water, I stooped until I could get into the hole, which was but just wide enough for the purpose; then I pushed myself back to the end. I found there was just height enough for me to sit with my mouth above water. The back sloped so that I had to dig my heels into the clay to prevent myself from slipping forward.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was known}} for his garishly camp outfits and {{flamboyant}} persona - he would typically come to the ring playing an electric guitar and wearing a fringed tiger-striped jacket and fluorescent shredded tights. His interviews and out-of-ring promotional work were all well-received, but his wrestling skills were widely regarded as below-par and the crowds were not entertained, as Southern made hard work of defeating [...] "jobber" [...] and mid-card wrestlers like Joey Maggs and Firebreaker Chip. Maggs later commented that [...] "J.T. Southern was so bad that <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> good match out of him. But the fact that nobody else could get a match out of him made me feel good." ...|$|E

60|$|After {{all this}} was delivered, and the ladies had {{received}} them, and given them their women to hold, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> out <b>a</b> little box in which I had two couple of large pearls, of that pearl which I mentioned we found at the Pearl Islands, very well matched for ear-rings, and gave the lady one pair, and the daughter the other; and now, I think, I had made a present fit for an ambassador to carry to a prince.|$|R
