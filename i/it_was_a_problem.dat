25|$|The {{first serious}} {{concerns}} about driver safety occurred on Friday afternoon. Dr. Steve Olvey, CART Director of Medical Affairs, would later report that two drivers felt dizzy and disoriented after running their cars at over , and that they felt they could not control their cars. The identities of the two drivers were not disclosed, but Tony Kanaan and Alex Zanardi later claimed they experienced the symptoms. Adrian Fernandez also reported to the media he was experiencing dizziness. Olvey said in his 25 years of working in motorsports, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> he had never experienced.|$|E
25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{posed by}} Wren {{that serves as}} an {{ultimate}} source to the conception of Newton's Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis. Robert Hooke had theorised that planets, moving in vacuo, describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to Halley and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, {{within the context of}} Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the Kepler's laws with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, De motu corporum in gyrum, which was later to be expanded into the Principia.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} Eurocentrism {{and hence the}} problem of development, is … the <b>problem</b> of knowledge. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of {{discovering}} Other ways of knowing, being and doing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of how to be human in ways Other than those of Europe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of how the West could liberate its true self from its colonial history and moorings.

25|$|Nunes also {{solved the}} problem of finding the day with the {{shortest}} twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration. This problem per se is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli {{more than a century}} later with less success. They could find {{a solution to the problem}} of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.|$|E
500|$|The year 1933 was a busy one for Barrymore, and his decline {{began to}} be evident. He {{appeared}} in five films during the year, including as a meek schoolteacher-turned-businessman in Topaze, opposite Myrna Loy, and Dinner at Eight, with Lionel. Peters opines that Barrymore's portrayal of a washed-up alcoholic actor [...] "could well have fixed... in the public's and MGM's mind that John Barrymore was a drunken has-been." [...] After the run of films with MGM, the company ended its contact with Barrymore amid its financial woes caused by the Great Depression. He then signed with Universal Studios to portray a troubled Jewish lawyer in Counsellor at Law. During filming he struggled to remember his lines for even small scenes. Filming was stopped on one occasion after more than 25 takes when he struggled to recall the right lines; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with which he began to suffer regularly. Despite the problems, Norden believes that this was [...] "one of his best film performances".|$|E

For the main event, James said that [...] "this didn't feel like a ladder match. Dallas simply {{did not take the}} risks needed to show that he really wanted to retain his title". However, he was not disappointed because he did not [...] "expect too much from a Bo Dallas match". James felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> to close the show with Dallas-Neville because [...] "the show could only go down" [...] from Cesaro-Zayn. Lastly, James had some technical issues viewing the live stream of the event, where the video paused during the Cesaro-Zayn match, and the feed cut out during Rusev's appearance, but returned before the main event match started.|$|E

Tens of thousands of southern African Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained enough disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel. The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the [...] "Jim Crow cars" [...] – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages. As one black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile [...] "it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. We feel like Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 2, 2017, Deadline {{reported}} that Netflix {{was in the}} process of renewing the lapsed contracts of the series' eight leading actors, to keep them available until June of the same year, suggesting that a positive decision to renew Sense8 for a third season before that time passes was highly possible. In early May 2017, producer Roberto Malerba said that not all eight regulars of the cast had renewed yet, but the process was still going. He additionally disclosed the first season had an average budget of about $4.5 million per episode, and the second season $9 million per episode. Furthermore, he added that a potential third season would likely be the series' last, due to the complicated nature of the series' production, and the fact Lana Wachowski works as a filmmaker on it almost alone. On June 1, 2017, Netflix announced they had cancelled the series after two seasons. Although no official reason for the cancellation was provided in the press release by Netflix, actor Brian J. Smith, who had hinted at the cancellation a couple of days before the announcement was made, has said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of low viewership compared to the production's cost. Shortly after the cancellation, Malerba commented that it happened abruptly by Netflix without providing them an explanation, [...] "just numbers".|$|E
500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy. [...] "here is in general a want of passion; the affections are at a stand; our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions." [...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. There is no easy solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who felt the same way, and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how Mariana could love and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E

The story was {{eventually}} used in season three, when the writing staff {{was looking for a}} reason to exploit the changing friendship between Clark and Pete. According to Verheiden, they wanted a moment where Pete could release his feelings to Clark, and the jealousy he has over Clark spending more time with Lex and Lana. The episode featured the moment when the friendship between Clark and Pete [...] "fractured a bit". [...] "Obsession" [...] featured a scene first thought up in season two’s [...] "Visage", which called for the use of lead paint to block the effects of kryptonite on Clark when Tina Greer trapped him in the storm cellar with Lana’s kryptonite necklace. The scene was rewritten to have Clark’s spaceship save him, and used later in [...] "Obsession", where Clark and Chloe use lead paint to trap the teleporting Alicia Baker.|$|E
2500|$|This time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of {{too much}} water.

Surprisingly, not a single drop of water entered the church, as if there was an invisible, mysterious wall preventing the water from going in. When, eventually, the river went back to its normal course, the Ermita was so dried, clean and tidy that no one would say any rain had fallen and not flooding had occurred in the vicinity. All this happened to the great surprise of the caretaker or [...] "ermitaño" [...] who, afraid for his life, had climbed to the altar of Our Lady and, on his knees, prayed for his safety.

2500|$|The only {{weakness}} {{that could}} be seen in the Australian team was their batting, Don Bradman (99.94), Sid Barnes (63.05) and Bill Brown (46.82) had all retired and had not been fully replaced. The vice-captain Arthur Morris (46.48) was labeled [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] as the English bowler dismissed him easily in the first three Tests, but he made 168 and 105 against the tourists for New South Wales and 100 for an Australian XI. He finally laid the bunny to rest with his highest Test century in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 206 out of 371. The real trouble was finding him a suitable opening partner as Jack Moroney made a pair, Ken Archer never made a Test 50 and Jim Burke failed when promoted after making an unbeaten century on his Test debut. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that was not solved and Lindsay Hassett took to opening the batting in 1953 and Morris had another succession of partners in 1954-55. Neil Harvey (48.42) was still a baby-faced youngster in 1950-51, committed to strokeplay regardless of the situation. He had a steady series and initially came in at number 3 before being moved down to his natural position at number 4. Lindsay Hassett replaced him and the Australian captain made more runs than anybody else in the team, but failed to make a century. However, he did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, Miller topped the Australian batting averages and was the only man who could - briefly - take the attack to the accurate bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. Sam Loxton (36.93) was a big-hitting all-rounder, but his bowling days were behind him and was used as a middle order batsmen, without success. Ian Johnson was a useful tailender who could have been a fully-fledged all rounder with greater application and made 77 in the Third Test at Sydney. Don Tallon was a useful lower-order batsmen in 1948, but failed in all the Tests and his increasing deafness made him a poor runner. Bill Johnston was an awkward batsmen who could be difficult to remove, but the last man was Jack Iverson [...] "...whose batting pretensions are possibly no higher than those of a third-grade schoolboy player".|$|E
