5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E

5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E

25|$|Importantly, {{the retina}} is immune-privileged, and thus does not {{experience}} a significant inflammation or immune-response when AAV is injected. Immune response to gene therapy vectors {{is what has}} caused previous attempts at gene therapy to fail, and is considered a <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of gene therapy in the eye.

25|$|The {{pyroelectric effect}} {{converts}} a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It {{is analogous to}} the piezoelectric effect, which is another type of ferroelectric behavior. Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small power outputs in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Through {{methods such as}} X-ray {{crystallography}} and NMR spectroscopy, {{the information}} about 3D structures of target molecules has increased dramatically, and so has structural information about the ligands. This drives rapid development of structure-based drug design. Some of these new drugs target membrane receptors. Current approaches to structure-based drug design {{can be divided into}} two categories. The first category is about determining ligands for a given receptor. This is usually accomplished through database queries, biophysical simulations, and the construction of chemical libraries. In each case, a large number of potential ligand molecules are screened to find those fitting the binding pocket of the receptor. This approach is usually referred to as ligand-based drug design. The <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of searching a database is that it saves time and power to obtain new effective compounds. Another approach of structure-based drug design is about combinatorially mapping ligands, which is referred to as receptor-based drug design. In this case, ligand molecules are engineered within the constraints of a binding pocket by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either atoms or molecules. The <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of such a method is that novel structures can be discovered.|$|E
25|$|As the schism in the Democratic party deepened, {{moderate}} Republicans {{argued that}} {{an alliance with}} anti-administration Democrats, especially Stephen Douglas, would be a <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> in the 1860 elections. Some Republican observers saw {{the controversy over the}} Lecompton Constitution as an opportunity to peel off Democratic support in the border states, where Frémont picked up little support. After all, the border states had often gone for Whigs with a Northern base of support in the past without prompting threats of Southern withdrawal from the Union.|$|E

25|$|A <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> {{of every}} film capacitor's {{internal}} construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|E
25|$|Generally, CPOE is advantageous, as {{it leaves}} the trails of just better {{formatting}} retrospective information, as with traditional hospital information systems designs. The <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of providing information from the physician in charge of treatment for a single patient to the different roles involved in processing he treatise itself is widely innovative. This makes CPOE the primary tool for information transfer to the performing staff and lesser the tool for collecting action items for the accounting staff. However, the needs of proper accounting get served automatically upon feedback on completion of orders.|$|E

25|$|A <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> {{of modern}} film {{capacitor}} internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths to the entire electrode very short. The setup behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and the parasitic inductance (ESL). The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in very low ohmic losses and a very low parasitic inductance, which makes them especially suitable for applications with very high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} riders who will share a vehicle {{is a key}} unknown. In the U.S., the average car carries 1.16 persons, and most industrialized {{countries}} commonly average below two people; not having to share a vehicle with strangers is a <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of private transport. Based on these figures, {{some have suggested that}} two passengers per vehicle (such as with UniModal), or even a single passenger per vehicle is optimum. Other designs use a car for a model, and choose larger vehicles, making it possible to accommodate families with small children, riders with bicycles, disabled passengers with wheelchairs, or a pallet or two of freight.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} built a foundry at Knott Mill, near Chester Road in Hulme on {{the site}} of former premises which had served a similar purpose but had fallen into disuse subsequent to the death of its owner, Alexander Brodie, in 1811. The site was near to William's address as known in 1832, which was 26 Jackson's Lane, Hulme. (The lane was subsequently renamed Great Jackson Street). A <b>key</b> <b>advantage</b> of the site was the adjacent River Medlock, sources of water being vital for iron founding and the operation of steam engines, and it was the erosion caused by this watercourse which required the works to be built on two levels. It has been noted that the Medlock had a greater concentration of steam engines along its length than any other similar river in England {{and the quality of the}} water was so poor, due to industrial pollution, that there were immense difficulties with priming in steam engine boilers.|$|E
