40|$|Introduction: Wheat is {{the most}} {{important}} crops and bread made from in Iranian diet, which contamination of wheat and flour storage in adverse environmental conditions can lead to contamination with toxic fungi particularly aflatoxin producing fungi. The aim of current {{study was to determine the}} frequency and type of fungal contaminants in the distributed flours in Yazd bakeries. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 80 bakeries' flour samples and 20 flour samples of flour producer factories were collected. After measuring their moisture, dilutions from 10 - 2 to 10 - 6 of flour samples were cultivated on Saboraud dextrose agar plates and by enumeration of isolated colonies, their genus and species were identified based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Data was analyzed by SPSS software using descriptive statistics such as average and Chi square test. Differences were considered statistically signifi­cant when P < 0. 05. Results: A total of 2223 fungal colonies from 11 different genus and species were isolated and identified from samples of flour that only 7 % showed <b>fungal</b> <b>contaminations</b> more than allowable cut off points. Penicillium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger were the most prevalent and Alternaria, Vertisillium, Rhizopus and Fouma showed minimum contamination in studied flour samples in present study. Conclusion: Results of present study compared with other similar studies indicating a fairly favorable situation in terms of <b>fungal</b> <b>contaminations</b> in the distributed flour in Yazd bakeries...|$|R

40|$|Healthy {{seeds are}} a {{necessary}} condition for economic production of high quality vegetables, not only in organic production. Seed health comprises not just high levels of germination and emergence, but also absence of fungal infections. More than 200 genera of vegetable seed borne pathogenic fungi are listed in the literature: e. g. Alternaria, Ascochyta, Botrytis, Bremia, Cercospora, Colletotrichum, Peronospora, Phoma, Plasmopara, Phytophthora, Stemphylium, Septoria. Hot water seed treatment or hot air treatment can be applied to disinfect vegetable seeds. Both techniques result in an intensive soaking of the seeds, which makes expensive drying necessary to avoid unwanted germination of the grains. Disinfection of carrot seeds with aerated steam (90 sec. / 65 ° C.) completely eliminates <b>fungal</b> <b>contaminations</b> without impairing germination percentage. Because of the limited exposure time, little water is taken up by the grains, leading to comparably low drying costs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Spices (flavorings) are {{contaminated}} to microbial agents such as filamentous and yeast fungi during production processing. Almost {{these are}} grown and harvested in warm and humid {{areas of the}} world where the growth {{of a wide variety of}} organisms is readily supported. The aim of this study was to assess the <b>fungal</b> <b>contaminations</b> of three current spices including turmeric, black pepper and cinnamon from some supermarkets in Tehran and evaluating of their hygienic quality. Methods: In this cross- sectional study that was performed in laboratory of Medical Mycology, School of Public Health in Tehran University of Medical Sciences from December 2012 to September 2014, 165 packed spices including 55 samples from each 11 valid brands of cinnamon, turmeric and black pepper were selected from different regions of Tehran. Culture was performed on many different fungal media from 10 - 1 to 10 - 4 dilutions of their samples. The fungal colonies obtained from cultures were studied by traditional laboratory methods. On the other hand, the number of unknown possible colonies was identified by molecular methods and then all identified colonies were counted. Results: Totally, from 165 packed spices, 4317 colonies include 29 different fungal species were isolated and identified from cinnamon (1520), turmeric (1373) and black pepper (1424). The etiologic agents were mainly including Aspergillus niger (7. 3 %), Penicillium spp. (4. 1 %), Paecilomyces spp. (2. 8 %) and Aspergillus flavus (2. 3 %), respectively. Non-parametric Kruskal-wallis test indicated that there was no significant difference statistically among brands at each level. Also the present study showed P = 0. 0003 among under study spices. The most contaminated spices were cinnamon, while turmeric had the lowest contamination rate.

In this study, we tested the effects of silver nanoparticles on the sterilization rate (antifungal and antibacterial activity), regeneration and shoot formation of African violet "Pink Amiss" explants. These nanoparticles were synthesized from pomegranate peels and Damask rose petals extracts. We used a completely randomized design test with factorial arrangement to investigate various volumetric ratios of plant extracts to silver nitrate (1 : 20, 1 : 10, 1 : 5 and 1 : 1) on the culture contaminations. Using silver nanoparticles synthesized by the plant extracts, especially Damask rose petals extract resulted in no <b>fungal</b> and bacterial <b>contamination</b> in the African violet explants after 1 and 3 weeks {{as compared to the}} control, and silver nitrate (1 mM). All tested concentrations of the silver nanoparticles significantly (P &le 0. 05) controlled both bacterial and <b>fungal</b> <b>contaminations.</b> The 1 : 20 ratio of plant extracts to silver nitrate showed the best control. In addition, the highest regeneration (% 52) and shoot regeneration (% 38) was observed in this treatment. In conclusion, we suggest using silver nanoparticles synthesized by plant extracts for sterilization of in Vitro Culture for African Violet rather than using other chemicals such as silver nitrate...|$|R

An alternative in vitro method of quantification of sporozoites in whole tick-derived stabilates is proposed. The method consists of incubating serially diluted T. parva stabilates with bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes, the host cell that is infected naturally. Allowing the cultures to incubate undisturbed for the full cultivation period (10 days) reduced the variability among replicate titrations. <b>Fungal</b> <b>contaminations</b> were avoided by centrifuging stabilates at 400 g prior to the incubation, which did not precipitate sporozoites significantly.

40|$|The {{disposability}} of {{high numbers}} of entomophagous insects for their use in biological control strategies is an old objective carried on, between others, by the rearing in different kinds of artificial diets. The definition and the perfecting of these diets are at first based on nutritional studies. Food or carcass analyses, nutritional balance studies, and deletion/supplementation methods allow to evaluate the different nutritional needs. Nitrogen sources are the most critical needs especially with fast growing entomophagous insects. Lipids and carbohydrates mainly constitute energy sources with storage possibility. Other nutrients such as salts and vitamins are also needed, and sometimes some specific polyunsaturated fatty acids. There are other important physiological requirements, concerning the digestion process, the respiration, or the hormonal balances.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Diabetic foot is {{the result}} of {{uncontrolled}} diabetes and imperfect sanitary care which leads to necrotic lesions, gangrene and finally amputation. Secondary mycotic infections play a principal role to produce chronic lumpy lesions. This study was designed to investigate the incidence of fungal pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Materials and methods: The study population included 120 consecutive diabetic patients who were hospitalized in the department of vascular surgery due to diabetic foot during 2006 - 2008. Direct fresh smear and fungal culture were performed for each patient. <b>Fungal</b> <b>contaminations</b> were confirmed by direct microscopy and/or culture. Results: The ages of the patients were between 32 to 86 years old. Of those 86 (71. 7 %) individuals were male and 34 (28. 3 %) were female. Direct examinations in 10 % KOH were positive for fungal element in 25 (20. 8 %) cases, but cultures were positive in 30 (25 %) cases. Candida species were the most predominantly isolated fungi (23 patients). Dermatophytic infection due to Trichophyton mentagrophytes was observed in three cases. The isolated opportunistic molds were known as Acremonium spp., Aspergillus fumigatus and Scopulariopsis spp. Significant correlation was found between infection, gender and age of the patients (P= 0. 0001 and P= 0. 0001). Conclusion: This study shows that fungal infection can be observed in about more than 20 % of diabetic foot and causes a lesion with poor prognosis.
