In comparison with off-the-shelf electromechanical actuators, VSAs present the possibility to control the mechanical stiffness at the output <b>joint</b> <b>shaft,</b> thus leading to the need of new performance and classification criteria, measuring systems and more generally control policies. Thanks to the adoption of the CANopen model at the ISO/OSI application layer, the proposed controller, developed under Linux-Xenomai, is able to real-time communicate over CANbus to retrieve sensor related information such as encoder positions, and recruit to the motor drivers the current related commands. Moreover, mainly thanks to the modularity and the multi-process real-time arrangement of the overall architectural framework, it is able to precisely estimate and control the stiffness of the particular mechanical device only relying on force and positioning data, with no reference to the current mechanical implementation or its model. Some experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the overall architecture are carried out and results are discussed as well as some considerations related to the overall reliability and accuracy of the estimator with respect to the external disturbances and measuring errors...|$|E

The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|E

The current design {{is intended to be}} a bench-test for future development towards applications in haptic teleoperation purposed exoskeletons. The main feature of the pVSJ is its capability of varying the stiffness with infinite range based on a simple mechanical system. Moreover, the joint can rotate freely at the zero stiffness case without any limitation. The stiffness varying mechanism consists of two torsional springs, mounted with an offset from the pVSJ rotation center and coupled with the <b>joint</b> <b>shaft</b> by an idle roller. The position of the roller between the pVSJ rotation center and the spring's center is controlled by a linear sliding actuator fitted on the chassis of the joint. The variation of the output stiffness is obtained by changing the distance from the roller-springs contact point to the joint rotation center (effective arm). If this effective arm is null, the stiffness of the joint will be zero. The stiffness increases to reach high stiffness values when the effective arm approaches its maximum value, bringing the roller close to the torsional springs' center. The experimental results matched with the physical-based modeling of the pVSJ in terms of stiffness variation curve, stiffness dependency upon the springs' elasticity, joint deflection and the spring's deflection...|$|E

This thesis {{presents}} {{design and}} construction details of a 12 Dofs biped walking robot. Bipedal walking {{is one of the}} most challenging research fields on humanoid robots. So this work aimed at providing experience on bipedal walking and to be pre-study of {{design and construction}} of a full humanoid robot. Therefore, biped robot design has no head and arms. Robot structure is formed by four subassemblies with torso, hip, knee and ankle. Kinematic structure is 6 -Dof at the leg, 3 Dof at the hip, one at the knee and two at the ankle. The biped robot’s total weight is 55 kg and its height is 142 cm. Humanoid robots are autonomous robots, because they can adapt to changes in their environments or their self and continue to reach their goal. This is the main difference between humanoid and other kinds of robots. In this context, some of the capacities of a humanoid robot may include, among others: self-maintenance, autonomous learning, avoiding harmful situations to people, property and itself, safe interacting with human beings and the environment. Humanoid robots are created to imitate some of the same physical and mental tasks that humans undergo daily. Scientists and engineers from many different fields combine their efforts to create a robot as human-like as possible. The main goal for the robot is that one day it will be able to both understand human intelligence, reason and act like humans. If humanoids are able to do so, they could eventually work in collaboration with humans to create a more productive and higher quality future. Another important benefit of developing humanoid robot is to understand the human body s biological and mental processes. Asimo {{is one of the most}} successful humanoid robot project for all times. Honda and Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center develop it since middle of the 1980 ’s. Until today, 12 different prototypes are developed and manufactured. The most popular one of these prototypes is announced in 2005 with name of New Asimo. HRP is another milestone humanoid robot prototype, is developed by AIST, METI and NEDO in Japan. In the past several years, successful prototypes HRP 4 -C and HRP- 4 are announced to public. In order to define design criteria belongs to assembly groups; hip, knee and ankle, a beam model simulation is used with a pre-defined dimensions and mass. Bipedal robots in literature are considered in defining masses and dimensions for beam model simulation. Beam robot model has 12 Dofs and 35 kg mass totally. Joints’ angular displacements, angular velocities and torques are revealed form results of computer simulation based on beam model. Simulated walking speed of the beam model is 1 km/h under condition of predefined foot trajectories. In the presence of the simulation results, an inquiry list is generated and design criteria of bipedal robot studied in this thesis is derived from results and that inquiry list. After clarification of the goals and defining the frame of the project, verbal construction structures of joints’ mechanical systems are derived. These schemes, states systems inputs and outputs in terms of energy, signal, matter, and defines interactions between them. System’s elementary function structure is expressed with Koller elementary function figures using the verbal construction structure. A concept design that meets the requirements of design criteria and project goals, is introduced and improvements and detailing of project is made based of this concept design. Concept design describes location, shapes, manufacturing techniques and power transmission system of the joints. Mechanical structure and units such as motors, couplings etc. are explained in the section of robots joints detailed design. During the design phase, parts that are seem to be critical according to their structure, are analyzed with finite element methods and necessary improvements are done. All Dofs are driven by dc motors. Harmonic drive units are used to reduce the velocity which is provided by motors. Also, it provides stiff and robust mechanical structure because of it has no backlash. Axes of the at hip joint, intersect at one point. Thus, inverse kinematic calculations are fairly straightforward. Incremental encoders are mounted to motor shafts to feedback the system. Moreover, initial conditions are defined by absolute encoders, are located to rotary axes of the each hip joints. Lower and upper legs consist of U-profiles containing all actuation and transmission mechanism of the knee and ankle joints. An industrial computer with real-time operating system, all motor drivers and sensors interfaces and a battery are situated on an upper body upon the hip joints. Knee and ankle joints are driven by vertically placed actuators through ball screw mechanism. Actuators and transmission driving higher than the driven rotating Dofs. In such a kinematic configuration, the center of mass of the robot moves also higher in vertical with respect to that of robots with direct driven joints. The knee joint has 90 degrees motion range, and it is driven by a ball screw mechanism which is actuated by a dc actuator placed in the upper leg. To provide the required conversion ratio, ball screw mechanism is used to as velocity reducer. In a same way to the hip joint, the incremental encoder is mounted to the dc motor shaft of the knee joint, and also, the absolute encoder is placed on the knee <b>joint</b> <b>shaft</b> to get rid of the measurement errors which may occur because of transmission mechanisms. In the lower leg, 2 Dofs of the ankle joints are driven by dc electrical actuators. Driving torque of the actuators is transmitted to the ankle joints by ball screw mechanism similar to the knee joint. The ball screw mechanism are guided on a polyamide part which is mounted on lower leg, therefore only linear displacements are allowed to the mechanism. Complexity of the power transmission of the ankle joint causes uncertain feedback by only incremental encoder. Therefore, additional absolute encoders are mounted to each ankle joints. Besides, 6 axes force-torque sensors are placed over feet to measure the forces and torques which are required for the control loop. The sensory system of the biped robot includes incremental and absolute encoders at all 12 joints and two force-torque sensors at each ankle. The components of the interaction forces exerted by the ground on the biped robot will be measured. The incremental encoders attached to the motor shafts to measure the angular displacements relative to initial values of each joint. Resolution of the incremental encoder which is 500 increments per revolution satisfies qualified measurement with highly stiff harmonic drive gears. Since an incremental encoder measures differentiation of angular positions, initial angular position of all joints must be measured by absolute encoders. The absolute encoders which are integrated to shafts of joints measure the initial values of joints before the biped robot stars walking. Measurement errors of the absolute encoders are negligible thanks to its 12 -bit resolution pre revolutions. The biped robot consist of 12 Maxon dc motors driven by Epos motor drivers. The motor drivers drive dc motors with respect to trajectory data which is received from the computer via canbus. The embedded computer receives data from absolute encoders and force-torque sensors and transmits data to motor drivers via canbus. The computer which is installed embedded real time Linux operating system will provide the trajectories for static walking and control algorithms for dynamic walking. To simulate the biped robot model and control algorithm, Msc-Adams and Matlab-Simulink software packages are used. Simulink is responsible for the pattern generation and the dynamic controller, and Adams is responsible for the biped robot model. Reference joint trajectories are generated by Simulink and are sent to Adams. Adams solves the inverse dynamics of the biped robot and sends joint torques and contact forces back to Simulink. Feet paths are generated off-line and also desired ZMP references are generated off-line in accordance with the foot placements. To solve the inverse kinematics problem of the biped robot model, feet and torso paths must be known simultaneously. Torso path is generated to ensure dynamic balance of the robot. In torso path generation model predictive control and linear inverted pendulum model is used. Adams takes reference joint trajectories as inputs and gives joint torques and contact forces as outputs. CAD drawings of the parts are imported into Adams and all material properties and constraints are defined in Adams environment. Subsequent to selection of ready to use units and final design, electronic components and control equipments that takes place in the project are defined and interactions between each other is explained. Besides, computer simulation derived for beam model, is rerun for new designed model and angular displacements, angular velocities and torques are calculated with a high accuracy. Design and selection of ready to use units are validated with new simulation results. Following to design cycle, technical drawings for manufacturing and assemblies are drawn according to convenient manufacturing techniques and tolerances are defined. Manufacturing folder which contains technical drawings and all necessary information for manufacturing is created. Sequent, in the light of problems encountered during assemblies and first trials, some modifications are done and final design is released. After construction and assembly process and integration electrical components, joint’s basic functions and control system has been tested with movements in the air. The transmission mechanism of the hip, knee and ankle joints, are tested under various input. All sensors have been put in use and joint position references successfully controlled. The next step is, put the robot on ground and perform the actions are done in air. After test stage, experimentation of biped walking will start. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that for a robotic {{manipulator}} without sensors on the end-effector, the end-effector has to follow a path in its workspace without regard to any feedback other than its <b>joints</b> <b>shaft</b> encoder or resolvers. This fact imposes severe limitations on certain tasks where an interaction between the robot and the environment is needed. However, with the help of sensors, a robot can exhibit an "adaptive behavior", the robot being able to deal flexibly with changes in its environment and to execute complicated skilled tasks. In this paper, we firstly propose a new control strategy based on multisensor fusion with three different sensors-that is, encoders mounted at each joint of the robot with six degrees of freedom, a wrist force sensor and an accelerometer-whose goal is to obtain a suitable contact force estimator for the three Cartesian axes. Secondly, the corresponding self-calibration method developed for the commented contact force observer is also proposed. This procedure aims at offering a `plug-and-play' solution for the integration of different kind of accelerometers with the final goal of obtaining an observer capable of estimating the contact force exerted by an industrial robotic manipulator. To validate both the behaviour of the contact force observer and the performance of the self-calibrating procedure, different experiments were carried out on an ABB industrial robot with open control system architecture.

40|$|Abstract—Research on {{damage of}} gears and gear pairs using {{vibration}} signals remains very attractive, because vibration signals from a gear pair are complex {{in nature and}} not easy to interpret. Predicting gear pair defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of gears pairs in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information generally obscured by the noise from dynamic factors of other gear pairs. This article presents the value of cepstrum analysis in vehicle gearbox fault diagnosis. Cepstrum represents the overall power content of a whole family of harmonics and sidebands when more than one family of sidebands is present at the same time. The concept for the measurement and analysis involved in using the technique are briefly outlined. Cepstrum analysis is used for detection of an artificial pitting defect in a vehicle gearbox loaded with different speeds and torques. The test stand is equipped with three dynamometers; the input dynamometer serves asthe internal combustion engine, the output dynamometers introduce the load on the flanges of the output <b>joint</b> <b>shafts.</b> The pitting defect is manufactured on the tooth side of a gear of the fifth speed on the secondary shaft. Also, a method for fault diagnosis of gear faults is presented based on order Cepstrum. The procedure is illustrated with the experimental vibration data of the vehicle gearbox.

As a result of this work, the longitudinal response of the slider block is observed with applied moment as well as slider block response along with reaction forces at joint R 2 is investigated in case of imposed rotational motion. presents a multibody dynamics approach that uses a simulation of crank-slider mechanism in ADAMS software [5].

2500|$|Cantinieau {{went to the}} Société Matra {{to build}} a two seat development, the MC-101. [...] This was also an open steel tube design, more complex {{particularly}} in the tail boom, though the undercarriage was reduced to simple skids [...] apart. [...] It had a [...] Hirth HM-504 engine, enclosed in a long, smooth nosed but partially open sided cowling, driving the oscillating rotor hub via a 41:6 reduction gearbox, clutch and Paulstra universal joint. The rotor blades were machined from duralumin. A three blade tail rotor was driven via another Paulstra <b>joint</b> and cardan <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a modular {{propeller}} is to provide more user control on boat rally speed. Each modular propeller made of composite materials has three main parts: the hub part with a front-end cap, a set of replaceable blades, and a rear <b>joint</b> to the <b>shaft.</b> The propeller blade parts assembly into slides of the hub requires not professional assistance, but desscrewing a high quality bronze to remove cone. The blade` bottom joint part of composite blades must be compatible by manufacturer design to overall license the blade assembly for use.|$|R
