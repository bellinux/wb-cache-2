40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to apply a new {{backward}} and forward dispersion approach, starting from the original Rasmussen definition, which can give further insight into the interactions between industries and <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> in a multiregional framework. The method is based on identification of the Macro Multipliers and the related impact components of a model based on a bi-regional SAM, which allows for {{the representation of the}} bi-regional multisectoral and multi-industry model in a two-dimensional space defined by the two dominating impact components. From such representation, we derive a set of indices of intraregional and interregional backward and forward dispersion that identifies key groups of industries and <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors.</b> The strength of these groups is further evaluated in terms of correlation of the impact components within the groups and cross-correlation between industry and <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> groups.

3000|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the chaebol using flow-of-funds (FOF) accounts. The FOF accounts consist {{of the balance}} sheets of all <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> in a country, including the foreign sector. The FOF table shows the interrelations between various <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors.</b> In this analysis, we integrate the chaebol into FOF accounts. Applying the input–output analysis method to FOF accounts, Y and [...] Y^* matrices (asset–liability matrix of <b>institutional</b> sector-by-institutional <b>sector)</b> are obtained. Furthermore, using a Leontief inverse matrix, four kinds of indices (the power-of-dispersion index and the sensitivity-of-dispersion index) are estimated. Some previous studies attempted to subdivide the corporate sector of the FOF accounts into various industries. For example, Nishiyama (1991) used the balance sheets and income statements of each industry in Japan to subdivide non-financial corporations in FOF accounts into 37 industries. In this paper, the power indices of 44 <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> are reported. Kim (2016) used this method to disaggregate the Korean FOF accounts into 115 <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors,</b> including 95 types of inter-industries, combined with the Financial Statement Analysis data. According to these studies, using balance sheets and income statement data for each industry, {{it is possible to}} generate expanded FOF accounts that indicate the financial transactions of each industry. Therefore, if the financial statements of the chaebol are obtained, then {{it will be possible to}} add the chaebol sector to the FOF account. This research aims to find and identify the characteristics and roles of the chaebol in the financial system of Korea. This paper consists of four sections. The first section is the introduction. The second section explains the data and the analytical method adopted in this study. The third section describes the results of our research in three parts. Conclusions are drawn in the last section.|$|R

Insertion of financial accounts into the SAM requires the inclusion of flows related to capital accounts and financial asset (or liability) accounts (Emini and Fofack 2004) by each <b>Institutional</b> <b>Sector.</b> More specifically, net savings by <b>institutional</b> <b>sector</b> is a balance of incomes and expenditures. Together with net capital transfers (receivables and payables), net savings by <b>institutional</b> <b>sector</b> is used to accrue the non-financial flows (United Nations 2008). The resulting surplus or deficit is the net lending or borrowing, and this figure is the balancing item to move forward from the capital accounts to the financial accounts. In contrast, the financial accounts do not have any balancing item carried forward to other accounts.|$|E

30|$|The {{determination}} of disposable income by <b>institutional</b> <b>sector</b> {{allows us to}} find the final demand for consumption and savings.

Disposable income can be allocated between final consumption and savings according to the intertemporal well-being function of each <b>institutional</b> <b>sector.</b> All the institutional sectors maximize the present value of their intertemporal utility function, which can be interpreted as the well-being function (Prasad et al. 2004) depending on the final consumption expenditure and gross savings, subject to the lifetime budget constraint. The lifetime budget constraint is the lifetime disposable income that derives from the sum of compensation of primary factors plus net transfers and taxes to or from the other agents occurring in the secondary income distribution phase in each period.|$|E

The analysis of these modalities is complex since the delimitations of the public and private spheres of R&D activities are liable to change depending on whether the funding, the production or the utilization of knowledge is considered. To that end, we show that the principle of an institutional diversity associated with the organisation of R&D activities between these sectors can in fact be questioned. Indeed, the specific logics and pratices of the main <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> become rather interlinked.
