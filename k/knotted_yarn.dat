A final Design Challenge requires youth to design and create a personal piece utilizing skills learned in these beginning projects. 4 -H Youth Development, Cornell Cooperative Extension Department of Fiber Science and Apparel Design, Cornell Universit...|$|R
50|$|Once the bobbin is full, {{the hobby}} spinner either {{puts on a}} new bobbin, or forms a skein, or balls the yarn. A skein is a coil of yarn twisted into a loose <b>knot.</b> <b>Yarn</b> is skeined using a niddy-noddy or other type of skein -winder. Yarn is rarely balled {{directly}} after spinning, it will be stored in skein form, and transferred to a ball only if needed. Knitting from a skein, is difficult as the <b>yarn</b> forms <b>knots,</b> {{in this case it}} is best to ball. Yarn to be plied is left on the bobbin.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a computing method to determine the geometrical parameters of fibers and the textile periodical structure. This method combines two two-dimensional discrete fast Fourier transforms to calculate a diffraction pattern from a diffraction pattern image of material under consideration. The result {{is the same as}} that of observation of a diffraction pattern which is achieved by illuminating the diffraction pattern image of material by a beam of coherent monochromatic light. After the first transform we obtain the Fraunhofer diffraction picture with clearly visible elements of the periodical structure of material, but distances in this picture are reciprocally proportional to distances in the periodical structure of the source object so additional calculations are required. After the second transform we have a clear periodical structure of diffraction maximums where distances between them are equal to distances between repeating elements in the source material (fibers, <b>knots,</b> <b>yarns,</b> etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{latch hook}} tool traces its origin to the {{invention}} of the latch needle. Invented in 1847, the latch needle was part of a knitting machine that wrapped yarn around the latch and pushed through a canvas before pulling it through and <b>knotting</b> the <b>yarn</b> to the canvas. In the 1920s, the tool was created by combining the hand hook with the latch.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the Mechanical {{properties}} of polypropylene yarn of outer protection layer on Submarine High Voltage Cable, twisted around submarine cable,is determined on various conditions at ABB Company. In the first step, tensile tests are done with polypropylene yarn specimens {{with and without}} Bitumen at Room temperature. In the second step,tensile tests are done with polypropylene yarn specimens with and without Bitumen and with <b>knotted</b> polypropylene <b>yarn</b> namely: the Fishermen’s knot, the Weaver’s knot, the Square knot and the Overhand knot at Warm Condition (60 ˚c) and Cold Condition(- 5 ˚c). In the final step,it is proposed to obtain numerical solution using FEM analysis with ABAQUS Software to obtain the hoop stress, the yarn stresses from twisting cable and analyzing of the cylindrical buckling in the buckling torsion and buckling bending on the outer layer of submarine cable with polypropylene material that is mixed with Bitumen...|$|R

The weaving is {{undertaken}} during winter by the female members of the extended family, girls learning from their mothers and grandmothers and wives assisting their mothers-in-law. The carpet is made on horizontal or vertical looms using multi-coloured wool, cotton or silk yarn coloured with natural dyes. Applying special techniques to create pile carpets, weavers <b>knot</b> the pile <b>yarn</b> around threads of the warp; pile-less carpets are variously made with interlacing structural warps, wefts, and patterning wefts. The cutting of a finished carpet from the loom is an unusually solemn celebration.|$|R
5000|$|A {{latch hook}} {{is both the}} tool and the textile art of latch hooking. Latch hooking differs from {{traditional}} rug hooking and locker hooking by the physical <b>knotting</b> of the <b>yarn</b> to canvas. Latch hook was invented {{in the nineteenth century}} with the latch needle, in the twentieth century the latch needle underwent numerous variations including the hand tool used by artisans and crafters to produce latch hook rugs. While rug hooking uses a base fabric of burlap or hessian, latch hooking uses specially woven rug canvas. Rug canvases range from 3.3 holes per inch (hpi) to 5 hpi. The pattern may be stencilled onto the canvas or worked from a chart similar to a needlepoint pattern. Latch hook yarns may be bough pre-cut (usually 2.5 inch lengths) or in skeins and cut to the desired length.In his book [...] "The Hooked Rug," [...] published in 1930, American writer William Winthrop Kent describes a form of rugmaking [...] "A canvas is used like cross-stitch canvas only coarser, which has every third mesh a large one. It is held on the knee or on a table. The pieces of wool yarn are cut exactly the same length by a gauge. The hook used has a catch or latch on it and is inserted in one hole and out the next in the next row, as follows: The wool is held in the left hand and above the canvas, then doubled and the double end is slipped over the hook, the catch being up or open. The hook is then drawn out through the canvas toward the worker, the cut ends being kept in the left hand. The catch by this action drops down and secures the wool. The tool is next pushed forward through the wool loop and catches the two ends held in the left hand, then the loop is held in the left hand and has the two ends pulled through it with the hook. To pull out hook and draw tight the two cut ends finishes the knot. This is really a pile fabric and is known as a Turkey Rug but sprang from the hooking process as the earlier hook used was of the crochet hook form." ...|$|R
