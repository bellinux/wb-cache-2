5|$|Stela 114 {{dates to}} AD 435, in the Early Classic. It was moved in antiquity to be reset {{into the base}} of Structure 2. The stela has a long hieroglyphic text that <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> {{translation}} but probably commemorates a royal enthronement in 411.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
25|$|Poitou-Charentes – Use of Occitan has {{declined}} {{here in the}} few parts {{it used to be}} spoken, replaced by French. Only Charente Limousine, {{the eastern part of the}} region, <b>has</b> <b>resisted.</b> The natural and historical languages of most of the region are the langues d'oïl Poitevin and Saintongeais.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} his father, an [...] "ordinary German", had {{understood}} {{the nature of the}} Nazi regime and <b>had</b> <b>resisted</b> it, coloured Fest's view of his fellow Germans {{for the rest of his}} life. He never accepted that Germans had not known what Hitler was doing or that they could not <b>have</b> <b>resisted</b> the Nazi regime.|$|R
6000|$|She {{opened the}} door, and, {{standing}} inside it, {{after he had}} passed her, gave him her hand. He <b>had</b> <b>resisted</b> her look, he <b>had</b> <b>resisted</b> her words, but the magnetic fascination of her touch conquered him at the final moment. [...] "I can't leave you!" [...] he said, holding helplessly by the hand she had given him. [...] "What must I do?" ...|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} cosmic age (the second 3000 years), Ahriman, who until then <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> the exhortations of his demons, is roused from his {{impotence}} by Jeh's beguiling devices, who promises to destroy the creatures of Ohrmazd (Bundahishn 3.1-7). Incited, Ahriman defiles her with a kiss, and from this act Jeh is thenceforth afflicted with menstruation (Bundahishn 3.6-8).|$|E
25|$|The firm {{promotes}} {{very heavily}} from within, {{most notably in}} its executive suite. The company <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> the trend toward outsider CEOs. Paul Otellini was a 30-year veteran of the company when he {{assumed the role of}} CEO. All of his top lieutenants have risen through the ranks after many years with the firm. In many cases, Intel's top executives have spent their entire working careers with Intel.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Labor party <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> {{offering}} {{criticism of}} the Government's handling of the issue and has on several occasions offered the Government in principle support for Kevin Andrews' decision to cancel Haneef's visa. This contrasts with statements issued by The Greens which have been strongly critical of the Government's actions. Federal Labor's failure to criticise the Government is widely seen as an attempt by its leadership to avoid a political wedge issue in the lead up to the late-2007 federal election.|$|E

25|$|In-N-Out Burger <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> {{franchising}} {{its operations}} or going public; {{one reason is}} the prospect of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth. The company's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies. For example, In-N-Out {{is one of the}} few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines – starting at US$11.00 per hour in California, as of May 2017. The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base, and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys.|$|E
25|$|Mafiosi have {{protected}} {{a great variety}} of clients over the years: landowners, plantation owners, politicians, shopkeepers, drug dealers, etc. Whilst some people are coerced into buying protection and some do not receive any actual protection for their money (extortion), by and large there are many clients who actively seek and benefit from mafioso protection. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why the Mafia <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> more than a century of government efforts to destroy it: the people who willingly solicit these services protect the Mafia from the authorities. If one is enjoying the benefits of Mafia protection, one does not want the police arresting one's mafioso.|$|E
25|$|She has {{involved}} {{herself in the}} causes of her protagonists which are generally women, farm workers and laborers and also include the indigenous, such as the Zapatistas in Chiapas in the 1990s. She puts many in touch with those {{on the left side}} of Mexico's and the world's political spectrum although she is not officially affiliated with any of them. She considers herself a feminist to the bone and looks upon civil movements with sympathy and enthusiasm. However she <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> offers to become formally involved in political positions. She became involved in Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s 2005 presidential campaign. She wrote about the seven-week occupation of the Zócalo that followed López Obrador's loss in 2006. She blames Mexico's businessmen and the United States for his loss as well as López Obrador's naivete.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of Colombian President Álvaro Uribe <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> criticism of aerial spraying of coca and poppy and has seen major reductions in both crops {{according to the}} United Nations Office of Crime and Drugs (See also Plan Colombia). In 2003, over 1,300 square kilometers of mature coca were sprayed and eradicated in Colombia, where {{at the start of}} the year, approximately 1,450 square kilometers had been planted. This strategic accomplishment prevented the production over 500 tonnes of cocaine, sufficient to supply all the cocaine users in both US and Europe for one year. Further, it eliminated upward of $100 million of illicit income in Colombia. No effect on prices or availability in the marketplace has been noted, and the actual number of acres of coca planted seems to have actually increased, largely shifting to more remote areas or into neighboring countries. Aerial spraying also has the unintended consequence of destroying legitimate crop fields in the process.|$|E
500|$|The {{steel pipe}} is {{resistant}} to gunshots and <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> them on several occasions, but on October 4, 2001, a drunken gunman named Daniel Carson Lewis shot a hole into a weld near Livengood, causing the second-largest mainline {{oil spill in}} pipeline history. Approximately [...] leaked from the pipeline; [...] were recovered and reinjected into the pipeline. Nearly [...] of tundra were soiled and were removed in the cleanup. The pipeline was repaired and was restarted more than 60 hours later. Lewis was found guilty in December 2002 of criminal mischief, assault, drunken driving, oil pollution, and misconduct.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{described}} his songwriting as [...] "a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me it's {{a bit from}} here, a bit from there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what you're doing ... Song writing is like a way of feeling connected to mystery." [...] He <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> the label of 'storyteller' and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; [...] "they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it's just that situation". Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in [...] "To Her Door", [...] "Love Never Runs on Time", and [...] "How to Make Gravy".|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Ripley {{announced}} {{that she would be}} writing a cookbook about family food. She said, [...] "I want to help people prepare good food for their kids, really practical stuff that's easy, quick, healthy and you can whizz up in the blender for the baby." [...] Fay's Family Food was published by Michael Joseph, an imprint of Penguin Books, in April 2009 and was selected by Marie-Claire Digby of The Irish Times as a [...] "summer read". Ripley's second book, entitled What's For Dinner, was published in April 2012. Since the release of her first book, she <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> offers from television production companies to make her own cookery series. In November 2016, Ripley guest presented an episode of The One Show with Alex Jones. She guest presented an episode with Angela Scanlon in January 2017.|$|E
500|$|Saint Anselm College <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> {{what the}} college {{sees as the}} grade {{inflation}} trend at many of America's college's and universities. At Saint Anselm, the top 25% of the class has a 3.1 GPA; the median grade at the college is around a 2.5 GPA. While the Dean's List at most schools begin at a 3.5 GPA, Saint Anselm awards students with the honor at a 3.0 GPA. According to a 2006 Fox News article, former Dean of the College Father Peter Guerin, O.S.B., {{is quoted as saying}} that today's [...] "parents may view universities as a consumer market in which they're in a way paying for the diploma.... Students who attend class on a regular basis and are paying tuition feel that they should be receiving that A, even if they have not deserved it." [...] Some professors and administrators believe that inflating grades makes it harder for students to realize their academic strengths and weaknesses and may encourage students to take classes based on grade expectations. The practice also makes it harder for parents and students {{to determine whether or not}} the grade was earned. A curriculum committee was set up in 1980 to meet with the academic dean and review the grading polices on a monthly basis. The previous president of the college, Father Jonathan DeFelice, is quoted as saying, [...] "I cannot speak for everyone, but if I'm headed for the operating room, I will take the surgeon who earned his or her 'A' the honest way".|$|E

2500|$|The University <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> {{attempts}} by adjunct faculty to join unions, arguing that its academic staff {{are exempt from}} employee rights due to {{its status as a}} religious institution.

2500|$|Modern Turkey succeeded the Ottoman Empire in 1923 and vehemently {{denies that}} a {{genocide}} took place. It <b>has</b> <b>resisted</b> calls {{in recent years}} by scholars, countries and international organizations to acknowledge the crime. The Armenian genocide is the second most-studied case of genocide after the Holocaust. Lemkin coined [...] "genocide" [...] with the Armenian genocide in mind.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry.
