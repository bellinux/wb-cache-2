60|$|Eurylochus and his {{followers}} now passed under a lofty portal, and looked through the open doorway into {{the interior of the}} palace. The first thing that they saw was a spacious hall, and a fountain in the middle of it, gushing up towards the ceiling out of a marble basin, and falling back into it with a continual plash. The water of this fountain, as it spouted upward, was constantly taking new shapes, not very distinctly, but plainly enough for a nimble fancy to recognize what they were. Now it was the shape of a man in a long robe, the fleecy whiteness of which was made out of the fountain's spray; now it was a lion, or a tiger, or a wolf, or an ass, or, as often as anything else, a <b>hog,</b> <b>wallowing</b> in the marble basin as if it were his sty. It was either magic or some very curious machinery that caused the gushing waterspout to assume all these forms. But, before the strangers had time to look closely at this wonderful sight, their attention was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable sound. A woman's voice was singing melodiously in another room of the palace, and with her voice was mingled the noise of a loom, at which she was probably seated, weaving a rich texture of cloth, and intertwining the high and low sweetness of her voice into a rich tissue of harmony.|$|R
60|$|Lane could grasp some infinitesimal {{truth of}} the sublime and horrible change war had wrought in the souls of {{soldiers}}. That change was too great for any mind but the omniscient to grasp in its entirety. War had killed in some soldiers a belief in Christ: in others it had created one. War had unleashed the old hidden primitive instincts of manhood: likewise it had fired hearts to hate of hate and love of love, to the supreme ideal consciousness could conceive. War had brought out the monstrous in men and as well the godlike. Some soldiers had become cowards; others, heroes. There were thousands of soldiers who became lions to fight, hyenas to snarl, beasts to debase, <b>hogs</b> to <b>wallow.</b> There were equally as many who were forced to fight, who could not kill, whose gentleness augmented under the brutal orders of their officers. There were those who ran toward the front, heads up, singing {{at the top of}} their lungs. There were those who slunk back. Soldiers became cold, hard, materialistic, bitter, rancorous: and qualities antithetic to these developed in their comrades.|$|R

60|$|It really {{seemed like}} coming {{up out of}} the earth into the midst of the town, when we found {{ourselves}} so unexpectedly in upper Bolsena. We were in a little nook, surrounded by old edifices, and called the Piazza del Orologio, on account of a clock that was apparent somewhere. The castle was close by, and from its platform there was a splendid view of the lake and all the near hill-country. The castle itself is still in good condition, and apparently as strong as ever it was as respects the exterior walls; but within there seemed to be neither floor nor chamber, nothing but the empty shell of the dateless old fortress. The stones at the base and lower part of the building were so massive that I should think the Etrurians must have laid them; and then perhaps the Romans built a little higher, and the mediaeval people raised the battlements and towers. But we did not look long at the castle, our attention being drawn to the singular aspect of the town itself, which--to speak first of its most prominent characteristic--is the very filthiest place, I do believe, that was ever inhabited by man. Defilement was everywhere; in the piazza, in nooks and corners, strewing the miserable lanes from side to side, the refuse of every day, and of accumulated ages. I wonder whether the ancient Romans were as dirty a people as we everywhere find those who have succeeded them; for there seems to have been something in the places that have been inhabited by Romans, or made famous in their history, and in the monuments of every kind that they have raised, that puts people in mind of their very earthliness, and incites them to defile therewith whatever temple, column, ruined palace, or triumphal arch may fall in their way. I think it must be an hereditary trait, probably weakened and robbed of a little of its horror by the influence of milder ages; and I am much afraid that Caesar trod narrower and fouler ways in his path to power than those of modern Rome, or even of this disgusting town of Bolsena. I cannot imagine anything worse than these, however. Rotten vegetables thrown everywhere about, musty straw, standing puddles, running rivulets of dissolved nastiness,--these matters were a relief amid viler objects. The town was full of great black <b>hogs</b> <b>wallowing</b> before every door, and they grunted at us with a kind of courtesy and affability as if the town were theirs, and it was their part to be hospitable to strangers. Many donkeys likewise accosted us with braying; children, growing more uncleanly every day they lived, pestered us with begging; men stared askance at us as they lounged in corners, and women endangered us with slops which they were flinging from doorways into the street. No decent words can describe, no admissible image can give an idea of this noisome place. And yet, I remember, the donkeys came up the height loaded with fruit, and with little flat-sided barrels of wine; the people had a good atmosphere--except as they polluted it themselves--on their high site, and {{there seemed to be no}} reason why they should not live a beautiful and jolly life.|$|R

For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males <b>wallow</b> in dry <b>soil</b> during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was one of}} {{the three}} {{worthless}} men that were eager for agricultural pursuits (Genesis Rabba xxxvi. 5); {{he was the first to}} plant, to become drunken, to curse, and to introduce slavery (Tan., Noah, 20; comp. Gen. l.c.). God blamed Noah for his intemperance, saying that he ought to have been warned by Adam, upon whom so much evil came through wine (Sanhedrin 70a). According to Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer (l.c.), Noah took into the ark a vine-branch which had been cast out with Adam from paradise. He had previously eaten its grapes, and their savor induced him to plant their seed, the results of which proved lamentable. When Noah was about to plant the vineyard, Satan offered him his help, for which he was to have a share in the produce. Noah consented. Satan then successively slaughtered a sheep, a lion, an ape, and a hog, fertilizing the ground with their blood. Satan thereby indicated to Noah that after drinking the first cup of wine, one is mild like a sheep; after the second, courageous like a lion; after the third, like an ape; and after the fourth, like a <b>hog</b> who <b>wallows</b> in mud (Midrash Agadah on Gen. ix. 21; Midrash Abkir, in Yal?., Gen. 61; comp.

This legend is narrated by Ibn Yahya (Shalshelet ha-Kabbalah, p. 75a, Amsterdam, 1697) thus: [...] "Noah, seeing a he-goat eat sour grapes and become intoxicated so that it began to frisk, took the root of that vine-branch and, after having washed it with the blood of a lion, a hog, a sheep, and an ape, planted it and it bore sweet grapes." ...|$|R

Random stratified sampling was conducted to assess impacts from hog damage on resources by vegetation type at a landscape scale. Landscape features such as topography, soil moisture, soil type, and dominant vegetative cover types were used to predict hog damage. The overall damage to vegetation from <b>hog</b> rooting or <b>wallowing</b> averaged 28 % within the 3 units of the BTNP. In the Big Sandy unit, floodplains had the most damage (45 %), whereas flatlands were mostly impacted in the Turkey Creek unit (46 %), and uplands in the Lance Rosier unit (32 %). These levels of damage were more severe and widespread than previously believed and support the premise that hog damage in the BTNP parallels the increase in hog abundance over the past 20 years...|$|R
60|$|The folding-doors swung quickly back, {{and left}} him {{standing}} behind the pillar, in the solitude of the outer hall.

Then there was a clatter of silver dishes, or golden ones, which made him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banqueting-hall.

Eurylochus could not conceive what had happened, unless a drove of swine had broken into the palace, attracted by the smell of the feast. Chancing to cast his eyes at the fountain, he saw that it did not shift its shape, as formerly, nor looked either like a long-robed man, or a lion, a tiger, a wolf, or an ass.

60|$|We {{lived to}} find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had placed a half-mile between himself and us. To avert suspicion, he had judged it best that the line should {{continue}} to move; so he caught that ram, and {{at the time that he}} was sitting on it making the rope fast to it, we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon, overcome by fatigue and distress. When he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging around, trying to rid itself of the rope, and this was the signal which we had risen up with glad shouts to obey. We had followed this ram round and round in a circle all day--a thing which was proven by the discovery that we had watered the Expedition seven times at one and same spring in seven hours. As expert a woodman as I am, I had somehow failed to notice this until my attention was called to it by a hog. This <b>hog</b> was always <b>wallowing</b> there, and as he was the only hog we saw, his frequent repetition, together with his unvarying similarity to himself, finally caused me to reflect that he must be the same hog, and this led me to the deduction that this must be the same spring, also--which indeed it was.|$|R

40|$|Grazing {{can either}} promote or reduce weed {{abundance}} {{at a particular}} site. By itself, grazing will rarely, if ever, completely eradicate invasive plants. However, when grazing treatments are combined with other control techniques, such as herbicides or biocontrol, severe infestations can be reduced and small infestations may be eliminated. Grazing animals may be particularly useful in areas where herbicides cannot be applied (e. g., near water) or are prohibitively expensive (e. g., large infestations). Animals {{can also be used}} as part of a restoration program by breaking up the soil and incorporating in seeds of desirable native plants. When not properly controlled, however, grazing or other actions of grazing animals (<b>wallowing,</b> pawing up <b>soil)</b> can cause significant damage to a system, and promote the spread and survival of invasive weeds. Overgrazing can reduce native plant cover, disturb soils, weaken native communities, and allow exotic weeds to invade.

50|$|Moonbeam McSwine: The {{unwashed}} but shapely form of languid, delectable Moonbeam {{was one of}} {{the iconic}} hallmarks of Lil Abner — an unkempt, impossibly lazy, corncob pipe-smoking, flagrant (and fragrant), raven-haired, earthly (and earthy) goddess. Beautiful Moonbeam preferred the company of pigs to suitors — much to the frustration of her equally lazy pappy, Moonshine McSwine. She was usually showcased luxuriating among the hogs, somewhat removed from the main action of the story, in a deliberate travesty of glamour magazines and pinup calendars of the day. Capp designed her in caricature of his wife Catherine (minus the dirt), who had also suggested Daisy Maes name. In one comic it is revealed that she bears a striking resemblance to a wealthy, well-dressed and well-washed woman named Gloria Van Welbuilt; a famous socialite. Despite her lazy nature and dirty appearance she was generally good-natured and kind as shown when she ran off to the Dogpatch, carrying two shmoos under her arms to save them from going extinct wondering if humanity will ever be good enough for them. She also consoled Abner to stop worrying about being a father. Moonbeam also seemed to have interests in romance as in some comic strips she was seen flirting with and even kissing various male characters including Abner. She once expressed the desire of having a family of her own and she actually discussed the matter of trapping a husband if she got cleaned up to Abner. In one strip it was revealed that Moonbeam was in fact in love with Abner when they were children. In the same strip it was shown that Moonbeam’s disposition for filth was born out of a failure to understand the turn-ons of Abner when he was a child. Strangely she actually disliked hogs as a child but after seeing Abner ignoring the openly romantic advances of a clean Daisy Mae, she dived right into a mud-hole headfirst where some <b>hogs</b> were <b>wallowing</b> to earn his love believing that if Abner didnt like clean girls he must have liked them dirty. Much to her disappointment however this too failed to capture his attention. Moonbeam was also unknowingly the star of a horror movie directed by Rock Pincus head film director of a race known as the Pincushions from Pincus 7. Unfortunately this venture ended in tragedy for Rock when he was unknowingly grilled, put into a hot dog bun and devoured while he was still alive.|$|R
5000|$|A popular {{theory of}} the origins of the name [...] "white rhinoceros" [...] is a {{mistranslation}} from Dutch to English. The English word [...] "white" [...] {{is said to have been}} derived by mistranslation of the Dutch word [...] "wijd", which means [...] "wide" [...] in English. The word [...] "wide" [...] refers to the width of the rhinoceros's mouth. So early English-speaking settlers in South Africa misinterpreted the [...] "wijd" [...] for [...] "white" [...] and the rhino with the wide mouth ended up being called the white rhino and the other one, with the narrow pointed mouth, was called the black rhinoceros. Ironically, Dutch (and Afrikaans) later used a calque of the English word, and now also call it a white rhino. This suggests the origin of the word was before codification by Dutch writers. A review of Dutch and Afrikaans literature about the rhinoceros has failed to produce any evidence that the word wijd was ever used to describe the rhino outside of oral use. Other popular theories suggest the name comes from its wide appearance throughout Africa, its color due to <b>wallowing</b> in calcareous <b>soil</b> or bird droppings or because of the lighter colour of its horn.|$|R
40|$|Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are {{considered}} an exotic, free-ranging ungulate distributed within numerous countries and continents {{to include the}} United States. The reproductive efficiency, lack of predators, land use practices for domestic livestock (e. g., feeding stations, introduced water sources, intense cropping practices, etc.), and diet are leading factors in the expansion of feral hogs throughout their range. Feral hogs negatively impact floral and faunal communities, agricultural lands, and residential and recreational areas to include concerns with public safety and disease transmission. My study objectives were to (1) assess feral hog abatement strategies by (A) evaluating trap designs with the inclusion of electrical fencing, and (B) evaluating candidate baits for feral hog-specificity, and (2) assess prevalence levels for feral hog diseases. I evaluated 3 corral trap designs differing in the addition of electric fence configurations. Feral hog capture success data were collected and used to determine trap design efficacy. Treatments evaluated included (A) control corral trap with no electrical configurations, (B) corral trap with 1 electrical leg, and (C) corral trap with 2 electrical legs. ANOVA analyses suggest no differences (df = 2, P = 0. 758) between trap designs; however, length of trapping effort (i. e., {{the number of days}} that trapping occurred) was a significant (df = 6, P < 0. 001) factor in determining trap success. Pre-baiting was an important factor in observed trapping success. Trapping success declined after fourth day of continuous trapping. I recommend short, intensive trapping efforts (e. g., < 4 days) when using corral traps in feral hog abatement programs. I also evaluated 14 candidate baits (with and without repellant) replicated 40 times to determine feral hog specificity. Three evaluated baits (i. e., PIGOUT? strawberry, corn, and rice) were selected (df = 2, P < 0. 05) more frequently by feral hogs than other combinations. Non-target species (e. g., raccoons) visited baits with repellants less (df = 2, P < 0. 05) than baits without repellants. Repellant had no direct impact on feral hog visitation at bait sites. Trapping data also suggests that grains commonly farmed in local or regional areas {{are more likely to be}} consumed by feral hogs and, therefore considered in baiting options. Finally, of 412 feral hogs captured, 86 were sampled for prevalence of pseudorabies and Brucella suis. The prevalence of pseudorabies and B. suis was 20. 9 % and 13. 9 %, respectively within the study area. Based on disease study results, I recommend that natural resource managers take necessary precautions to protect themselves by wearing protective equipment and equipment and properly cooking feral hog meat. Additionally, resource managers should properly administer vaccinations to domestic and companion animals, and restricting domestic and companion animals from areas of high risk (e. g., carcasses of dead <b>hogs</b> and <b>wallows)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Big Thicket National Preserve (BTNP) is {{a unit of}} the National Park Service {{whose mission}} prioritizes {{conservation}} of its wildlands in the United States. One threat to natural resources of the BTNP has been impacts associated with feral hog (Sus scrofa) activities. Population numbers of this non-native game species have increased throughout Texas, including areas within the preserve. Recreational hunting permitted by the BTNP has served as a means of controlling hog numbers, although the reported amounts of hog damage to park resources appear to have increased in recent years. Population reduction of feral hogs and mitigation of their impacts require research that documents and validates feral hog impacts on park resources. Here, I evaluated (1) population trends of feral hogs for the past 20 years via data from hunter-card surveys and track-counts, and (2) feral hog impacts on native vegetation for 3 management units of the BTNP. Results from my analysis suggest a nearly 3 -fold increase in hog numbers throughout the preserve since 1981. The overall damage to vegetation from <b>hog</b> rooting or <b>wallowing</b> averaged to 28 % among the 3 units of the BTNP. Landscape features such as topography, soil moisture, soil type, and dominant vegetative cover types were used to predict hog damage. Floodplains had the most damage in the Big Sandy unit (45 %), while flatlands were mostly impacted in the Turkey Creek unit (46 %), and uplands in the Lance Rosier unit (32 %). Vegetative cover was an important variable in explaining variation in hog damage throughout the 3 units of the preserve. Impacts were more widespread across different vegetative strata than previously believed. Study results also support the premise that hog damage in the BTNP parallels the increase in hog abundance over the past 20 years. A more aggressive program for population reduction of feral hogs and mitigation of their impacts is recommended for the BTNP to continue to meet its legal mandates for conservation...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, soil bacterial diversity at environmentally distinct locations on Signy Island was examined using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) profiling, {{and a range}} of chemical variables in soils was determined in order to describe variations between them. The dominant bacterial communities of all locations were found to be significantly different, although higher levels of similarity were observed between locations with similar physico-chemical characteristics, such as at penguin rookeries, seal <b>wallows</b> and vegetated <b>soils.</b> Extending this study, here soil prokaryote biodiversity was compared between 15 distinct locations in order to elucidate any interaction between four general habitat types on Signy Island (South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic) and any influence of previous human impacts at these sites. Specific sites were selected to represent the range of different soil environments present and to cover a range of environmental factors present in the maritime Antarctic which are known to influence bacterial community composition in soils elsewhere. A diverse prokaryote community is described, again with the majority of excised and sequenced bands belonging to the Bacteroidetes. Although DGGE profiling identified significant differences in prokaryotic biodiversity between all sampling sites, aggregations of banding patterns were also apparent across the different soil environments examined. Correlations between specific DGGE profiles and 10 selected soil parameters suggested that much of this variation could be explained by differences in the levels of environmental disturbance and soil pH. In particular, a greater proportion of variation in soil bacterial diversity was explained by differences in soil properties at human-disturbed locations than at undisturbed locations, with higher explanatory values by edaphic factors in the former and soil metal content in the later. In general, our data indicate that small-scale variation {{is an important factor in}} understanding patterns of prokaryotic distributions in soil habitats in the maritime Antarctic environment.
