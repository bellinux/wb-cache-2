We propose a variant of geodesic image <b>filter-ing</b> which preserves the locally strongest edges, leading to preser-vation of both strong edges and weak edges depending on the sur-rounding context. Our contribution is to introduce cumulative range geodesic <b>filter-ing,</b> where the distance in the image plane is lengthened propor-tional to the color distance.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} aquatic animals {{was found to}} emit the potent {{greenhouse}} gas nitrous oxide when nitrate was present in the environment. The emission was ascribed to denitrification by ingested bacteria in the anoxic animal gut, and the exceptionally high N 2 O-to-N 2 production ratio suggested delayed induction of the last step of denitrification. <b>Filter-</b> and deposit-feeding animal species showed {{the highest rates of}} nitrous oxide emission and predators the lowest, probably reflecting the different amounts of denitrifying bacteria in the diet. We estimate that nitrous oxide emission by aquatic animals is quantitatively important in nitrate-rich aquatic environments like freshwater, coastal marine, and deep-sea ecosystems. The contribution of this source to overall nitrous oxide emission from aquatic environments might further increase because of the projected increase of nitrate availability in tropical regions and the numeric dominance of <b>filter-</b> and deposit-feeders in eutrophic ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a {{statistical}} learning tool developed {{to a more}} complex concept of structural risk minimization (SRM). In this paper, SVM is applied to signal detection in communication systems {{in the presence of}} channel noise in various environments in the form of Rayleigh fading, additive white Gaussian background noise (AWGN), and interference noise generalized as additive color Gaussian noise (ACGN). The structure and performance of SVM in terms of the bit error rate (BER) metric is derived and simulated for these advanced stochastic noise models and the computational complexity of the implementation, in terms of average computational time per bit, is also presented. The performance of SVM is then compared to conventional binary signaling optimal model-based detector driven by binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. We show that the SVM performance is superior to that of conventional matched <b>filter-,</b> innovation <b>filter-,</b> and Wiener filter-driven detectors, even in the presence of random Doppler carrier deviation, especially for low SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) ranges. For large SNR, the performance of the SVM was {{similar to that of the}} classical detectors. However, the convergence between SVM and maximum likelihood detection occurred at a higher SNR as the noise environment became more hostile.

The {{tree and}} path constraints, for digraph {{partitioning}} by vertex-disjoint trees and paths respectively, are unified {{within a single}} global constraint, including a uniform treatment {{of a variety of}} useful side constraints, namely precedence, incomparability, and degree constraints. The key point of the <b>filter-ing</b> is to take partially into account the strong interactions between the tree par-titioning problem and all the side constraints, in order to avoid thrashing during search. Finally, our approach is evaluated on three applications: the Hamiltonian path problem, the ordered disjoint path problem, and the phylogenetic supertree problem. ...|$|R
