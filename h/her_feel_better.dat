It made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> stronger and <b>better</b> capable of affronting the difficulties of life. And Lucy, living much in the future, was pleased to see how beloved George was of all his friends. Everyone seemed willing to help him, and this seemed of good omen for the career which she had mapped out for him.|$|R
