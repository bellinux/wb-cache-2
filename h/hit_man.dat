Hunter {{lived in}} the US {{for a year and}} returned following Smith’s assassination in 2011, taking Smith’s former position.

Hunter carried out or oversaw multiple murders for Le Roux, which the organization referred to as “bonus jobs”. He apparently recruited <b>hit</b> <b>men</b> through contacts from his days as a defense contractor. Many of the <b>hit</b> <b>men</b> Hunter recruited for Le Roux were, like him, former soldiers who had had trouble settling into civilian life.|$|R
25|$|However, Khánh {{received}} little assistance from Minh, who resented his deposal by a younger officer whom he {{viewed as an}} unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the detention of his colleagues and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter were set free when Minh demanded that Khánh release them {{as a condition for}} his cooperation. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged plot as long as he could, and then claimed that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and implement neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a <b>hit</b> <b>man</b> US$1,300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. U.S. intelligence officials in Vietnam found the story spurious.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political <b>hit</b> <b>man</b> than as a prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of Riot, {{additional}} lineup changes took place. In early 1972, Jerry Martini inquired to Sly and his managers about monies due to him; saxophonist Pat Rizzo {{was hired as a}} potential replacement for Martini if he ever became suspicious of the band's business practices again. Both Rizzo and Martini remained in the band. Later that year, the tension between Sly Stone and Larry Graham reached its peak. A post-concert brawl broke out between Graham's entourage and Sly's entourage; Bubba Banks and Eddie Chin, having heard that Larry had hired a <b>hit</b> <b>man</b> to kill Sly, assaulted Graham's associates. Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety. Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit the Family Stone and went on to start Graham Central Station, a successful band in the same vein as Sly and the Family Stone. Graham was replaced in the interim by Bobby Womack, and then by nineteen-year-old Rusty Allen.|$|E

The <b>hit</b> <b>men</b> are picked up by police in Buddy’s powder blue Cadillac, though Tank gets off after having Eldorado Red take care of a drug dealer named Reno who was the only witness that could tie Tank to the killings.|$|R

25|$|In 1989, Manchester-based Nigel Martin-Smith {{sought to}} create a British male vocal singing group {{modelled}} on New Kids on the Block. Martin-Smith's vision, however, was a teen-orientated group that would appeal {{to more than one}} demographic segment of the music industry. Martin-Smith was introduced to young singer-songwriter Gary Barlow, who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow's catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow's musical abilities. A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition, but he was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. Prior to auditioning, Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme The <b>Hit</b> <b>Man</b> and Her. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16-year-old Robbie Williams to round out the group, which initially went by the name Kick It.|$|E
