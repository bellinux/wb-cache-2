However, political scientists {{mentioned that}} PR would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time getting support from rural areas, referring to the DAP's dismal performance in rural polling centres. Nevertheless, encouraged by the strong support from the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by-election, DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese-majority parliamentary seats (namely the Sarikei, Miri, Stampin and Lanang seats) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak.|$|E

When asked whether {{there would be a}} movie {{adaptation}} of Eldest at the premiere of Eragon, Christopher Paolini replied, [...] "I think we'll know after opening weekend."

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} many {{different}} factors adding to complexity of the campaign, ActionTrip noting that [...] "Medieval adds a new strategic balance to the game, which teaches that great empires come with an even greater responsibility". Eurogamer praised the way the player had to manage production queues, guard the loyalty of important generals and make use of spies and assassins, calling the level of control [...] "far ahead of anything seen in the previous game"; many other reviews shared a similar view. The number of factions in the game, each with their own historically accurate units and territories, was commended, with IGN and Game Informer stating it [...] "gives the game huge replay value", with GameSpot adding [...] "the strategic portion now {{has a lot more}} options". Many reviewers gave praise to the fact the historical setting of the Middle Ages was said to be well integrated into the game; PC Zone acknowledging the [...] "brutality and instability" [...] of the era is well included in the game, with GameSpot praising the religion in the game, [...] "religion played an enormous role in shaping history, and so it is in the game". GameSpy stated that the different historical starting positions made the games attention to detail [...] "impressive and noteworthy"; the historical battle system was also highly received from Computer Gaming World, stating that they successfully [...] "provide an authentic glimpse of the past". However, GameSpot commented on a problem with a lack of information, [...] "you'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time keeping track of all the goings-on in your provinces", suggesting this could be solved through a more informative interface. Overall, reviewers highly complimented the strategic gameplay, many saying it was similar to a Civilization-style game.|$|E

Channel Five's Gadget Show cooked one of these flash drives with propane, froze it with dry ice, submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar.

I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope.

2500|$|Moose lack {{upper front}} teeth, but have eight sharp incisors {{on the lower}} jaw. They also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> tongue, lips and gums, which aid in the eating of woody vegetation. Moose have six pairs of large, flat molars and, ahead of those, six pairs of premolars, to grind up their food. A moose's upper lip is very sensitive, to help {{distinguish}} between fresh shoots and harder twigs, and the lip is prehensile, for grasping their food. In the summer, moose may use this prehensile lip for grabbing branches and pulling, stripping the entire branch of leaves in a single mouthful, or for pulling forbs, like dandelions, or aquatic plants up by the base, roots and all. A moose's diet often depends on its location, {{but they seem to}} prefer the new growths from deciduous trees with a high sugar content, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach branches up to [...] or higher above the ground.|$|E

2500|$|The Devil in Miss Jones {{was one of}} {{the first}} films to be {{inducted}} into the XRCO Hall of Fame. The sound-recording, cinematography, and story-line of The Devil in Miss Jones were of a considerably higher quality than any previous porn film. The lead, Georgina Spelvin, who had been in the original Broadway run of The Pajama Game, combined vigorous sex with an acting performance some thought as convincing as anything to be seen in a good mainstream production. She had been hired as a caterer, but Gerard Damiano, the film director, was impressed with her reading of Miss Jones's dialogue, while auditioning an actor for the non-sex role of 'Abaca'. According to Variety's [...] review, [...] "With The Devil in Miss Jones, the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time ignoring in the future". The review also described the plot as comparable to Jean-Paul Sartre's play No Exit, and went on to describe the opening scene as, [...] "a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature." [...] It finished by stating, [...] "Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare." ...|$|E
