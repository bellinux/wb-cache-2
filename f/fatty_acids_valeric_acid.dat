High levels of circulating estradiol are found after an intravenous injection of estradiol valerate, and this indicates very rapid cleavage of the drug upon entering circulation.

40|$|Intravenous {{infusions of}} glucose into lambs in utero (130 - 150 days) and after birth, {{confirmed}} the marked post-natal {{increase in the}} magnitude of the response of plasma insulin to glucose. These studies also suggest that insulin secretion in foetal lambs is stimulated by glucose at lower plasma concentrations than in lambs after birth. The short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> given as the sodium salt, caused a very rapid increase in the plasma insulin level of foetal lambs, when given either by intravenous injection or infusion. When birth was induced after only 135 days of gestation by i. v. infusion of a synthetic adrenocorticotrophin preparation (Synacthen) into foetal lambs there was also a prematurely induced maturation of the insulin secretory response to glucose. In these prematurely born lambs the insulin secretory response to i. v. glucose infusion was similar to that ofnormal lambs after birth and differed greatly from that of normal foetuses of similar age. The results indicate that maturation of the insulin secretory mechanism in the lamb is associated with parturition and suggest that these changes may be consequences of the increasing corticosteroid secretion in the foetus during the last few days of gestation...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to oral administration, the bioavailability of estradiol valerate {{has been found}} to be complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection. Due to the far greater bioavailability of intramuscular estradiol valerate relative to oral, the former is substantially stronger (in terms of potency) than the latter. As an example, a single 4 mg intramuscular injection is said to be approximately equivalent to 2 mg/day of the drug administered orally over the course of 3 weeks. Estradiol valerate, when given intramuscularly in oil, has a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular depot from which the drug is slowly released and absorbed. Upon intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary microcrystalline depot is formed within the muscle at the site of injection. In addition, a secondary depot may also be formed in adipose tissue. The slow release of estradiol valerate is caused by the increased lipophilicity of the drug, which in turn is due to its long <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> ester moiety. The terminal half-life of intramuscularly administered estradiol valerate in oil is reported to be 4 to 5 days.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{suggests}} that dietary composition influences gastrointestinal function and bacteria-derived metabolic {{products in the}} dog colon. We previously reported that dietary composition impacts upon the faecal microbiota of healthy dogs. This study aims at evaluating the dietary influences on bacteria-derived metabolic products associated with the changes in faecal microbiota that we had previously reported. We fed high-carbohydrate starch based (HCS), [crude protein: 194 g/kg, starch: 438 g/kg], high-protein greaves-meal (HPGM), [crude protein: 609 g/kg, starch: 54 g/kg] and dry commercial (DC), [crude protein: 264 g/kg, starch: 277 g/kg] diets, and studied their effects on the metabolism of the colonic microbiota and faecal calprotectin concentrations in five Beagle dogs, allocated according to the Graeco-Latin square design. Each dietary period lasted for three weeks and was crossed-over with washout periods. Food intake, body weight, and faecal consistency scores, dry matter, pH, ammonia, volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (VFAs), and faecal canine calprotectin concentrations were determined. RESULTS: Faecal ammonia concentrations decreased with the HCS diet. All dogs fed the HPGM diet developed diarrhoea, which led to differences in faecal consistency scores between the diets. Faecal pH was higher with the HPGM diet. Moreover, decreases in propionic and acetic acids coupled with increases in branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> caused changes in faecal total VFAs in dogs on the HPGM diet. Faecal canine calprotectin concentration was higher with the HPGM diet and correlated positively with <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration.

Every diet was crossed-over and fed to each dog for three 21 -day periods. The microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was profiled according to its percentageoftheguanine-cytosinecontent(%G+C) inordertodetectthefluctuations in intestinal microbiota. Thereafter, 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16 S rRNA) gene amplicons {{were obtained from the}} most abundant %G+C peaks and analysed by sequence analysis. The DC diet sample was associated with high abundances of representatives of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, Coriobacteriales and Bacteroidales. Sequence diversity was highest for the DC diet samples and included representatives of the orders Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales, which were not detected in samples obtained for the HPGM and HCS diets. The HPGM and HCS diets also had reduced numbers of representatives of the family Lachnospiraceae; specifically Clostridium cluster XIVa. The HCS diet favoured the proliferation of representatives of the order Erysipelotrichales, specifically the Clostridium cluster XVIII, whereas the HPGM diet favoured representatives of the order Fusobacteriales. Bacterial metabolism and intestinal inflammatory status were assessed by determining dry matter, pH, ammonia, short-chained <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (SCFAs), and faecal canine calprotectin concentrations. Faecal ammonia concentrations decreased with the HCS diet. All dogs fed the HPGM diet developed diarrhoea, which led to differences in faecal consistency scores and increased faecal pH. Moreover, decreases in propionic and acetic acids coupled with increases in branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> caused changes in faecal total SCFAs. Faecal canine calprotectin concentration was also higher for the HPGM diet than with the other diets and correlated positively with <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations. 8 Dietary effects on digestive enzyme composition in the serum, in jejunal fluid, and in the faeces were studied by determining the following factors: amylase activity, the concentrations of canine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (cTLI), canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI), and canine pancreatic elastase (cE 1) concentrations with the two radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for determining cTLI and cPLI concentrationswere specifically validated for jejunalfluid and faecal specimen analysis. Both RIAs were linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Dog specific serum enzyme concentrations did not differ between diets. Feeding the HCS diet was associated with decreased amylase activities and cPLI concentrations in the lower jejunum, when compared to the corresponding cPLI activities of the HPGM and the DC diet. The HPGM diet decreased the concentrations of cPLI and cE 1 in faecal samples, but not in the jejunal fluid. In conclusion, all bacterial clusters discovered in this research represent the normal GIT microbiota of canines. The HPGM diet favoured Fusobacterium and this Gram-negative bacterial genus may be associated with the observed elevated inflammation status. The latter was deduced from the observed diarrhoea and elevated levels of canine faecal calprotectin in all dogs fed the HPGM diet. It seems likely that these research results could be associated with the quality and increased or decreased amounts of dietary protein or carbohydrate being available for fermentation by the intestinal microbiota. The limited capacity of pancreatic enzymes to adapt adequately by a change inprofile inresponse to changes indietary components seems to be an essential factor, which influences the nutrient levels available for the intestinal microbiota.

The experimental permeability coefficients are compared with the predictions of a bulk solubility diffusion model in which the bilayer membrane is represented as a slab of bulk hexadecane. Deviations of the observed permeability coefficients (Pm) from the values predicted from solubility diffusion theory (Po) lead to the determination of a correction factor, the permeability decrement f (=Pm/Po), {{to account for the}} effects of chain ordering. The natural logarithm of f has been found to correlate linearly with the inverse of the bilayer free surface area with slopes of 25 ± 2, 36 ± 3, 45 ± 8, 32 ± 12, 33 ± 4, 49 ± 12, and 75 ± 6 Å 2 for formic acid, acetic acid, propionic <b>acid,</b> butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> isovaleric acid, and trimethylacetic acid, respectively. The slope, which measures the sensitivity of the permeability coefficient of a given permeant to bilayer chain packing, exhibits an excellent linear correlation (r= 0. 94) with the minimum cross-sectional area of the permeant and a poor correlation (r= 0. 59) with molecular volume, suggesting that in the bilayer interior the permeants prefer to move with their long principal axis along the bilayer normal.

Isoacids are the branched ketoacids resulting from the natural rumen degradation of their corresponding amino acids. IsoPlus™ is the calcium salt of four volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (isobutyric, isovaleric, <b>valeric,</b> and 2 -methylbutyric). <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid</b> is a straight chain 5 -carbon <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The other three are isoacids (branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids).</b> Isobutyric, isovaleric and 2 -methylbutyric are produced in the rumen mainly by oxidative deamination and decarboxylation of the amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine respectivelyl, 2, 3 (Figure 1). <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid</b> is produced mainly from carbohydrate or from amino acids such as proline...|$|R
40|$|An ion {{chromatography}} procedure, employing an IonPac AC 15 concentrator column {{was used to}} investigate on line preconcentration for the simultaneous determination of inorganic anions and organic acids in river water. Twelve organic acids and nine inorganic anions were separated without any interference from other compounds and carry-over problems between samples. The injection loop {{was replaced by a}} Dionex AC 15 concentrator column. The proposed procedure employed an auto-sampler that injected 1. 5 ml of sample into a KOH mobile phase, generated by an Eluent Generator, at 1. 5 mL min- 1, which carried the sample to the chromatographic columns (one guard column, model AG- 15, and one analytical column, model AS 15, with 250 x 4 mm i. d.). The gradient elution concentrations consisted of a 10. 0 mmol l- 1 KOH solution from 0 to 6. 5 min, gradually increased to 45. 0 mmol l- 1 KOH at 21 min., and immediatelly returned and maintained at the initial concentrations until 24 min. of total run. The compounds were eluted and transported to an electro-conductivity detection cell that was attached to an electrochemical detector. The advantage of using concentrator column was the capability of performing routine simultaneous determinations for ions from 0. 01 to 1. 0 mg l- 1 organic acids (acetate, propionic acid, formic acid, butyric acid, glycolic acid, pyruvate, tartaric acid, phthalic <b>acid,</b> methanesulfonic <b>acid,</b> <b>valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> maleic acid, oxalic acid, chlorate and citric acid) and 0. 01 to 5. 0 mg l- 1 inorganic anions (fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, bromide, sulfate and phosphate), without extensive sample pretreatment and with an analysis time of only 24 minutes...|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive {{control of}} odors, {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S), ammonia (NH 3), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with swine production {{is a critical}} need. A pilot-scale experiment was conducted to evaluate surface-applied soybean peroxidase (SBP) and calcium peroxide (CaO 2) as a manure additive to mitigate emissions of odorous volatile organic compounds (VOC) including dimethyl disulfide/methanethiol (DMDS/MT), dimethyl trisulfide, n-butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> isovaleric acid, p-cresol, indole, and skatole. The secondary impact on emissions of NH 3, H 2 S, and GHG was also measured. The SBP was tested at four treatments (2. 28 – 45. 7 kg/m 2 manure) with CaO 2 (4. 2 % by weight of SBP) over 137 days. Significant reductions in VOC emissions were observed: DMDS/MT (36. 2 %– 84. 7 %), p-cresol (53. 1 %– 89. 5 %), and skatole (63. 2 %– 92. 5 %). There was a corresponding significant reduction in NH 3 (14. 6 %– 67. 6 %), and significant increases in the greenhouse gases CH 4 (32. 7 %– 232 %) and CO 2 (20. 8 %– 124 %). The remaining emissions (including N 2 O) were not statistically different. At a cost relative to 0. 8 % of a marketed hog it appears that SBP/CaO 2 treatment could be a promising option at the lowest (2. 28 kg/m 2) treatment rate for reducing odorous gas and NH 3 emissions at swine operations, and field-scale testing is warranted...|$|R

Bacteriol. 85 : 53 – 61. 1963. —Bacteroides succinogenes {{was found}} to require both a branched-chain volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (e. g., isobutyric) and a straight-chain <b>acid</b> (e. g., <b>valeric)</b> for growth. The organism used the acids as precursors for the synthesis of long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>fatty</b> aldehydes, which in turn were employed in the synthesis of phospholipid, mainly ethanolamine plasmalogen. Isobutyric acid was incorporated primarily into branched-chain C 14 and C 16 acids (tentatively identified as 12 -methyl tridecanoic and 14 -methyl pentadecanoic acids, respectively), and into <b>fatty</b> aldehydes. <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid</b> was used mainly for the synthesis of n-C 13 and n-C 15 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>fatty</b> aldehydes.

V. wallichii {{is reported}} to contain valpotriates, <b>valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> valerenic acid, valechlorine, valerianine, resins and alkaloids. <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> found in V. wallichii appears similar in structure to the neurotransmitter GABA. <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid</b> also acts as an NMDA-receptor antagonist. The aim of present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of V. wallichii containing <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> and its possible mechanism of action in amelioration of intracerebroventricular streptozotocin induced neurodegeneration in Wistar rats. The rhizomes of V. wallichii were powdered coarsely and extracted by percolation method using dichloromethane. Wistar rats (220 – 250 g) of either sex were divided into 5 groups, comprising 6 animals each. <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid</b> was isolated from plant extract and characterized using FT-IR. Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) was used as GABA-A antagonist. Intracerebroventricular streptozotocin administration caused significant (p< 0. 05) increase in escape latency, retention transfer latency on morris water maze on 17 th, 18 th, 19 th and 20 th day and elevated plus maze on 19 th and 20 th day respectively, as compared to normal untreated rats. Treatment with V. wallichii extract 100 and 200 mg/kg and <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> 20 and 40 mg/kg significantly decreased the escape latency and retention transfer latency, as compared to intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin group. Plant extract and <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> also decreased the level of lipid peroxidation and restored glutathione level in rat brains. Administration of picrotoxin significantly reversed the effects produced by plant extract and <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin treated rats. The findings may conclude that <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> present in V. wallichii has significant GABAergic effect in amelioration of experimental dementia...|$|R
40|$|Methyl pentanoate, {{commonly}} known as methyl valerate, is the methyl ester of pentanoic <b>acid</b> (<b>valeric</b> <b>acid)</b> with a fruity odour. Methyl pentanoate is commonly used in fragrances, beauty care, soap, laundry detergents at levels of 0. 1 – 1 %. In its very pure form (purity 99. 5 %) it {{is used as a}} plasticizer in the manufacture of plastics. In the present investigation, kinetics of esterification of pentanoic acid with methanol catalyzed by heterogeneous catalyst in a batch-type reactor is reported. The effect of reaction conditions such as temperature, molar ratio, catalyst loading, and initial concentration of pentanoic acid and methanol, and the inhibiting effect of water on the kinetics has been studied. The pentanoic acid conversion reached 93 % at 333. 15 K at a methanol to pentanoic acid molar ratio of 10 : 1 with 7 % (g L– 1) Amberlyst 15 as catalyst. Mass transfer effects were found to be negligible. Observed reaction rate data was fitted to the regression technique.

30|$|Due to {{its high}} growth rate, {{metabolic}} versatility and genetic stability H. mediterranei {{has become an}} interesting microorganism for investigating PHA production. The PHA accumulated by H. mediterranei (PHBV), has much better mechanical properties than PHB, (the most frequently occurring PHA) and hence is more promising for commercial production and application. Furthermore, H. mediterranei can accrue PHBV up to 60 % (wt/wt) from starch, glucose or other cheaper industrial by-products without the addition of costly and cellular toxic carbons, such as propionic <b>acid</b> or <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> that are generally required by producing eubacteria as precursors of the 3 -hydroxyvalerate (HV) unit.

40|$|With {{the final}} aim of ascertaining {{consistent}} {{data about the}} changes of phenolic metabolites in faeces after a regular wine consumption, the present paper compiles the data from two previous human intervention studies: a) a pilot study (n = 8), that compared the ingestion of de-alcoholised red wine (272 mL/day), red wine (272 mL/day), or gin (100 mL/day) during 20 days, and b) a large trial study (n = 41, 33 cases and 8 controls), that assessed variability among individuals after the intake of red wine (250 mL/day, 28 days). Great coincidence was observed in the main phenolic metabolites identified in the faecal samples from both studies that included benzoic acids, phenols, hippuric acids, phenylacetic <b>acids,</b> phenylpropionic <b>acids,</b> <b>valeric</b> <b>acids,</b> valerolactones and cinnamic acids. However, significant differences (P < 0. 05) in the total phenolic content between faecal samples {{before and after the}} wine intervention was only observed for the large trial study (358 ± 270 and 625 ± 380 μg/g faeces, corresponding to the mean values before and after the intervention, respectively), emphasizing the large variability in the phenolic-metabolizing gut-microbial capacity among individuals. The overall results confirm that consumption of wine enhances phenolic metabolism, which might have physiological relevancy at the gut level.
