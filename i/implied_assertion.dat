6000|$|... 183. You have doubtless, in {{the course}} of these lectures, been {{occasionally}} surprised by my speaking of Holbein and Sandro Botticelli, as Reformers, in the same tone of respect, and with the same <b>implied</b> <b>assertion</b> of their intellectual power and agency, with which it is usual to speak of Luther and Savonarola. You have been accustomed, indeed, to hear painting and sculpture spoken of as supporting or enforcing Church doctrine; but never as reforming or chastising it. Whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, you have admitted what in the one case you held to be the abuse of painting in the furtherance of idolatry,--in the other, its amiable and exalting ministry to the feebleness of faith. But neither has recognized,--the Protestant his ally,--or the Catholic his enemy, in the far more earnest work of the great painters of the fifteenth century. The Protestant was, in most cases, too vulgar to understand the aid offered to him by painting; and in all cases too terrified to believe in it. He drove the gift-bringing Greek with imprecations from his sectarian fortress, or received him within it only on the condition that he should speak no word of religion there.|$|E
60|$|It {{is true that}} a {{proposition}} which predicates any attribute, even though it be one implied in the name, is in most cases understood to involve a tacit assertion that there exists a thing corresponding to the name, and possessing the attributes connoted by it; and this <b>implied</b> <b>assertion</b> may convey information, even to those who understood {{the meaning of the}} name. But all information of this sort, conveyed by all the essential propositions of which man can be made the subject, is included in the assertion, Men exist. And this assumption of real existence is, after all, the result of an imperfection of language. It arises from the ambiguity of the copula, which, in addition to its proper office of a mark to show that an assertion is made, is also, as formerly remarked, a concrete word connoting existence. The actual existence of the subject of the proposition is therefore only apparently, not really, implied in the predication, if an essential one: we may say, A ghost is a disembodied spirit, without believing in ghosts. But an accidental, or non-essential, affirmation, does imply the real existence of the subject, because {{in the case of a}} non-existent subject there is nothing for the proposition to assert. Such {{a proposition}} as, The ghost of a murdered person haunts the couch of the murderer, can only have a meaning if understood as implying a belief in ghosts; for since the signification of the word ghost implies nothing of the kind, the speaker either means nothing, or means to assert a thing which he wishes to be believed to have really taken place.|$|E

The leaders of that Army had also been viewed throughout the history of the German-speaking peoples {{as an integral part of}} the leadership cadre.

40|$|This Article {{describes}} {{how and why}} the use of intent in trademark infringement cases has become unintelligible. It does so by first identifying the supposed relevance of intent to trademark infringement. Leading cases state that a defendant’s intent matters because defendants who deliberately try to confuse consumers must believe that consumers are susceptible to confusion. Accordingly, a defendant’s intent to infringe functions like an <b>implied</b> <b>assertion</b> that the defendant’s behavior is likely to cause the desired confusion. This Article then explains how problems have arisen because courts do not use intent in this specific manner. Instead, courts use intent to portray innocent defendants as faulty actors who deserve liability for infringement. Such use of intent may make intuitive sense, but it is inconsistent with the reasons given for intent’s relevance in the first place. This Article {{describes how}} such improper use of intent makes the law unintelligible, and it argues that the law can be improved by paying proper attention to the given reasons for intent’s importance to trademark infringement cases...|$|E

The primary stakeholders for marketing are pharmaceutical companies and large medical centers striving for increased market share. The target populations for marketing of cancer include practitioners as well as consumers. The latter group is especially vulnerable because of fears and anxiety related to their diagnosis. Recommendations for cancer marketing include: (1) ensuring fair and balanced promotion of cancer services, (2) avoiding exaggeration of claims in the context of reputational marketing, (3) providing data and statistics to back up direct and <b>implied</b> <b>assertions</b> whenever possible and (4) defining eligible patient groups in the context of marketing for research...|$|R

40|$|To date, many {{important}} threads of information privacy research have developed, but these threads {{have not been}} woven together into a cohesive fabric. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis: individual, group, organizational, and societal. Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside: the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments {{in the body of}} normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test <b>implied</b> <b>assertions</b> from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies—both positivist and interpretive—could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third...|$|R
