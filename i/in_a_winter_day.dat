40|$|Several {{species of}} small birds are {{resident}} in boreal forests where environmental temperatures can be − 20 to − 30 °C, or even lower, <b>in</b> <b>winter.</b> <b>As</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days</b> are short, and food is scarce, <b>winter</b> survival is <b>a</b> challenge for small endothermic animals. A bird {{of this size}} will have to gain almost 10 % of its lean body mass in fat every day to sustain overnight metabolism. Birds such as parids (titmice and chickadees) can use facultative hypothermia, <b>a</b> process <b>in</b> which body temperature is actively down-regulated to a specific level, to reduce heat loss and thus save energy. During cold winter nights, these birds may decrease body temperature from the normal from 42 ° down to 35 °C, or even lower in some species. However, birds are unable to move in this deep hypothermic state, making it a risky strategy if predators are around. Why, then, do small northern birds enter a potentially dangerous physiological state for a relatively small reduction in energy expenditure? We used stochastic dynamic programming to investigate this. Our model suggests {{that the use of}} nocturnal hypothermia at night is paramount in these biomes, as it would increase <b>winter</b> survival for <b>a</b> small northern bird by 58 % over <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> of 100 <b>days.</b> Our model also explains the phenomenon known as winter fattening, and its relationship to thermoregulation, in northern birds...|$|R

5000|$|Their {{financial}} differences {{produced a}} lasting enmity between Cobbett and Wright, which was embittered by another circumstance. On Cobbett's release from gaol <b>in</b> 1812 <b>a</b> statement appeared <b>in</b> The Times {{that he had}} sought to avoid imprisonment two years before by making his submission to government and offering to suppress the Weekly Register. Wright, who had been privy to Cobbett's overtures, and had endeavoured to dissuade him from them, was unjustly suspected of having betrayed them. The revelation was too damaging to be forgiven. In 1819, while in America, Cobbett published a savage attack on Wright in the Register, alleging that he had detected him falsifying his accounts and describing graphically [...] "the big round drops of sweat that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold <b>winter's</b> <b>day</b> rolled down the caitiff's forehead" [...] when his villainy was discovered. Wright obtained £500. damages against William Innell Clement, the bookseller, for publishing the libel, and when Cobbett returned to England he commenced proceedings against him also, and on 11 December 1820 obtained £1,000 damages (The Times, 12 December 1820).|$|R
60|$|The Teleology which supposes {{that the}} eye, {{such as we}} see it in man or one of the higher Vertebrata, was made with the precise {{structure}} which it exhibits, for the purpose of enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly received its death-blow. Nevertheless it is necessary to remember that there is a wider Teleology, which is not touched by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the fundamental proposition of Evolution. That proposition is, that the whole world, living and not living, in the result of the mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less certain that the existing world lay, potentially, in the cosmic vapour; and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a knowledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour, have predicted, say the state of the Fauna of Britain in 1869, with as much certainty as one can say {{what will happen to the}} vapour of the breath <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold <b>winter's</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) can {{be implemented}} into building practice to enhance thermal storage performance, reduce indoor temperature fluctuations and improve the comfort of occupants. Traditional solid-liquid PCMs suffer from inefficient energy recovery and reduction in overall thermal conductivities and also affect the structural integrity. Solutions to these practical problems such as encapsulation tend to lead to manufacturing complexity. In current study, the thermal storage performance of concrete cement integrated with a hypothetical solid-solid PCM was numerically investigated. The hypothetical thermal storage material was subject to the solar radiation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sunny cold <b>winter</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Toronto.

40|$|Purpose of {{this work}} was to study the effect of UV {{irradiation}} on a microecosystem consisting of several interacting species. The system chosen was of a hypersaline type, where all the species present live at high salt concentration; it comprises different bacteria; a producer, the photosynthetic green alga Dunaliella salina; and a consumer, the ciliated protozoan Fabrea salina, which form a complete food chain. We were able to establish the initial conditions {{that give rise to}} a self-sustaining microecosystem, stable for at least 3 weeks. We then determined the effect of UV irradiation on this microecosystem under laboratory-controlled conditions, in particular by measuring the critical UV exposure for the two main components of the microecosystem (algae and protozoa) under UV-B irradiances comparable to those of solar irradiation. In our experiments, we varied irradiance, total dose and spectral composition of the actinic light. The critical doses at irradiances of the order of 56 kJ/m 2 (typical average daily irradiance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sunny summer day in Pisa), measured for each main component of the microecosystem (algae and ciliates), turned out to be around 70 kJ/m 2 for ciliates and 50 kJ/m 2 for D. salina. By exposing microecosystems to daily UV-B irradiances of the order of 8 kJ/m 2 (typical average daily irradiance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sunny <b>winter</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Pisa), we found no effect at total doses of the order of the critical doses at high irradiances, showing that the reciprocity law does not hold. We have also measured a preliminary spectral-sensitive curve of the UV effects, which shows an exponential decay with wavelength...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{model of a}} passive house located <b>in</b> Denmark with <b>a</b> large solar absorber, a horizontal ground heat exchanger coupled with a HP/ORC unit. The HP/ORC reversible unit is a module able to work as an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) or as a heat pump (HP). There are 3 possible modes {{that need to be}} chosen optimally depending on the weather conditions, the heat demand and the temperature level of the storage. The ORC mode is activated, as long as the heat demand of the house is covered by the storage to produce electricity based upon the heat generated by the solar roof. The direct (free) heating is used when the storage cannot cover the heat demand of the house. Finally, when direct heating is not sufficient to cover the heat demand because of poor weather conditions, the HP mode is activated. Dynamic simulations of the whole system are presented for different typical days {{of the year in the}} Modelica language. A peak of 3. 28 kW of power is reached in ORC mode with a heat input of 59. 5 kW from the solar roof (23. 9 kWh are produced during a typical summer <b>day).</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> representative <b>winter</b> <b>day,</b> 17. 28 kWh are consumed by the heat pump with a daily average COP of 4. 1. Conclusions regarding control strategies and enhancement of the global system are drawn. A control strategy with a low storage temperature set-point (50 ˚C) allows reducing electrical consumption from 11 % up to 24 % when compared to higher set-point (60 ˚C). The system performance to produce power could also be optimized if an extra tank is included to store heat uniquely to produce electricity with the ORC during the peak electricity consumption. Finally, this technology is a promising way to achieve Net Zero Energy Building at low price compared to competitive products (heat pump combined with PV for example). The system {{presents a}} higher global COP because the heat produced on the roof can heat the storage directly. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Globally, excess winter {{morbidity}} from ischemic {{heart disease}} (IHD) is reported. In subtropical regions, {{there is a need}} to quantify the difference in the adverse effect of cold winters compared with hot summers, particularly among the older people. Our objectives were to: (i) compare the effect of winter on IHD hospitalizations with that of summer; (ii) examine temporal trends in the excess winter hospitalizations; and (iii) investigate the effect of age, gender, and meteorological factors on predicting such excess. Inpatient admissions due to IHD as principal cause during June 2000 to February 2009 in public hospitals of Hong Kong were extracted for the population aged ≥ 65. An Excess Hospitalization in Winter vs. Summer (EHWS) Index was used to contrast the adverse effect of weather on hospitalizations in winter vs. summer. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the trend and the predictors of such index. It was found that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subtropical city, greater effect of winter on IHD hospitalizations than summer was observed, particularly among the oldest old (an index of 61. 5 % (95 % CI: 49. 5 %– 74. 4 %) for men aged ≥ 85 and 32. 3 % (95 % CI: 25. 5 %– 39. 5 %) for women aged ≥ 85). There was significant increasing trend in the index among those aged ≥ 85 but the age difference was less prominent among the women. Absolute level of coldness was not a significant factor, whereas the change <b>in</b> temperature was <b>a</b> significant factor, which implies that great fluctuation <b>in</b> temperature within <b>a</b> <b>winter</b> <b>day</b> had greater impact on occurrence of circulatory disease than an absolute temperature threshold. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> first version, {{it starts}} after the troops of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy invaded the Papal States in 1870. Hundreds of Belgian {{students}} went to Italy {{to defend the}} papal sovereignty. One tradition has it that Zouave soldiers rejoined the Catholic University of Louvain (UCL) and started {{the tradition of the}} calotte.In another version, Edmond Carton de Wiart, {{one of the founders of}} the General Society for Brussels's Students (français: Société Générale catholique des étudiants bruxellois), <b>a</b> law student <b>in</b> the town of Leuven, wore the cap to go skating on the frozen lakes <b>in</b> the <b>winter.</b> <b>A</b> few <b>days</b> later, more students started waring the calotte, until it developed into a sort of new trend. In the 19th century, the calotte was worn by Catholic students only (called calottins), while the penne, another cap with a very long peak, was worn by liberal (i.e. non-Catholic) students (the gueux). Rivalry between the two factions led to numerous bloody disputes on both sides, a tradition which still persists, albeit less heatedly, to this day.During the 1980s, the tradition of the calotte was revived after the Catholic University of Louvain was split between French speaking and Dutch speaking Universities, the former moving to a new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve, which in turn brought about a resurgence of ancient student traditions, among them the calotte.|$|R
