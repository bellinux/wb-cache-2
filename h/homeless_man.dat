40|$|This {{research}} {{reveals the}} social and individual processes that dominate the experiences of <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> through an exploration of their struggle to achieve ontological worth. Drawing on eight in-depth interviews with <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> who are experiencing homelessness, this research demonstrates this struggle {{is because of the}} situated nature of identities that <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> continually reconstruct and renegotiate. It proposes that relations to this set of identities are relevant to <b>homeless</b> <b>men,</b> in particular the construction and reconstruction of their identities within homelessness. The central findings of this research reveal that <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> actively manage their identities to cope with the instability inherent to the experience. The implications of this for social work practice are explored, focusing on the importance of self-conception and the restoration of positive identities...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{results from}} {{epidemiological}} cohort studies of {{morbidity and mortality}} among <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women are presented. Comparisons were made with the general population concerning hospital care for somatic diseases, injury and mental disorders, and concerning mortality. The thesis contains also the results from a five-year follow-up study of 82 <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> with mental problems. Results from Paper I shows that the mortality among the 82 <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> was higher than expected (SMR 4. 7). Surprisingly, among men with severe psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, none had died at the follow-up. Among the survivors, 75 % were still homeless, and the mental health problems combined with substance use problems had increased. Paper II, shows that among 1 364 <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and 340 <b>homeless</b> women, the relative risk of being hospitalised for physical diseases was double that {{of men and women in}} the general population. When age was considered, younger homeless women had the highest risk compared to <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> (RR 1. 6). The highest prevalence was found in the diagnosis group injury/poisoning (22 % men, and 20 % women). The highest risk was found for skin diseases (RR 36. 9) and concerned homeless women. Paper III shows that among 1 364 <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and 340 <b>homeless</b> women, the relative risk of having mental disorders, including alcohol and drugs, was 13 - 21 times higher that of the general population. The homeless women ran a higher risk compared with <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> (RR 1. 2), where younger homeless women had the highest risk (RR 2. 2). Alcohol use disorders were equally common among <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women, but women had more drug use disorders (RR 1. 3). Women had a higher risk of schizophrenia (RR 2. 8), and personality disorders (RR 2. 7). When adjustment was made for substance use disorders, no increased risk for mental disorder was found in the homeless group. Paper IV reports a relative risk of 3. 1 for death among 1 758 <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> compared with men in the population, and a relative risk of 2. 5 for 527 homeless women compared to women in the population. No difference in mortality was found between <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women. The mortality among men was principally related to alcohol, and among women to drug abuse. For <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> with long homelessness and mental problems including substance misuse, the life and housing situation had not improved at the 5 -year follow-up, and substance misuse problems and mental problems had increased among them. There was no connection between mortality and mental illness. Among <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women the risk of having diseases that requires hospitalisation was very high, compared with the general population. Younger homeless women were particularly at risk. There were a number of gender specific somatic and psychiatric diagnoses that are important to take into account when planning services for homeless people. The excess risk for mental illness found among the homeless was entirely related to alcohol and drug misuse, as was their excess mortality...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim was {{to study}} the {{prevalence}} of mental disorders among <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women admitted for inpatient treatment in hospitals. Methods: Hospital care utilization of <b>homeless</b> people, 1364 <b>men</b> and 340 women, was compared with a control group consisting of 3750 men and 1250 women from the general population, 1996 – 2002. Results: Homeless women ran a higher risk for mental disorders than women in the population [risk ratio (RR) 20. 88]; their risk was also higher than the risk for <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> (RR 1. 20). Younger homeless women had the highest risk (RR 2. 17). Alcohol use disorders were equally common among <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women, but women had more drug us...|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876. The couple and their four {{children}} were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an agricultural labourer. In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a <b>homeless</b> <b>man</b> named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a <b>homeless</b> <b>man</b> get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic {{priest of}} a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a <b>homeless</b> <b>man</b> named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E

5000|$|For <b>homeless</b> <b>men,</b> {{specifically}} those {{suffering from}} a substance abuse problem or who are in crisis, spirituality often serves as a positive coping mechanism, giving meaning to life and is tied {{to a sense of}} peace. However, positive spiritual coping lessens in its effectiveness the longer someone is homeless and is not as effective for <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> with mental health problems as for those who are alcohol/drug dependent or in crisis. Many <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> attribute their ability to get sober to their spirituality, though this may be a product of the spiritual nature of programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. In a study done by Brush and McGee (2000) surveying <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> in a shelter for recovery, 78% of the respondents commented on how their spiritual views influence their decisions and two thirds agreed or strongly agreed [...] "to seeking spiritual guidance in daily life experiences." ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} health beliefs {{and health care}} utilisation among 20 <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> in Liverpool, through the voices of <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> themselves. Using semi-structured interviews and framework analysis, narratives highlighted the interplay between the limiting structures {{of the health care}} system and an individual's ability to know how to seek out health care in order to improve their own health. Specifically, we found that individual agency was contingent on the availability of a set of minimum resources, to which <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> did not have access. These findings have important implications in terms of practical policy recommendations for improving health care utilisation among the homeless...|$|R
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a <b>homeless</b> <b>man,</b> who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a <b>homeless</b> <b>man,</b> agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses a cane and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a <b>homeless</b> <b>man</b> on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To study {{morbidity}} amongst <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> {{and women}} by comparing prevalence of hospital care for somatic diseases and injuries with {{a control group}} {{of men and women}} from the general population. Methods: A cohort of 1, 364 men and 340 women were documented as homeless in 1996. Comparisons are made concerning hospital care for somatic diseases and injuries (1996 - 2002) among 3, 750 men and 1, 250 women from the general population. Results: The relative risk (RR) for <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women of being hospitalised was double that {{of the men and women}} in the controls (1. 93 and 1. 96 respectively). Homeless women had a slightly, not significant, increased risk compared to <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> (RR 1. 10). Younger homeless women had a significant higher risk. Among diagnostic categories, the highest prevalence was found among <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> in the diagnosis group injury/poisoning (22 %). The highest risk was found for skin diseases (RR 36. 96) and concerned homeless women. There were a number of gender specific diagnoses, where risks were considerably elevated, such as diseases of the genital organs, viral hepatitis, and poisoning for homeless women, and cerebrovascular diseases, diseases of the liver, and concussion for <b>homeless</b> <b>men.</b> Conclusions: <b>Homeless</b> people had twice the risk of being hospitalised for physical diseases compared to the general population. Younger women were particularly at risk compared to <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and to women in the controls. There were a number of gender specific diagnoses that are important to take into account when planning services for homeless people...|$|R

Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella to jump off a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he has been charged with Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he must accept that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about Phil, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day of Phil's release he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up, and suggests that Ben may ultimately bring Phil down.|$|E
