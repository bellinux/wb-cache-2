5|$|As {{early as}} the 1830s and 1840s, merchants, {{including}} Gilbert Mair and Logan Campbell, were buying gum from local Māori for £5 ($8.25) a ton, or trading it for goods. The majority of the gum was exported to America and London (<b>from</b> <b>whence</b> it was distributed throughout Europe), although smaller amounts were sent to Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of World War II for the United States, the War Shipping Administration requisitioned Henry R. Mallory for use as a civilian-manned troopship in July 1942. Remaining under the {{operation}} of her owners, Agwilines, Inc., she began operation on U.S. Army schedules in July 1942, when she sailed from New York to Belfast. After her return to New York in August, she made way to Boston <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> she sailed to Saint John, Wabana, Newfoundland; Sydney, Nova Scotia; and Halifax, before returning to New York in October.|$|E
5|$|Spirituals were {{primarily}} expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations. In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, spirituals spread out of the U.S. South. In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country. In imitation of this group, gospel quartets arose, followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th-century rise of jackleg and singing preachers, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> came the popular style of gospel music.|$|E

60|$|The old {{man turned}} a {{disappointed}} look towards Middleton, who {{was too much}} occupied in solacing Inez to observe his embarrassment, which was, however, suddenly relieved <b>from</b> a quarter, <b>whence,</b> <b>from</b> previous circumstances, there was little reason to expect such a demonstration of fortitude.|$|R
5000|$|The penduline tits {{constitute}} {{a family of}} small passerine birds, related to the true tits. All but the verdin make elaborate bag nests hanging <b>from</b> trees (<b>whence</b> [...] "penduline", hanging), usually over water.|$|R
5|$|The {{coalition}} army {{then proceeded}} to Amyclae, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia. The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at Gythium. As the land forces began to invest the city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct siege engines within a few days. Though these machines had a devastating effect on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{dangerous}} {{days of the}} passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wives– the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms {{by the end of}} the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.|$|E

60|$|Septimius thought, however, {{that the}} doctor's talk began, at least, at a {{sufficient}} remoteness from any practical business; for {{he began to}} question about his remote ancestry, what he knew, or what record had been preserved, of the first emigrant <b>from</b> England; <b>whence,</b> <b>from</b> what shire or part of England, that ancestor had come; whether there were any memorial of any kind remaining of him, any letters or written documents, wills, deeds, or other legal paper; in short, all about him.|$|R
5|$|The acting Commander, 7th Division Australian Army Service Corps (AASC), Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Richardson, assumed {{control of}} {{logistics}} {{on the track}} on 10 September. Supplies were then brought from the Base Supply Depots at Sogeri and Ilolo to Newton's Depot in 3-ton trucks by the 2/5th AASC Company. The 2/4th AASC Company moved them by jeep to the roadhead at Owers' Corner. The flying fox was used {{to take them to}} the floor of the Goldie River Valley, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> the 1st Independent Light Horse Troop carried them to Uberi. From there, they were carried on the backs of Papuan porters, known as carriers. If there were more stores than the animals could carry, they would assist with that too.|$|E
5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then lift her off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> she could not be moved.|$|E
5|$|The city {{started from}} an inland town that {{extended}} to the coast. The Bairro da Matriz, whose nucleus was the centre <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> the city grew, is intersected by 14th century narrow and twisted streets lined by single family homes. The historical district has old buildings such as the sixteenth-century house in front of Matriz Church — the main church, the old Town Hall (14th century), the seventeenth century Solar dos Carneiros and house of Captain Leite Ferreira, and the eighteenth century Limas and the Coentrão Houses. The fishermen were grouped in the south coast, around Póvoa Cove (Enseada da Póvoa); The fisher district was already developed in the 18th century with its structure of narrow streets parallel to the coast.|$|E
25|$|In 1904 the Jewish {{community}} possessed {{three other}} synagogues: Jeshurun, built in 1710 {{according to the}} inscription on a marble slab in the synagogue; Ahabat-Shalom, built in 1880; Shebeṭ Aḥim or Mafṭirim, founded in 1882 by emigrants <b>from</b> Karlovo, <b>whence</b> the Jews fled during the Turko-Russian war (1877-1878).|$|R
50|$|The Vankar is {{a social}} group found largely in western states of India. Some claim to be descended from Rajputs and use the prefix Maru (meaning <b>from</b> Marwar, <b>whence</b> they believe they came) to {{differentiate}} themselves from other Vankar groups. They migrated to places like Bhilad, Gariadhar, Cheetal and Patan.|$|R
60|$|A Liverpool Institution {{of another}} class, known as 'The Hollies,' is an Industrial Home for fallen women, drunkards, thieves, and incorrigible girls. It holds thirty-eight inmates and is always full, {{a good many}} of these being sent to the place <b>from</b> Police-courts <b>whence</b> they are {{discharged}} under the First Offenders Acts.|$|R
5|$|The northwestern and {{northern}} {{portions of the}} Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of}} the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a cenote is formed.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E
5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E

50|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Syme {{identified three}} distinct {{families of the}} Arruntii: the first descended from the admiral Lucius Arruntius, and ended with Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus; another originated at Patavium; the third came <b>from</b> Lycia, <b>whence</b> they were descended from a certain Arruntius who settled in the east {{during the early years}} of the Roman Empire.|$|R
50|$|Rotuman {{oral history}} {{indicates}} that the islands' first inhabitants came <b>from</b> Samoa, <b>whence</b> they were led {{by a man named}} Raho. Shortly thereafter, further settlers arrived from Tonga. Later, additional settlers came from Tonga and Kiribati. In the 1850s and 1860s, Tongan Prince Ma'afu claimed Rotuma and sent subordinates to administer the main island and islets.|$|R
5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil {{off with}} their {{chattels}} {{on a train}} to Toulouse, where his sister Guiliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> he eventually {{made his way to}} the United States. Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Guiliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to Lisbon via Madrid on 19 July 1940. Both women were pregnant. Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner Quanza on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached New York City, where they stayed with his brother Paolo. While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in Leonia, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The main site, {{known as}} H1, was {{established}} on Hermite Island. This was {{the location of}} the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with the equipment to monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E

5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea <b>from</b> <b>whence</b> the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
