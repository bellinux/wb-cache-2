A new method of calculating the test result is described-namely, digital systolic blood pressure in the cooled <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> {{as a percentage of}} the systolic pressure in the arm (DP%).

The influence of test structure gate placement (Schottky metallization between ohmic contacts, on mesa and on GaN surface) was analyzed and discussed. Moreover, various distances between ohmic contacts paths were tested. Except for experimental investigations, simulations using finite elements method in COMSOL were performed {{for the same}} structure. The modelling results revealed crucial impact of a gap beyond the mask on the electric field distribution in photoresist layer. The smallest value of relative error of <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> lengths was observed for finger parts placed between ohmic paths on mesas.

5000|$|Common {{screening}} procedures for acalculia include asking {{the patient to}} answer questions about order, conducting memory tests to rule out the possibility of a mental disorder, confrontation naming (naming parts of objects), reading tests, writing <b>tests,</b> calculation <b>tests,</b> <b>finger</b> naming, clock drawing, and left/right orientation testing. The writing <b>tests,</b> spelling <b>tests,</b> <b>finger</b> naming, and left/right orientation are all tests to confirm the presence of Gerstmann's syndrome. Acalculia is one out of four defining components of Gerstmann's syndrome; the other three components are agraphia, finger agnosia, and right/left confusion. Typically, acalculia is present because of Gerstmann's syndrome or it is linked with other disorders. It is imperative to note that there is [...] "difficulty separating calculation disorders from disruptions in other domains". This is why testing functions besides calculation abilities is crucial for the screening of acalculia- so that other disorders can be ruled out. More extensive testing includes [...] "brain mapping techniques such as position emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and event related potentials (ERP), which have helped to illuminate some of the functional anatomical relationships for number processing".|$|R
40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{measuring}} disorders of vascular function and neurological function associated with occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration have been defined {{by reference to}} the available literature. For measuring vascular function the methods are: i) measures of the finger systolic blood pressure (FSBP) response to local cooling and ii) measures of the finger skin temperature (FST) response to local cooling. For measuring neurological function the methods are: i) measures of vibrotactile thresholds at the fingertips and ii) measures of thermal thresholds at the fingertips. Measures of the FSBP and the FST response to cold provocation were appraised in 109 dockyard workers. The FST test did not differentiate between 82 healthy subjects and 27 subjects with vibration-induced white finger (VWF) whilst the FSBP test {{was found to be}} sensitive, specific and responsive to VWF. Vibrotactile and thermal thresholds were found to be sensitive, specific and responsive to symptoms of numbness in another study of 104 dockyard workers, of whom 67 reported neurological disorders. It was concluded that whilst the above tests could be useful for monitoring the vascular and neurological disorders, a number of improvements to the measurement methods could be worthwhile. Further experiments were carried out to investigate these improvements. The simultaneous measurement of FSBPs on multiple <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> was developed to improve the practicality of this test when measuring FSBPs on more than one <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> Increased central sympathetic activity was hypothesised to result from increasing the stimulus by cooling more fingers. In two experiments on 12 healthy subjects, it was found that FSBPs measured simultaneously on four <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> gave similar results to FSBP measurements on one <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> Simultaneous FSBP measurements on four <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> had comparable repeatability to measurements on one <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> It was concluded that measuring FSBPs on multiple <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> is a useful improvement to this test. When measuring FSBPs, changing the order of presentation and the period of recovery between thermal stimuli was hypothesised to influence the results by altering central sympathetic activity. In 12 healthy subjects {{it was found that the}} order of presentation of thermal stimuli was not important but that inter-subject variability increased when recovery was allowed between thermal stimuli. It was concluded that minimising the time interval between successive applications of thermal provocation reduces undesirable inter-subject variability. Another study on 12 healthy subjects showed that different reference measurement locations give different results. It was concluded that the thumb is suitable location for making reference measurements. The FSBP test and the FST test both involve application of cold provocation. The two tests are sometimes performed in succession but multiple thermal provocations may have cumulative effects on central sympathetic activity. When the two vascular tests were performed in succession on 36 subjects, including 12 subjects with VWF, any effects of the order of test presentation were small although a test performed first tended to be more repeatable. It was concluded that if both tests are performed consecutively, greater emphasis should be placed on the test performed first. The data for the FST test were reanalysed and showed that the sensitivity and specificity to VWF of this test is improved by changing the method of interpreting the results. Three methods of interpreting the FST response to cold provocation that represent an improvement to the test are suggested. The two vascular tests have been shown in the literature to be repeatable for healthy subjects but not for subjects with VWF. The repeatability of the vascular tests was assessed in 36 subjects (12 manual workers, 12 office workers and 12 subjects with VWF). The repeatability of both tests was found to be low amongst workers with VWF; some of these subjects showed a negative test result on one occasion and a positive test result on another occasion. It was concluded that a repeat test may be required when a false negative result is obtained. For the vibrotactile threshold test, the skin-stimulus contact force is usually controlled. Controlling the skin indentation would simplify measurement equipment. An experiment on ten healthy subjects investigated the relationship between skin-stimulus contact force, skin indentation and vibrotactile thresholds. It was concluded that the vibrotactile threshold test could be improved by implementing control of skin-indentation. Skin indentations giving comparable vibrotactile thresholds to those obtained using controlled contact forces were identified. It is concluded that a test battery comprising the four test methods identified from the literature and subsequently developed during the course of this research can be used to monitor disorders of both vascular and neurological function associated with occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration. A number of recommendations are made for further improvements that might be achievable as a result of further work...|$|R

40|$|In humans, the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), {{which is}} a multi-tendoned muscle, {{produces}} forces that flex the four distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. We determined whether the force associated with activity in a single motor unit in the FDP was confined to a single finger or distributed {{to more than one}} finger during a natural grasp. The discharge of single low-threshold motor units (n = 69) was recorded at sites across the muscle during weak voluntary grasping involving all fingers and spike-triggered averaging of the forces under each of the finger pads was used to assess the distribution pattern. Spike-triggered averaging revealed that time-locked changes in force occurred under the ‘test’ finger (that finger on which the unit principally acted) as well as under the ‘non-test’ fingers. However, for the index-, middle- and ring-finger units, the changes in force under non-test fingers were typically small (50 % of those under the <b>test</b> <b>finger).</b> The distribution of forces by little-finger units differed significantly from that for each of the other three fingers. Apart from increases in force under non-test fingers, there was occasional unloading of adjacent fingers (22 / 267 combinations), usually affecting the index finger. The increases in force under the <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> correlated significantly with the background force for units acting on the middle, ring and little fingers. During a functional grasp, the activity of single units in the FDP allows for a relatively selective control of forces at the tips of the index, middle and ring fingers, but this is limited for little-finger units...|$|R
40|$|While {{the human}} hand has an {{extraordinary}} capacity to manipulate objects, movement of its digits {{is usually not}} completely independent. These limits have been documented for extrinsic flexor muscles, although hand skills also require selectivity for extension movements. Hence, we measured the degree of independent control of the major extrinsic extensor (extensor digitorum, ED). Subjects grasped a cylinder, with the thumb perpendicular to the fingers. Load cells were connected to the proximal phalanges of the fingers and the thumb's distal phalanx. Intramuscular recordings using needle electrodes were made from the individual digital compartments of ED. Subjects were instructed to extend each digit isometrically in a voluntary ramp contraction to 50 % maximal force. In total, the behaviour of 283 single motor units was analysed. More {{than half of the}} units associated with one ‘test’ finger were recruited inadvertently when another digit contracted to 50 % maximum, with most units being recruited by extension of the adjacent digits. Usually, test motor units were recruited at higher forces by extension of fingers further from the <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> Unexpectedly, extension of the thumb recruited many motor units acting on the little finger. Across tasks, at recruitment of the test motor units, the force produced by the <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> often differed between the voluntary and inadvertent contractions. Overall, the independent control of the output of ED is limited; this may reflect ‘spill-over’ of motor commands to other digital extensor compartments. This level of control of the extrinsic extensor muscles is more independent than the control of the deep extrinsic flexor muscle but less independent than that of the superficial extrinsic flexor muscle...|$|R

30|$|However, {{the high}} sugar {{content of the}} very high gravity {{fermentation}} medium causes {{an increase in the}} osmotic pressure, which has a pessimistic effect on yeast cells, and the fermentations are rarely fast and complete. The ethanol produced by the yeast also poses negative effects on yeast metabolism like enzyme inhibition and membrane solubility and needs some protectants to counteract these effects {{at the end of the}} fermentation process [3]. S. cerevisiae can ferment an increased amount of sugars in the medium when all required nutrients are provided in adequate amounts [6]. Specific nutrients, such as nitrogen, trace elements, or vitamins, are required to obtain rapid fermentation and high ethanol levels, which are desirable to minimize capital costs and distillation energy. On a laboratory scale, media are often supplemented with peptone, yeast extract, amino acids, and vitamins [6]-[8]. However, such addition is not feasible in industrial fermentation processes due to the associated high costs. Thus, it is necessary to exploit inexpensive nutrient sources to supply all nutritional requirements for yeast growth and fermentation.

40|$|Lateralization {{pattern in}} {{schizophrenia}} {{and effects of}} antipsychotics in this pattern Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the cerebral lateralization patterns in right-handed medication-free patients with schizophrenia. We were also interested in studying the effect of antipsychotic treatment on the lateralization patterns and whether the lateralizaton patterns and the clinical symptoms were related. Method: Nineteen right-handed medication-free patients with schizophrenia were compared with healthy controls on visuospatial and motor tasks with the Corsi’s cube placing <b>test,</b> <b>finger</b> tapping <b>test,</b> and the turning preference test. Diagnosis were confirmed by SCID-I interviews based on the DSM-IV criteria. Patients were either antipsychotic-naive or free of oral medication for at least 3 weeks and 6 months for depot medications. All subjects were right-handed. Tests were repeated after 3 weeks of antipsychotic drug treatment. Laterality indices were calculated in favor of right side for all tests [(right-left) /(right+left) ]. Results: The left-turning tendency was not significantly different between patients and controls. Antipsychotic treatment had no significant effect on the left-turning tendency in the patient group. There were significant differences on laterality indices of the Corci’s cube placing test, before and after antipsychotic treatment. The laterality indices on the turning and finger-tapping tests were correlated. Conclusion: It was found that antipsychotic medication decreased right hemispatial inattention in visuospatial tasks...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the acute effect of playing games on executive function and motor ability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Consecutive cases with PD were studied with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Stroop <b>test,</b> <b>finger</b> tapping and 14 -meter walk test. After randomization, patients performed a game of dominoes and were tested before and after experiment being further categorized as control, winners or non-winners. Forty patients, 27 male (67. 5 %), aged 48 to 84 years (63. 2 ± 8. 5), Hoehn & Yahr I to III were included. Twenty-eight (70 %) presented depressive symptoms (BDI > 10). Groups (Control N = 13; Winners = 14 and Non-winners = 13) were not different regarding age, disease duration, age at onset, BMI, MMSE scores, depressive symptoms, levodopa dose, and previous practice of games. Winners presented significantly better results on executive function (Stroop test, p = 0. 002) and on motor activity (Finger tapping, p = 0. 01). Non-winners showed a trend of better performance in the 14 -meter-walk test. This study shows that the practice of a non-reward game acutely improved memory and motor skills in PD. Our results suggest a role for the reward system in the modulation of the dopaminergic function of the basal ganglia in these patients...|$|R
40|$|These {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} determine whether cutaneous input from a digit provides a general facilitation of the detection of movements applied to an adjacent digit. The ability to detect passive movements at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger was measured when cutaneous (and joint) input was removed (using local anaesthesia) {{from the tip of}} one or both digits adjacent to the <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> (16 subjects). The same parameter was also measured when input was artificially increased by stimulation of the adjacent digits at three intensities: below, above and at perceptual threshold (PT; 15 subjects). Detection of flexion or extension movements was not altered by anaesthesia of one or both adjacent digits. Since it was possible that too few tonically active afferents in the hand had been blocked to reveal an effect, the median nerve was blocked, with movements applied to the little finger, causing no measurable impairment in acuity (three subjects). Simultaneous electrical stimulation of the tips of the adjacent digits at intensities above PT impaired movement detection, but had no effect when delivered at or below PT. To test whether the effect of detectable electrical stimuli was due to a specific interaction between the artificial input and the input evoked by moving the digit, or due to mental distraction, stimuli were delivered above PT to either the left or right little <b>finger,</b> or the <b>test</b> index <b>finger</b> during movement of the index finger. Electrical stimulation of the index finger significantly reduced detection by ∼ 50 %, but stimulation of the remote little fingers did not. Electrical stimulation is a non-natural stimulus, so a ‘natural’ stimulus was applied by continuously stroking the tips of the adjacent digits with a brush (10 subjects). The natural stimulus also significantly reduced movement detection by ∼ 50 %. Together, these findings suggest that tonic inputs from digital nerve afferents adjacent to, or more remote from the passively moved finger do not facilitate movement detection. However, the reduced detection during stimulation of the adjacent digits shows that there is nevertheless some interaction between the various proprioceptive inputs from the digits...|$|R
40|$|EN] The {{present study}} is aimed at {{exploring}} the application of Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT perfusion brain scintigraphy for the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of cerebral vascular disease Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and epilepsy. For a period of seven years (1996 - 2003) the Department of nuclear medicine at St. Marina University Hospital - Varna used Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT to investigate a total of 187 patients of whom 105 male, 82 female, mean age 48. 82 ± 11. 65 years. Their distribution according to the clinical diagnosis was as follows: 42 patients with hypertension, 83 patients with brain infarction, 32 with Alzheimer’s disease, 10 with vascular dementia and 20 with epilepsy. Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT was performed on a gama-camera DIACAM after injecting 20 mCi Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT at rest or under stress. The stress studies included stimulation with physical exercise, stimulation with acetazolamide (Diamox), a combination of stimulation with physical exercise and acetazolamide, neuroactivation <b>tests,</b> <b>finger</b> - thumb opposition test, labyrinth test. The 64 scintigraphic images were processed {{by means of a}} standard SPECT programme and visual assessment of the distribution and radionuclide uptake on the transversals, the sagittal and coronal slides. In the different groups of patients we introduced various semi-quantitative indicators. Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT performed under conditions of physical exercise is a reliable method for assessment of the autoregulatory mechanisms of the brain vessels in patients with uncomplicated hypertension and detects the structural and functional haemodynamic changes in the resistant brain vessels. The correlation between the regional blood flow and the changes in the thrombocyte aggregation in patients with hypertension of Ilnd degree (r= + 47, p< 0. 05) showed a possible connection between the changes in the perfusion indices from the SPECT and the hemorheological changes under conditions of physical exercise. The established positive correlation in the perfusion indices differences obtained by the method of physical exercise and after drug vasodilatation with acetazolamide suggests that the two methods reflect the state and disorders of the autoregulatory capacity of the brain vessels in a similar way. After the introduction of the acetazolamide, Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT allows for the assessment of the vasodilatory capacity of the cerebellar hemispheres in patients with cross cerebellar diaschisis. Seven and two hours after the beginning of the acute cerebrovascular episodes hypo- and aperfusional changes in the scintigraphic imaging with focal and diffuse character correlated to a large extent with the moderate focal diffusion disorders of the electrical brain activity (r = 0. 86) and differed significantly from those in the control group. The presence of a neurovascular connection in the affected hemisphere can be suggestive of a good prognosis after ischaemic stroke. Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT and the neuroactivation <b>test</b> (<b>finger</b> - thumb opposition test) can be a useful tool for the prognosis of the motor function recovery in these patients. The combination of Tc- 99 m-HMPAO SPECT and neuroactivation resulted in increased method sensitivity by 6. 4...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{examine the}} {{comparative}} {{reliability and validity}} of three simple ways of rating upper limb tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis.  METHODS—Three examiners independently rated severity of upper limb tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis on a 0 - 10 scale by studying videotape recordings of patients' examinations, spiral drawings, and handwriting samples. The correlations of the tremor severity scores with scores from arm dexterity tests and a tremor related disability scale were also assessed.  RESULTS—Rating tremor on posture had a good intrarater and interrater reliability. However, these reliabilities decreased when kinetic tremor was assessed, in part because dysmetria was a confounding factor. The intrarater reliabilities of rating tremor from spirals and handwriting were also good but the interrater reliabilities were only fair to moderate. Tremor severity scored by all three methods correlated highly with scores obtained from the nine hole peg <b>test,</b> <b>finger</b> tapping <b>test,</b> and a tremor related activities of daily living (ADL) questionnaire, indicating that all three methods were valid ways of assessing tremor in multiple sclerosis.  CONCLUSION—Multiple sclerosis tremors in posture can be scored using a clinical rating scale in a valid and reliable way, and from spirals and handwriting samples if the ratings are carried out by the same examiner. However, scoring kinetic tremor was less reliable. In addition, the nine hole peg and <b>finger</b> tapping <b>tests</b> provide useful objective assessments of upper limb function in tremulous patients with multiple sclerosis. ...|$|R
