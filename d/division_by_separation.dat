40|$|Multicellular magnetotactic {{bacteria}} (MMB) are unique microorganisms typically comprised of 10 – 40 bacterial cells arranged around a central acellular compartment. Their life cycle has no known unicellular stage and <b>division</b> occurs <b>by</b> <b>separation</b> {{of a single}} MMB aggregate into two identical offspring. In this study, South-seeking multicellular {{magnetotactic bacteria}} (ssMMB) were enriched from a New England salt marsh. When exposed to light, ssMMB reversed their magnetotactic behaviour to become North-seeking. The exposure time needed to generate the reversal response varied with light wavelength and intensity. Extensive exposure to light appeared to be lethal. This is the first report of a Northern hemisphere MMB displaying South-seeking behaviour {{and the first time}} a MMB is found to exhibit photo-magnetotaxis. We suggest that this mechanism enables ssMMB to optimize their location with regard to chemical gradients and light intensities, and propose a model to explain the peculiar balance between photo- and magnetotaxis...|$|R
40|$|Synchronized, slowly growing (TD = 70 to 80 min) {{cultures}} {{were used}} to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. The rate of peptidoglycan synthesis per cell declined {{during most of the}} period of chromosome replication (C), but increased during the latter part of C and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (D). An increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. Cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of C, reached a maximum late in C or early in D, and declined during D. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during C prevented the decline in autolytic capacity {{at the end of the}} cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell <b>division</b> <b>by</b> inhibiting cell <b>separation.</b> Inhibition of DNA synthesis during D did not prevent the increase in autolytic capacity during the next C phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. Thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. The data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed model for cell division of S. faecium (G. D. Shockman et al., Ann. N. Y Acad. Sci. 235 : 161 - 197, 1974) ...|$|R
