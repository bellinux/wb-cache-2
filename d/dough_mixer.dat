The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Total annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007, and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies. A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility or the American Dream. Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square. Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large <b>dough</b> <b>mixer,</b> were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots. Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as [...] "the poster child for managing industrial transition". Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the parallel computation of incompressible viscoelastic rotating flows. Such flows arise in many industrial settings being particularly important in the food industries, for materials such as dough. Here, the material is driven by one or two stirrers, rotating about the centre of a cylindrical vessel, fixed to a lid. The stirrers may be positioned in eccentric arrangement with respect to the axis of the vessel. The motivation for this workis to advance fundamental technology modelling the kneading of dough with the ultimate aim to predict the optimal design of <b>dough</b> <b>mixers</b> themselves, hence, leading to efficient dough processing. The numerical method employed is a time-marching semi-implicit Parallel-Taylor-Galerkin scheme, posed in a cylindrical polar coordinate system. This scheme is second-order in time and based on a fractional-staged pressure-correction formulation. Parallel computations are performed, via domain decomposition, on homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed networks using the Parallel Virtual Machine message passing protocol. Parallel timings are compared against those for sequential computation. Ideal linear speed-up is observed with increasing numbers of processors. This is achieved through a sophisticated implementation that effectively masks communication within pure computation costs. 1 A. Baloch, P. W. Grant and M. F. Webster...|$|R

Therefore, the quality of wheat grown in Kansas is a primary concern of the milling and baking industry. Quality of wheat flour is measured through analysis of protein, dough rheology, and baked product characteristics. This study characterized four commonly-grown Kansas hard red winter wheat cultivars chosen to span the largest possible range of protein contents and baking qualities. Flour protein content and moisture was determined by NIR, and composition was assessed using SE-HPLC. Dough empirical rheological and mixing characteristics were determined by farinograph and mixograph recording <b>dough</b> <b>mixers.</b> Rheological measurements of fundamental dough properties were performed through strain sweeps, frequency sweeps, temperature sweeps, creep-relaxation, and stress relaxation on a rheometer. All cultivar flours were baked to assess baking quality through evaluation of loaf volume, texture profile analysis (TPA), C-cell, and x-ray microtomography (XMT). Overley and Karl 92 have the two highest protein contents, respectively, and are not significantly different in percent of unextractable polymeric protein (UPP). Generally, cultivars with higher protein and percent UPP (Overley and Karl 92) gave larger loaves, much more expanded air cells, thinner cell walls, greater void fractions, and better mixing properties. Lower TPA firmness was found for Overley, corresponding with its larger XMT fragmentation index, existence of large air cells, and high void fraction. In contrast, 2137 gave the lowest XMT fragmentation index, low void fraction, larger cell wall thicknesses, and a significantly firmer (P< 0. 05) crumb structure. Protein content {{was found to have}} an inverse relationship with the elastic nature of dough in fundamental rheological measurements since small amplitude measurements generally do not give good correlations to baking quality. Stress relaxation gave the most useful information about flour quality through its relaxation spectra. Flours with high total polymeric protein percentages could be identified through their higher relaxation spectra. Starch gelatinization properties of the flours were different for RVA and rheometer temperature sweeps. All of these tests have helped characterize the four Kansas wheat cultivars chosen for this study...|$|R

In addition, the report includes information on former GSP recipients that have negotiated free trade agreements with the United States, in view of Senate Report 110 - 410. Information in the profiles covers the period March 2008 through February 2009. Each country profile contains a table and three text sections that cover (1) the incidence and nature of child labor; (2) child labor laws and enforcement; and (3) current government policies and programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The first text section provides, to the extent available, a comprehensive picture of exploitive child labor in a country, while {{the second and third}} text sections describe government efforts to combat the problem through legal measures and enforcement, and through policies and programs, respectively. The tables present key statistics and indicators on child labor and government efforts to address it, including information about the rate of child work versus participation in school where available; basic policies in regard to child work and education; ratification of international conventions relevant to child labor; and participation in the ILO-IPEC program. Since the TDA applies to U. S. trade beneficiary countries and territories, this report does not include information on the worst forms of child labor in the United States.

40|$|A laboratory-scale Tweedy-type {{mechanical}} <b>dough</b> development <b>mixer</b> {{was modified}} to monitor work inputs of dough during mixing through a computerised data acquisition system. Recorded torque showed a curve that increased to a peak about midway through mixing. Using this system, {{the effects of}} mixing speed and pressure {{on the development of}} doughs made from strong and weak flours mixed to a work input of 40 kJ kg− 1 were studied. Mixing was characterized in terms of peak torque and torque at the end of mixing (end torque), {{and in terms of the}} number of blade revolutions at these two reference points. The peak torque and the end torque both increased with increasing mixing speed. The peak torque increased with increasing mixer headspace pressure, but the end torque did not. The number of blade revolutions to both the point of peak torque and to the end of mixing decreased with increasing mixing speed for both flours, implying dough development at higher speeds was more efficient. Increasing headspace pressure reduced the number of revolutions to the peak, but not to the end of mixing. These results provide evidence that achieving dough development is not independent of mixing speed in Tweedy-type <b>mixers,</b> and that <b>dough</b> aeration, as affected by mixer headspace pressure, affects dough rheology and hence development in the mixer.

Previous research reports into <b>dough</b> <b>mixer</b> scale-up only consider the dough development aspect of mixing and neglect aeration, despite over-aeration being a known problem that occurs with scale-up. A series of experiments was performed on three scales of the Tweedy-type high-intensity mixer. A pressure step-change was introduced during mixing, and dimensionless aeration parameters for each mixer were found through measurement of the dough voidage response, using a previously reported aeration model. The degree of steady state aeration, the turnover rate and the volumetric entrainment rate were all found to increase with mixer scale, or alternatively with Reynolds number. The number density of bubbles in the dough and the mean bubble size could not be seen to vary significantly with scale, but both increased with mixer headspace pressure...|$|E

40|$|Dough mixing {{involves}} {{a combination of}} different deformation flows, e. g. shear and elongation. The complicated nature of mixing process {{makes it difficult to}} understand dough processing at a mechanistic level. A new Couette device allowed the effects of shear flow on the physical properties of glutenin macro-polymer (GMP) and micro-structure formation of the dough to be studied. Steady shear deformation using concentric Couette-type flow did not decrease GMP content or size of glutenin particles. Confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed the formation of interconnected gluten domains indicating the development of a gluten network. In an eccentric Couette configuration the results depended on the degree of eccentricity. A higher degree of eccentricity and a longer processing time led to considerable reduction in GMP content and size of glutenin particles. The micro-structural change in the narrow gap regions of the eccentric cell occurred early in processing, leading to a break up of large protein domains, and a microscopically more homogeneous dough. Transient high shear flow led to elongation and break up of the macroscopic gluten network. In low shear regions of the eccentric cell (wider gap settings), reformation or aggregation of protein domains was observed. Thus, the gluten aggregation¿break up mechanisms are strongly influenced by the local flow profile in a conventional mixer.
