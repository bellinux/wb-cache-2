5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} group of American {{military}} men {{who believed that}} long-range <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II by those in the military who did not share their belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E

5|$|Australians {{participated in}} attacks on German defences in France {{in the weeks}} before D-Day. No.453 Squadron made four raids on radar {{stations}} in late May and early June, and RAAF pilots serving with British fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons took part in other such attacks. The four Australian <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons contributed aircraft to raids on radar stations and communications facilities in the week before the landing. These units also struck German coastal batteries along the channel coast on nine occasions between 8 and 29 May; Australians serving with British light bomber units took part in a further 14 raids on German batteries. The RAAF <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons and Australians in RAF light and <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> units also participated in raids against German Army camps in France and Belgium during May. The Australian squadrons suffered heavy losses in several of these attacks, including seven aircraft lost during a raid on the 21stPanzer Division's facilities at Mailly-le-Camp on the night of 3/4 May. In addition to these attacks on German positions, Bomber Command struck the seven largest German munitions factories and ammunition dumps in France during late April and early May; the four Australian squadrons participated in five of these operations, and no Australian aircraft were lost.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> are bomber {{aircraft}} {{capable of}} delivering the largest payload of air-to-ground weaponry (usually bombs) and longest range of their era. Archetypal <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> have therefore usually {{been among the}} largest and most powerful military or civil aircraft at any point in time. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> were largely superseded by strategic bombers, which were often smaller in size, but were capable of launching nuclear weapons.|$|R
5|$|Following Operation Goodwood, {{responsibility}} for attacking Tirpitz {{was transferred to}} the Royal Air Force in late August 1944. In three <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> raids conducted during September and October 1944, the battleship was first crippled and then sunk. Historians regard Operation Goodwood as a significant failure for the Fleet Air Arm, and attribute its results to shortcomings with the force's aircraft and their armament.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Paravane, the German Navy's {{commander}} {{decided to}} use Tirpitz as a static artillery battery to protect the town of Tromsø. The Allies were unable to confirm {{the extent of the}} battleship's damage, and conducted two further <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> raids against her in late 1944. Tirpitz was sunk with considerable loss of life on 12 November during the second of these attacks.|$|E
5|$|No. 82 (<b>Heavy</b> <b>Bomber)</b> Wing—the RAAF's {{first such}} wing—was formed at Ballarat, Victoria, on 25August 1944, {{under the command}} of Group Captain Deryck Kingwell. Comprising Nos.21 and 24 Squadrons, both {{equipped}} with B-24 Liberators, the wing became operational on 11January 1945. By this time it was headquartered in the Northern Territory, and came {{under the control of the}} RAAF's North-Western Area Command (NWA). Based at Fenton Airfield, the wing's aircraft sank seven Japanese ships in the Dutch East Indies during March.|$|E

5|$|The great {{majority}} of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons (No.460, No.462, No.463, No.466 and No.467squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, {{and the proportion of}} Australians in these units increased over time. No.464Squadron, which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons into No.6Group RCAF in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had little control over how they were used.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E

50|$|The {{arrival of}} nuclear weapons and guided missiles, {{permanently}} changed the nature of military aviation and strategy. After the 1950s intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines began to supersede <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> in the strategic nuclear role. Along with the emergence of more accurate precision-guided munitions ("smart bombs") and nuclear-armed missiles, which could be carried and delivered by smaller aircraft, these technological advancements eclipsed the <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber's</b> once-central role in strategic warfare by the late 20th century. <b>Heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> have, nevertheless, been used to deliver conventional weapons in several regional conflicts since World War II (e.g. B-52s in the Vietnam War).|$|R

5|$|By July the Allied armies {{were having}} {{difficulty}} advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In {{an attempt to}} create a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions. The first of these attacks was made on 7 July by 467 Bomber Command aircraft and targeted German forces near Caen, as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 Lancasters from No.460 Squadron and 14 Halifaxes from No.466 Squadron as well as aircrew in RAF units. One of No.460 Squadron's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July. All four Australian <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18 July as part of Operation Goodwood, but this offensive also failed to result in a breakthrough. On 30 July, No.463, No.466 and No.467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near Caumont ahead of Operation Bluecoat; 693 heavy bombers took part in this attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many did not drop their bombs as cloud obscured the aiming markers in the target area. All four Australian <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons participated in the next major attack, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support Operation Totalize, but cloud and smoke again prevented many of the bombers from attacking the target area. The four squadrons also attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of Operation Tractable; visibility was clear over most of the target area, and the raids were considered successful. By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> attacks were required.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific, US forces {{continued}} to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands, and decisively defeated Japanese {{forces in the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to {{the resignation of the}} Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} invasion, the RAF {{intensified}} {{its operations}} against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No.460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and Heligoland Bight. Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No.455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.|$|E

The nuclear warheads in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours.

5|$|The Admiralty {{accepted}} that Barracudas were {{too slow to}} be effective against the Kaafjord area following the failure of Operation Goodwood. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to RAF Bomber Command. The first <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> raid against Kaafjord (Operation Paravane) was conducted on 15 September 1944, with the bombers flying from staging bases in northern Russia. This attack inflicted irreparable damage on Tirpitz, and she was transferred south to the Tromsø area {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. The battleship was sunk there with heavy loss of life by another Bomber Command raid on 12 November.|$|E

One I-5 was carried was on each wing and a third over the fuselage. Ramps were used to get the wing-mounted aircraft to their places, but the fuselage-mounted aircraft had to be lifted by hand. This was so cumbersome that they were generally used solely as an extra powerplant for the TB-3 later in the program. The aircraft used in these trials used the longer landing gear with smaller tires originally used in the prototypes.|$|E

25|$|Sint-Truiden Air Base was a {{frequent}} target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned {{down on the ground}} and be unable to attack the <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers.</b> Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Saint Trond after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the <b>heavy</b> <b>bombers</b> all the way to their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Saint Trond on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.|$|R
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{had flown}} {{a total of}} 8 sorties throughout the war and dropped 27 tons of bombs. With the conclusion of hostilities the squadron continued training and on November 10 even moved once more to Tel Nof. The B-17s flew a few more sorties during a January 1957 survey of the Sinai but were soon sent back to storage. 69 Squadron was finally disbanded on March 1, 1957. It was initially slated to operate the IAF's next <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber,</b> the Sud-Ouest Vautour, but these plans were dropped in favour of 110 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|After several modifications, {{the first}} {{production}} variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most {{closely associated with}} the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber.</b> A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp. Lancasters were known to fly entire missions with their engines running at full power with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a threat to}} shipping, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D.

On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. Another <b>heavy</b> <b>bomber</b> attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, but in a third raid mounted on 12 November, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.|$|E
