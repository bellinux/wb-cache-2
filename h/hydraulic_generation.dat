40|$|Abstract- Energetic {{autonomy}} of a hydraulic-based mobile field robot requires a power source capable of both electrical and <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>generation.</b> While the <b>hydraulic</b> power {{is used for}} locomotion, the electric power {{is used for the}} computer, sensors and other peripherals. An internal combustion engine was used as the prime mover due to the high energy density of gasoline. The primary specification for this hybrid Hydraulic-Electric Power Unit (HEPU) is that it must output constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. An on-board computer uses a pressure sensor and a speed sensor to regulate the pressure and voltage by modulating a hydraulic solenoid valve and an engine throttle. The speed regulation also results in a system noise with predictable frequency band which allows for optimal muffler design. A novel characteristic of this power source is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders. Several hydraulic-electric power units were built and successfully demonstrated on the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) shown on bleex. me. berkeley. edu/bleex. htm. A prototype power unit weighs 27 Kg, outputs 2. 3 kW (3. 0 hp) hydraulic power at 6. 9 MPa (1000 psi), and 220 W of electric power at 15 VDC.

40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal scheduling of hydropower plants in a hydrothermal interconnected system. This problem, of outmost importance for large-scale power systems {{with a high}} proportion of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>generation,</b> requires {{a detailed description of the}} so-called hydro unit production function. In our model, we relate the amount of generated hydropower to nonlinear tailrace levels; we also take into account hydraulic losses, turbine-generator efficiencies, as well as multiple 0 - 1 states associated with forbidden operation zones. Forbidden zones are crucial to avoid nasty phenomena such as mechanical vibrations in the turbine, cavitation, and low efficiency levels. The minimization of operating costs subject to such detailed constraints results in a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. By means of Lagrangian Relaxation, the original problem is split into a sequence of smaller and easy-to-solve subproblems, coordinated by a dual master program. In order to deal better with the combinatorial aspect introduced by the forbidden zones, we derive three different decomposition strategies, applicable to various configurations of hydro plants (with few or many units, which can be identical or different). We use a Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm to solve nonlinear subproblems. We assess our approach on a real-life hydroelectric configuration extracted from the south sub region of the Brazilian hydrothermal power system...|$|E
