40|$|In any court system, {{national}} or international, judges should be impartial. Every {{judge of the}} fifteen-man International Court of Justice is required by the International Court of Justice Statute to make a “solemn declaration... that he will exercise his powers <b>impartially</b> <b>and</b> <b>conscientiously.</b> ” But this provision {{is not the only}} safeguard in the statute to help insure a judge’s impartiality. The framers of the statute believed that the national States would have greater confidence in the court if there were additional safeguards. Which articles in the statute restrict judicial bias and which articles, if any, overlook its possible existence? For this purpose the statute is measured by two standards: (1) a method of appointing judges which places judicial qualifications above political considerations, and (2) methods of safeguards to impartiality after appointment.
