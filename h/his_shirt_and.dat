5|$|He {{was also}} noted as a joker on the pitch. After the {{replay of the}} Scottish Cup Final against Celtic in 1963 he stuffed the match ball up <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> later gave it to a new member of the team. The SFA insisted that the ball should be returned, and Rangers sent them a ball, but {{possibly}} not the match ball.|$|E
5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Bankhead was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light of these experiences, Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid on Indian Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, {{although some of the}} Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|A return {{match against}} Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were {{fortunate}} {{to get a}} draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1–86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84–9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again {{came to the rescue}} with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161–4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, he had run three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded as the ball was dead (out of play) when it went into his shirt.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm {{began on}} 19 April (although some {{preliminary}} discussions took place days before). It {{took place in}} Warsaw and the deputies and senators in service of foreign powers declared it a confederated sejm (with decisions decided by the majority) to prevent liberum veto (the right of any deputy to force an immediate end to the current session and nullify any legislation {{that had already been}} passed) being used to stop it. The marshals of the Sejm were Adam Poniński, one of the nobles in Russian service, for the Crown of Poland, and Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. At least half of the deputies were bribed by the foreign powers, and others were threatened. Some deputies (Tadeusz Rejtan, Samuel Korsak Stanisław Bohuszewicz, Franciszek Jerzmanowski, Stanisław Kożuchowski, Rupert Dunin, Jan Tymowski, J. Zaremba, Michał Radoszewski, Ignacy Suchecki, Tadeusz Wołodkowicz) tried to protest, which caused delays. Out of those, Rejtan's gesture – in which he was said to have barred the doors, torn <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> asked other deputies to murder him rather than Poland – became widely known, and was immortalized in a painting by Jan Matejko. By 24 April the few vocal opponents, such as Rejtan, had lost, the confederation was joined by the King and the Sejm elected a committee of thirty to deal with the various matters presented (primarily the partitioners' demands, but also some reforms to the government). The committee was to deliberate until September, {{and the rest of the}} Sejm was adjourned in the meantime.|$|E

The Queen was impressed by his humility and pleaded for his life so Alexander was imprisoned again, this time in Tantallon Castle.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 6 July, three more people were murdered in Dnipropetrovsk. The first was Egor Nechvoloda, a {{recently}} discharged army recruit, who was bludgeoned while walking home from a nightclub. His mother found {{the body in the}} morning by their apartment building on Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street. Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old night guard, was then murdered around the corner on Kosiora Street. According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> struck her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out. Later the same night, the men murdered a woman named Valentina Hanzha (no apparent relation to co-defendant Alexander Hanzha), a mother of three with a disabled husband.|$|E
25|$|Leeds' relegation in May 2004 saw Smith {{kissing the}} badge on <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> crying at {{what would be}} his last match for the club. His {{transfer}} to bitter rivals Manchester United, however, led to controversy. His exit was marred by accusations of treachery, and {{in the space of a}} day he went from hero to villain in the eyes of some Leeds fans; this was despite the fact that club had publicly stated that they could not afford to pay his wages, that they were open to offers for him, and that no other club had registered an interest. Due to the financial difficulties at Leeds, Smith chose to waive the personal transfer fee owed to him by the club. This did not stop some Leeds fans from feeling betrayed, and they held up banners in subsequent games that compared Smith to Judas.|$|E

25|$|The second PPV {{match of}} the night carried the {{stipulation}} that {{the captain of the}} losing team (El Zorro or Charly Manson) would receive 10 lashes with a Singapore cane. The real development came after the match as the storyline of the 10 lashes received more attention than the preceding match. After nearly 20 minutes of wrestling X-Pac executed his X-Factor finishing move on El Zorro twice and then pinned him. Following the loss Zorro calmly removed <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> then knelt down to take his punishment. X-Pac and Rocky Romero delivered the first three strikes to the back of El Zorro who took the punishment without complaining. When Charly Manson returned to the ring wearing a Zorro style mask and mockingly offering El Zorro a paper rose El Zorro became enraged and started to fight back. He took the Singapore cane from Romero and began hitting his opponents, moments later Dark Ozz and Dark Escoria's team mates Dark Espiritu and Dark Cuervo ran to the ring, giving the rudo side a five on three advantage. El Zorro and the Black Family beat up all three members and successfully fought off Real Fuerza Aérea who came to the ring to make the save. In the closing minutes of the segment El Zorro confronted Marisel Peña who sat at ringside, Peña slapped El Zorro, a move that seemingly shocked El Zorro.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the injury}} to her leg, she {{continued}} to go on tour every summer, when her own theater in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities. In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born Lou Tellegen, a very handsome actor who {{had served as a}} model for the sculpture Eternal Springtime by Auguste Rodin, and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in Phedre, where he could take off <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of Judas Iscariot in Judas by the American playwright John Wesley De Kay. It was performed in New York's Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia. The tour took her to from Boston to Jacksonville, through Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, to Canada and Minnesota, usually one new city and one performance every day.|$|E
