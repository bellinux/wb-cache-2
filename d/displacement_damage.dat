5000|$|Total {{ionizing}} dose effects: The {{cumulative damage}} of the semiconductor lattice (lattice <b>displacement</b> <b>damage)</b> caused by ionizing radiation over the exposition time. It {{is measured in}} rads and causes slow gradual degradation of the device's performance. A total dose greater than 5000 rads delivered to silicon-based devices in seconds to minutes will cause long-term degradation. In CMOS devices, the radiation creates electron-hole pairs in the gate insulation layers, which cause photocurrents during their recombination, and the holes trapped in the lattice defects in the insulator create a persistent gate biasing and influence the transistors' threshold voltage, making the N-type MOSFET transistors easier and the P-type ones more difficult to switch on. The accumulated charge can be high {{enough to keep the}} transistors permanently open (or closed), leading to device failure. Some self-healing takes place over time, but this effect is not too significant. This effect is the same as hot carrier degradation in high-integration high-speed electronics. Crystal oscillators are somewhat sensitive to radiation doses, which alter their frequency. The sensitivity can be greatly reduced by using swept quartz. Natural quartz crystals are especially sensitive. Radiation performance curves for TID testing may be generated for all resultant effects testing procedures. These curves show performance trends throughout the TID test process and are included in the radiation test report.|$|E

The calculation is based on the experimental data on Î³-ray induced gain degradation in a commercial space borne BJT (2 N 3019). The method involves the calculation of Î³-ray dose (rad(Si)) equivalent of effective particle fluence. The linear energy transfer (LET) in silicon for different particle radiation obtained from TRIM calculation has been used for the conversion of Î³-dose into fluence of various particles. The estimation predicts a smooth increase in the <b>displacement</b> <b>damage</b> factor as the mass of the ion increases. Further, the <b>displacement</b> <b>damage</b> factor reaches a maximum at the same value of energy, which corresponds to maximum LET for all heavy ions.

The facade has a central opening and a gable on top, whereas the two sidewalls, acting as abutments, are either blind or have a window. A unidirectional seismic action, in the perpendicular direction to main wall, was applied. Out-of-plane behavior of the facade was found, even if the response was clearly influenced by the presence of the window in one of the sidewalls, which led to significant torsion of the structure.
