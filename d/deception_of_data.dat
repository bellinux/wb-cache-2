30|$|As a dataset, 911 calls may {{be ideal}} for {{deception}} detection research because they {{occur in a}} real-world setting, are relatively unrehearsed, occur soon after the crime in question, and are part of emotionally charged situations [3],[4]. In contrast, in laboratory settings where deception is often sanctioned, the consequences of lying and getting caught are minor, and incentives to deceive are artificial (e.g., [5],[6]). Thus, as Mann et al. [7] suggest, these low-stakes laboratory environments may not induce feelings of guilt or elicit behavior found in real settings; as a result, they may adversely affect researchers’ ability to accurately judge credibility, and therefore diminish the external validity of the results. Thus, {{it is important to}} add real-world scenarios to the collection <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> research <b>data.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the great}} shift towards {{expressionism}} in painting, André Bazin {{used the word}} pseudoreal in reference to mechanical means which freed the plastic arts from the drive toward 'unachievable likeness'. Meanwhile, photorealistic CGI animation and 3D computer graphics used today have become indistinguishable from cine-photography. In that regard, the special effects augmenting feature film through photographic <b>deception</b> <b>of</b> the eye have gained an entirely different dimension. Computer generated imagery and 3D animation are used not only to bolster reality based images but also to create imaginary worlds. [...] We understand the CGI feature film to be an image of pseudorealism in Bazin’s terms - a fundamental <b>deception</b> <b>of</b> the eye. Of course the cinema itself in whatever incarnation involves a <b>deception</b> <b>of</b> the eye, that of the ‘persistence of vision’ effect. Though things appear to exist and have causal properties, they {{are the product of}} man-made parameters. — David Surman, [...] "CGI Animation: Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds" ...|$|R
