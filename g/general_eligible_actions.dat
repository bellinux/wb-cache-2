40|$|We study capital {{requirements}} for bounded financial positions {{defined as the}} minimum amount of capital {{to invest in a}} chosen eligible asset targeting a pre-specified acceptability test. We allow for general acceptance sets and <b>general</b> <b>eligible</b> assets, including defaultable bonds. Since the payoff of these assets is not necessarily bounded away from zero the resulting risk measures cannot be transformed into cash-additive risk measures by a change of numeraire. However, extending the range of eligible assets is important because, as exemplified by the recent financial crisis, assuming the existence of default-free bonds may be unrealistic. We focus on finiteness and continuity properties of these general risk measures. As an application, we discuss {{capital requirements}} based on Value-at-Risk and Tail-Value-at-Risk acceptability, the two most important acceptability criteria in practice. Finally, we prove that there is no optimal choice of the eligible asset. Our results and our examples show that a theory of capital requirements allowing for <b>general</b> <b>eligible</b> assets is richer than the standard theory of cash-additive risk measures...|$|R

40|$|Introduction For any application, the {{designer}} of a distributed system {{has the responsibility}} of certifying the correctness of the system, before users start using it. This guarantee might possibly hold as long every hardware and software component works according to specifications. This chapter explains what correctness criteria are considered important for distributed systems. In message passing models, the state of a distributed system consists of the local states of all the processes, and {{the states of the}} channels connecting these processes. For the locally shared variable models, channel states are irrelevant. The state of a distributed system is also called its configuration. From any state, the execution of each <b>eligible</b> <b>action</b> takes the system to a new state.

50|$|Military retirees {{fall into}} two general categories: those retired for disabilities and those retired for length of service. Members of the U.S. {{military}} who serve honorably for a specified period, generally at least 20 years, are entitled to retire and to receive retirement pay. Military veterans are entitled to compensation for service-connected disabilities, a benefit generally called VA disability, with some exceptions. Some service members may be entitled to a different benefit called combat-related special compensation (CRSC) because of disability caused either by direct engagement in an armed conflict or through an instrumentality of war, such as exposure to Agent Orange. In <b>general,</b> <b>eligible</b> service members must elect either retirement pay, or any disability benefit awarded for a service-connected disability, or choose a CRSC benefit alone, {{but they may not}} receive all three, however, some veterans may qualify to receive both retirement pay and a disability benefit.|$|R
40|$|Problem {{formulation}} {{and challenges}} Many decision−making systems adopt lookahead policies {{to select the}} most promising <b>eligible</b> <b>actions.</b> In most cases, the deeper a program looks ahead, the better performance it will achieve. But as Nau has suggested, sometimes looking ahead deeper consistently degrades {{the quality of a}} decision, which is called pathology. This is usually somewhat contradictory to our intuition. Although some researchers have discovered pathology in several games, like the Pearl Game, little is known about why and how pathology occurs. Some intuitive explanations were given, but they were neither general nor theoretically grounded. Further study on pathology is needed. With a better understanding of such anomalies, {{we will be able to}} avoid pathology and design better evaluation functions or algorithms, thus improve the performance of our searching process. According to the advice Prof. Bulitko gave us based on his experiences, and the work we have done, we have a feeling that the use of an inadmissible function may cause pathologies. Thus, the challenge is to find an &quot;interesting and natural &quot; inadmissibl...|$|R
40|$|Tradable green {{certificate}} (TGC) schemes {{have been developed}} and tested in several countries to foster market-driven penetration of renewable energy sources. Another well-known and widely analysed type of market–based instrument is the tradable CO 2 permit. The first international CO 2 emission trading scheme will soon start in the European Union (EU). Recently the attention of policy makers has been attracted {{by the possibility of}} introducing tradable certificates for energy savings (TCES) to stimulate energy efficiency investments and achieve national energy efficiency targets. TCES schemes have been recently introduced in Italy and the UK. However, there is a debate over the effectiveness and applicability of this instrument. The paper describes the concept of a TCES scheme in the EU policy context. It discusses the main elements of a TCES scheme: the creation of the market and of the demand (<b>eligible</b> <b>actions</b> and technologies), the trading rules (validity of certificates, banking, borrowing), the possible cost-recovery mechanisms, and institutional infrastructure and processes to support the scheme (measurement and verification, penalty for non-compliance) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Following recent discussions, {{there is}} hope that a {{mechanism}} for reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will be agreed by the Parties of the UNFCCC at their 15 th meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 as an <b>eligible</b> <b>action</b> to prevent climate changes and global warming in post- 2012 commitment periods. Countries introducing a REDD-regime in order to generate benefits need to implement sound monitoring and reporting systems and specify the associated uncertainties. The principle of conservativeness addresses the problem of estimation errors and requests the reporting of reliable minimum estimates (RME). Here the potential to generate benefits from applying a REDD-regime is proposed with reference to sampling and non-sampling errors that influence the reliability of estimated activity data and emission factors. Results A framework for calculating carbon benefits by including assessment errors is developed. Theoretical, sample based considerations {{as well as a}} simulation study for five selected countries with low to high deforestation and degradation rates show that even small assessment errors (5 % and less) may outweigh successful efforts to reduce deforestation and degradation. Conclusion The generation of benefits from REDD is possible only in situations where assessment errors are carefully controlled. </p...|$|R

40|$|We discuss risk {{measures}} {{representing the}} {{minimum amount of}} capital a financial institution needs to raise and invest in a pre-specified eligible asset to ensure it is adequately capitalized. Most of the literature has focused on cash-additive risk measures, for which the eligible asset is a risk-free bond, {{on the grounds that}} the general case can be reduced to the cash-additive case by a change of numéraire. However, discounting does not work in all financially relevant situations, especially when the eligible asset is a defaultable bond. In this paper, we fill this gap by allowing <b>general</b> <b>eligible</b> assets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the corresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on value-at-risk and tail value-at-risk on L p spaces, as well as to shortfall risk measures on Orlicz spaces. We pay special attention to the property of cash subadditivity, which has been recently proposed as an alternative to cash additivity to deal with defaultable bonds. For important examples, we provide characterizations of cash subadditivity and show that when the eligible asset is a defaultable bond, cash subadditivity is the exception rather than the rule. Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not liquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the resulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is only compatible with continuous pricing rules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Inter-sensor data {{modeling}} and prediction have recently {{proven to be}} very promising techniques in drastically {{reducing the number of}} active sensors and thus the overall energy consumption in wireless sensor networks. Using existing and recently proposed inter-sensor {{data modeling}} techniques as the enablers, we propose an on-line distributed active prediction algorithm to use the available prediction models to put redundant sensor nodes to sleep. We first start by a more <b>general</b> <b>eligible</b> redundant set representation of the problem with an integer linear programming formulation that does not take network connectivity into account. We then discuss an efficient centralized heuristic to deal with the connectivity issue. The proposed distributed algorithm selects a subset of the sensors that form a connected network. After completion, each sensor is either in the active set or its measurements can be directly predicted by a designated predictor sensor in the active set, within specified tolerance levels. The elected predictor sensor performs the prediction and disseminates it along with its own measurements when necessary. We also show that performing the prediction modeling locally, as opposed to at a fusion center, is better suited for dynamic sensor networks. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using simulated data as well as real experimental data collected from 16 indoor temperature sensors from a large office building. The experimental results from the indoor temperature sensors show that the algorithm can reduce the number of active nodes in this case by 60 % to 80 % with only a 0. 5 ◦ F average tolerance level in the predicted measurements.

50|$|For {{promotion}} to the permanent grade of brigadier <b>general,</b> <b>eligible</b> officers are screened by a promotion board consisting of general officers from their branch of service. This promotion board then generates {{a list of}} officers it recommends for {{promotion to}} general rank. This list is then sent to the service secretary and the joint chiefs for review {{before it can be}} sent to the President, through the defense secretary, for consideration. The President nominates officers to be promoted from this list with the advice of the Secretary of Defense, the service secretary, and if applicable, the service's chief of staff or commandant. The President may nominate any eligible officer who is not on the recommended list if it serves {{in the interest of the}} nation, but this is uncommon. The Senate must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once the nominee is confirmed, they are promoted to that rank once they assume or hold an office that requires or allows an officer of that rank. For positions of office reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For all three uniformed services, because the grade of brigadier general is a permanent rank, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board. The rank does not expire when the officer vacates a one-star position. Tour length varies depending on the position, by statute, or when the officer receives a new assignment. The average tour length per one-star billet is two to four years.|$|R
