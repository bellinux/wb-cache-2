40|$|Thirteen out of 268 {{children}} (< 18 years old) underwent hepatic transplantation (OLT) for end-stage {{liver disease}} (ESLD) associated with arteriohepatic dysplasia (AHD). Seven children {{are alive and}} well with normal liver function. Six children died, four within 11 days of the operation {{and the other two}} at 4 and 10 months after the OLT. Vascular complications with associated septicemia were {{responsible for the deaths of}} three children. Two died of <b>heart</b> failure and <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse,</b> secondary to pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart disease. The remaining patient died of overwhelming sepsis not associated with technical complications. Seven patients had a portoenterostomy or portocholecystostomy early in life; five of these died after the OLT. Severe cardiovascular abnormalities in some of our patients suggest that complete hemodynamic monitoring with invasive studies should be performed in all patients with AHD, especially in cases of documented hypertrophy of the right ventricle. The improved quality of life in our surviving patients confirms the validity of OLT as a treatment of choice in cases of ESLD due to AHD. © 1992 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Background: Patients with {{pulmonary}} embolism have high mortality and morbidity rate due to right <b>heart</b> failure and <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> leading to sudden death. Multi-detector computed tomography MDCT can efficiently evaluate the cardiovascular {{factors related to}} {{pulmonary embolism}}. Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) in differentiation of between sever and non-severe pulmonary embolism groups depending on the associated cardiovascular parameters and create a simple reporting system. Patients & methods: Prospective study contained 145 patients diagnosed clinically pulmonary embolism. All patients were examined by combined electrocardiographically gated computed tomography pulmonary angiography-computed tomography venography (ECG-CTPA-CTV) using certain imaging criteria in a systematic manner. Results: Our study revealed 95 and 55 non-severe and severe pulmonary embolism groups respectively. Many cardiovascular parameters related to pulmonary embolism shows significant p value and can differentiate between sever and non-severe pulmonary embolism patients include pulmonary artery diameter, intraventricular septum flattening, bowing, superior vena cava and Azygos vein diameters, right and left ventricular diameters. Conclusion: Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) can be valuable to assess the severity of pulmonary embolism using the related cardiovascular parameters and leading the management strategy aim for best outcome.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIn the {{majority}} of health centers in Ethiopia, the severity of falciparum malaria has been determined by parasitemia alone. However, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of peripheral infected RBC counts as an indicator of disease severity by itself is insufficient. Therefore, this study was performed to assess the severity of falciparum malaria infection in three Ethiopian localities with epidemic malaria and to compare the usual severe malaria determination technique (parasitemia) used in Ethiopia with other malaria severity determination parameters: <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse,</b> cerebral malaria and severe anemia. MethodsBlood samples were collected from 400 individuals to examine the presence of falciparum malaria in the Awash, Metehara and Ziway areas of Ethiopia. Data on cerebral malaria, <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> and severe anemia were collected from 210 falciparum malaria patients. ResultsOf the 400 individuals examined, 210 were positive for falciparum malaria, and 190 were negative and served as healthy controls (HC). Severe anemia (18 patients, 8. 57 %) and <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> (25 patients, 11. 90 %) were the common features associated with severe falciparum malaria. Additionally, the detection of severe malaria was comparable using parasitemia, <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> or anemia. ConclusionThe findings of this study demonstrated comparable capacity for detecting severe falciparum malaria using <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse,</b> severe anemia or parasitemia. Therefore, in addition to parasitemia, assessing severity of falciparum malaria using <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> and severe anemia will facilitate the diagnosis and management of malaria in Ethiopia...|$|R

40|$|Background: Circulatory assist {{devices are}} applied to support {{patients}} with end-stage <b>heart</b> failure or <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse.</b> Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and ventricular assist device (VAD) are the two devices that are commonly used in these situations. However, in patients undergoing ECMO, complications occur more frequently and are more severe than in those with VAD, especially in patients with coagulopathy. The cause of coagulopathy is seldom reported; therefore, the current prospective {{study was designed to}} compare the coagulation status between patients who received ECMO and bridged VAD thereafter. Methods: The cases for our study were collected between December 2005 and January 2010. A total of 21 patients with VAD were enrolled. Seven patients received initial ECMO support and were subsequently shifted to VAD. Use of blood transfusion products by patients was recorded during application of ECMO and VAD. Thrombelastography (TEG) was performed pre-ECMO and pre-VAD, and thereafter to 1 week post-VAD implantation. The relevant parameters that were examined included coagulation time (R: resting, K: kinetics, seconds), angle (α, degrees), maximal amplitude (MA, mm), clot strength (G, dynes/cm 2), and estimated percent lysis in 30 minutes (LY 30, %). Coagulation status and average unit per day of blood transfusion at pre-VAD and post-VAD status were recorded. TEGs of pre-VAD and post-VAD implantation were compared {{in order to determine the}} frequency of bleeding. Results: Average results from seven cases were incorporated into the current analysis. The patient transfusion requirement was reduced after implantation of the VAD. The TEG of post-VAD implantation was improved from the earlier pre-VAD results (ECMO status). Ultimately, TEG resulted in significant differences in R, K, angle, MA, and G, postoperatively. Conclusion: Coagulopathy of patients with VAD improved after bridging from ECMO, which can be attributed to improved coagulation factor and platelet function. Thus, bleeding complications are reduced...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies (1) (2) have {{demonstrated}} that <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> similar to that often ob-served in disease and suitable for experimental study is induced in normal subjects in the upright position by administering sodium nitrite.

40|$|Management of poly-trauma {{patients}} presenting to {{the emergency}} room is usually a challenging and formidable task. Two of the common problems seen in those patients are shock and neurological dysfunction. A huge differential for post-traumatic <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> exist and timely identification of the etiology is of utmost importance to avoid complications. In this report we are describing 2 cases presenting with <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> following trauma. The first case was a 29 year old female who presented after a motor vehicle accident fully conscious with severe hypotension and bradycardia. The second case presented with severe hemodynamic instability after falling at home. Physical examination of both patients revealed weakness in all 4 limbs and CT cervical spine revealed complete anterior sublaxation of C 5 over C 6 cervical vertebrae in the first case and partial sublaxation of C 5 over C 6 cervical vertebrae in the second case confirming that spinal cord injury is the likely cause for these hemodynamic alterations. A high index of suspicion for spinal cord injuries is therefore mandatory when managing a trauma patient presenting with quadriparesis and hemodynamic instability that is otherwise unexplained especially when the ensuing hypotension is associated with bradycardia instead of reflex tachycardia. Awareness of this cause of <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> is particularly important in the unconscious patient where eliciting sensory and motor deficits looking for spinal cord injury is not always feasible. Both patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and were maintained on epinephrine till becoming hemodynamically stable.

40|$|Cardiac arrest with {{impending}} <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> An old {{patient was}} brought to the emergency department with cardiac arrest following blunt traumatic injury. After successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient underwent CT scan which revealed dependent layering of contrast and severe venous reflux (figure 1) as well as lack of forward flow into the left heart (figure 2), indicating impending <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse.</b> Moments later, the patient became pulseless and severely hypo-tensive. Further attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient died on the examination table. Cardiac arrest is most commonly detected by physical examin-ation or electrocardiography, leading to rapid intervention to prevent <b>circulatory</b> <b>collapse</b> and subsequent death. Imaging does not typically {{play a significant role in}} the acute management of these unstable patients. However, CT imaging may detect import-ant haemodynamic signs of impaired spontaneous circulation. These signs include intravascular sedimentation of high-density contrast to form a blood-contrast level and relative confinement of contrast to the venous circulation. 1 Patients with these CT findings progress to overt cardiac arrest within seconds to minutes. Once recognised, CT imaging should be promptly ter-minated in favour of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to prevent end-organ ischaemia and death...|$|R

40|$|The <b>heart</b> <b>circulatory</b> {{system is}} {{composed}} {{of the heart and}} blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries. Our bodies actually have two circulatory systems: The pulmonary circulation is a short loop from the heart to the lungs and back again, and the systemic circulation (the system we usually think of as our circulatory system) sends blood from the heart to all the other parts of our bodies and back again. The heart gets messages from the body that tell it when to pump more or less blood depending on an individual's needs. When we're sleeping, it pumps just enough to provide for the lower amounts of oxygen needed by our bodies at rest. When we're exercising or frightened, the heart pumps faster to increase the delivery of oxygen.
