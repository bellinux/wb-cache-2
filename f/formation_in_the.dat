5|$|The Grand Staircase is {{an immense}} {{sequence}} of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park {{and into the}} Grand Canyon.

Bryce Canyon to the northeast continues where the Zion and Kolob areas end by presenting Cenozoic-aged rocks. In fact, the youngest formation seen in the Zion and Kolob area is the oldest exposed formation in Bryce Canyonthe Dakota Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 and 16million years ago, in the Middle Miocene, eruptions of Columbia River basalts from {{volcanic}} vents {{in eastern}} Oregon and Washington flowed {{across much of}} northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean.

5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble <b>formation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tissues {{could be avoided}} during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly by the number of compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E
5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same <b>formation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Taylor Creek Thrust Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.|$|E
