40|$|International audienceThis work {{studies the}} {{influence}} of added <b>inert</b> <b>dust</b> on the ignition sensitivity of the combustible/inert dust mixture. Different types of combustible dust of various sizes, such as coal, powdered sugar, lycopodium, anthraquinone, rice and coffee husks, beech wood flour or ground coffee were mixed with alumina and kieselguhr before being tested. Parameters measured were 1) minimum ignition temperature (MIT) in 5 mm layer, 2) minimum ignition temperature in cloud (Godbert-Greenwald oven) and 3) minimum ignition energy (MIE) (in a Kühner-Mike 3 apparatus). It appears from this study that the MIT in 5 mm layer is strongly influenced by an inert fraction >= 60 % (weight). There is also {{a significant increase in}} MIT in cloud form when the fraction of <b>inert</b> <b>dust</b> exceeds 60 % (weight). This threshold {{is a function of the}} bulk density of the inert substance selected for these tests. However, in cases where the density of the <b>inert</b> <b>dust</b> is different from that of the combustible dust, there appears to be a separation of the two constituents of the mixture after its pneumatic dispersion during the test.

40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of naturally occurring zeolite and diatomaceous earth, as <b>inert</b> <b>dusts</b> approved for insect pest control in certified organic crop production, on trading and breadmaking quality of treated wheat. The treatments significantly reduced the trading quality of wheat which was reflected through lowering of test weight. This effect was more marked in the case of low-vitreous wheat rather than in high-vitreous one. Investigation of rheological properties of flours made from the treated wheat demonstrated that treatments with natural zeolite and diatomaceous earth at all applied doses significantly increased the water absorption, which consequently increased the bread yield.

As a consequence, safety conditions pertaining to ignition suppression are rarely identified to an adequate level. It is well known that, in general, the ignition attitude of a dust depends on several factors, such as {{the nature of the}} chemical, the particle size, moisture content, etc., but there is still a lack of knowledge on the effect of the single variables. This paper aims has the aim of providing data on the minimum ignition temperatures of dust mixtures obtained from a mixing of a combustible dust (flour, lactose, sucrose, sulphur) and an <b>inert</b> <b>dust</b> (limestone, extinguishing powders) {{as well as from the}} mixing of two different combustible dusts. Various mixtures with different weight ratios have been tested in a Godbert Greenwald (GG) furnace and on a hot plate in order to measure the effect of mixture composition on the minimum ignition temperature (MITL) of the layer and on the minimum ignition temperature (MITC) of the cloud. In order to further verify the effects of <b>inert</b> <b>dust</b> particle size, inerts sieved to different size ranges have been tested separately. Generally, both MITL and MITC increase as the inert content is increased. MITC is poorly affected by inert particle size when limestone is used. The MITL of pure flour is higher than the MITL of mixtures containing up to 40 % of 32 - 75 micrometers of limestone.

Insect infestation can occur just prior to harvest, during storage in traditional storage structures, cribs, metal or concrete bins, and in warehouses, food handling facilities, retail grocery stores as well as in-transit. Many tools are available for managing insects {{associated with}} grains and processed food. Although pest management strategies are changing to meet consumer’s demand for food free of insecticide residues, address concerns about safety of insecticides to humans, delay insecticide resistance development in insects and comply with stricter insecticide regulations, the use of synthetic residual insecticides {{will continue to be}} a major component of stored-product pest management programmes. Selective use of residual insecticides requires a through understanding and evaluation of risks, costs and benefits. The use of plant and inert materials may be a safe, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of grain preservation against pest infestation among low-resource poor farmers who store small amounts of grains. There is a dearth of information on the use of plant materials by rural farmers in Africa for stored-product protection. The most promising candidate plant materials for future utilization as grain protectants are Azadirachta, Acorus, Chenopodium, Eucalyptus, Mentha, Ocimum, Piper and Tetradenia together with vegetable oils from various sources. Neem is the only plant from which several commercial products have been developed worldwide. However, unlike synthetic insecticides these alternatives often do not provide effective or rapid suppression of pest populations and may not be effective against all species of pests. These alternatives are also more expensive than synthetic insecticides, and have not been tested extensively under field conditions in the tropics. This paper focuses on the current state of the utilization of residual insecticides, <b>inert</b> <b>dusts</b> and botanicals by resource-poor farmers for protection of durable stored produce against pest infestation in Africa.

The varroa mite was first {{discovered in the}} United States in 1987. Globally, {{it is the most}} important pest of honey bees and it has caused extensive losses in feral and managed colonies. Once introduced, varroa mites have never been eradicated from any country or region, and beekeepers must adopt an integrated pest management strategy to protect their colonies. Early detection and assessment of infestation levels are important components of a varroa management plan. Since varroa mites feed by piercing the intersegmental membranes {{on the underside of the}} bee 2 ̆ 7 s abdomen, they are not easily observed on bees until colonies are severely injured. Beekeepers need to use a detection technique to check their colonies for mites.

Progress of research into the use of IGRs and microbial insecticides is reviewed.

Other candidate materials are either still at the early stages of evaluation, or have been discarded because their levels of persistence are too high. In these cases, results from both laboratory and field trials are outlined. A few materials which have shown potential against agricultural, medical or veterinary insect pests have been included as they may be tested against storage pests in the future.

Recent studies indicate that, when used in combination, aromatic plant EOs may enhance the insecticidal efficacy of IDs. Such effect could be due both to the physical action of IDs on the cuticle and the supposed neurotoxic effects of EOs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of the two aromatic plants Pistacia lentiscus and Foeniculum vulgare EOs, of K and D powders and of the IDs-EOs mix as grain protectants against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) (Curculionidae). The EOs were tested at 10, 40, 80 and, 100 ppm, IDs at 25, 50 and 100 ppm while the EOs + IDs at 20, 40 and 60 ppm in 330 ml pots containing 150 g of maize grains and 10 unsexed insects. Results were recorded after three, six and nine days of treatment. Orthogonal contrasts analysis shows that the action of IDs was higher when used in combination with the EOs (P < 0. 05). These results indicate that the combined use of IDs and EOs could effectively enhance the insecticidal efficacy of IDs reducing the costs of the management of stored grains...|$|R
