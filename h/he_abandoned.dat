5|$|Chatwin {{was born}} near Sheffield, England. At 18 {{he went to}} work at Sotheby’s in London, where he gained an {{extensive}} knowledge of art and eventually ran the auction house’s Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. In 1966 he left Sotheby’s to read archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, but <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> his studies after two years to pursue a career as a writer.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He was also very lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. <b>He</b> <b>abandoned</b> all the rules.|$|E
5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided {{this would make}} the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that he was glad <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard {{enrolled}} at Helena High School, where he contributed to the school paper, but earned only poor grades. <b>He</b> <b>abandoned</b> school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle. He joined his parents in Guam in June 1928. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. <b>He</b> <b>abandoned</b> the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's role in {{defeating}} the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 helped secure James on the throne, yet {{just three years}} later <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> his Catholic patron for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. Honoured for his services at William's coronation with the earldom of Marlborough, he served with further distinction {{in the early years}} of the Nine Years' War, but persistent charges of Jacobitism brought about his fall from office and temporary imprisonment in the Tower. It was not until the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 that Marlborough reached the zenith of his powers and secured his fame and fortune.|$|E
5|$|François Truffaut as Claude Lacombe, a French {{government}} {{scientist in}} charge of UFO-related activities in the United States. Gérard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Lino Ventura were considered for the role. Internationally renowned as a film director, this was Truffaut's only acting role in a film he did not direct {{as well as his}} only role in an English language film. During filming, Truffaut used his free time to write the script for The Man Who Loved Women. He also worked on a novel titled The Actor, a project <b>he</b> <b>abandoned.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 144 BC Emperor Jing {{abolished}} private minting {{in favor}} of central-government and commandery-level minting; he also introduced a new coin. Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC, but a year later <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> the ban liangs entirely {{in favor of}} the wuzhu (五銖) coin, weighing 3.2g (0.11oz). The wuzhu became China's standard coin until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Belcourt {{travelled}} to Rainy Lake {{to examine}} sites for a mission. <b>He</b> <b>abandoned</b> the plan after discovering that the First Nations people {{were unwilling to}} give up their Hudson's Bay Company-supplied liquor, as he required for conversion to Christianity. In August 1838, the priest arranged to have a dictionary published in the Chippewa language, and returned to his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul. In the winter of 1839, Belcourt carved 280 oak balusters and candlesticks for his log chapel.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September he {{attacked}} a Rumpler C.IV which he {{drove down to}} 1,000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates fall from the machine as it took violent evasive action. <b>He</b> <b>abandoned</b> the chase and spotted another. This time {{he attacked}} {{from the sun and}} from behind and below. His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed behind enemy lines. Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill. A DFW C.V followed on 23 September—his 13th victory.|$|E

5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.|$|E

5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. One reason is that he needed a new subject after <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-five men (including replacements) {{formed the}} shore and ship's parties of the Terra Nova Expedition. They were chosen from 8,000applicants, and {{included}} seven Discovery veterans together with five {{who had been with}} Shackleton on his 1907–09 expedition. Lieutenant Edward Evans, who had been the navigating officer on Morning, the Discovery expedition's relief ship in 1904, was appointed Scott's second-in-command. <b>He</b> <b>abandoned</b> plans to mount his own expedition, and transferred his financial backing to Scott.|$|E
5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, <b>he</b> <b>abandoned</b> wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
