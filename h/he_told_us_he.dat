2500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{source said}} interrogations with Roof {{after his arrest}} determined he had been planning the attack for around six months, researched Emanuel AME Church, and targeted it because of its role in African-American history. One of the friends who briefly hid Roof's gun from him said, [...] "I don't think the church was his primary target because <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was going for the school. But I think he couldn't get into the school because of the security ... so I think he just settled for the church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} at him all the evening," [...] said Miss O'Callaghan, [...] "and Mrs. Conroy, too, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> {{lived on}} the island, and he invited us to come over there, and he would show us some good hunting. I suppose it must be quite a place." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{were in a}} club when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> {{and another}} person were {{involved}} in raping and murdering women... (Valenzuela, Víctor; 1999) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is in {{attendance}} on the duke, my lord," [...] Beorn said. [...] "We presented ourselves also at his tent, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> required no duty from us." ...|$|R
50|$|We met General Abacha at 02.00 hrs (2 a.m.) at his offices. Having heard <b>us</b> out, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> {{would reflect}} on what we had said and would respond to us before we left Nigeria.|$|R
60|$|Clarence {{was to be}} lodged with Peter, whose devotion {{would not}} extend to {{following}} us into barbarism, where, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>he</b> understood {{there was no such}} thing as a 'harea,' and master would have to kill his own mutton.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} of it," [...] Malchus said, [...] "nor, I suppose, did the others. Halcon was our leader, and we did as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us.</b> <b>He</b> thought the fires would keep them off. Who could have thought the beasts would have ventured to attack us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very glad to {{find you}} safe, sir," [...] said Ormond. [...] "We met the Blackfoot who peddles moccasins, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> had seen four men he thought were Stevens' gang heading for Carrington, so we pushed on {{as fast as we}} could. Perhaps if we three went on with rifles we might {{overtake}} them." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> {{suspected}} the Potomac River was the holiest in the world, since “you {{can take the}} dumbest sonofabitch {{and put him on}} the other side of that river and all of a sudden he becomes Good Will Hunting.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Alice; [...] "I am {{beginning}} to get anxious about Lawrence, and if Mr. Foster can tell us anything fresh, I ought to hear it. But I don't think he can. I believe <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> all <b>he</b> knew before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He will be {{out there}} himself, father. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> had for some little time been {{thinking}} of returning to Flanders, and that now he should do so at once. How was it, father, that the men-at-arms did not defend the Tower?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right in the side, {{just above}} the hip. I am afraid it is all up with him; the long journey, {{and the loss of}} blood, have pretty well done for any chance he might have had. Still we could not let him die like a dog, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was sure you would come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we were court-martialled to rights," [...] said Pritchard, [...] "but {{we should}} have been tried for murder if Boy Niven 'adn't been unusually tough. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> had an uncle 'oo'd give us land to farm. 'E said he was born at the back o' Vancouver Island, and all the time the beggar was a balmy Barnado Orphan!" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{to the two}} Indians, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> {{would see}} to it that they let us alone. He didn't think that Maiden's Heart would ever harm us, for he was more of a blower than {{anything}} else; but he said that Crowded Owl was really one of the worst-tempered Indians in the fort, and he advised us to have nothing more to do with him, in any way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{suggesting}} that we may meet Mr. Lessingham?" [...] Helen enquired, lazily. [...] "I am perfectly certain that he knows nothing of the equipment of the melodramatic spy. As to Zeppelins, don't you remember <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> hated them and was terrified of bombs." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{policeman}} left in {{the room}} was a big, thick-voiced, pompous man, with a horrible unfeeling pleasure in hearing himself talk before an assembly of frightened, silent people. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> how <b>he</b> had found her, {{as if he had been}} telling a story in a tap-room, and began with saying: [...] "I don't think the young woman was drunk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He had {{intended}} to conceal his knowledge," [...] Ben Ibyn went on, [...] "which would have been politic; but when he found that my intentions were kind, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> knew our tongue, and now revealed his knowledge, as {{he thought it would}} be dishonourable to listen to our talk, leaving us under the impression that he could not understand us." ...|$|R
6000|$|APRIL 14. John Alphonsus Mulrennan {{has just}} {{returned}} from the west of Ireland. European and Asiatic papers please copy. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish. Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd seen {{a case of}} sarkie before; so {{when the}} skin peeled off his feet, and he stopped sneezing, I knew he'd live. He was bad, though; lay like a log for a week while Imam Din and I massaged the {{paralysis}} out of him. Then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was a Hajji--had been three times to Mecca--come in from French Africa, and that he'd met the nigger by the wayside--just like a case of thuggee, in India--and the nigger had poisoned him. That seemed reasonable enough by what I knew of Coast niggers." ...|$|E
60|$|When we got down-stairs {{we found}} our cycles waiting ready at the door, {{together}} with the stable man and the stable boy and the boy's helper and the cook and the chambermaid and the waiters and the other servants, waiting for their tips. Mr. Poplington seemed in a fine humor, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> had heard the night before that {{there was to be}} a stag hunt that day, the first of the season. In fact, it was not one of the regular meets, but what they called a by-meet, and not known to everybody.|$|E
6000|$|... "His blood {{be on his}} own head," [...] said Yeo, [...] "He {{looked as}} wild a savage as the worst of them, more shame to him; and the ancient here had nigh cut off his arm before <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> who <b>he</b> was: and then, your worship, having a price upon his head, and like to bleed to death too--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> {{had been}} {{prospecting}} and mining in Arizona {{part of the}} time since the war; and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied. As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>’e</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> ’ow <b>he</b> {{was sitting}} washing ’is shirt in a ditch, when he ’eard a snuffling noise {{and saw the}} ’ead of a big tiger {{sticking}} through the hedge the other side. He left ’is shirt and ran, and ’e said that, fortunately, the tiger stopped to tear the shirt to pieces, else ’is last hour would ’ave arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Seegrave began, {{as you may}} remember, {{by setting}} a guard on the women's bedrooms; and the women all {{followed}} him up-stairs in a rage, {{to know what he}} meant by the insult he had put on them. I went with the rest, because if I had done anything different from the rest, Mr. Seegrave was the sort of man who would have suspected me directly. We found him in Miss Rachel's room. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't have a lot of women there; and he pointed to the smear on the painted door, and said some of our petticoats had done the mischief, and sent us all down-stairs again.|$|E
60|$|Synge {{was always}} ready to go {{anywhere}} with one, and when there to enjoy what came. He went with me to see an ordinary melodrama at the Queen's Theatre, Dublin, and he delighted {{to see how the}} members of the company could by the vehemence of their movements and the resources of their voices hold your attention on a play where everything was commonplace. He enjoyed seeing the contrite villain of the piece come up {{from the bottom of the}} gulch, hurled there by the adventuress, and flash his sweating blood-stained face up against the footlights; and, though <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> had but a few short moments to live, roar his contrition with the voice of a bull.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, don't {{get angry}} about it, and I {{will tell you}} how it happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him. He was {{perfectly}} open and honorable about Meg, for <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so young." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Elinor, most feelingly {{sensible}} {{of every}} fresh circumstance {{in favour of}} Lucy's veracity; [...] "I remember <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> that <b>he</b> had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth." [...] She remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to their names.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he {{had read}} the envelope, [...] "if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit {{home at the end}} of next month, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife." [...] He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was {{redirected}} to be promptly sent on to Angel.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> then <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> {{thought it}} would not be an {{unprofitable}} adventure if, before we set forward, and after we had got a stock of provisions, we should make a journey north {{to the edge of the}} desert <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> of, from whence our negroes might bring every one a large elephant's tooth, and that he would get some more to assist; and that, after a certain length of carriage, they might be conveyed by canoes to the coast, where they would yield a very great profit.|$|R
6000|$|She {{handed him}} the paper, folded to the column which she wished to show, {{and he took it}} between two finger-tips, so as to soil it as little as possible, and stood reading it. She went on saying, [...] "He wouldn't be on the train if he was at Ponkwasset; I got the paper when I first came down stairs, but I didn't happen to read the account till just now; and then I thought I'd run out and see what father said to you about where he was going. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was going to the Mills, too, and--" [...] Her voice growing more and more wistful, died away in the fascination of {{watching}} the fascination of Elbridge as he first took in the half-column of scare-heads, and then followed down to the meagre details of the dispatch eked out with double-leading to cover space.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Home," [...] {{the colonel}} said, [...] "Hector Campbell is a proof {{that even in}} France merit will make its way. That Turenne should have taken a fancy {{to him in the}} first place was fortunate. But Turenne would surely not have {{promoted}} him to be a captain within three or four months of his joining except for the marked bravery and diligence that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> displayed at Turin; and I have no doubt that when we hear the particulars we shall find that this promotion now has been equally well deserved, for certainly Enghien is not likely to have gone out of his way to promote one altogether a stranger to him when he had so many young nobles round him, personal friends of his own, belonging to families whom he would wish to oblige. Of course you will, as one of the bearers of despatches, attend at the court this evening, Campbell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Kelley," [...] {{began the}} girl, [...] "I {{must tell you}} that I don't believe my brother has a thing to do with this mine except to divide the profits. Furthermore, you are trying to cover {{something}} up from me. You're doing it very well, but you've made one or two little 'catches' which have disturbed me. My brother has never mentioned you or Hank in his letters, and that's unnatural. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was interested in a mine which was paying one hundred and fifty dollars a month. Now, why did he say that? I'll tell you why. It's because you pay him a salary and he's not really a partner." [...] She paused to watch his face, then went on. [...] "Now what does he do--what can he do to earn five dollars per day? His palms are as soft as silk--the only callous is on his right forefinger." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Our {{departed}} teacher insistently exhorted us to forsake our homes, {{to scatter}} far and wide, in quest {{of the promised}} Beloved... Regarding {{the features of the}} Promised One, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>He</b> is of a pure lineage, is of illustrious descent, and of the seed of Fatimah. As to His age, He is more than twenty and less than thirty. He is endowed with innate knowledge. He is of medium height, abstains from smoking, and is free from bodily deficiency." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "General Mathieson," [...] Mr. Halstead went on, [...] "was only in {{our office}} {{a minute or two}} on that occasion, but of course that was {{sufficient}} for us to recognize him when <b>he</b> called again. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> desired <b>us</b> to draw out a will, and that as he had determined to appoint Mr. Pettigrew one of his trustees and guardian to his heir, he thought it as well to employ another firm to draw up the will.|$|R
60|$|To {{put an end}} to the matter, we went upstairs, {{and asked}} the traffic superintendent, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>he</b> had just met a man, who said he had seen it at number three platform. We went to number three platform, but the {{authorities}} there said that they rather thought that train was the Southampton express, or else the Windsor loop. But they were sure it wasn’t the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn’t they couldn’t say.|$|R
