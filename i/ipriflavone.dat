OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of oral <b>ipriflavone</b> on prevention of postmenopausal bone loss and to assess the safety profile of long-term treatment with <b>ipriflavone</b> in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4 -year study conducted in 4 centers in Belgium, Denmark, and Italy from August 1994 to July 1998. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred seventy-four postmenopausal white women, aged 45 to 75 years, with bone mineral densities (BMDs) of less than 0. 86 g/cm(2). INTERVENTIONS: Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive <b>ipriflavone,</b> 200 mg 3 times per day (n = 234), or placebo (n = 240); all received 500 mg/d of calcium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy measures included spine, hip, and forearm BMD and biochemical markers of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline corrected for creatinine and urinary CrossLaps [Osteometer Biotech, Herlev, Denmark] corrected for creatinine), assessed every 6 months. Laboratory safety measures and adverse events were recorded every 3 months. RESULTS: Based on intent-to-treat analysis, after 36 months of treatment, the annual percentage change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine for <b>ipriflavone</b> vs placebo (0. 1 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), - 7. 9 % to 8. 1 %] vs 0. 8 % [95 % CI, - 9. 1 % to 10. 7 %]; P =. 14), or in any of the other sites measured, did not differ significantly between groups. The response in biochemical markers was also similar between groups (eg, for hydroxyproline corrected for creatinine, 20. 13 mg/g [95 % CI, 18. 85 - 21. 41 mg/g] vs 20. 67 mg/g [95 % CI, 19. 41 - 21. 92 mg/g]; P =. 96); urinary CrossLaps corrected for creatinine, 268 mg/mol (95 % CI, 249 - 288 mg/mol) vs 268 mg/mol (95 % CI, 254 - 282 mg/mol); P =. 81. The number of women with new vertebral fracture was identical or nearly so in the 2 groups at all time points. Lymphocyte concentrations decreased significantly (500 /microL (0. 5 x 10 (9) /L]) in women treated with <b>ipriflavone.</b> Thirty-one women (13. 2 %) in the <b>ipriflavone</b> group developed subclinical lymphocytopenia, of whom 29 developed it during <b>ipriflavone</b> treatment.

The group 1 rats underwent sham operation. Bone histomorphometry, performed on the ectocranial periosteum of parietal bones, showed that absolute erosion boundary, absolute eroded area, absolute erosion depth, number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive polinucleated osteoclasts, and number of TRAP-positive mononucleated cells decreased in ipriflavone-treated rats compared with group 2 rats. The reduction was roughly proportional to the increase of drug dosage and reached statistical significance in rats of groups 5 and 6. The same parameters were extremely low in group 1 rats.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} pattern of {{biochemical}} markers of bone metabolism and vertebral bone mineral density in early postmenopausal women treated with combined <b>ipriflavone</b> and low dose conjugated estrogens. METHODS: Bone biochemical markers and vertebral bone density were evaluated in a longitudinal, comparative, 2 year study conducted in postmenopausal women treated with sole calcium supplementation (500 mg/day), or with either <b>ipriflavone</b> (IP) at the standard dose (600 mg/day) plus the same calcium dose, low dose conjugated estrogens (CE) (0. 3 mg/day) plus calcium, or low dose IP (400 mg/day) plus low dose CE (0. 3 mg/day) plus calcium. The results were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance, as appropriate. RESULTS: No modifications of both urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and plasma osteocalcin levels were observed in calcium and in CE-treated women, while vertebral bone density significantly decreased (P < 0. 0001) in both groups. In IP or IP + CE-treated women, plasma osteocalcin did not show any modification, while urinary hydroxyproline showed a significant (P < 0. 05) decrease, that paralleled a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in vertebral bone density. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal IP administration, at the standard dose of 600 mg/day, can prevent the increase in bone turnover and the decrease in bone density that follow ovarian failure.

40|$|Biodegradable {{plastics}} are {{an interesting}} class of drug carriers for controlled release, as they can decompose to nontoxic, readily bioresorbable products and are advantageous over conventional biomaterials {{because they do not}} require surgical retrieval from the body after completion of treatment. In this work, films of poly(D,L-lactic acid) (D,L-PLA) were deposited by the solvent casting technique, onto the surfaces of stainless steel plates and their biodegradation was studied after immersion in buffer solutions. The release of two model drugs, i. e. guaifenesin and <b>ipriflavone,</b> from the above D,L-PLA systems loaded with these compounds at various concentrations, was also studied. The experimental results showed that for low drug concentrations, the release of guaifenesin is controlled by the biodegradation rate of PLA, whereas for high concentrations the burst effect becomes the dominant release mechanism. The rate of release is faster at low pH values probably due to an acceleration of PLA biodegradation, whereas there are no chemical interactions between drug and polymer, that could essentially influence the release rate of the drug or the biodegradation of the polymer. On the other hand, high guaifenesin concentrations produce increased porosity in the PLA matrix and seem to accelerate its biodegradation and further the drug release rate. Finally, the release of <b>ipriflavone</b> in a mixture of 2 -propanol/water is clearly a two stage process and, again, the burst effect seems to control the delivery process at high drug concentration. In conclusion, the present study shows that similar results to those obtained With D,L-PLA tablets loaded with model drugs can be obtained with thin coatings of the same systems. This might be of interest for transfer of the existing knowledge to the design of biomedical implants, treated with coatings Of D,L-PLA containing reactive compounds. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a influência das combinações: bifosfonato (alendronato de sódio) + estatina (atorvastatina cálcica), bifosfonato (alendronato de sódio) + flavonóide (ipriflavona) e estatina (atorvastatina cálcica) + flavonóide (ipriflavona) em ratas com osteoporose induzida pelo glicocorticóide dexametasona. As influências das associações dessas substâncias foram pesquisadas pela análise de testes dos marcadores bioquímicos de remodelação óssea, tais como, cálcio e fósforo sérico, fosfatase alcalina óssea e por exames histomorfométricos, caracterizando a densidade trabecular óssea. Através da avaliação da densidade trabecular óssea foi possível verificar o aumento da mesma em todos os tratamentos efetuados. Ressaltando-se, ainda, que as associações contendo alendronato de sódio apresentaram elevadas taxas de restauração tecidual óssea, alcançando valores superiores aos do grupo dos animais normais. Os marcadores bioquímicos não apresentaram resultados estatisticamente significativos, não fornecendo subsídios para o diagnóstico e acompanhamento da osteoporose. No entanto, a avaliação histomorfométrica permitiu a análise estática e dinâmica, bem como detecção de alterações teciduais na unidade metabólica óssea, particularmente, no osso trabecular. The {{objective}} of this work was to study {{the influence of the}} combinations: biphosphonate (alendronate of sodium) + statin (calcic atorvastatin), biphosphonate (sodium alendronate) + flavonoid (<b>ipriflavone)</b> and statin (calcic atorvastatin) + flavonoid (<b>ipriflavone)</b> in female rats with osteoporosis induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The influence of the combinations of those drugs was observed through tests of the biochemical markers of bone remodeling, such as, levels of serum calcium and phosphorus and bone alkaline phosphatase and through histomorphometric exam, visualizing the bone trabecular density. Through the evaluation of the bone trabecular density it was possible to verify the clear increase in any group of treated animals. The combinations with biphosphonate presented high rates of bone tissue restoration, reaching higher values than those of normal animals. The results obtained with biochemical markers were not statistically significant and did not subsidies the diagnosis and the follow of the osteoporosis. However, the histomorphometric evaluation allowed us the static and dynamic analyses as well as detection of tissue alterations in the bone metabolic unit, particularly in the trabecular bone...|$|E
40|$|Current {{therapeutic}} {{approaches to}} postmenopausal bone loss or established osteoporosis vary widely {{among the different}} regions of the world. Because no treatment of osteoporosis has unequivocally demonstrated full prevention of the appearance or the recurrence of axial or peripheral fractures so far, many investigational compounds are being developed. Anabolic steroids act mainly as inhibitors of bone resorption with very few, if any, effects on bone formation. Because of the high occurrence of signs of virilization and the weak effects on bone structure, the risk/benefit ratio in osteoporosis should be considered at least problematic. If ongoing large-scale trials confirm the expected benefits of estrogen antagonist/agonists on the skeleton and confirm no cardiovascular risk to postmenopausal women with optimal uterine safety, these substances are likely to become the most prominent alternative to hormonal replacement therapy after the menopause. Additional studies are requested to evaluate the potential benefit of growth hormone or insulin-like growth factors in treatment of osteoporosis. <b>Ipriflavone</b> acts predominantly as an inhibitor of bone resorption. To confirm the efficacy of <b>ipriflavone</b> on the prevention of vertebral fractures and its effects on bone mineral density in women with postmenopausal established osteoporosis, a large multicentric European study is being conducted. Treatment with parathyroid peptides induces a significant gain in bone mass, mainly in the axial skeleton. Long-term studies that compare peptides, doses, and regimes are needed to better understand the exact position of parathyroid peptides as treatment of osteoporosis. Prolonged administration of strontium to postmenopausal osteoporotic women resulted in a decoupling between bone resorption and formation that yielded {{a significant increase in the}} lumbar spine bone mineral density of treated subjects. In the view of these promising results and of the excellent tolerance of strontium during preliminary trials, additional investigations of this compound in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis should be promptly initiated. Several other compounds have been punctually suggested for treatment of osteoporosis or are at very early stages of development. Finally, besides pharmacologic approaches to the treatment of osteoporosis, hip fractures may also be reduced by the use of hip protectors. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} years, {{there has been}} a {{multiplication}} of drugs identified as candidates for use in the prevention or the treatment of osteoporosis. When treating established osteoporosis, the objective is to prevent further skeletal deterioration, improve bone mass and/or bone microarchitecture to provide a documented reduction of the risk of vertebral and/or peripheral fractures. Calcium and vitamin D {{have been shown to be}} particularly efficient in elderly patients, mainly to prevent non-vertebral fractures. By inhibiting osteoclastic activity, calcitonin improves bone mineral density at all sites. Preliminary results suggest that it might also decrease vertebral fracture rates. Bisphosphonates have been investigated for 20 years in the treatment of osteoporosis. Alendronate was shown to reduce spinal and extravertebral fractures. New formulations of fluoride, like monofluorophosphate appear to be particularly beneficial in women with mild to moderate osteoporosis. Several new compounds, including parathormone, strontium salts, <b>ipriflavone</b> or others are currently developed and subject to large investigational programs to demonstrate their ability to reduce fracture.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar os efeitos da ipriflavona durante a fetogênese, já que não foram encontrados estudos visando avaliar seu efeito durante este período. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizadas 60 ratas prenhes, distribuídas aleatoriamente em quatro grupos (n= 15). G-controle (1 mL de água destilada) e três grupos tratados com ipriflavona, via intragástrica, do 16 º ao 20 º dia pós-coito (PC) : G- 300 (300 mg/kg), G- 1500 (1. 500 mg/kg) e G- 3000 (3. 000 mg/kg). Os animais foram pesados e sacrificados no 21 º dia por exsanguinação total sob anestesia (xilazina (10 mg/kg) e quetamina (90 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal. Foi realizado hemograma completo e dosagens séricas de colesterol, triglicérides, AST, ALT, ureia, creatinina e glicose das ratas prenhes. Após laparotomia foram removidos e pesados fígado, rim, suprarrenais, baço e ovários; os fetos e placentas foram pesados obtendo-se o peso médio das ninhadas. Quatro fetos (dois machos e duas fêmeas) por mãe foram aleatoriamente designados para obter-se o comprimento e peso de cérebro, fígado, rins e pulmões. Para a análise estatística utilizou-se o teste ANOVA seguido do teste de Dunnet; para dados não homocedásticos e sem distribuição normal, foi usado o teste de Kruskal-Wallis, seguido de Mann-Whitney; as proporções foram analisadas pelo teste do &# 967;² (p PURPOSE: Evaluate {{the effects}} of <b>ipriflavone</b> during fetogenesis, since no studies have been {{conducted}} to assess its effect during this period. METHODS: 60 pregnant rats were divided randomly into four groups (n= 15). G-control (1 mL of distilled water) and three groups treated intragastrically with <b>ipriflavone</b> from the 16 th to the 20 th post coitus (PC) day: G- 300 (300 mg/kg), G- 1, 500 (1, 500 mg/kg) and G- 3, 000 (3, 000 mg/kg). The animals were weighed, anaesthetized intraperitoneally with xylazine and ketamine at doses of 180 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, and sacrificed by total exsanguination on the 21 st day. A complete blood count was performed and serum cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, urea, creatinine, and glucose were determined in pregnant rats. After laparotomy, the liver, kidneys, adrenals, spleen and ovaries were removed and weighed; fetuses and placentas were also weighed to obtain the average weight of the litters. Four fetuses (two males and two females) were chosen at random for the determination of the length and weight of brain, liver, kidneys and lungs. Statistical analysis: ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. For raw data without normal distribution and homoscedasticity, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney test. Proportions were analyzed by the &# 967;² test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Triglyceride levels (mg/dL) were: Control-G (138. 8 ± 21. 8), G- 300 (211. 2 ± 63. 9) G- 1, 500 (251. 5 ± 65. 2) G- 3, 000 (217. 7 ± 49. 6); p< 0. 05. The body weight of fetuses (g) was: G-Control (male 3. 3 ± 0. 3; female 3. 1 ± 0. 3), G- 300 (male 3. 4 ± 0. 2; female 3. 1 ± 0. 4), G- 1, 500 (male 3. 5 ± 0. 3; female 3. 2 ± 0. 3), G- 3, 000 (male 3. 4 ± 0. 5; female 3. 1 ± 0. 4). CONCLUSION: <b>Ipriflavone</b> did not cause maternal toxicity, but increased triglyceride levels and reduced hematocrit at higher doses. The body and organ weights of the fetuses did not change with dam treatment. There were no external malformations or fetal deaths...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{clinical}} evidence {{available for the}} treatment of menopausal symptoms with alternative and complementary medicine. Methods: The MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE and COCHRANE electronic databases for the years 1980 – 2002 were searched for articles concerning soy products, black cohosh, dong quai, acupuncture, ginseng and evening primrose oil. Studies pertaining to menopausal vasomotor symptoms, lipid profiles and bone mineral densities of postmenopausal women were included. The data from clinical trials were reviewed. Results: Soy isoflavones slightly decrease total cholesterol and LDL levels. The clinical significance of this small change is yet to be determined. The synthetic isoflavone derivative <b>ipriflavone</b> increases bone mineral density in healthy peri‐ and postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral densities. Although earlier reports have claimed that soy is beneficial for the improvement of vasomotor symptoms, recent data do not support this claim. There are insufficient data on the other alternative therapies for treating menopausal symptoms at this time. Conclusion: Alternative and complementary medicine {{may play a role in}} the management of menopause, however, well‐designed large studies are still needed...|$|E
40|$|More than 25 % of {{postmenopausal}} women {{are at risk}} of osteoporosis. In order to avoid its consequences, it is necessary to find an appropriate prevention and/or treatment. We studied: (1) 15 {{postmenopausal women}} treated with percutaneous estradiol (50 micrograms/ 24 h) plus MPA (10 mg/ 10 days/month); (2) 15 postmenopausal women treated with synthetic calcitonin nasal spray at the daily dose of 100 IU; (3) 10 postmenopausal women treated with nandrolone decanoate (50 mg every 3 weeks); (4) 10 postmenopausal women treated with <b>ipriflavone</b> (600 mg/day); and (5) 10 postmenopausal women treated with sodium fluoride (20 mg) plus calcium (600 mg). Clinical examination, bone mass measurement (total BMD), hematochemical and urinary parameters of bone metabolism (calcium, urinary hydroxyproline, PTH) and growth factors (as IGF-I and TNF-beta) were evaluated. After 6 months of therapy, a complete prevention of bone resorption was achieved. In agreement with current literature, we observed that the various therapeutic approaches have all some positive effect on BMD, with different results on pain, blood biochemical parameters and growth factors' concentrations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTestosterone 5 α-reductase inhibitors {{represent}} important therapeutic {{drugs for}} use against androgen-dependent {{diseases such as}} benign prostatic hyperplasia, male pattern baldness, and acne. We have searched for inhibitors of rat prostate testosterone 5 α-reductase in the cultured broths of many kinds of soil bacteria, and have found that cultured soybean-casein digest broths of certain bacterial strains have a potent inhibitory effect on the enzyme. We tested 10 selected isoflavonoids, including isoflavones and O-methylated isoflavones, for inhibitory effects on rat prostate testosterone 5 α-reductase to determine the important structural elements for inhibition of the enzyme. Genistein, biochanin A, equol, and 3 ′, 4 ′, 7 -trihydroxyisoflavone showed considerably higher inhibitory effects whereas daidzein, formononetin, glycitein, prunetin, <b>ipriflavone,</b> and 4 ′, 7 -dimethoxyisoflavone showed lower inhibitory effects. The IC 50 values of genistein, biochanin A, equol, 3 ′, 4 ′, 7 -trihydroxyisoflavone, and riboflavin, a positive control, for rat prostate testosterone 5 α-reductase were 710  μm, 140  μm, 370  μm, 690  μm, and 17  μm, respectively.

40|$|Complementary {{medicine}} {{has become an}} increasing area of interest for patients and researchers around the world. The utilization {{of some of these}} therapies by many individuals makes it imperative to understand if they have a role in cancer or other disease treatment. Soy products have generated a large interest because a variety of laboratory and epidemiologic research suggests these items {{may play a role in}} the prevention of prostate cancer. Clinical trials are addressing this issue and whether or not these products could also improve prognosis of prostate cancer. Additionally, other soy-based capsules (<b>ipriflavone)</b> have received some research, but the largest clinical study to date does not support the use of these supplements to reduce hot flashes and/or osteoporosis risk. Dietary fat reduction to prevent prostate cancer is supported by numerous case-control studies over the past 25 years. However, recent prospective studies suggest that fat reduction may not play a strong role in prevention of prostate carcinoma. Soy products and fat reduction may have a symbiotic relationship. Any healthy lifestyle or dietary change should be encouraged, because it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is still the number one cause of mortality...|$|E
