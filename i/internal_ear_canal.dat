40|$|In {{the paper}} the author proposes a novel {{approach}} to design customised shells for hearing aids by means of techniques of virtual prototyping, used today in several fields of medicine. Digital technology is providing the technical platform to eliminate {{the need to take}} an ear impression, replacing the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> of a patient with a digital scan, but at present on the market there are still not systems able to perform in vivo scans of the human <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Starting from CT (Computed Tomography) data of the external ear, adopting the powerful and quite easy to automate NURBS (Non Uniform Rational B-spline) modelling tools available in the commercial Rhinoceros® CAD system, the author uses a straightforward modelling procedure that by means of VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) tools, allows obtaining automatically and quickly the accurate CAD solid model of the customised hearing aid shell. Having the CAD model, then, it is possible to view and modify the shape in the three-dimensional space and so to design innovative acoustic prostheses completely <b>internal</b> to the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> to which they perfectly fit. Moreover, the procedure followed in the paper, will allow, analysing the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> changes in response to normal jaw motion, to design the best shape of the hearing aid shell...|$|R

40|$|A {{five year}} old female spayed Cocker Spaniel {{presented}} {{with a history of}} chronic otitis externa. Initial diagnostics revealed bilateral stenotic and calcified <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> Because the right <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> was slightly more stenotic than the left, the total <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO) was performed on the right ear first. The animal recovered well from the procedure. Otitis externa is an inflammatory process of the externa ear, and {{it is one of the}} most common diseases seen in small animal practice. The causes of otitis externa are numerous and often categorized into predisposing factors, primary causes, secondard causes, and perpetuating factors. For chronic otitis externa cases that respond poorly to medical therapy or neoplasia within the <b>ear</b> <b>canals,</b> surgical treatment may be accomplished via lateral <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> resection, vertical canal ablation, or total <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ablation. Total <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ablation is warranted to patients with end-stage chronic otitis externa non-responsive to medical treatment, failed lateral or vertical <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> resection, neoplasia within horizontal <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and stenotic/calcified <b>ear</b> <b>canals...</b>|$|R
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is called the concha. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|R

This type is {{characterized}} by a minimal amount of effect on the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> resonances, as it traditionally leaves the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting {{in the middle of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small plastic case behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Inside the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.|$|R
40|$|Purpose The role of <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> in {{transmitting}} blast {{waves to}} the brain is not clear. The goal of this work is to characterize the influence of <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> on blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury through a computational approach. Methods A three-dimensional human head model with single-side <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> details was reconstructed from computed tomography images. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> was positioned either facing the incident blast wave or facing away from the blast wave. Results The blast wave-head interaction has demonstrated that the overpressure within the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> was substantially amplified when the ear directly faced the blast wave. When it faced away from the blast wave, the overpressure within the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> was less than the actual incident blast pressure. Regardless of the substantial pressure differences within the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> induced by the blast wave, the resulting intracranial pressures were almost the same for both cases. Conclusions The blast wave-head interaction has demonstrated {{that the role of}} the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> in brain dynamics, and thus brain injury, was negligible. However, the peak overpressure within the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> exceeded the documented tympanic membrane rupture and inner ear damage thresholds. This was speculated to cause the degeneration of axons along the auditory pathway up to the midbrain. This work provided fundamental understanding o...|$|R
25|$|Even without {{exposure}} to water, {{the use of}} objects such as cotton swabs or other small objects to clear the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is enough to cause breaks in the skin, and allow the condition to develop. Once {{the skin of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is inflamed, external otitis can be drastically enhanced by either scratching the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> with an object, or by allowing water to remain in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> for any prolonged length of time.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{condition}} of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and the surgical technique used, the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> may require several weeks to several months to heal.|$|R
50|$|Irritation {{from cold}} {{wind and water}} {{exposure}} causes the bone surrounding the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> to develop lumps of new bony growth which constrict the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Where the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is actually blocked by this condition, water and wax can become trapped and give rise to infection. The condition is so named due to its prevalence among cold water surfers. Warm water surfers are also at risk for exostosis due to the evaporative cooling caused by wind {{and the presence of}} water in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{occlusion}} effect {{occurs when}} an object fills the outer {{portion of a}} person's <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and that person perceives [...] "hollow" [...] or [...] "booming" [...] echo-like sounds of their own voice. It is caused by bone-conducted sound vibrations reverberating off the object filling the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> When talking or chewing, these vibrations normally escape through an open ear canal; most people are unaware of their existence. When the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is blocked, the vibrations are reflected back toward the eardrum. Compared to a completely open <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> the occlusion effect can boost low frequency (usually below 500 Hz) sound pressure in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> by 20 dB or more. This effect can be measured with a probe-tube microphone.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{efficacy}} of <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> flushing and <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and mouth swabbing methods for {{the isolation of}} mycoplasmas was investigated in 39 goats. Of the 19 goats positive for Mycoplasma spp., 14 (73. 7 %) were positive with the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> flushing method, 4 (21. 0 %) were positive with both <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> flushing and mouth swabbing methods, and 1 (5. 3 %) was positive by the mouth swabbing method. Mycoplasma arginini, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides, and M. mycoides subsp. capri were inhibition tests. Previous reports on the isolation of M. the literature. Research conducted in the last 2 decades have shown that clinically normal goats often harbor several species of mycoplasmas {{in association with the}} ear mites Rail-lietia caprae and Psoroptes cuniculi, 3, 4, 6 parasites found in the external <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> of domestic animals.

50|$|Excessive {{body hygiene}} of the <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> {{can result in}} {{infection}} or irritation. The <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> require less body hygiene care than {{other parts of the}} body, because they are sensitive, and the body system adequately cares for these parts. Most of the time the <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out. Attempts to clean the <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> through the removal of earwax can actually reduce <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.Excessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can also adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin. For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{equivalent}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume {{ranges from}} 0. 3 ml to 1. 0 ml {{in children and}} from 0. 65 to 1. 75 ml in adults. In subjects with chronic otitis media these values can be different, according to the disease status. Aim: To study the equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume in 52 ears of patients with chronic otitis media with and without active infection. Study design: clinical prospective with transversal cohort. Material and Method: The equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume was obtained from 52 ears diagnosed with chronic otitis media with and without active infection and in age and gender matched control group. The study group with active infection was evaluated before and after clinical treatment. Results: Equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume mean for the studied groups with and without infection and {{for the control group}} was 2. 86 ml; 1. 42 ml and 0. 80 ml, respectively. The equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume mean for the study group with infection prior and post clinical treatment was 1. 42 ml and 1. 82 ml, respectively. Conclusions: The Equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume mean was higher in patients with Chronic Otitis Media. We did not observe variation of equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume before and after clinical treatment...|$|R

40|$|A {{bacteriological}} {{study of}} the middle-ear effusions and the <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> in children with chronic serous otitis media (S. O. M.) was performed. Sixty-eight children (127 ears) were investigated. From this study it appeared that cleansing of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> with 0. 5 % chlorhexidine in 70 % ethanol for 30 s is partially effective; micro-organisms (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis) could still be isolated in 29 %. Cleansing of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> decreases the incidence of middle-ear fluid contamination by non-pathogenic <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> organisms (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus), but after cleansing, 'non-pathogenic' micro-organisms could still be isolated in 33 % of the effusions (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis). From 12 % of the middle-ear effusions pathogenic micro-organisms (Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus pneumoniae) were isolated; cleansing of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> did not influence this percentage. Anaerobics were not isolated from the middle-ear effusion...|$|R
40|$|Auditory {{brainstem}} response (ABR) peak {{measures were}} compared for a custom <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> electrode and traditional mastoid and ear lobe reference electrode sites {{with the assumption}} that the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> electrode would yield larger Wave I amplitudes. In this study, Waves I, III, and V latencies and amplitudes were measured and compared in twenty participants between the ages of 18 and 50, with particular interest in a potential Wave I advantage using the custom <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> reference electrode. The statistical analysis suggested that all reference electrode sites yielded comparable results with no statistical differences in peak latency or peak-to-trough amplitude for Waves I, III, and V. Although the custom <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> electrode did not produce larger Wave I amplitudes over the other two references, a deeper placement of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> electrode might have yielded different results...|$|R
5000|$|Cleaning of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> {{occurs as}} a result of the [...] "conveyor belt" [...] process of {{epithelial}} migration, aided by jaw movement. [...] Cells formed in the centre of the tympanic membrane migrate outwards from the umbo (at a rate comparable to that of fingernail growth) to the walls of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and move towards the entrance of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> The cerumen in the canal is also carried outwards, taking with it any particulate matter that may have gathered in the canal. Jaw movement assists this process by dislodging debris attached to the walls of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> increasing the likelihood of its expulsion.|$|R
25|$|Effective {{solutions}} for the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> include acidifying and drying agents, used either singly or in combination. When the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> skin is inflamed from the acute otitis externa, the use of dilute acetic acid may be painful.|$|R
50|$|They {{may cause}} {{irritation}} of the temporomandibular joint, {{which is located}} {{very close to the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> causing pain. Individually fitted non-elastic earplugs may be less likely to cause this irritation compared with foam ones that expand inside the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some earplugs are {{primarily}} {{designed to keep}} {{water out of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> especially during swimming and water sports. This type of earplug may be made of wax or moldable silicone which is custom-fitted to the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> by the wearer.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} advised {{not to use}} cotton swabs (Q-Tips or cotton buds), as doing so will likely push the wax farther down the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and if used carelessly, perforate the eardrum. Abrasion of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> particularly after water has entered from swimming or bathing, can lead to ear infection. Also, the cotton head may fall off and become lodged in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Therefore, cotton swabs should be used only to clean the external ear.|$|R

This type is {{characterized}} by a minimal amount of effect on the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> resonances, as it traditionally leaves the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting {{in the middle of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small plastic case behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Inside the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly vented acrylic tip holds the tube in place.This design is intended to reduce the occlusion effect. Conversely, because of the increased possibility of feedback, and because an open fit allows low frequency sounds to leak out of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> they are limited to moderately severe high-frequency losses.While the design approach is attractive to a general hearing aid user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's). This problem has been addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the hearing aid.|$|R
50|$|The {{sound waves}} enter the {{auditory}} canal, a deceptively simple tube. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> amplifies sounds that are between 3 and 12 kHz. At {{the far end}} of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is the tympanic membrane, which marks the beginning of the middle ear.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is a test}} of bone {{conduction}} and examines the effect of <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> on the hearing. A vibrating tuning fork {{is placed on the}} mastoid while the examiner alternately closes and opens the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> by pressing on the tragus inwards. A normal person or a person with sensorineural hearing loss hears louder when <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is occluded and softer when the canal is open (Bing Positive). A patient with conductive hearing loss will appreciate no change (Bing Negative) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{mathematical}} modelling methods are formulated {{in order to}} examine how sound pressures in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> interact with displacements on the eardrum. Existing finite-element code is altered and new code developed to deal with the acoustics of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and the mathematics of the fluid-structure interaction problem. A finite-element model of the human <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and eardrum using simplified geometry is developed as an initial approach to the coupled problem. The preliminary finite-element model consists of a cylindrical tube attached to a circular plate, with appropriate material properties assigned to each part. The coupled ear canal/eardrum problem is analyzed at several frequencies. Output is discussed in view of results obtained for eigenvalue analyses of both <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and eardrum as separate problems...|$|R
5000|$|... "In Ear" [...] {{headphones}} or earphones using balanced armature technology {{were launched}} in November 2007. These headphones use patented Contour Ear Gels, invented by Mark Blanchard of Klipsch Group, which are anatomically designed to accurately fit inside the human <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> These oval shaped silicone tips reduce ear fatigue by minimizing pressure {{to any one}} area of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> wall. The patented ear tips {{are designed to be}} inserted in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> to acquire an air seal for noise isolation and a proper frequency response.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{impedance}} {{measurements of}} the human <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> enable us to understand {{the function of the}} middle and the inner ear as well as to recognize possible dysfunctions. Additionally, the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> impedance is an important parameter which has {{to be taken into account}} when hearing aids are adjusted. Hearing aids for infants, children, and adults are all fitted using only a few standardized couplers (i. e. 2 ccm coupler (IEC 60126). The measurement of individual real-ear-to-coupler differences (RECD) is required since these couplers yield insufficient data as far as children are concerned. However, couplers suitable for different age groups can be developed for an improved fitting process if the knowledge about <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> impedances and the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volumes of infants and children is increased. Two different methods to obtain <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> impedances will be discussed in this article. The first one is a classic measurement technique in which a one-microphone-impedance probe is used. Different coupling techniques have been tested with regard to repeatability and measurement uncertainty. Later on, the impedance probe is tested on adults and on children. The second method is the simulation of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> impedance using FEM (Finite-Element-Method). The required CAD-models are generated with the help of CT-scans (computed tomography) of young children and adults...|$|R
