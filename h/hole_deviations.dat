40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} strategy for automatic control of the ITH percussive drilling process. Such automation would provide the benefits of improved productivity and quality in terms of penetration rate and <b>hole</b> <b>deviation,</b> as well as enhanced hole quality and machine life. Analysis of field data acquired from drilling experiments performed at INCO's Little Stobie Mine is presented. As {{a result of this}} analysis, a control algorithm is formulated to enhance the drilling process efficiency. This algorithm calculates the specific energy (SE) of the rock and adjusts the applied feed force based on this SE value, using a relationship obtained from the field data analysis. A model of the percussive drilling process is developed and simulated in software. The proposed control algorithm is tested through simulations on this simulated drilling process. The results of the simulation show a significant increase in efficiency of the drilling process. As a result of vibration data analysis it is concluded that vibration should be controlled through an improved design of the shock-absorber, rather than through drilling variables. A detailed shock-absorber test data analysis is therefore presented. Recommendations for design changes in the shock-absorber are also given. Deviation analysis is also presented in the thesis, which shows a poor correlation between the machine variables and the <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> data. Hence, it is recommended that deviation be controlled by steering. An innovative guided drilling mechanism for controlling the <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> is also proposed. This mechanism consists of an eccentric ITH percussive hammer with controlled rotational speed, which can be employed as an actuator to steer the drill string in a desired direction without using any down hole instrumentation.

40|$|Patients with {{deformed}} {{or missing}} ears {{try to hide}} their deformities and consequently {{their quality of life}} (QoL) may frequently be compromised. Ear reconstruction by means of autogenous or craniofacial implant-supported appliances may serve to improve QoL of this patient group. The hypothesis {{of the present study was}} that the use of CAD/CAM and rapid prototyping (RP) technology in the fabrication of implant-supported ear prostheses can improve their treatment outcomes and QoL. The over-all aims of the study were to develop innovative techniques using CAD/CAM and RP technology in the fabrication of implant-supported ear prostheses and provide improvement in the treatment outcomes and QoL of patients. The research project was performed with the aim of achieving innovation and advancement in scientific knowledge through the following approaches: 1. To compare the 3 D accuracy of image-guided drillings between Stryker (Nav II iNtellect Cranial, Stryker, Montreux, Switzerland) and BrainLAB (Kolibri Navigation Station 2. 0, BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany) Navigation systems and to assess the inter-operator variability. A custom-made acrylic resin block with attached fiducial markers was drilled by three operators to 6 mm depth of 10 drill holes guided by each navigation system. On comparison between the two systems, slight under-drilling was common for the Stryker system whereas slight over-drilling was common for BrainLAB. The drill <b>hole</b> <b>deviations</b> assessed in two planes found that more deviation occurred with the Stryker system. Inter-operator variability in drilling angles was more common with the Stryker system whereas BrainLAB was more consistent. In one operator, it appeared that there was a learning curve. 2. To present a new concept of visual axis maintenance in the fabrication of ear prostheses. This was shown in a hemifacial microsomia patient wearing spectacles by using a combination of computer planning and CAD/CAM technology. 3. To present an innovative method of integrating image planning and surgical navigation in performing simulation implant surgery on biomodels and the pre-fabrication of ear prostheses. 4. To evaluate the accuracy of surgical planning and implant installation on biomodels. The method was applied on 6 patients’ biomodels in prefabricating their ear prostheses. The accuracy of the surgical planning and the implant installation on the biomodels was considered having minimal deviation in drill depth, entry point in sagittal position and angulation in coronal and axial planes. 5. To present a new method of implant-supported prosthetic ear fabrication composing of a RP framework simulating the cartilage and covered by different thicknesses of silicone skin. 6. To evaluate the treatment outcomes of prosthetic auricular rehabilitation using surgical navigation in osseointegrated implant installation and prosthetic fabrication with CAD/CAM technology. A clinical series of 6 patients were sequentially recruited for prosthetic ear rehabilitation. It was demonstrated that implant-supported ear prosthesis could induce improvement in their QoL particularly in the domains of the body image, social interaction and mood. The primary insertion torque of the implants was high and hence all cases had achieved immediate implant loading.

Five of the planar-laminated sandstone samples have a grain imbrication 8 °, permitting specification of a unique flow direction rather than just the line-of-motion of the current. Both ripples and grain fabric point to unconfined flow toward the north-northeast. There is considerable spread in the data so that some paleoflow indicators point toward the northwest, whereas others point southeast.

The {{objective of this}} work was to investigate techniques that reduce the cost and increase the productivity of blasthole drilling. The focus is on a technology that uses a high pressure waterjet to assist the conventional rotary rock cutting action of a tricone drill bit. The potential benefits of this technique are increased productivity, reduced drill bit wear and reduced <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> and hence improved quality of drilling. This paper describes {{the results of a}} laboratory based experimental program comparing conventional tri-cone drilling performance to the proposed waterjet assisted approach. Additionally, work has been completed looking at the more practical issues around the collection and sampling of drill cuttings and water recovery (recycling) when drilling with a waterjet. These studies have demonstrated that waterjet assisted drilling can significantly increase the rate of penetration over conventional rotary drilling. For the best-case experimental result, the relative improvement was over 40 per cent. More importantly, it is a starting point for examining alternative uses of the additional drill productivity obtained from waterjet assisted drilling. For example, increased drill productivity could be used to improve rock fragmentation by drilling a tighter blasthole pattern in the same time period. an existing drill fleet, then the drill fleet size could be reduced, or improved rock fragmentation could be achieved by drilling a tighter blasthole pattern within the same time period...|$|R
40|$|Overbreak {{and damage}} to rock walls {{is one of}} the most serious {{problems}} encountered in blasting operations. Several techniques have been developed to control the undesirable effects of rock blasting. These techniques are collectively known as wall-control blasting methods. The stress distribution around pressurized holes has been numerically evaluated, in order to analyze the mechanism of wall-control blasting methods. The effect of blast geometry and the role of discontinuity on this stress field has also been studied in detail. The results obtained by numerical modelling have been verified by controlled blasting experiments, and further supported by analysis of existing roadcuts on a large scale. It was found that the mechanism of wall-control blast can be explained by the collision and superposition of the stresses between the holes. A narrow fracture zone between the holes was produced by tensile stresses on the centreline. It is neither necessary nor realistic to assume onset of fractures at the midpoint between holes by reinforcement of the stresses from each hole. The analysis shows that a burden can be defined as being infinite when the ratio of that to the spacing is greater than unity. For pre-split blasting (infinite burden) in an isotropic and homogeneous material the hole separation could range up to 15 borehole diameters. The decoupling ratio between the explosive charge and the borehole diameter should be smaller than 0. 5. This ratio would generally be between 0. 2 and 0. 3 for pre-splitting (infinite burden), and between 0. 3 and 0. 4 in the presence of a free face. A discontinuity parallel to the free face and located at the back of the holes causes high stress levels between the discontinuity and the boreholes, resulting is a shattered one in this region. The presence of a similar discontinuity at the front of the holes leads to considerable overbreak and development of an undamaged "hump" of rock between holes. The effect of a discontinuity oriented normal to the centreline at the midpoint between holes has minimal effect on the blast results. As the angle of the discontinuity with the free face decreases from 90 $ sp circ,$ the damage zone between the holes and the discontinuity increases, and the shape of the final wall changes from a smooth face to a corrugated shape. A closed-discontinuity or an open discontinuity cemented with strong filling materials has little effect on the results of the blast. However, as the width of the discontinuity increases, the size of the damage zone also increases. An open discontinuity, 50 mm wide or more, plays a role similar to a free face. In roadcut blast design, <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> is a key parameter in determining the quality of the face. However, consistent <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> in the same direction has minimal effect in the result of the blast. This type of deviation is usually associated with bedded rocks, with alternating bands of soft and hard rock on the face. The degree of deviation is dependent, amongst other factors, on orientation, thickness, frequency and the position of these bands...|$|R

This challenge appears to have being well examined in case of straight hole-angle (Belavadi and Chukwu 1994), {{but in the case of}} highly deviated and horizontal portions of the well, removal of drilled cuttings is still a major problem (Ismail et al. 2016). Also, when drilling in highly deviated and horizontal portions of the annulus, the cleaning of the well worsens with increasing well depth and <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> (Ismail et al. 2016; Onuoha et al. 2015; Gavignet and Sobey 1989). Application of this form of drilling system is in most cases linked with serious drilling problems which often affect the performance of drilling muds. High torque and drag, barite sag, formation damage, lost circulation, slow drilling rate, increased equivalent circulating density (ECD), kick leading to blowout if not properly controlled, hole instability, and in terrible situation, differential stuck pipe, are several of the problems faced while drilling in highly deviated or horizontal wells (Ismail et al. 2016; Onuoha et al. 2015; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ford et al. 1990). If these problems are not properly addressed, it can get worse and probably lead to well side tracking or even loss of the entire well (Gatlin 1960). Thus, appropriate design of drilled cuttings transport strategy, such as incorporating optimum drilling fluid properties with the best drilling practice is crucial to obtaining a successful drilling operation.|$|R

Because core recovery was poor, these images {{are essential to the}} understanding of the structural context within which this deep hole is drilled. Nearly 4500 traces of fractures were mapped over 167 m of images (26. 9 per m on average). The steep to nearly vertical structures that dominate throughout this interval are ori-ented mainly in a 015 °N strike direction, which is identical to the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) determined higher up in Hole 504 B from BHTV images. Two zones with intense horizontal fracturing are described (1920 - 1950 and 1975 - 2005 mbsf) from FMS images. Although the top one is also detected at a meter scale by deep-reaching electrical resistivity measurements, the bottom one is not. The top interval is also the site of a change in <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> (at 1950 mbsf), possibly in relation to a change in dike orientation or in structure of the stress field near the bottom of the hole. The large number of nearly vertical fractures reported from FMS images in this bottom section were probably induced in response to drilling. Particularly concentrated over a 70 -m-long interval (1975 - 2045 mbsf), these steep features coincide in azi-muthal direction with those of borehole enlargements. This might arise from tension-generated failures under a strike-slip and strongly deviatoric environment, as suggested also by modes of failure obtained in cores.

Even with the advances in drilling technology over the years it is still almost impossible. This is especially the case as the drilling depth increases. Drill <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> is affected {{by a variety of}} factors including drilling techniques such as weight on bit (WOB) or drill string diameter and rock properties such as density and crystal structure. It is important to study the deviation of the drill holes to ensure that the borehole is aligned correctly. When there is deviation within a boreholes major negative consequences can occur. This thesis describes the results from deviation measurements of drill holes from two different drifts within the ore body ”Alliansen” in the LKAB mine in Malmberget (MUJ). In the first drift, the production holes were drilled with a 115 mm drill bit, and in the second a drill bit of 105 mm.

40|$|During underground, long-hole {{drilling}} operations, the bending of {{the drill}} string and vibrations exert significant effects on <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> and penetration rates. Little {{research has been}} conducted {{in the area of the}} bending and vibrations associated with ITH (In - The - Hole) drills. This thesis deals with the modelling of the static and dynamic properties of the ITH drill system. The bending of the drill string is the result of the string becoming unstable. The critical length and feed force of the ITH drill string before being unstabilized and its characteristics after unstabilization are studied. By analyzing the static and dynamic properties of the drill string, a continuous system mathematical model has been developed. Two different boundary conditions have been discussed and applied through computer simulations. Measurements of downhole parameters and vibrations while drilling were acquired by a high-rate telemetry and data acquisition system from field tests of a CMS CD- 90 B long-hole ITH drill and prototype shock absorber in an underground nickel mine. Determining the inter-relationships between the drilling parameters and the vibrations is also a principal objective of the thesis. The performance of a prototype shock absorber developed by a third party company was also evaluated. The results of the simulations and analyses of the vibration data indicate that a prototype shock absorber effectively reduces the amplitude of the vibrations. A mathematical model using a complex boundary condition has been developed which will be of use in further research relating to the development of a vibration-based control system for ITH drills. By decreasing the vibration levels acting on the drill head and rod, the instrumentation for an automated drill can be protected to ensure maximum life and proper performance during hammer operation.

This objective was addressed through the drilling of well ER- 12 - 1 at N 886, 640. 26 E 640, 538. 85 Nevada Central Coordinates. Drilling of the 1094 m (3588 ft) well began on July 19, 1991 and was completed on October 17, 1991. Drilling problems included <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> and <b>hole</b> instability that prevented the timely completion of this borehole. Drilling methods used include rotary tri-cone and rotary hammer drilling with conventional and reverse circulation using air/water, air/foam (Davis mix), and bentonite mud. Geologic cuttings and geophysical logs were obtained from the well. The rocks penetrated by the ER- 12 - 1 drillhole are a complex assemblage of Silurian, Devonian, and Mississippian sedimentary rocks that are bounded by numerous faults that show substantial stratigraphic offset. The final 7. 3 m (24 ft) of this hole penetrated an unusual intrusive rock of Cretaceous age. The geology of this borehole was substantially different from that expected, with the Tongue Wash Fault encountered at a much shallower depth, paleozoic rocks shuffled out of stratigraphic sequence, and the presence of an altered biotite-rich microporphyritic igneous rock {{at the bottom of the}} borehole. Conodont CAI analyses and rock pyrolysis analyses indicate that the carbonate rocks in ER- 12 - 1, as well as the intervening sheets of Eleana siltstone, have been thermally overprinted following movement on the faults that separate them. The probable source of heat for this thermal disturbance is the microporphyritic intrusion encountered at the bottom of the hole, and its age establishes that the major fault activity must have occurred prior to 102. 3 + 0. 5 Ma (middle Cretaceous) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} of the in situ stress between 550 and 925 meters below seafloor in Hole 959 D has been derived from the analysis of caliper and electrical images of Formation MicroScanner data. Because of a high <b>hole</b> <b>deviation</b> (5 °- 13 °), drill pipe wear has enlarged the hole in a northerly direction. As a result, the four-arm caliper analyses cannot distinguish between mechanically and stress induced borehole elongations. The FMS data show {{that one of the}} principal stresses is parallel to the borehole axis and that mainly tensile wall fractures have formed in the borehole wall. The tensile wall fractures demonstrate a 168 ° ± 8 °N weighted mean {{orientation of}} the maximum horizontal stress. The upper 750 mbsf of the borehole comprises the majority of the tensile wall fractures, whereas they only occur sporadically below this depth. The change in the downhole distribution of fractures coincides with the transition from weaker to more compacted, stronger sedimentary rock. Furthermore, the integration of seismic and physical properties data suggests that this depth corresponds to the boundary between passive margin evolution and continent/ocean transform faulting. The {{orientation of the}} maximum horizontal stress in Hole 959 D is almost perpendicular to the east-west maximum horizontal stress orientation of the first-order stress province in western and north central Africa. Through comparisons with (1) the orientations of the maximum horizontal stress in Hole 959 D, (2) the maximum horizontal stress of three focal mechanisms from earthquakes in Ghana, and (3) the strike of the continental margin, it is suggested that lateral strength contrasts across the Côte d’Ivoire-Ghana Transform Margin are the most probable source for the observed stress orientations. It is further suggested that sediment loading and lateral variation in crustal thickness and density may only have a minor influence on the stress field in this area.

It is found that the number and width of the magnetic gaps decrease, and even disappear for large antidot filling fractions...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{observations}} of merging black holes by {{the instruments of}} the fledging gravitational wave astronomy has {{opened the way for}} testing the general relativistic Kerr black hole metric and, at the same time, for probing the existence of more speculative horizonless ultracompact objects. In this Letter we quantify the difference that these two classes of objects may exhibit in the post-merger ringdown signal. By considering rotating systems, we provide the first approximate calculation of the early ringdown frequency and damping time {{as a function of the}} body's multipolar structure. Using the example of a gravastar, we show that the main ringdown signal may differ as much as a few percent with respect to that of a Kerr black <b>hole,</b> a <b>deviation</b> that could be probed by near future Advanced LIGO/Virgo searches.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{temporal}} evolution of the percussion drilling process in deep laser drilling. Ultrashort laser pulses at 1030 nm and a duration of 8 ps were used to machine silicon while simultaneously imaging the silhouette of the hole using an illumination wavelength above the band edge. We investigate {{the influence of the}} processing parameters fluence and pulse energy on the depth and shape of the hole demonstrating different phases of the drilling process. In the first phase, a tapered hole is formed with highly reproducible shape and depth. In the following, the evolution of the hole shape is irregular and imperfections like bulges, changes of the drilling direction and the formation of multiple hole ends occur. In the final phase, the maximum depth stays constant while the volume still increases due to enlargement of the hole diameter and the possible formation of multiple <b>hole</b> ends. <b>Deviations</b> from the ideal hole shape occur primarily in {{the lower part of the}} hole. Their extent can be reduced by increasing the amount of applied pulse energy. Moreover, the pulse energy is chiefly determining the maximum achievable hole depth, which is largely independent of the focusing conditions and corresponding fluence...|$|R
40|$|S. I. Disorder {{analysis}} Uniformity {{and disorder}} in the fabricated photonic crystal lattice are analyzed with the method described in Ref. [S 1]. The edge detection algorithm employed {{to examine the}} image disorder quantification involves categorizing the image into holes and the substrate region. First, we normalize the image pixel to be distributed between 0 and 1. Then, each pixel of the image is compared to an optimum threshold parameter, which is chosen based on the histogram of the pixel value of the image. Figure S 1 shows one example high-resolution SEM image containing a sample photonic crystal lattice of 56 holes. A threshold value of 0. 3 is chosen, and the fitted hole centers and edge shapes are shown in the white dots and curves respectively. The hole radii are {{found to have a}} mean percent error of 3. 26 % and the root mean square (RMS) fit error of an edge from a perfect circle is computed statistically to be approximately 3. 5 nm. The RMS of the <b>hole</b> center <b>deviations</b> from a perfect lattice along the two principal directions (Figure S 1) are σx = 7. 7 S- 2 nm and σy = 2. 7 nm respectively. To study the roughness of features in the photonic crystal lattice, a fractal methodology was employed and the correlation length of 16. 8 nm was compute...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{waves on}} a fluid stream, in a de Laval nozzle, are shown to {{correspond}} to quasinormal modes emitted by black holes that are physical solutions in a quadratic curvature gravity with cosmological constant. Sound waves patterns in transsonic regimes at a laboratory are employed here to provide experimental data regarding generalized theories of gravity, comprised by the exact de Sitter-like solution and a perturbative solution around the Schwarzschildâde Sitter standard solution as well. Using the classical tests of General Relativity to bound free parameters in these solutions, acoustic perturbations on fluid flows in nozzles are then regarded, to study quasinormal modes of these black <b>holes</b> solutions, providing <b>deviations</b> of the de Laval nozzle cross-sectional area, {{when compared to the}} Schwarzschild solution. The fluid sonic point in the nozzle, for sound waves in the fluid, is shown to implement the acoustic event horizon corresponding to quasinormal modes.

40|$|We {{present results}} for models of neutron stars and strange stars {{constructed}} using the Hartle-Thorne slow-rotation method {{with a wide}} range of equations of state, focusing on the values obtained for the angular momentum J and the quadrupole moment Q, when the gravitational mass M and the rotational frequency Ω are specified. Building on previous work, which showed surprising uniformity in the behaviour of the moment of inertia for neutron-star models constructed with widely-different equations of state, we find similar uniformity for the quadrupole moment. These two quantities, together with the mass, are fundamental for determining the vacuum space-time outside neutron stars. We study particularly the dimensionless combination of parameters QM/J^ 2 (using units for which c=G= 1). This quantity goes to 1 in the case of a Kerr-metric black <b>hole</b> and <b>deviations</b> away from 1 then characterize the difference between neutron-star and black-hole space-times. It is found that QM/J^ 2 for both neutron stars and strange stars decreases with increasing mass, for a given equation of state, reaching a value of around 2 (or even less) for maximum-mass models, meaning that their external space-time is then rather well approximated by the Kerr metric. If QM/J^ 2 is plotter against compactness R/ 2 M (where R is the radius), it is found that the relationship is nearly unique for neutron-star models, independent of the equation of state, while it is significantly different for strange stars. This gives a new way of possibly distinguishing between them. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to MNRA...|$|R
40|$|This work investigates an upper-limit {{of charge}} {{for a black}} hole in a {{nonlinear}} Newtonian theory of gravity. The charge is accumulated via protons fired isotropically at the black hole. This theoretical study of gravity (known as `pseudo-Newtonian') is a forced merger of special relativity and Newtonian gravity. Whereas the source of Newton's gravity is purely mass, pseudo-Newtonian gravity includes effects of fields around the mass, giving a more complete picture of how gravity behaves. Interestingly, pseudo-Newtonian gravity predicts such relativistic phenomena as black <b>holes</b> and <b>deviations</b> from Kepler's laws, but of course, provides a less accurate picture than general relativity. Though less accurate, it offers an easier approach to understanding some results of general relativity, and merits interest due to its simplicity. The method of study applied here examines the predictions of pseudo-Newtonian gravity for a particle interacting with a highly charged black hole. A black hole with a suitable charge will reach an upper limit (expressed by pseudo-Newtonian gravity) in charge capacity before Coulomb's law repels like-charge particles away from the hole. In particular, this work attempts to push pseudo-Newtonian gravity to its extreme and discover how its results differ from general relativistic predictions involving the same proton bombardment. It is found that the results for an upper limit of charge in general relativity and this nonlinear theory of Newtonian gravity differ {{by a factor of}} four. This may give insight into the importance of space-time curvature effects on the description of particle dynamics around a black hole. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, to {{construct}} an airframe 2 -layer composite materials consisting of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates and TiAl 6 V 4 {{still need to be}} machined, whereby drill holes are frequently machined. Special attention has to be paid to the machining quality, which implies hole dimensional accuracy, defect free peripheral zone, edge quality at inlet and outlet of hole and so on. Machining defects often occur as a consequence of excessive mechanical and thermal loads, which are often caused by wrong process conditions or by the wrong choice of machining process itself. With respect to widely used state-of-the-art machine tools providing high performance and equipped with potent control unit, for the comparatively large drill hole, circular milling gains interest {{as an alternative to the}} drilling operation [1, 2]. In this research, in order to select suitable machining conditions for 2 -layer composite materials consisting of CFRP laminates and TiAl 6 V 4 a large number of circular milling tests of 6 mm diameter are executed by using a high performance vertical milling machine. <b>Hole</b> diameter <b>deviation</b> from 6 mm and inner surface roughness in relation to number of hole machined are measured and evaluated for CFRP laminates and TiAl 6 V 4. Moreover, from observations of cutting edges in relation to number of hole machined it is confirmed that under wrong machining conditions the difference of heat conductivity between CFRP laminates and TiAl 6 V 4 induces for chips of TiAl 6 V 4 to be deposited on the end cutting edges of endmill used. In this case tool life shortens extremely...|$|R
40|$|The spin of {{supermassive black}} holes could power jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN), {{although}} direct observational {{evidence for this}} conjecture is sparse. The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have long been observed to follow a linear correlation. If jet power is coupled to black <b>hole</b> spin, <b>deviations</b> from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN {{can be used to}} probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample. To exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST survey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II quasars with a median redshift of z= 1. 2 A tight correlation between the optical luminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We estimate that 5 - 20 % of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet power. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to environment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e. g., spin) contribute at most 0. 2 dex. Under the assumption that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0. 1 dex to the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading the horizon. If black hole spin determines the AGN jet efficiency, then our observations imply that all FR-II quasars have very similar spin. In addition, the quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain the radio-quiet population. The alternative, and perhaps more likely, interpretation of the tight jet-disk correlation is that black hole spin is not relevant for powering AGN jets.
