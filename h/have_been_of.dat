5|$|The {{history of}} chairs started In ancient Egypt chairs appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> great {{richness}} and splendour.

5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to}} as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E

5|$|A {{military}} {{organization called}} Kölpények {{is reported to}} have existed in Medieval Hungary during the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries. Hungarian scholars have proposed that the Kölpények were identical with the Kylfings/Kolbiagi. Hungarian sources regard the Kölpények as being of Scandinavian origin. They were hired by the early rulers of the House of Arpad, particularly Taksony of Hungary in the 950s, to serve as frontier guards. They fought with their Magyar employers alongside Sviatoslav I of Kiev against Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire. Alternatively, the Kölpények may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> Pecheneg origin, as there was a Pecheneg tribal group called Külbej during roughly the same period.|$|E
5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E

Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type of female deity).|$|E

5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Gareloi has an {{extensive}} eruptive history, {{dating back to}} at least 1760. At least 12 eruptions have occurred at the summit, accompanied by lava and pyroclastic flows. Typically they have been characterized by a central vent eruption followed by an explosive eruption, and sometimes a phreatic explosion. All <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 1 to 3. Such eruptions have occurred in 1790, 1791, 1792, 1873, 1922, April 1929, 1950, January 17, 1952, August 7, 1980, January 15, 1982, September 4, 1987, and August 17, 1989. Uncertain eruptions occurred in 1760, 1828, 1927, and 1996.|$|E
5|$|He {{had also}} {{continued}} to play chess, competing in the 1952 and 1956 Olympiads. This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky, since Britain and the USSR, which had been allies during World War II, were by then locked into the Cold War, and Milner-Barry's wartime codebreaking knowledge would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> great interest to the Soviets; {{the very fact that}} Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974, when Frederick Winterbotham's book The Ultra Secret was published. He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 (finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky), with a score of 8/11; this would be his best result in British Championships.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, {{with an increase in}} interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970.

5|$|Loetoeng Kasaroeng is a 1926 fantasy {{film from}} the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) which was {{directed}} and produced by L. Heuveldorp. An {{adaptation of the}} Sundanese folktale Lutung Kasarung (The Lost Lutung), the film tells {{of a young girl}} who {{falls in love with a}} magical lutung and stars the children of noblemen. Details on its performance are unavailable, although it is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> poor technical quality and thought to have performed poorly. It was the first film produced in the country and the first to feature a native-Indonesian cast. It is likely a lost film.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{site where}} {{historical}} records {{have been used}} to interpret sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E
5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} absent from another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>Of</b> the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E

5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.|$|E
5|$|The area {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>of</b> some {{importance}} in the early Christian period, {{as evidenced by the}} Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans Church, and now housed in the small museum there. The stones had been used in the building of the old church and many had been badly damaged. One of the stones, the 9th century Drosten Stone, has the distinction of being one of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text: 'DROSTEN: IREUORET TTFOR CUS', which has been interpreted in various ways, but it is thought to refer to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned between 839 and 842AD.|$|E
