500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat.

2500|$|While at {{the head}} of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the {{acquisition}} of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: [...] "Perhaps the easiest decision I ever made was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and the first thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> became chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million..." [...] American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wearing of}} skirts, kilts, or similar {{garments}} on an everyday basis by men in Western cultures {{is an extremely}} small minority. One manufacturer of contemporary kilt styles claims to sell over 12,000 such garments annually, resulting in over $2 million annually worth of sales, and has appeared at a major fashion show. According to a CNN correspondent: [...] "At Seattle's Fremont Market, men are often seen sporting the Utilikilt." [...] In 2003, US News said that [...] "... the Seattle-made utilikilt, a rugged, everyday riff on traditional Scottish garb, has leapt from idea to over 10,000 sold in just three years, via the Web and word of mouth alone." [...] "They've become a common sight around Seattle, especially in funkier neighbourhoods and at the city's many alternative cultural events. They often are worn with chunky black boots," [...] writes AP reporter Anne Kim. [...] "I actually see more people wearing kilts in Seattle than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lived in Scotland," [...] one purchaser remarked in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man.

I decided I had to stop, which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E

[...] "Better on the Other Sides"s lyrics pertain to the influence of Jackson and his effect on people worldwide, as well as reflecting on their own personal memories of Jackson. In the song's lyrics Diddy opens the song with Jackson's influence in the lyrics [...] "I believed I can do anything," [...] he says. [...] "You made the world dance. You made the music come to life." [...] Brown's part of the song is the chorus, where he described the grief of Jackson's death and noting that [...] "I know it's better on the other side." [...] On The Game's verses he reflects on Jackson's influence on him growing up and comparing himself to Jackson. [...] Towards the ending on the song The Game claims that the feud between him and 50 Cent is over, presumably due to Jackson's death, [...] "First thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard was I called Puff. Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us, Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, and the young Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge." [...] After this line, Chris Brown then sings the chorus. Hinting that he is the [...] "young Mike Jackson." [...] However, their beef still continued until 2016, when it was squashed with 50 Cent saying [...] "What happened, that shit was 12 years ago." [...] The Outkast song Ms. Jackson is also referenced, referring to Jackson's mother, also saying [...] "your son was our king so we won't Coretta you". Diddy concludes the song by stating that while people's opinions of Jackson may vary, that he's going to [...] "remember the miracles that you showed us." [...] through Jackson's music, dancing, and philanthropy commenting that [...] "through us your legacy lives on, Mike Jackson." ...|$|E
