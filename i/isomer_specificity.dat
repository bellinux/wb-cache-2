Researchers are now starting to discover that not all TFAs behave in a similar manner, that is, <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity</b> may be found. Among non-conjugated TFAs, plant originated TFAs (mainly elaidic and linolelaidic acids) are particularly linked to increased risk for coronary heart diseases, while animal originated TFAs (mainly vaccenic acid) are not. Among conjugated TFAs, two major isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), cis- 9,trans- 11 and trans- 10,cis- 12, show distinctive biological activities. A number of clinical trials of CLA with effects on body composition have been reported, but effects on coronary heart disease risk factors have been inconsistent. Meanwhile, safety concerns regarding CLA, in particular <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity,</b> have also been raised.

40|$|We {{have found}} that in {{addition}} to the 11 -cis and 9 -cis isomers of retinal which are known to couple with the visual pigment apoprotein opsin to form pigments, a third isomer 9, 13 -dicis retinal also will form a pigment. That this isomer is indeed bound to opsin has been shown unequivocally by removing the chromophore without isomerization and subsequent identification by high-speed liquid chromatography. Using similar techniques, we have shown that the product of bleaching by light of all three pigments in Trition X- 100 is the all-trans <b>isomer.</b> This <b>specificity</b> in the product of bleaching, as with many other properties of visual pigments, is not shared by the free chromophore.

Only a single conformer of ethanethiol is observed to give the adiabatic ionization potential (IP) of 9. 2922 (0. 0007 eV for the gauche conformer. For isopropanethiol, IP {{is found to be}} 9. 1426 (0. 0006 for the trans conformer and 9. 1559 (0. 0006 eV for the gauche conformer. Only two major conformational isomers are identified for 1 -propanethiol, giving an IP of 9. 1952 (0. 0006 for the trans-gauche conformer and 9. 2008 (0. 0006 eV for the gauche-gauche conformer. The tert-butanethiol, as expected, has a single conformer with an IP of 9. 0294 (0. 0006 eV. For 1 -butanethiol, {{there are a number of}} conformers, and the assignment of the MATI bands to each conformer turns out to be nontrivial. The spectral simulation using the Franck-Condon analysis based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations has been used for the identification of each conformational isomer in the MATI spectrum. Each conformer undergoes its unique structural change upon ionization, as revealed in the vibration resolved MATI spectrum, providing the powerful method for the spectral identification of a specific conformational <b>isomer.</b> The conformer <b>specificity</b> in the ionization-driven structural change reflects the role of the electron of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in the conformational preference...|$|R

This is specifically for application in developing countries where access to gas chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (GC–HRMS) and highly skilled personnel is limited. The method, using an Rxi- 5 Sil MS column in the first dimension (D) coupled with an Rtx- 200 column in the second dimension (D), was used to quantify PCDDs and PCDFs in different environmental sample matrices. The results were compared with those obtained usingGC–HRMSand good agreement was observed.

Moreover, other cryptic dehalogenases were also {{detected}} when the cells were grown in continuous culture. In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of one of the cryptic dehalogenases in MBA 4. This cryptic haloacid dehalogenase, designated Chd 1, was expressed constitutively in Escherichia coli. This recombinant Chd 1 had a relative molecular weight of 58, 000 and existed predominantly as a dimer. The subunits had a relative molecular weight of 27, 000. Chd 1 exhibited <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity,</b> being active towards the L-isomer of 2 -monochloropropionic acid only. The structural gene, chd 1, was isolated on a 1. 7 -kb PstI fragment. This fragment contains a functional promoter, because expression of chd 1 in E. coli is orientation independent. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and characterized. An open reading frame of 840 bp encoding a putative peptide of 280 amino acids was identified. This corresponds closely with the size of the subunit. The nucleotide sequence of chd 1 did not show any homology with those of other dehalogenase genes. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence, however, shows significant homology, ranging from 42 to 50 %, with the amino acid sequences of many other dehalogenases. Chd 1 is unusual in having a long leader sequence, a property of periplasmic enzymes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Cg 10062 from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a tautomerase {{superfamily}} {{member with}} the characteristic β−α−β fold and catalytic Pro- 1. It is a cis- 3 -chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (cis-CaaD) homologue with high sequence similarity (53 %) {{that includes the}} six critical active site residues (Pro- 1, His- 28, Arg- 70, Arg- 73, Tyr- 103, and Glu- 114). However, Cg 10062 is a poor cis-CaaD: it has much lower catalytic efficiency and lacks <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity.</b> Two acetylene compounds (propiolate and 2 -butynoate) and an allene (2, 3 -butadienote) were investigated as potential substrates for Cg 10062. Cg 10062 is a hydratase/decarboxylase using propiolate and cis- 3 -chloro- and 3 -bromoacrylates, where malonate semialdehyde {{is the product of}} hydration and acetaldehyde is the product of decarboxylation. The two activities occur consecutively using the initial substrate. In contrast, 2 -butynoate and 2, 3 -butadienote only undergo a hydration reaction with Cg 10062 to afford acetoacetate. cis-CaaD does not function as a hydratase/decarboxylase using any of these substrates, yielding only the products of hydration. Cg 10062 proceeds by direct hydration or covalent catalysis (using Pro- 1) depending on the substrate. Direct hydration yields the hydration products and covalent catalysis yields the hydration and decarboxylation products. Cg 10062 mutants shift the reaction toward one or the other mechanism. The observation that propiolate is the best substrate suggests that Cg 10062 could be a hydratase/decarboxylase in a pathway that transforms an unknown acetylene compound to acetaldehyde via propiolate. The bifunctional activity of Cg 10062 might also have implications for the evolution of the dehalogenase and decarboxylase activities in the tautomerase superfamily...|$|E
40|$|Several aldo–keto reductase (AKR) enzymes from subfamilies 1 B and 1 C show {{retinaldehyde}} reductase activity, having low K m and kcat values. Only AKR 1 B 10 and 1 B 12, with all-trans-retinaldehyde, and AKR 1 C 3, with 9 -cis-retinaldehyde, display high catalytic efficiency. Major structural determinants for retinaldehyde <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity</b> {{are located}} in the external loops (A and C for AKR 1 B 10, and B for AKR 1 C 3), as assessed by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics. Cellular models have shown that AKR 1 B and 1 C enzymes are well suited to work in vivo as retinaldehyde reductases and to regulate retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis at hormone pre-receptor level. An additional physiological role for the retinaldehyde reductase activity of these enzymes, consistent with their tissue localization, is their participation in β-carotene absorption. Retinaldehyde metabolism may be subjected to subcellular compartmentalization, based on enzyme localization. While retinaldehyde oxidation to RA takes place in the cytosol, reduction to retinol could take place in the cytosol by AKRs or in the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum by microsomal retinaldehyde reductases. Upregulation of some AKR 1 enzymes in different cancer types may be linked to their induction by oxidative stress and to their participation in different signaling pathways related to cell proliferation. AKR 1 B 10 and AKR 1 C 3, through their retinaldehyde reductase activity, trigger a decrease in the RA biosynthesis flow, resulting in RA deprivation and consequently lower differentiation, with an increased cancer risk in target tissues. Rational design of selective AKR inhibitors could lead to development of novel drugs for cancer treatment as well as reduction of chemotherapeutic drug resistance...|$|E
40|$|A 149 -amino acid protein {{designated}} Cg 10062 is encoded by a gene from Corynebacterium glutamicum. The {{physiological function}} of Cg 10062 is unknown, and the gene encoding this protein has no obvious genomic context. Sequence analysis links Cg 10062 to the cis- 3 -chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (cis-CaaD) family, {{one of the}} five known families of the tautomerase superfamily. The characterized tautomerase superfamily members have two distinctive characteristics: a P-cc-p structure motif and a catalytic amino-terminal proline. Pro- 1 is present in the Cg 10062 amino acid sequence along with His- 28, Arg- 70, Arg- 73, Tyr- 103, and Glu- 114, all of which have been implicated as critical residues for cis-CaaD activity. The gene for Cg 10062 has been cloned and the protein overproduced, purified, and subjected to kinetic and mechanistic characterization. Like cis-CaaD, Cg 10062 functions as a hydratase: it converts 2 -oxo- 3 -pentynoate to acetopyruvate and processes 3 -bromopropiolate to a species that inactivates the enzyme by acylation of Pro- 1. Kinetic and (1) H NMR spectroscopic studies also show that Cg 10062 processes both isomers of 3 -chloroacrylic acid at low levels with a clear preference for the cis isomer. Pro- 1 is critical for the dehalogenase and hydratase activities because the PIA mutant no longer catalyzes either reaction. The presence of the six key catalytic residues and the hydratase activity coupled with the absence of an efficient cis-CaaD activity and the lack of <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity</b> implicate factors beyond this core set of residues in cis-CaaD catalysis and specificity. This work sets the stage for in-depth mechanistic and structural studies of Cg 10062, which could identify the additional features necessary for a fully active and highly specific cis-CaaD. Such results will also shed light on how cis-CaaD emerged in the tautomerase superfamily because Cg 10062 could be characteristic of an intermediate along the evolutionary pathway for this dehalogenase...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin A and retinene, the {{carotenoid}} precursors of rhodopsin, {{occur in}} a variety of molecular shapes, cis-trans isomers of one another. For the synthesis of rhodopsin a specific cis isomer of vitamin A is needed. Ordinary crystalline vitamin A, as also the commercial synthetic product, both primarily all-trans, are ineffective. The main site of <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity</b> is the coupling of retinene with opsin. It is this reaction that requires a specific cis isomer of retinene. The oxidation of vitamin A to retinene by the alcohol dehydrogenase-cozymase system displays only a low degree of <b>isomer</b> <b>specificity.</b> Five isomers of retinene have been isolated in crystalline condition: all-trans; three apparently mono-cis forms, neoretinenes a and b and isoretinene a; and one apparently di-cis isomer, isoretinene b. Neoretinenes a and b were first isolated in our laboratory, and isoretinenes a and b in the Organic Research Laboratory of Distillation Products Industries. Each of these substances is converted to an equilibrium mixture of stereoisomers on simple exposure to light. For this reaction, light is required which retinene can absorb; i. e., blue, violet, or ultraviolet light. Yellow, orange, or red light has little effect. The single geometrical isomers of retinene must therefore be protected from low wave length radiation if their isomerization is to be avoided. By incubation with opsin in the dark, the capacity of each of the retinene isomers to synthesize rhodopsin was examined. All-trans retinene and neoretinene a are inactive. Neoretinene b yields rhodopsin indistinguishable from that extracted from the dark-adapted retina (λmax· 500 mµ). Isoretinene a yields a similar light-sensitive pigment, isorhodopsin, the absorption spectrum of which is displaced toward shorter wave lengths (λmax· 487 mµ). Isoretinene b appears to be inactive, but isomerizes preferentially to isoretinene a, which in the presence of opsin is removed to form isorhodopsin before the isomerization can go further. The synthesis of rhodopsin in solution follows the course of a bimolecular reaction, as though one molecule of neoretinene b combines with one of opsin. The synthesis of isorhodopsin displays similar kinetics. The bleaching of rhodopsin, whether by chemical means or by exposure to yellow or orange (i. e., non-isomerizing) light, yields primarily or exclusively all-trans retinene. The same appears to be true of isorhodopsin. The process of bleaching is therefore intrinsically irreversible. The all-trans retinene which results must be isomerized to active configurations before rhodopsin or isorhodopsin can be regenerated. A cycle of isomerization is therefore {{an integral part of the}} rhodopsin system. The all-trans retinene which emerges from the bleaching of rhodopsin must be isomerized to neoretinene b before it can go back; or if first reduced to all-trans vitamin A, this must be isomerized to neovitamin Ab before it can regenerate rhodopsin. The retina obtains new supplies of the neo-b isomer: (a) by the isomerization of all-trans retinene in the eye by blue or violet light; (b) by exchanging all-trans vitamin A for new neovitamin Ab from the blood circulation; and (c) the eye tissues may contain enzymes which catalyze the isomerization of retinene and vitamin A in situ. When the all-trans retinene which results from bleaching rhodopsin in orange or yellow light is exposed to blue or violet light, its isomerization is accompanied by a fall in extinction and a shift of absorption spectrum about 5 mµ toward shorter wave lengths. This is a second photochemical step in the bleaching of rhodopsin. It converts the inactive, all-trans isomer of retinene into a mixture of isomers, from which mixtures of rhodopsin and isorhodopsin can be regenerated. Isorhodopsin, however, is an artefact. There is no evidence that it occurs in the retina; nor has isovitamin Aa or b yet been identified in vivo. In rhodopsin and isorhodopsin, the prosthetic groups appear to retain the cis configurations characteristic of their retinene precursors. In accord with this view, the β-bands in the absorption spectra of both pigments appear to be cis peaks. The conversion to the all-trans configuration occurs during the process of bleaching. The possibility is discussed that rhodopsin may represent a halochromic complex of a retinyl ion with opsin. The increased resonance associated with the ionic state of retinene might then be responsible both for the color of rhodopsin and for the tendency of retinene to assume the all-trans configuration on its release from the complex. A distinction must be made between the immediate precursor of rhodopsin, neovitamin Ab, and the vitamin A which must be fed in order that rhodopsin be synthesized in vivo. Since vitamin A isomerizes in the body, it is probable that any geometrical isomer can fulfill all the nutritional needs for this vitamin...|$|E
