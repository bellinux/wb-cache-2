5|$|Two {{recordings}} of Bax as a pianist {{were made in}} 1929. With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own Viola Sonata for Columbia, and with May Harrison he recorded Delius's Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer's lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The Viola Sonata, Nonet and Mater ora Filium were recorded {{under the auspices of}} the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs. Of the tone poems, Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of Tintagel, in 1928; twenty years later a set of The Garden of Fand with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that The Record Guide listed only Tintagel, the Coronation March, the unaccompanied choral work What is <b>it</b> <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> be Young and Fair? and the solo piano piece Paean.|$|E

Oxford {{philosophers}} of the 20th century include Gilbert Ryle, {{author of the}} influential The Concept of Mind, who spent his entire philosophical career at the university and Derek Parfit, who specialised in personal identity and related matters. Other commonly read modern philosophers to have studied at the university include A. J.

500|$|Liverpool {{dominated}} the opening exchanges, but struggled to create clear-cut chances. They almost went a goal behind when Frank Stapleton's header forced goalkeeper Ray Clemence into action. Seven {{minutes before the}} interval, Terry McDermott scored for Liverpool. The midfielder collected a pass from Ray Kennedy who surged through the centre, turned left and from outside the penalty area struck the ball low into the bottom left-hand corner. Arsenal began the second half with more vigour, but struggled to suppress Liverpool's attacks. Alan Kennedy found space to shoot after a one-two with Ray, but his effort went over the post. Arsenal were forced to make a substitution around the hour mark after Sammy Nelson collided with McDermott and was concussed; Willie Young replaced him. Liverpool extended their lead minutes later. Alan Hansen intercepted an Arsenal attack, strode forward and passed the ball to Dalglish. The striker approached the penalty area, cut inside Steve Walford and curled {{the ball into the}} right-hand corner. John Hollins came on for David Price, at which point Liverpool scored their third. Dalglish dispossessed Liam Brady, but tripped himself in the process. Johnson collected the ball and played it back to Dalglish, who charged forward and sprayed a pass towards McDermott, the furthest forward player on the right. The midfielder's shot went under the legs of Pat Jennings and into the goal. Alan Sunderland scored a late goal for Arsenal having combined well with Stapleton. This did not dampen the spirits of the Liverpool spectators, who chanted, [...] "What's <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be outclassed?" [...] and, [...] "Why are we so great?"

30|$|So the {{creative}} imagination of bhāvana {{is used in}} conjunction with meditative practices prescribed by earlier yogic traditions and complements them. With bhāvana one appropriates into one’s sense of self a kind of feeling-being state that imagines what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be free of bondage. In some sense this recalls Nagel’s “what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a bat”, but in this case, rather than bat or wasp, one uses this embodied imagination to tap into what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a liberated puruṣa, someone free of karma. This feeling into “what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be x” also entails that this imaginative practice, carries a capacity to mold and transform the body, first the subtle body and then following on this, the physical body. In this respect this is more than mere empathy, feeling what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be another, bat or person. It entails also an embodied habitus, a whole identity as being in the world which bhāvana addresses and attempts to transform and direct. Just as Nagel’s formulation entails an assumed embodiment, so also does bhāvana, and bhāvana in this case proposes the possibility of transforming this embodiment.|$|R

2500|$|In {{philosophy}} and certain models of psychology, qualia ( [...] or singular form: quale) are {{claimed to be}} individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective [...] (...) meaning [...] "of what sort" [...] or [...] "of what kind" [...] in a specific instance like [...] "what is <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> taste a specific orange, this particular orange now". Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, {{as well as the}} redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to [...] "propositional attitudes", where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what is it directly like to be experiencing.|$|E
2500|$|Although it {{does not}} {{actually}} mention the word [...] "qualia", Thomas Nagel's paper [...] "What Is <b>it</b> <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> Be a Bat?" [...] is often cited in debates over qualia. Nagel argues that consciousness has an essentially subjective character, a what-it-is-like aspect. He states that [...] "an organism has conscious mental states {{if and only if}} there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism—something it is like for the organism." [...] Nagel also suggests that the subjective aspect of the mind may not ever be sufficiently accounted for by the objective methods of reductionistic science. He claims that [...] "if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done." [...] Furthermore, he states that [...] "it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective." ...|$|E

The scene was shot at the San Antonio Alamodome on September 15, 1996 and was advertised in newspapers which garnered the attention of 35,000 people. Lopez said how she was nervous for the scene since {{it would be the first}} time she would perform in front of an audience of that size. She further expressed how uneven she was due to the criticism she received and was unsure how fans would receive her. Jackie Guerra voiced on how during the scene she saw Selena's parents sobbing, the cast later said how after the scene was completed they were overwhelmed with emotions. Later that night, fans approached Lopez sobbing that she looked identical to Selena and public perception on Lopez changed after her performance. The death scene was shot once, the cast explained how once they were emotional they continued after the director announced the take. Guerra said how she was physically and emotionally drained after the death scene was shot. She explained how she [...] "could not imagine what's <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be [...] " [...] and further said how she had to live with the pain for four months but found it unimaginable to the pain the family goes through since the death of Selena. Lopez spoke how the scene made her appreciate life even more, whereas Seda expressed that working on the film was one of the hardest for him in terms of departing from the cast.|$|E

Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be an F is recommended...|$|R
