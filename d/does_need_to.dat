Directed by Punit Malhotra, the romantic comedy saw him portray Jai Dhingra, a young Casanova who {{does not believe in}} the concept of love and romance. The film garnered mixed reviews from critics; Khan's performance was generally well received. Komal Nahta wrote, [...] "Imran Khan is endearing and does well for {{a good part of the}} film.

I Hate Luv Storys was a domestic and international box-office success, earning [...] Khan expressed his gratitude that Johar gave him the opportunity.

A commercial failure, the film (and his performance) received mixed reviews; while Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled his performance [...] "earnest", Anupama Chopra said that [...] "Imran is saddled with a bland, supporting role".|$|E

2500|$|Three {{different}} {{covers for}} Game Informers first {{preview of the}} game for its October 2010 issue were collaborations between Irrational and the magazine, envisioning what a video game magazine would be like in the early 20th century. Each cover, drawn by Irrational's Rob Waters, is inspired by the cover artwork from The Saturday Evening Post and includes fictional advertisements based on early 20th century variants, including one redrawn from a public domain ad. Kevin Gifford of Gamasutra praised these covers, commented that such a diversion for a game magazine cover represents a paradigm change, in that [...] "developers are beginning to appreciate what magazines can do for their media strategy that online can't", and that because Game Informer <b>does</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> vie for space at newsstands, is able to take more creative approaches with such covers as opposed to cover layers designed to gain maximum exposure. Similarly, in its reveal of the first images of the player protagonist Booker, Electronic Games Monthly used a cover in homage to the Uncanny X-Men comic, Days of Future Past, another story dealing with alternate realities.|$|E
