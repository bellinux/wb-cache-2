Social network matrices are constructed using different centrality measures. These measurements are used to explore the association between network centrality and coordination for a construction project. Network centrality affects the ability of an individual to coordinate the actions of others. The following questions guide this study: What is the effect of network centrality on coordination? How is the actor's ability to coordinate projects related to his or her structural position in the communications network? Multi-layered test designs were developed to explore this relationship in a project-based coordination of Dabhol Power Company Construction company and Azurix Corporation. There are three major findings from this analysis. First, centrally positioned actors show more coordinative activity. Second, the betweenness <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> is the most potent predicate for coordination.

30|$|Centrality {{is a key}} {{concept in}} social network {{analysis}} [13, 34] and in academic literature there are different <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> [33, 35, 36] which have the common purpose of “quantify an intuitive feeling that in most networks some vertices or edges are more central than others” [37], p. 16.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many works {{investigated}} the trophic structure of communities stressing, in particular, {{the role played}} by species in food webs (e. g., their trophic level and, more recently, their centrality). There exist some encouraging applications, but few details are known about the relationships between centrality measurements and trophic levels. In addition, these studies almost refer to unweighted trophic networks, despite the acknowledged need of investigating weighted webs. Here we aim to contribute to the synthetic treatment of these complementary issues by analyzing several <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> and trophic level. Studying 19 ecosystems, we ranked the nodes according to their positional importance values (based on various centrality indices) and we compared the rank order of coefficients with unweighted or weighted trophic levels. Our goal was revealing potential biases in finding high centrality nodes among basal, intermediate and top species. We found that key species occupy intermediate positions of the trophic hierarchy. In case of unweighted data, trophic levels of key nodes do not deviate from trends displayed by the whole dataset. Significant differences were observed when using weighted data. These results contradict the common belief of many ecologists that identified top-predators and charismatic megafauna as main targets of conservation policies. We discuss the potential consequences of the observed features on ecosystem dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between scientific productivity and collaborative behaviours (formal and informal). Despite the different approaches available in the literature, we will focus on what we call the “relational trend”: our goal is to detect some of the factors which might affect researchers’ productivity, considering “relational variables”. In particular, the tendency to write papers in co-authorship will be used as a proxy of formal scientific collaboration amongst scientists, while the number of acknowledgements will be assumed as a proxy of the scientist’s ability to build informal collaboration networks. Both co-authorships and acknowledgments indices are interpreted as two of the main forces which could affect and drive scientific production, apart from individual talent. Using the dataset developed by Togni (2009) which collects data about geographers’ publications on the Top Journals in the years 2000 - 2007, an econometric analysis using two-stage least squares has been performed, in order to regress productivity on a series of other indices, including (amongst the others) a typical SNA <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> (betweenness centrality). Three results clearly emerged from the analysis: co-authorships networks affect productivity in a negative way, but a variety of co-authors may increase geographers’ productivity; on the contrary, informal influence (acknowledgments network) on productivity seems not to have any effect on productivity. Finally, a trade-off between the transaction costs from the collaboration and the need to mutual exchange of skills and knowledge complementarities which boost scientists to vary their co-authors...|$|E

By drawing from established coordination and organisational process theory, a text-mining tool is designed and implemented to measure coordination from a large dataset of emails. Here, we provide effective mechanisms for: (i) cataloguing coordination key phrases from an email corpus; (ii) the calculation of coordination score based on project scope; (iii) the construction of social network matrices using centrality measures, and (iv) approaches for exploring the association between network centrality and coordination score. We argue that actor centrality affects the ability of an individual to coordinate the actions of others. The following questions guide this study [...] What {{is the effect of}} network centrality on organisational coordination? How is the actor's ability to coordinate projects related to their structural position in the communications network? We developed multi-layered test designs to explore this relationship in a project-based (macro) and cross-project (micro) level. We suggest four major findings from the analysis of communication data from Enron email corpus. Firstly, it is concluded that centrally positioned actors show more coordinative activity. Secondly, it is found that betweenness <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> is the most potent predicate for coordination. Thirdly, the influence of an actor is associated with coordination more so than the actor's prominence.

A crucial question is understanding which species {{play a key role}} in the trophic transfer of contaminants to disclose the contribution of feeding linkages and the importance of trophic dependencies in bioaccumulation dynamics. In this work we present a computational framework to model the bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in aquatic food webs, and to discover key species in polluted ecosystems. As a result, we reconstruct the first PCBs bioaccumulation model of the Adriatic food web, estimated after an extensive review of published concentration data. We define a novel index aimed to identify the key species in contaminated networks, Sensitivity Centrality, and based on sensitivity analysis. The index is computed from a dynamic ODE model parametrised from the estimated PCBs bioaccumulation model and compared with a set <b>of</b> established trophic <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality.</b> Results evidence the occurrence of PCBs biomagnification in the Adriatic food web, and highlight the dependence of bioaccumulation on trophic dynamics and external factors like fishing activity.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this study}} we {{explored}} preeclampsia through a bioinformatics approach. We create a comprehensive genes/proteins dataset by the analysis of both public proteomic data and text mining of public scientific literature. From this dataset the associated protein-protein interaction network has been obtained. Several <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> have been explored for hubs detection {{as well as the}} enrichment statistical analysis of metabolic pathway and disease. Results We confirmed the well known relationship between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases but also identified statistically significant relationships with respect to cancer and aging. Moreover, significant metabolic pathways such as apoptosis, cancer and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction have also been identified by enrichment analysis. We obtained FLT 1, VEGFA, FN 1, F 2 and PGF genes with the highest scores by hubs analysis; however, we also found other genes as PDIA 3, LYN, SH 2 B 2 and NDRG 1 with high scores. Conclusions The applied methodology not only led to the identification of well known genes related to preeclampsia but also to propose new candidates poorly explored or completely unknown in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, which eventually need to be validated experimentally. Moreover, new possible connections were detected between preeclampsia and other diseases that could open new areas of research. More must be done in this area to resolve the identification of unknown interactions of proteins/genes and also for a better integration of metabolic pathways and diseases. </p...|$|R

However, after the full opening of the electricity market in 2007, the Italian legislation opens up new possibilities for the management of power lines owned by RFI. Consequently, the objective of this work is to identify which segments of the high-voltage network of RFI are of greater strategic importance within the overall electrical infrastructure in Italy. Multiple reasons may be of interest of this analysis, ranging from a correct evaluation of the individual sections, which obviously cannot be based on mere technical characteristics of the line, to a program of investment and infrastructure development that avoids duplications or overlaps. After an analysis of the evolution of the regulatory framework, strategic points of the transmission of high voltage energy of RFI have been identified using a method derived from the network analysis that allowed us to build a model of representation of a set of high voltage grids throughout the country. In the national network we contextualized the network of RFI and we evaluated some <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality,</b> i. e. the parameters that identify the importance of individual nodes within the network. Therefore nodes RFI were identified with a greater number of connections that are also relevant to the structure of the network itself.

However, minor {{attention has been paid to}} the study of bioremediation in marine food webs and to the definition of integrated strategies for reducing bioaccumulation in species. We propose a novel computational framework for analysing the multiscale effects of bioremediation at the ecosystem level, based on coupling food web bioaccumulation models and metabolic models of degrading bacteria. The combination of techniques from synthetic biology and ecological network analysis allows the specification of arbitrary scenarios of contaminant removal and the evaluation of strategies based on natural or synthetic microbial strains. In this study, we derive a bioaccumulation model of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Adriatic food web, and we extend a metabolic reconstruction of Pseudomonas putida KT 2440 (iJN 746) with the aerobic pathway of PCBs degradation.

Their median age was 25.5  years (range 16 – 71), weight was 75 Kg (40 – 120), and height 174  cm (163 – 188). The cause of sepsis was intra-abdominal, pulmonary or extensive soft tissue infection. The diagnosis of sepsis was based on the occurrence of a temperature[*]>[*] 38.3 °C, white blood cell count[*]>[*] 12 [*]×[*] 109 /L or[*]<[*] 3 [*]×[*] 109 /L and clear evidence of infection verified by positive cultures from blood, surgical drainage of infected areas, or sputum in the case of pulmonary sepsis. Median sepsis severity score (Skau 1985) upon diagnosis of sepsis was 24 (range 11 – 75). Most patients survived, some of them after evolving through near-fatal illness, two patients died from septic metabolic and cardiorespiratory decompensation from multiple organ dysfunction, and one suffered sudden death without multiple organ dysfunction. The AA assessments were performed every 8 to 24  hours until the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis persisted, for a total of 430 measurements. For this purpose, arterial blood samples were collected into EDTA vacutainer tubes and the plasma was immediately separated and deproteinized with a sulfosalicylic acid solution. The AA analyses were performed on the fresh plasma samples, or the plasma was frozen and stored at − 20 °C and the assay was performed within one week on a Beckman 6300 high-performance AA analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Phosphoserine was included in the AA profile. The Fischer AA ratio (Freund et al. 1979) was calculated according to the ratio (leucine[*]+[*]isoleucine[*]+[*]valine)/(phenylalanine[*]+[*]tyrosine). In many instances serum creatinine, bilirubin and ammonia were simultaneously available. The Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA score) (Vincent 2006) was additionally determined. The patients were receiving total parenteral nutrition (34 [*]±[*] 14  kcal/kg/ 24  hr, about three fourths glucose and one fourth fat, and 1.5 [*]±[*] 0.6  g/kg/ 24  hr amino acids). To account for possible transient variations in infusion rate, the infusion rates maintained in the last eight hours before blood sampling were recorded and used for the study. The study protocol complied with the 1964 Helsinki declaration. It consisted of the secondary analysis of a previously developed patient AA database, and patients or their relatives gave their consent {{to take part in the}} original study Medians and ranges or 5 th - 95 th percentiles were used as <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> and dispersion <b>of</b> the distributions. The measurements provided a continuous distribution of observations over a wide range of conditions, extending from moderately to extremely severe septic illness. This was well suited to assessing the correlations of phosphoserine over an ample area of pathophysiologic abnormalities. The relationships existing between phosphoserine and the other AAs and the metabolic variables were explored on two- or three-dimensional graphical displays. Further assessments and validations of the results were performed by Student’s t test, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test and by least-square regression and covariance analysis, and analyzed for the Pearson correlation coefficient, with skewness and kurtosis control, and analysis of residuals (Statgraphics Plus, Manugistics, Rockville, MD). To specifically address only the best correlates of phosphoserine, correlations with absolute r < 0.30 were not taken into account. Significance of covariance was assessed by Scheffé criteria (based on confidence intervals and differences in slope and intercept) (Seber 1977) and with the selection of the simplest possible regressions yielding the best control of variability of phosphoserine.|$|R

The simple sum of tertiary and quaternary contents of a settlement expresses no more than the wealth of its offer and only if we evaluate the importance of this offer can we reach the degree of the settlement’s potential centrality. Up to the moment when we determine the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a settlement, we remain in the domain of its nodal importance. The concept of nodality and the concept <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a settlement are two hindered concepts. The first may be called the concept of importance and the second the concept of relative importance of a settlement. In real life there is a whole range of transitive situations, from the good supply of the central settlement with tertiary and quaternary functions, whose capacities exceed the needs of the population in the gravitational area of the settlement, to the opposite situation, which is reflected in positive and negative values of the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centrality.</b> Therefore, the balance between the supply of the settlement and the demand of the gravitational area can be defined as "ideal centrality". A comparative analysis of systems of central settlements on the basis of relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> shows some inter-regional relations.
