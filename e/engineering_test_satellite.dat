50|$|JAXA <b>Engineering</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> ETS-VIII (Kiku 8) is {{the eighth}} {{technology}} test satellite {{in a series}} which started with ETS-1 in 1975 by NASDA. It was launched with the H-2A on December 18, 2006.ETS-VIII was developed by JAXA in cooperation with NICT and NTT.The aim of ETS-VIII is to enable satellite communications with small terminals. Unlike the Iridium satellites for mobile communication, ETS-VIII is positioned at GEO.However to fulfill the task the satellite must carry two very large antennas. It was the first use of the 204 configuration (four strap-on boosters) of the H-IIA launch vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Launch test {{efforts at}} KSC {{with regard to}} the Kappa, Lambda and Lambda-4 rockets set the stage for small {{satellite}} missions. At the same time, the Mu program of large rockets was pursued. After four launch failures, an <b>engineering</b> <b>test</b> <b>satellite</b> was successfully put into orbit aboard a Lambda 4S-5 rocket. The satellite Ōsumi (named after a peninsula in Kagoshima Prefecture) marked Japan's first successful satellite launch. Subsequent improvements in the Mu class rocket enabled scientific satellite launches at a rate of one per year. Development of the new generation M-V rocket resulted in successful launch of the scientific satellite MUSES-B (HALCA) in February 1997.|$|E
50|$|The ETS-VII, or <b>Engineering</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> No. 7, was a {{satellite}} developed and {{launched by the}} National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). It {{is also known as}} KIKU-7. It was launched aboard an H-II rocket from Tanegashima Space Center, on 28 November 1997. The ETS-VII was equipped with a 2 metre long robotic arm, which was used to carry out several experiments related to rendezvous docking and space robotics. It was the world’s first satellite to be equipped with a robotic arm, and also the first unmanned spacecraft to conduct autonomous rendezvous docking operations successfully. Although it was originally intended to be used for 1.5 years, the satellite was functional for a period of almost five years.|$|E
50|$|The Optical Inter-orbit Communications <b>Engineering</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> (OICETS), {{also called}} Kirari, is an {{experimental}} satellite launched by JAXA to demonstrate interorbital communication between satellites through optical (laser) means. OICETS was originally slated for a launch {{on the second}} J-I launcher. Due to problems with this launcher, the launch {{had to be put}} on hold. Using the H-IIA was out of question: it would be overkill to use this model to send a 570 kg satellite into low Earth orbit, and there was no budget for another H-IIA launch. Finally, {{in order to be able}} to perform the tests during the lifetime of the European Artemis satellite, OICETS was successfully launched on a Dnepr rocket.|$|E

Launch was originally scheduled for 2007. The launch date was eventually set for 15 February 2008, however a problem detected in a second stage manoeuvring thruster delayed it to 23 February. Lift-off occurred at 08:55 GMT on 23 February, and the satellite separated from the carrier rocket, into a Geosynchronous transfer orbit at 09:23, launched by an H-IIA carrier rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center. It {{will be used to}} relay the internet to Japanese homes and businesses, through Ka-Band signals. It will also develop technologies to be utilised by future Japanese communication spacecraft.
