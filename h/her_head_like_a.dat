60|$|She half {{closed her}} eyes and laughed softly to herself, moving <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child, as though from sheer pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{her face}} shone, and Kitty was waved over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> banner, as she {{flew out of}} the gate, crying, rapturously,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dar', she's reco'nised us now!" [...] exclaimed Ebony with delight; and it {{was evident}} that he was right for Betsy {{continued}} to caper upon the sands in a manner that could only be the result of joy or insanity, while the coal-scuttle beat tempestuously about <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> enraged balloon.|$|R
6000|$|MISS LORE--My! One {{evening he}} has his arm around her, {{and the next morning}} he's ready to break <b>her</b> <b>head!</b> Just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man! ...|$|R
6000|$|Bessie Alden {{threw back}} <b>her</b> pretty <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> startled hind, {{and a look}} flashed into her face that made Mrs. Westgate rise from her chair. [...] "Who says such things as that?" [...] she demanded.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' she cried, {{pressing}} back <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cobra, {{her eyes}} flashing. 'It {{is a process}} of pride--I want to be proud--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you're {{making them}} all the time," [...] she cried impulsively. [...] "No man ever courted a woman by holding a {{threatened}} proposal over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> club." ...|$|E
60|$|She said nothink in answer, but flumps past me, {{and opening}} the parlor-door, sees master looking very queer, and Miss Mary a-drooping down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pale lily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Macumazahn," [...] {{she said}} {{almost in a}} whisper, and letting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> droop <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fading lily, [...] "you have never given me the chance, have you?" [...] And she laughed a little, looking {{extremely}} attractive.|$|R
6000|$|She shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> calmly, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{person who}} saw things {{as she saw}} them. [...] "You don't do me justice. I think your conduct in {{excellent}} taste and the best you could adopt. Yes, that's what I think." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{a family}} member's interview, Rona was trapped in an abusive, loveless marriage, trying in vain to {{convince}} her husband to grant her a divorce. Rona's siblings claimed that she feared for her life during {{the days leading up}} to her death. Tooba, the second wife, allegedly said to Rona “You are a slave, you are a servant.” Reportedly, the Shafias held all of Rona’s identity documents, including her passport, so Rona believed she could not flee to another country, where she had relatives. It was reported that Rona came to Canada as a domestic servant on a visitor's visa and the [...] "visa's renewal held over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> axe ready to fall" [...] by her husband and co-wife.|$|R
60|$|The señora Morales {{waved her}} fan. She {{wore a black}} silk {{mantilla}} fastened tightly round <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cowl, and her dark, fleshy face was thickly smeared with powder. Her eyes were lazily contemptuous.|$|E
60|$|All {{the morning}} Liza {{worked in a}} dead-and-alive sort of fashion, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piece of lead with {{electric}} shocks going through it when she moved, and her tongue and mouth hot and dry. At last lunch-time came.|$|E
60|$|Then she {{loosened}} {{the soft}} mass of golden hair which crowned <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> shimmering waterfall turned to burnished metal by a dying sun it fell about her oval face; in waving lines, below her waist it tumbled.|$|E
60|$|The brim of her linen hat {{kept the}} sun from her face, but <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was {{drooping}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flower's <b>head</b> at noon.|$|R
60|$|Miss Charlotte {{she held}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> up <b>like</b> <b>a</b> queen while Buck was telling his tale, and her {{nostrils}} spread {{and her eyes}} snapped. The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she shook}} <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> very much <b>like</b> <b>an</b> inconsolable child {{and very much}} with a child’s {{complete}} pessimism she murmured, “Therese has told him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let {{him have}} 'em. I don't know as it {{interests}} me," [...] replied 'Cindy, waving <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> banner. [...] "If he wants to sell himself to that greasy Dutchwoman why, let him, that's all! I don't care." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{excitement}} at {{riding in}} a motor-car was greatest of all. He too {{was very proud of}} this last coup. He saw Ursula kindle and flare up to the romance of the situation. She raised <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> young horse snuffing with wild delight.|$|E
6000|$|... § XCIII. Eighth side. Envy. One of the noblest {{pieces of}} {{expression}} in the series. She is pointing malignantly with her finger; a serpent is wreathed about <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cap, another forms the girdle of her waist, and a dragon rests in her lap.|$|E
5000|$|Penny Van Dough - Reggie's baby sister, {{she talks}} only in [...] "baby talk." [...] The curl on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is shaped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dollar sign.|$|R
6000|$|But I saw {{her cheek}} and {{forehead}} [...] Change, as at a spoken word, [...] And I saw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> uplifted [...] <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> lily to the Lord.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now den," [...] said she, {{holding the}} candle over <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> black Witch of Ender {{just out of}} the ground, [...] "What you want?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he continued, [...] "it's {{long past}} now. Why should I {{be angry with}} the dead? Adam's wife never got the better o' that. She dropped <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> prairie flower in the first blast of winter, an' was soon beside her husband.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} {{where he had}} left her, gazing after him, leaning forward with her hands still held behind her. Suddenly, as with an inspiration, she raised them both, carried them impetuously to her lips, blew him a dozen riotous kisses, and then, lowering <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> colt, whisked her skirt behind her, and vanished in the cover.|$|E
60|$|And the {{old woman}} {{escaping}} from all those who would have restrained her, walked rapidly through the doorway and down the flagged path rendered slippery with the sleet. The gale caught the white wings of her coif, causing them to flutter about her ears, and freezing strands of her gray locks which stood out now all round <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> grizzled halo.|$|E
6000|$|There {{followed}} a long moment. On {{the one side}} was that vinegary woman poking <b>her</b> <b>head</b> forward <b>like</b> <b>an</b> angry hen, on the other, Daphne Wing, her eyes rounder and rounder, her cheeks redder and redder, her lips opening, her hands clasped to her perfect breast, and, in the centre, that broad, grey-bearded figure, with reddening face and angry eyes and hoarsening voice: ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Pecksniff {{was made}} so desperate by the loud tone {{in which she}} spoke, that, after looking about him in frantic {{uncertainty}} for some means of softening it, he rose and shook her until the ornamental bow of hair upon <b>her</b> <b>head</b> nodded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> plume. She was so very much astonished by this assault, that it really had the desired effect.|$|R
6000|$|For {{the first}} weeks, the black {{eyes of the}} child were for ever on the watch. Brangwen, good-humoured but impatient, spoiled by Tilly, was an easy blusterer. If {{for a few minutes}} he upset the {{household}} with his noisy impatience, he found at the end the child glowering at him with intense black eyes, and she was sure to dart forward <b>her</b> little <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> serpent, with <b>her</b> biting: ...|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} the {{spreading}} noose hung above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great snake, and then, {{as she looked}} upward to detect {{the origin of the}} swishing sound of the rope, it settled about her neck. With a quick jerk Tarzan snapped the noose tight about the glossy throat, and then he dropped the rope and clung to his support with both hands.|$|E
60|$|Gudruda bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{drooping}} flower, and presently sank to earth, for {{her knees}} would bear her weight no more; but Eric {{marched to the}} lip of the sea, his head held high and laughing merrily to hide his pain of heart. Here stood Asmund, who gripped him by both hands, and kissed him on the brow, bidding him good luck.|$|E
6000|$|Dora had {{the same}} yellow curly hair, in tight, frizzly rings all over <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boy's, a light complexion, and blue eyes, in a round, pug-nosed face; and she hung so entirely on Harold that I never doubted that she was his sister till, as we were sitting down to eat, I said, [...] "Can't you come a little way from your brother?" ...|$|E

60|$|The girl {{opened her}} lips and ate the jelly greedily. She ate {{as much as she}} was desired. In three minutes more <b>her</b> <b>head</b> had fallen <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child's upon her pillow and she was {{sleeping}} peacefully.|$|R
60|$|Clasping {{her hands}} above <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she stood <b>like</b> <b>a</b> beautiful, pale image of despair; tearless and mute, but {{with such a}} world of anguish in the eyes lifted to the smiling picture {{opposite}} that it needed no words {{to tell the story}} of a broken heart.|$|R
