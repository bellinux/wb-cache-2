5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester.

Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
