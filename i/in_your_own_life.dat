60|$|L. You may {{at least}} earnestly {{believe that the}} {{presence}} of the spirit which culminates <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> shows itself in dawning, wherever the dust of the earth begins to assume any orderly and lovely state. You will find it impossible to separate this idea of gradated manifestation from that of the vital power. Things are not either wholly alive, or wholly dead. They are less or more alive. Take the nearest, most easily examined instance--the life of a flower. Notice what a different degree and kind of life there is in the calyx and the corolla. The calyx is nothing but the swaddling clothes of the flower; the child-blossom is bound up in it, hand and foot; guarded in it, restrained by it, till the time of birth. The shell is hardly more subordinate to the germ in the egg, than the calyx to the blossom. It bursts at last; but it never lives as the corolla does. It may fall at the moment its task is fulfilled, as in the poppy; or wither gradually, as in the buttercup; or persist in a ligneous apathy, after the flower is dead, as in the rose; or harmonize itself so as to share in the aspect of the real flower, as in the lily; but it never shares in the corolla's bright passion of life. And the gradations which thus exist between the different members of organic creatures, exist no less between the different ranges of organism. We know no higher or more energetic life than our own; but there seems to me this great good in the idea of gradation of life--it admits the idea of a life above us, in other creatures, as much nobler than ours, as ours is nobler than that of the dust.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2004 interview, Guthrie {{spoke about}} spirituality {{and the role}} it plays {{in his life and}} on Outlasting the Blues. I'm not a big fan of overly happy spirituality ... Life ain’t happy all the time. For me, spirituality is not about being happy. It's about what to do when times are tough, not just for you {{personally}} but for everybody. There are times when disasters strike ... So, for me, spirituality is what to do about that, and then what to do <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>life</b> when you're confronting things that hurt, things that ain't fun. Outlasting the Blues was about that. It was not about preachin', it was not about telling people what's right, although there's {{a little bit about what}} I found was right.|$|R

After attending primary school, Koivisto worked a number of jobs, and {{at the beginning of the}} Winter War in 1939 joined a field firefighting unit at the age of 16. During the Continuation War, Koivisto served in the Infantry Detachment Törni led by Lauri Törni, which was a reconnaissance detachment operating behind enemy lines. This detachment was only open to selected volunteers. During the war he received the Order of the Cross of Liberty (2nd class) and was promoted to the rank of corporal.

Cozart stated, [...] "If you can take a garbage-strewn lot, or anything else in your neighborhood that you don't like, {{and turn it into a}} thing of beauty that benefits the com-munity--a thing of usefulness--then you know you can transform other things.

5000|$|Tazkiah (تزكية) is an Arabic-Islamic term {{alluding}} to [...] "tazkiyah al-nafs" [...] meaning [...] "purification of the self". This {{refers to the}} process of transforming the nafs (carnal self or desires) from its deplorable state of ego-centrality through various spiritual stages towards the level of purity and submission to the will of Allah. Its basis is in learning the shari'ah and deeds from the known authentic sunnah ('ilm) and applying it <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> deeds through <b>life</b> resulting in spiritual awareness of Allah (being constantly aware that He is with us by His knowledge and knows all that we do, along with being in constant remembrance or Dhikr of Him <b>in</b> <b>your</b> thoughts and actions) being the highest level of Ihsan.|$|R

The album was mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in March 2013 in New York City. The final album is a strikingly evocative collection of songs that represents the musicians who made it. From shimmering opener “Weak Currents” to sparsely wrought closer “Scrap Metal,” Last Call For The Quiet Life contains {{the ups and downs}} of existence and relationships and family, and the highs and lows of finding yourself <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life.</b> Each note resonates with its own emotion, creating an overall narrative of what it means to find the right beginning. Or, to let it find us. “When you start something you don’t know where it’s going to go,” Buddy says. “The whole record felt like solid footing right away. It wasn’t anguished over. We just did what we both do. I needed to feel scared and not know where it was going. I had to learn to just let it happen and let it keep unfolding. When you do that, suddenly you have these songs and they all go together.” [...] Author: Emily Zemler ...|$|E

5000|$|Describing Michael's personality, the {{official}} Holby City website states: [...] "Being a doctor defines Michael. Surgery {{is his first}} love, it's {{the only time he}} feels true emotion." [...] Dhillon believes that Michael is [...] "a very idiosyncratic character" [...] and [...] "not overly sincere in that 'I'm just trying to save a life' way." [...] He described: [...] "He's very objective about himself - as though he is slightly outside of himself in situations - a slight ironic disposition. Half the time I think he says things just to watch the reaction. He's direct, honest, morally ambiguous, unapologetic. He certainly thinks and behaves outside the normal parameters of behaviour, which is challenging to many characters." [...] Dhillon and Michael share a similar background. Michael grew up in India, moved to America, and now lives in the United Kingdom, while Dhillon grew up in San Francisco, spent nine months in India aged six, and also now lives in the United Kingdom. Explaining the impact of this on Michael's characterisation, Dhillon stated: [...] "I think that type of background has a certain effect on people - I think we both share a slight ironic detachment from the world we are in. Sometimes it feels like you are an objective observer <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> like you are on the outside looking in. I don't feel overly identified with a particular country, I feel pretty comfortable {{in a number of different}} environments, and I think he does as well." [...] Dhillon feels that Michael has a [...] "self-destructive perverse streak", and believes that his world is limited to his work and family. He commented: [...] "if you took one of those things away, you would cut out half of his personality. There's not much outside of that. He’s very muscular in his medical intellect but his emotional depth, or range, has almost withered. He's learning life's lessons late and in a hard way." ...|$|E

I tried--oh, dear, how I tried--to get you to look at me.

5000|$|The band {{started work}} on a new album in early 2012. According to Benzie, the album may take a more {{electronic}} approach than This Is the Warning;, stating [...] "I think we're kind of in a cyborg half-human, half-robot stage at the moment. Yeah, I definitely think we could (be going in an electronic direction). We're leaning toward a bigger, fatter sound, rather than just the guitars." [...] Benzie also stated that thematically, the album would explore {{the issues of the}} first album, but build on those {{as if it were a}} second chapter in a first person narrative; [...] "Most of the next one’s going to be a bit of the after-effect: how can you combat things like that (not feeling <b>in</b> control of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life)?</b> How can small people deceive world bankers? The answer will actually be everyone — what everyone does within their individual bubble, how we choose to act, and if that will butterfly effect out."

40|$|Introduction With an ageing population, {{end-of-life}} care is increasing in importance. The present work investigated characteristics and time trends of older peoples' attitudes towards euthanasia and an end-of-life pill. Methods Three samples aged 64 {{years or older}} from the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam (N 1 / 41284 (2001), N 1 / 41303 (2005) and N 1 / 41245 (2008)) were studied. Respondents were asked whether they could imagine requesting their physician to end their life (euthanasia), or imagine asking for a pill to end their life if they became tired {{of living in the}} absence of a severe disease (end-of-life pill). Using logistic multivariable techniques, changes of attitudes over time and their association with demographic and health characteristics were assessed. Results The proportion of respondents with a positive attitude somewhat increased over time, but significantly only among the 64 e 74 age group. For euthanasia, these percentages were 58 % (2001), 64 % (2005) and 70 % (2008) (OR of most recent versus earliest period (95 % CI) : 1. 30 (1. 17 to 1. 44)). For an end-of-life pill, these percentages were 31 % (2001), 33 % (2005) and 45 % (2008) (OR (95 % CI) : 1. 37 (1. 23 to 1. 52)). For the end-of-life pill, interaction between the most recent time period and age group was significant. Conclusions An increasing proportion of older people reported that they could imagine desiring euthanasia or an end-of-life pill. This may imply an increased interest <b>in</b> deciding about <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> and stresses the importance to take older peoples' wishes seriously...|$|R

40|$|The {{point of}} this paper is for you to see {{universe}} invariant (UI) and universe specific (US) aspects <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life.</b> We do this by showing verses from the Bible that seem to show how the world is divided into UI and US realms. This will broaden your understanding of UI and US. We give specific examples from 22 verses and suggest 6 more verses with an additional verse as a counterexample to the previous 28 verses. The author uses verses from the New International Version (NIV) Bible and does not attempt to interpret the verses from their original languages. The author has spent many years trying to understand universe specific (US) and universe invariant (UI) things. During that search he has read many books, both fiction and non-fiction. One of the books he was reading was the Bible, and one day he ran across this verse; John 6 : 63 “The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. ” [Zondervan 1973] It is {{the first half of the}} verse that struck the author as being a US/UI statement. “The Spirit (UI) gives life; the flesh (US) counts for nothing. ” Here are our formal definitions of UI and US.

40|$|An {{experiment}} in narrative play. Ten Threaders explored an urban physical space and creatively related what they encountered via mobile to their Weavers. Weavers creatively shaped this material {{to fashion a}} collaborative story on the fly, framed by a theme of loss and connection. The Weavers On Threader’s Day, during the hours of the lost, Threaders and Weavers collaborate to recover moments of connection and loss, of missed (or not) meetings and inevitable (or not) parting. Threaders: Your path begins near Brick Lane. Use your gift to discover threads. The threads may be thin at start, as fine as an inkling or as fleet as a passing memory. Yet they pull forth deep personal moments which in turn lead to the most powerful stories in human experience, ones that partake of the mythic inevitable. On a street in London, as the sun declines, Gilgamesh pursues, Orpheus sings, Perdita boards a ship, Eurydice walks forever toward the light… as the Lady of Shalott works her loom. Weavers: The fabric a Threader stitches through is the ancient story rediscovered every time one person follows or leads another. As your Threader describes the moments and aspects of this journey to you, in spoken words and written words and in images sent from their phone, you weave these impressions into a multithreaded story, {{in concert with the}} other Weavers.
