Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E

Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow.

5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E

The Interstate runs through Wixom into Novi, where it passes to the south of the Twelve Oaks Mall.

5|$|Of {{the four}} major {{elements}} in seawater – hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine – only sodium takes on intense, short-term radioactivity {{with the addition of}} a single neutron to its nucleus: common sodium-23 becomes radioactive sodium-24, with a 15-hour half-life. In six days its intensity <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> thousandfold, but the corollary of short half-life is high initial intensity. Other isotopes were produced from seawater: hydrogen-3 (half-life 12 years) from hydrogen-2, oxygen-17 (stable) from oxygen-16, and chlorine-36 (301 thousand years) from chlorine-35, and some trace elements, but due to low abundance or low short-term intensity (long half-life) they were considered insignificant compared with sodium-24.|$|E

Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks.

Since White's pawn is now at 2e, it cannot be used to protect White's camp on the second file. Furthermore, since White cannot <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> second pawn on the second file, their defense is much weaker.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E

Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin <b>drops</b> <b>a</b> chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea.
