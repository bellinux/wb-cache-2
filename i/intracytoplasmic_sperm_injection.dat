5|$|In Series 3, Adam and Rachel seek <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) {{when they}} have trouble conceiving a child naturally.

5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{successful}} application of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) in 19781 and <b>Intracytoplasmic</b> <b>Sperm</b> <b>Injections</b> (ICSI) in 1992, 2 {{there has been a}} steady increase in the utilization of these assisted reproduction techniques (ART) to achieve pregnancy in subfertile couples. Initially, the natural menstrual cycle was allowed to recruit the ovarian follicle for IVF. The ovarian follicle is the microenvironment in which the oocyte matures. However, the lack of control of ovulation and the low propensity for a viable embryo and pregnancy after single oocyte fertilization {{led to the development of}} Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation treatment (COH) to yield more oocytes. The advantage is that COH overcomes the inefficiency of monofollicular ovulation in women and it extends the range of indications for IVF/ICSI treatment. The principal aim of COH is to stimulate growth and maturation of multiple ovarian follicles, which is achieved through the use of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) analogues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in incidence reports of rare imprinting disorders associated with assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART, including in vitro fertilization and <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injections,</b> is an important treatment for infertile people of reproductive age and increasingly produces children. The identification of epigenetic changes at imprinted loci in ART infants has led to the suggestion that ART techniques themselves may predispose embryos to acquire imprinting errors and dis-eases. In this review, we note that the particular steps of ART may be prone to induction of imprinting methylation errors during gametogenesis, fertilization and early embryonic development. In addition, we explain imprint-associated diseases and their causes. Moreover, from a Japanese nationwide epidemiological study of imprint-associated diseases, we determine their associations with ART. Epigenetic studies will be required to understand the pathogenesis, ART-related risk factor(s) and what precau-tions can be taken to prevent the occurrence of input methylation errors. We hope that the constitution of chil-dren born after each ART procedure will reveal the safest and most ethical approach to use, which will be invaluable for the future development of standard ART...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{caused by}} mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, {{is one of}} the most common autosomal recessive diseases in Caucasians. We screened for the CFTR gene mutation in a Caucasian father with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a Taiwanese mother, and twins resulting from an <b>intracytoplasmic</b> single <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) procedure. DNA fragments that showed abnormal banding patterns on temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis analysis followed by analysis of DNA sequence was used. The Caucasian father with CBAVD had ΔF 508 and p. L 375 F mutations. The two children were heterozygous for the ΔF 508 and p. L 375 F mutations, respectively. Mutation analysis of the CFTR gene should always be recommended for infertile couples seeking ICSI. The possibility of the children resulting from ICSI being a victim or carrier of CBAVD or CF, especially when the father is Caucasian with CBAVD, should be discussed during genetic counseling...|$|R

25|$|<b>Intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) {{is where}} a single sperm is {{injected}} directly into an egg. Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is to overcome male infertility problems, although {{it may also be}} used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in conjunction with sperm donation. It can be used in teratozoospermia, since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology.|$|E
25|$|Female {{infertility}} may {{be overcome}} by assisted reproduction technology, particularly embryo transfer techniques. Male infertility caused by absence of the vas deferens may be overcome with testicular sperm extraction, collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. In {{mouse and}} man Y {{chromosome}} deletions are frequently associated with spermatogenic defects. Mice with severe non-pairing Y chromosome long arm (NPYq) deficiencies are infertile in vivo and in vitro. We have previously shown that sperm from these males, although having grossly malformed heads, {{were able to}} fertilize oocytes via <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injections</b> (ICSI) and yield live offspring. However, in continuing ICSI trials we noted a reduced efficiency when cryopreserved sperm were used and with epididymal sperm as compared to testicular sperm. Our initial study tested if NPYq deficiency is associated with sperm DNA damage-a known cause of poor ICSI results. We observed that epididymal sperm from mice with severe NPYq deficiency are impaired in oocyte activation ability, and have an increased incidence of oocyte arrest and paternal chromosome breaks. Comet assays revealed increased DNA damage in both epididymal and testicular sperm, and transmission electron microscopy showed sperm having impaired membrane integrity and abnormal chromatin condensation. We therefore concluded that the increased DNA damage associated with NPYq deficiency might be a consequence of disturbed chromatin remodeling taking place during spermiogenesis. There are four distinct multi-copy genes found in the long arm of the Y chromosome. One of them, Sly, is known to control the expression of sex chromosome genes after meiosis; Sly deficiency results in a remarkable upregulation of sex chromosome genes. Sly deficiency {{has also been shown}} to be the underlying cause of sperm head anomalies and infertility associated with NPYq gene loss. We therefore hypothesized that Sly is our target gene. To test this, we examined mice with transgenically (RNAi) silenced Sly. Our analysis of Sly-deficient mice demonstrated similar 'sperm DNA damage' phenotype. This confirmed that lack of Sly is responsible for the sperm DNA damage/chromatin packaging defects observed in mice with NPYq deletions. This project provides the first evidence of DNA damage in sperm from mice with NPYq deficiencies and that the multi-copy NPYq-encoded Sly gene {{plays a key role in}} processes regulating chromatin remodeling and thus maintaining DNA integrity in sperm...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} somatic, psychomotor, and {{intellectual}} {{development of children}} conceived through <b>intracytoplasmic</b> single <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) over the whole preschool period. Design: Prospective, controlled, cohort study. Setting: Fertility clinic in Brussels, Belgium. Patient(s) : Sixty-six ICSI-conceived children prospectively compared with 52 IVF-conceived and 59 spontaneously conceived children. All children were full-term singletons. Intervention(s) : Home visits by a trained psychologist. Standardized interviews. Assessments using the revised Brunet-Lézine scale and the revised Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Physical growth and general health. Formal developmental and intellectual assessments. Result(s) : Children conceived by ICSI were healthy: no significant differences appeared {{in the incidence of}} combined congenital malformations (11. 3 %), health problems (44. 1 %), surgical interventions (18. 6 %), and hospitalizations (6. 8 %), nor for the developmental assessments (mean developmental quotient at 9 months: 93. 9; at 18 months: 102. 0). For the intellectual assessments, the between-group differences disappeared when adjusted for levels of parental education (mean intelligence quotient at 3 years: 97. 0; at 5 years: 103. 3). Conclusion(s) : This pilot study shows that throughout the preschool period, ICSI-conceived children have psychomotor and intellectual development similar to that of IVF-conceived and spontaneously conceived children. These conclusions need to be confirmed by multicenter studies. © 2003 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technology (ART) is {{the technology}} used to achieve pregnancy in procedures such as fertility medication, {{in vitro fertilization}} and surrogacy. It is reproductive technology used primarily for infertility treatments, and {{is also known as}} fertility treatment. It mainly belongs to the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and may also include <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) and cryopreservation. Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). ART is also used for couples who are discordant for certain communicable diseases; for example, HIV {{to reduce the risk of}} infection when a pregnancy is desired.|$|E
25|$|IVF {{may be used}} to {{overcome}} female infertility where it is due to problems with the fallopian tubes, making in vivo fertilisation difficult. It can also assist in male infertility, in those cases where there is a defect in sperm quality; in such situations <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) may be used, where a sperm cell is injected directly into the egg cell. This is used when sperm has difficulty penetrating the egg, and in these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. When indicated, the use of ICSI has been found to increase the success rates of IVF.|$|E
25|$|The {{sperm and}} the egg are {{incubated}} {{together at a}} ratio of about 75,000:1 in a culture media in order for the actual fertilisation to take place. A review in 2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4 hours results in significantly higher pregnancy rates than 16 to 24 hours. In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show two pronuclei. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells.|$|E

40|$|Feasibility of {{cryopreservation}} {{of mature}} human oocytes using 1, 2 -propanediol and sucrose was studied initially utiliz-ing 1 and 2 day old unfertilized oocytes. Of these 285 aged oocytes 55 % survived thawing, and 41 % of 128 oocytes inseminated by single <b>sperm</b> <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) fertilized normally. Limited embryonic development occurred in 51 % of these embryos (n = 27) observed {{for the next}} 4 days. Cryosurvival of fresh donated oocytes (n = 81) was poorer (n = 20; 24. 7 %), while fertilization (n = 13; 65 %) and embryo development (100 %) was good prior to uterine transfer on day 3. Eight oocyte recipient cycles were undertaken, in which cryopreserved donated oocytes were thawed and inseminated by ICSI. Five of these cycles reached embryo transfer, and three pregnancies were initiated though none went successfully to term.

25|$|Oocytes are {{carefully}} denudated from the cumulus cells, as these cells {{can be a}} source of contamination during the PGD if PCR-based technology is used. In the majority of the reported cycles, <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI) is used instead of IVF. The main reasons are to prevent contamination with residual sperm adhered to the zona pellucida and to avoid unexpected fertilization failure. The ICSI procedure is carried out on mature metaphase-II oocytes and fertilization is assessed 16–18 hours after. The embryo development is further evaluated every day prior to biopsy and until transfer to the woman’s uterus. During the cleavage stage, embryo evaluation is performed daily {{on the basis of the}} number, size, cell-shape and fragmentation rate of the blastomeres. On day 4, embryos were scored in function of their degree of compaction and blastocysts were evaluated according to the quality of the throphectoderm and inner cell mass, and their degree of expansion.|$|E
500|$|Many storylines {{were based}} on life {{experiences}} of the production team; Bullen and his wife Lisa had their first child in late 1997, which made Bullen identify with the Pete character, whose son is born in the first episode. Bullen incorporated his experiences of {{the first few months}} of parenthood into the Pete and Jenny storyline. Adam's testicular cancer storyline in Series 2, Episode 5 was influenced by a similar condition that afflicted Harries, and was supplemented by the newspaper columns written by terminal cancer sufferer John Diamond. If a storyline was not drawn from real life experiences, it was researched by communicating with experts; Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate for the scenes of Karen and David's marriage guidance session in Series 1, Episode 5, and consulted Dr Sammy Lee for information about Rachel's <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> in Series 3. When it was decided to have Rachel's abortion lead to her developing Asherman's syndrome in Series 3, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) were contacted.

2500|$|Embryos can {{be either}} “fresh” from fertilized egg cells of the same menstrual cycle, or “frozen”, that is they have been {{generated}} in a preceding cycle and undergone embryo cryopreservation, and are thawed {{just prior to the}} transfer, which is then termed [...] "frozen embryo transfer" [...] (FET). The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities, also between fresh versus frozen eggs used for <b>intracytoplasmic</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>injection</b> (ICSI). In fact, pregnancy rates are increased following FET, and perinatal outcomes are less affected, compared to embryo transfer in the same cycle as ovarian hyperstimulation was performed. The endometrium is believed to not be optimally prepared for implantation following ovarian hyperstimulation, and therefore frozen embryo transfer avails for a separate cycle to focus on optimizing the chances of successful implantation. Children born from vitrified blastocysts have significantly higher birthweight than those born from non-frozen blastocysts. When transferring a frozen-thawed oocyte, the chance of pregnancy is essentially the same whether it is transferred in a natural cycle or one with ovulation induction.|$|E
