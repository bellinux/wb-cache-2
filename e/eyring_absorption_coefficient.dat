Numerical comparisons are carried out for three geometrical configurations (a proportionate room, a corridor and a flat enclosure). Comparisons with the statistical theory and a ray-tracing software show that the modified boundary condition increases {{the accuracy of the}} diffusion model in term of reverberation time in all the simulated configurations. An experimental comparison {{in the case of a}} non-uniformly absorbent room (a reverberation chamber covered with patches of glass wool) is also carried out. The modified-diffusion model results match well with the ray-tracing ones. Both models are in agreement with the experimental data for most of third octave bands (discrepancy close to or below 10 %). However, some discrepancies up to 40 % can also be observed in a few octave bands, probably due to experimental considerations and to the modal behaviour of the room at low frequencies.

Materials and Methods: Mineral wool was used to find noise <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Random and normal sound <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> values were predicted. Then, the measures of transmission loss calculated as an overall value, for applied absorbent material and bare sheet metal.
