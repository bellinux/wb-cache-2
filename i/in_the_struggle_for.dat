5|$|By July 27 all the Mun'gyong divide was in North Korean {{possession}} and their units were {{moving into the}} valley of the upper Naktong in the vicinity of Hamch'ang. Prisoners taken at the time and others captured later said that the NK 1st Division suffered 5,000 casualties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> control of the divide, including the division commander who was wounded and replaced.

It was part of a concentrated attack by North Korean troops aiming to push the UN forces south before they had time to organize an effective defensive line.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the eighth century, the Northumbrian {{succession}} included a long series of murdered and deposed kings, as several royal lines contended for the throne. The main lines were those of Eadberht, Æthelwald Moll and Alhred. In the eight years before Eardwulf's accession, all three of these dynastic lines were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> kingship: on 23 September 788, King Ælfwald I, grandson of Eadberht, was murdered by the patricius Sicga near Hexham, and Ælfwald's cousin Osred became king.

5|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Darwin's theory in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Struggle</b> <b>for</b> Life is often considered the central {{event in the}} history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous Vestiges of Creation had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and common descent {{by the end of the}} 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind the}} Finnish Civil War was World War I; the Russian Empire {{collapsed}} under {{the pressures of}} the war, leading to the February and October Revolutions in 1917. The breakdown caused a large power vacuum and subsequent power struggle in Eastern Europe. The Grand Duchy of Finland, a part of the Russian Empire since 1809, became embroiled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> power. Geopolitically less important than the continental Moscow-Warsaw gateway, the northerly Finnish ground, isolated by the Baltic sea was a peaceful sidefront until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had indirect effects on the Finns. Since the end of 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of raw materials, industrial products, food and labor for the growing Imperial Russian capital Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasized the role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less marked northern section of the Estonian–Finnish gateway and buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the Narva area, the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus.|$|E
