5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than <b>judicial</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage of}} the Norris-La Guardia Act {{signified}} {{a victory for the}} American Federation of Labor, which had been lobbying Congress to pass it for slightly more than five years.

In 1503 the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) was founded to control migration to the New World, which was restricted to old Christians especially families and women. In addition, the Casa de Contratación took charge of the fiscal organization, and of the organization and <b>judicial</b> <b>control</b> of the trade with the Indies.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th {{century the}} River Doon {{is thought to}} have {{represented}} the physical boundary between the kingdoms of the Scots and that of Galloway. Alloway therefore, situated as it is in South Kyle, was on the border with Carrick and after the defeat of the Galloway forces a peace agreement was reached 1186. At this time a number of ringwork castles were erected at Dunduff and Greenan, suggesting that Alloway Mote was built at this time to help impose the royal control at this old boundary, in line with the introduction of feudal control of the area. Ayr Castle was built in 1197 and the focus of military and <b>judicial</b> <b>control</b> shifted to Ayr resulting in the abandonment of Alloway Mote.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of a few isolated cases, serfdom had ceased to exist in France by the 15th century. In early modern France, nobles nevertheless maintained a great number of seigneurial privileges over the free peasants that worked lands under their control. They could, for example, levy the cens tax, an annual tax on lands leased or held by vassals. Nobles could also charge banalités for the right to use the lord's mills, ovens, or wine presses. Alternatively, a noble could demand a portion of vassals' harvests in return for permission to farm land he owned. Nobles also maintained certain judicial rights over their vassals, although with the rise of the modern state many of these privileges had passed to state control, leaving rural nobility with only local police functions and <b>judicial</b> <b>control</b> over violation of their seigneurial rights.|$|E
25|$|Keenly {{aware of}} the need to seize the {{initiative}} and to get the process under firm <b>judicial</b> <b>control,</b> de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister François de Menthon to lead the Legal Purge (Épuration légale) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy {{in order to keep the}} country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences. Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down. It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and René Bousquet—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the constitutional courts {{is regarded as the}} main demand for democratic states; the regular courts and high court of justice in Jordan have delivered many several decisions that insist on the issue of judicial review on the constitutionality of law and administrative actions. The present study comprises a number of sections. The first section, general notion on democracy and <b>judicial</b> <b>controlling</b> in Jordan, is statement of the study problems, purposes and significance of the study and the methodology applied by the researchers. Democracy under the constitution of Jordan and the main features of democracy in this constitution are undertaken in the second section. The third section aims to acquaint the reader with the structure of the judiciary and the national standers pertaining to judicial independence and rule of law in Jordan. The fourth section evaluates the judicial review under the constitution of Jordan and the national charter, while section five examines respectively the role of judiciary in defending human rights of Jordanian citizens and the norms of judicial independence and rule of law in Jordan.   The sixth section highlights the issue of constitutional court and the judicial reform in Jordan. The subject of <b>judicial</b> review, <b>control</b> of the constitutionality laws and types of the constitutional review as well judiciary's attitude towards judicial review in Jordan is discussed deeply in the seventh section. Finally, section eight, conclusion and recommendation to the issue of democracy and <b>judicial</b> <b>controlling</b> in Jordan. This study suggests that the violable constitutional court in Jordan should be provided by the constitution as it is included in the national charter, 1992 which requires a new constitutional amendment. The court should be completely independent and separated from any type of controlling of other courts, either regular or administrative. It also recommends that the court should be interlay constituted from experienced, impartial and talented judges with long term of service and should exercise equally progressive role in intervening power politics and that more precautions may be taken for the court. </p...|$|R

500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} calls for the system to be reformed or replaced. [...] As early as 1997, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) called for China to allow <b>judicial</b> <b>control</b> over detentions; in 2000, the UN Committee Against Torture recommended that all forms of administrative detention, including re-education through labor, be abolished; in 2004, the WGAD called {{for the establishment of}} rights to due process and counsel for individuals detained; and in 2005, the Special Rapporteur on Torture called for the outright abolition of re-education through labor. [...] The prominent deaths of two inmates in spring 2003 prompted many calls within China for reform of the system, but reform did not happen immediately, though The China Daily reported that there was [...] "general consensus" [...] that reform was needed. [...] In March 2007, however, the Chinese government did announce that it would abolish the re-education through labor system {{and replace it with a}} more lenient set of laws. [...] According to the proposal, the maximum sentence would be lowered from four years to 18 months; re-education centers would be renamed [...] "correction centers" [...] and have their fences and gates removed. [...] A month later, Chongqing municipality passed a law allowing lawyers to offer legal counsel in re-education through labor cases.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{justification of}} jury equity {{is taken from}} the final few pages of Lord Devlin's book [...] "Trial by Jury". Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is [...] "the lamp that shows that freedom lives" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "little parliament". The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control. Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor <b>judicial</b> <b>control</b> are set in stone.|$|E
40|$|Like {{some other}} new democracies, Taiwan has {{transformed}} from a developmental state to a regulatory state with increasing procedural rationality and substantive legal controls. However, the driving forces for such a profound change and its consequences remain to be explored further and addressed against the backdrops of Taiwan’s development context as wel as the global trend. This paper argues that the shift to regulatory state took place in Taiwan not {{as a result of}} explicit government policies, but as an inevitable consequence of democratization. Major legislation facilitating the forming of a regulatory state was introduced in the backdrop of democratization in the 1990 s in parallel with certain pressures from international network. Increasing <b>judicial</b> <b>controls</b> over regulatory matters were made possible by legislative enactments triggered by democratization. More importantly, institutional constraints on the regulatory state bears strong procedural nature as demonstrated by both major legislation and court rulings. This process-centric feature enjoys the potency of developing a dialectic regulator...|$|R

2500|$|Alfred Vagts {{had already}} begun the {{discussion}} from an historical point of view, concentrating on the German/Prussian military experience. He was perhaps most influential with his definition of militarism, which he described as the state of a society that [...] "ranks military institutions and ways above the prevailing attitudes of civilian life and carries the military mentality into the civilian sphere." [...] Louis Smith, whose work pre-dated Huntington's, discussed issues of congressional and <b>judicial</b> <b>control</b> over the military as well as executive civilian control of military matters. However, all that discussion predated a general recognition that the American experience {{was going to change}} in the post-World War II era. Once it became apparent that the American military was going to maintain historically high levels of active-duty personnel, concerns about the differences between civilian and military cultures quickly came to the forefront. The ensuing debate can be generally divided into three periods with different emphases in each.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the European Commission’s Proposal for a Council Directive implementing a financial transaction tax through the enhanced cooperation procedure published on February 14, 2013. It starts by providing a brief description {{and analysis of the}} Proposal and the accompanying Impact Assessment, focusing on the newly added features of the proposed tax and its potential impact on both participating and non-participating Member States. Next, the {{article examines}} the Proposal from the perspective of public international law, discussing the controversial extraterritorial reach of the proposed tax. It is argued that doubts exist with respect to the compatibility of the “contagion effect” and the issuance principle with internationally recognised legal principles. The article then turns to EU law and considers the legal requirements imposed by the EU Treaties on the use of enhanced cooperation. Whilst raising some concerns in relation to the Proposal’s compliance with these requirements, the article concludes that the political and <b>judicial</b> <b>controlling</b> mechanisms in place appear weak and therefore the outcome of any potential political or judicial challenge remains uncertain. The importance of this debate {{is not limited to the}} financial transaction tax, but also extends to the use of enhanced cooperation in other areas of taxation and beyond...|$|R
