5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> {{part of the}} protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation of rocky planetesimals. Such conditions are thought to exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|Another high-inclination group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> {{part of the}} {{asteroid}} belt is the Phocaea family.

5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear. The movement of liquids within {{the inner ear}} is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
