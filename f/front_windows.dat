5|$|In 1968, the {{education}} {{building of the}} new complex was bombed {{by members of the}} Ku Klux Klan. Pieces of glass were salvaged from the destruction and are now incorporated into the <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> of the current synagogue building. The congregation owns and maintains a historic cemetery at 19th Street and 15th Avenue which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of the cabin just above the three <b>front</b> <b>windows.</b> Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their <b>front</b> <b>windows.</b> This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} events to {{publicize}} the debris problem occurred on Challenger's second flight, STS-7. A fleck of paint struck its <b>front</b> <b>window,</b> creating a pit over 1 mm wide. On STS-59 in 1994, Endeavour's <b>front</b> <b>window</b> was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.|$|R

25|$|The glass {{bulkheads}} {{behind the}} driving cabs were another {{casualty of the}} refurbishment - passengers {{could no longer see}} the driver's view through the <b>front</b> <b>windows.</b> Following refurbishment, units were repainted in the striking new orange and black livery introduced by the newly created Strathclyde PTE.|$|E
25|$|The {{stained glass}} that {{formerly}} {{stood in the}} side windows was removed to allow the congregation to view the surrounding buildings, {{in order to facilitate}} a sense of attachment to the community. The panels are now displayed in the <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> of the Cathedral's Patterson Education Center.|$|E
25|$|Only {{after the}} 1920s German {{inflation}} was over Großprofil cars could finally be ordered. In 1924, the first 16 multiple units and 8 normal passenger cars were delivered. Because they had big elliptical <b>front</b> <b>windows,</b> they were commonly called Tunneleulen ("tunnel owls"). The cars were 13.15 meters long and had 3 double sliding doors. This series was called BI.|$|E

25|$|It was {{released}} mainly with three trim levels: E, S and SE. The latter had air conditioning, wheel covers, body-colored bumpers, rear spoiler, fog lights and a stereo, with optional {{features such as}} roof rails, power steering, central locking, electric <b>front</b> <b>windows,</b> ABS and driver airbag. In certain markets it was also available with an automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|When built, {{the driving}} cabs had {{distinctive}} wrap-around <b>front</b> <b>windows,</b> although these {{were replaced by}} flat, toughened glass in the 1970s to better protect drivers following some incidents of stone-throwing vandalism. Glass partitions behind the cabs allowed passengers {{in the front and}} rearmost carriages to see the drivers' view of the track. This was particularly appreciated in the scenic riverside areas around Craigendoran and Helensburgh.|$|E
25|$|Some fire {{experts have}} {{questioned}} why the exterior <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> {{were taken out}} by firefighters while crews were committed inside, an action that could have increased the amount of oxygen being fed to the fire and drawn flames {{to the front of}} the store. Assistant Fire Chief Larry Garvin stated that fire blew out the windows, at which time firefighters broke open more windows to allow firefighters to escape.|$|E

25|$|In 1953 and 1954, Bel Airs {{could be}} ordered in convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door sedans, and, for 1954, the Beauville station wagon which {{featured}} woodgrain trim {{around the side}} windows. Many new options, once available only to more expensive luxury cars, became offered starting in 1953, including power steering and the Guidematic headlight dimmer in 1953; and power brakes, power 2-way front seat and power <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.|$|E
25|$|The Flight cost £10,380 {{and offered}} {{electric}} <b>front</b> <b>windows,</b> a three-speed fan and a cassette player. For an additional £1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, a CD player, fog lamps and metallic paint. The more competitive prices {{managed to keep}} European Escort sales going until the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and {{the sale of the}} plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September, closed-circuit {{television}} (CCTV) video was handed to and then released by Victoria Police. The video was handed {{to them by}} {{an employee of the}} Duchess Boutique, a bridal shop based on Sydney Road near Hope Street. It had been recorded from within the shop but had a limited view of the street through its <b>front</b> <b>windows.</b> It thus showed her speaking to a man in a blue hoodie at around 1:42 am on the night she disappeared. At one point she brandishes her mobile phone at him. The man had also been filmed walking outside the shop four minutes earlier. This was the last known time that Meagher was captured on camera.|$|E

25|$|In Romania, it was {{initially}} available with four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition. The basic level Ambiance featured driver airbag, body-colored bumpers, wheel trims and central locking. The second level Preference added passenger airbag, power steering, electric <b>front</b> <b>windows,</b> radio, two rear seat head restraints and remote locking. The third level Laureate added front fog lights, air conditioning, trip computer, electric mirrors, three rear seat head restraints and a multi-adjustable driver seat. The top level Ambition also had ABS, electric rear windows, CD player and alloy wheels. The 1.6-litre gasoline engine was available {{only on the}} Preference level and above. In September 2005, the 1.5-litre diesel engine was introduced, initially not being available on the Ambition level. In January 2006, a new intermediate trim level called Laureate Plus was added, which {{in addition to the}} Laureate level featured ABS, electric rear windows and CD player. Also, the diesel engine became available for the Ambition level.|$|E
25|$|Simeon Simpson's son Alexander Simpson, who {{was then}} owner of the company, {{decided he wanted to}} find a 'window' for Simpson clothes in the heart of London. He founded Simpsons of Piccadilly when the Geological Museum had closed and the site to be auctioned. The new {{building}} was designed by architect Joseph Emberton as a new and revolutionary retail establishment, the shop <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> exhibited the first curved glass display in Great Britain and the largest in the world at the time, these were designed so that no reflection would be cast to obscure the displays inside. The outstanding feature of the shop's interior was the travertine staircase that ran up through the centre of the store lit by a continuous window up the height of the building. The current lighting structure suspended through the staircase centre is the original from the 1930s as the building has since become a listed building.|$|E
25|$|In the April 19 episode, Perino read a {{prepared}} statement about O'Reilly's dismissal equivalent {{to what the}} network had released earlier in the day. The reasons for his firing and the sexual harassment allegations were {{not mentioned in the}} program itself. The termination of employment of the former host was a major feature of news coverage on both MSNBC and CNN; outside of the prepared statements, it was not mentioned on-air during the program and other regular topics were covered. The following day, images of the host were removed from the <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> of the News Corp. Building. O'Reilly was not given an opportunity to sign-off on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him. During the final episode Gutfield spoke about the program's legacy and the loyalty of the show's staff after a segment with Tucker Carlson, followed by a fading of the stage's lighting to a dark state, revealing the set now blank of anything identifying the show.|$|E
