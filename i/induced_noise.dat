500|$|The 147 is the [...] "universal" [...] {{version of}} the 122, {{designed}} for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and motor speed control, but is otherwise identical. The signal input is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The motor speed switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than the DC voltage control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to <b>induced</b> <b>noise,</b> and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed.

5000|$|Typical {{professional}} audio sources, such as microphones, have three-pin XLR connectors. One is {{the shield}} or chassis ground, {{while the other}} two are signal connections. These signal wires carry two copies of the same signal, but with opposite polarity. (They are often termed [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cold," [...] and the AES14-1992(r2004) Standard EIA Standard RS-297-A suggest that the pin that carries the positive signal that results from a positive air pressure on a transducer will be deemed 'hot'. Pin 2 has been designated as the 'hot' pin, and that designation serves useful for keeping a consistent polarity {{in the rest of the}} system.) Since these conductors travel the same path from source to destination, the assumption is that any interference is induced upon both conductors equally. The appliance receiving the signals compares the difference between the two signals (often with disregard to electrical ground) allowing the appliance to ignore any induced electrical noise. Any <b>induced</b> <b>noise</b> would be present in equal amounts and in identical polarity on each of the balanced signal conductors, so the two signals’ difference from each other would be unchanged. The successful rejection of <b>induced</b> <b>noise</b> from the desired signal depends in part on the balanced signal conductors receiving the same amount and type of interference. This typically leads to twisted, braided, or co-jacketed cables for use in balanced signal transmission.|$|E

50|$|A {{balanced}} line allows a differential receiver {{to reduce the}} noise on a connection by rejecting common-mode interference.

If {{balanced line}} is used in an unbalanced circuit, with different impedances from each conductor to ground, currents induced in the separate conductors will cause different voltage drops to ground, thus creating a voltage differential, making the line more susceptible to noise.
