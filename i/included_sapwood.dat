30|$|Sugi boxed-heart square timber at two source heights {{for five}} cultivars {{exhibited}} different surface checks. HWP and tangential shrinkage were the factors affecting the surface-check variation. The timber that <b>included</b> the <b>sapwood</b> at its outer part was susceptible to surface check {{due to the}} large drying stresses between the sapwood and heartwood. Timber having a large tangential shrinkage and a high MOE due to small MFA {{is likely to have}} longer surface checks and small bow.|$|R
40|$|Many of the Loch Tay crannogs {{were built}} in the Early Iron Age and so {{calibration}} of the radiocarbon ages produces very broad calendar age ranges due to the well-documented Hallstatt plateau in the calibration curve. However, the large oak timbers that were used in the construction of some of the crannogs potentially provide a means of improving the precision of the dating through subdividing them into decadal or subdecadal increments, dating them to high precision and wiggle-matching the resulting data to the master 14 C calibration curve. We obtained a sample from 1 oak timber from Oakbank Crannog comprising 70 rings (Sample OB 06 WMS 1, T 103) <b>including</b> <b>sapwood</b> that was complete to the bark edge. The timber is situated on the northeast edge of the main living area of the crannog and as a large and strong oak pile would have been a useful support in more than 1 phase of occupation and {{may be related to the}} earliest construction phase of the site. This was sectioned into 5 -yr increments and dated to a precision of approximately ± 8 – 16 14 C yr (1 &# 963;). The wiggle-match predicts that the last ring dated was formed around 500 BC (maximum range of 520 – 465 BC) and should be taken as indicative of the likely time of construction of Oakbank Crannog. This is a considerable improvement on the estimates based on single 14 C ages made on oak samples, which typically encompassed the period from around 800 – 400 BC...|$|R
40|$|Tree stems shrink in {{diameter}} {{during the day}} and swell during the night in response to changes in water tension in the xylem. Stem shrinkage can easily be measured in a nondestructive way, to derive continuous information about tree water status. The relationship between the strain and the change in water tension can be evaluated by empirical calibrations, or can be related to the structure of the plant. A mechanical analysis was performed to make this relationship explicit. The stem is modeled as a cylinder made of multiple layers of tissues, <b>including</b> heartwood, <b>sapwood,</b> and inner and outer bark. The effect of changes in water tension on the apparent strain at the surface of a tissue is quantified as a function of parameters defining stem anatomy and the mechanical properties of the tissues. Various possible applications in the context of tree physiology are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Wijk bij Duurstede {{is built}} {{on top of the}} Early Medieval {{settlement}} Dorestad. In 2008 ‘Veilingterrein’, an area adjoining the former port area, was excavated. Among the finds were 50 water wells. For this study two of these wells were investigated at the Cultural Heritage Agency (lab Stichting RING/RCE). One water well was made of a discarded cask made of 23 oak staves and a piece of beech. Samples were taken from the staves and the tree rings measured. The staves were found to originate from one single tree. Synchronising the data from all staves created a series of 111 tree rings, <b>including</b> 11 <b>sapwood</b> rings. This series did not match reliably with the reference chronologies. Cross-dating individual staves with the chronologies was not successful either. The piece of beech could not be dated dendrochronologically. The second water-well, a hollowed-out oak, was sampled, the synchronised measurements totalled 92 rings, no sapwood was present. The wood did not match with the reference chronologies...|$|R
40|$|CABI: 20153174020 Understanding how {{plants are}} {{constructed}} - i. e., how key size dimensions {{and the amount}} of mass invested in different tissues varies among individuals - is essential for modeling plant growth, carbon stocks, and energy fluxes in the terrestrial biosphere. Allocation patterns can differ through ontogeny, but also among coexisting species and among species adapted to different environments. While a variety of models dealing with biomass allocation exist, we lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying processes. This is partly {{due to the lack of}} suitable data sets for validating and parameterizing models. To that end, we present the Biomass And Allometry Database (BAAD) for woody plants. The BAAD contains 259634 measurements collected in 176 different studies, from 21084 individuals across 678 species. Most of these data come from existing publications. However, raw data were rarely made public at the time of publication. Thus, the BAAD contains data from different studies, transformed into standard units and variable names. The transformations were achieved using a common workflow for all raw data files. Other features that distinguish the BAAD are: (i) measurements were for individual plants rather than stand averages; (ii) individuals spanning a range of sizes were measured; (iii) plants from 0. 01 - 100 m in height were included; and (iv) biomass was estimated directly, i. e., not indirectly via allometric equations (except in very large trees where biomass was estimated from detailed sub-sampling). We included both wild and artificially grown plants. The data set contains the following size metrics: total leaf area; area of stem cross-section <b>including</b> <b>sapwood,</b> heartwood, and bark; height of plant and crown base, crown area, and surface area; and the dry mass of leaf, stem, branches, sapwood, heartwood, bark, coarse roots, and fine root tissues. We also report other properties of individuals (age, leaf size, leaf mass per area, wood density, nitrogen content of leaves and wood), as well as information about the growing environment (location, light, experimental treatment, vegetation type) where available. It is our hope that making these data available will improve our ability to understand plant growth, ecosystem dynamics, and carbon cycling in the world's vegetation...|$|R
30|$|The {{feasibility}} of identifying internal wood characteristics in computed tomography (CT) images of black spruce was investigated using two promising classifiers: the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) {{and the back}} propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. Nine image features including one spectral feature (gray level values), a distance feature, and seven textural features were employed to develop the classifiers. The selected internal wood characteristics to be identified <b>included</b> heartwood, <b>sapwood,</b> bark, and knots. Twenty cross-sectional CT images of a black spruce log were randomly selected to develop the two classifiers. The results suggest that both classifiers produced high classification accuracy. Compared with the MLC classifier (80.9 % overall accuracy), the BP ANN classifier had better classification performance (97.6 % overall accuracy). Moreover, statistical analysis reveals that the heartwood of the black spruce log {{used in this study}} is the easiest to identify by either classifier compared with the other three log features. The results also suggest that the separability of one wood characteristic from the other wood characteristics in black spruce CT images is mainly related to moisture content.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{literature}} on the formation of heartwood and on the components that affect natural durability. It includes discussion about the function of heartwood in living trees, factors influencing the natural durability of heartwood, the process of heartwood formation, and variations in heartwood quantity and quality. Heartwood formation is a regular occurrence in tree stems, and heartwood may have many different properties from <b>sapwood,</b> <b>including</b> natural decay resistance. A {{greater understanding of the}} heartwood formation process could allow control of heartwood production. Recent research involving enzymatic analyses have provided valuable insight into the biochemical processes involved in heartwood formation. Further study of the role natural durability plays in living trees would help to bring together many of the disparate strands of research relating to heartwood...|$|R
30|$|Three {{specimens}} {{were randomly}} selected from each treatment group for the laboratory termite tests. The total number of termite test specimens was 15 <b>including</b> the sugi <b>sapwood</b> reference material. Each specimen was placed {{at the center of the}} plaster bottom of a cylindrical test container 6  cm in depth ×  8  cm in diameter. A total of 150 workers and 15 soldiers of Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki were collected from a laboratory colony, which was harvested from Okayama Prefecture and had been maintained for more than 10  years in the Deterioration Organisms Laboratory (DOL) of RISH at Uji campus of Kyoto University. The collected termites were immediately transferred into each test container according to JIS K 1571 [17]. The assembled containers were placed on a water-moistened cotton pad and stored in the dark at 28  ±  2  °C and a RH of more than 80 % for 3 weeks. The percent of mass loss (mass difference at the end of the test), termite mortality (number of live termites at the end of the test) and consumption rates (the amount of the composite consumed per worker-termite day during the test period) were also determined.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} progressive changes in patterns of cavitation in the sapwood of three species of conifer (Larix kaempferi, Abies sachalinensis, and Picea jezoensis) that were growing in a sub-frigid zone. In all three conifers, all tracheids of the newly forming outermost annual ring were filled with water or cytoplasm {{during the period from}} May to August. However, many tracheids in the transition zone from earlywood to latewood lost water in September, presumably through drought-induced cavitation. Cavitated tracheids tended to be continuously distributed in a tangential direction. Subsequently, some earlywood tracheids of the outermost annual ring lost water during the period from January to March. This was associated with freeze-thaw cycles. In the second and third annual rings from the cambium of all three conifers, the lumina of most tracheids in the transition zone from earlywood to latewood contained no water. In contrast, some latewood tracheids near the annual ring boundary and many earlywood tracheids retained water in their lumina. The third annual ring had more cavitated tracheids than the second annual ring. Our observations indicated that cavitation progressed gradually in the tracheids of the conifers and that they were never refilled once cavitation had occurred. The region involved in water transport in conifers did not <b>include</b> the entire <b>sapwood</b> and differed among annual rings...|$|R
