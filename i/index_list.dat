We presents a novel hybrid index structure that aims at decreasing the number of <b>index</b> <b>lists</b> retrieved at query processing time, trading off a reduced number of <b>index</b> <b>lists</b> for an increased number of bytes to read. Our experiments demonstrate significant cold-cache performance gains of almost 25 % on standard benchmark queries...|$|R
