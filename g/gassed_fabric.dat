40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} gas hydrate bearing sediment {{is a possible}} trigger for huge tsunami generating slides on continental margins, but little is known of gas hydrates mechanical behavior in sediment. Here a method is proposed to simulate the behavior of gas hydrate in sediment on the pore scale using the Distinct Element Method (DEM). The simulation is founded on the surface energy, which is the cause for the forces exerted by growing crystals. The simulation uses attractive particle interaction and random particle agitation to generate a surface tensed material. The method is calibrated and validated {{by a series of}} different experiments. Gas hydrate growth is simulated in an oedometer. The influence of the host sediment <b>fabric</b> on <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>fabric</b> is investigated in a series of element tests and compared to natural <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R

Few fabrics can survive in the acidic and high temperature environment encountered in coal-fired boiler flue gas.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore a new method for testing the fabric {{abrasion}} resistance, a homemade abrasion tester is designed and manufactured. The principle, structure and test method of the homemade abrasion tester are introduced. The crease points on fabrics are rubbed using the abrasion tester under certain air pressure and the abrasion of fabrics is reflected on real time through the change of gas flow. The change of gas flow is converted into equivalent aperture by Bernoulli equation and the equivalent aperture is {{used to evaluate the}} abrasion resistance of the crease point on fabric. Three measuring parameters of friction velocity, <b>gas</b> pressure and <b>fabric</b> thickness influencing on the abrasion resistance of crease point on down fabrics are tested by orthogonal experiment. The influence of the three elements on the abrasion resistance is analyzed. The results show that the homemade abrasion tester can represent the abrasion resistance of crease point under certain conditions. The <b>gas</b> pressure and <b>fabric</b> thickness have significant influence on the abrasion resistance, but the influence of friction velocity is not significant. Above all, the gas pressure has the most high influence. The research result prevides reference for improving the abrasion resistance of crease points on down fabrics...|$|R

40|$|Drilling on Hydrate Ridge, {{offshore}} Oregon, during ODP Leg 204 {{enabled us}} to investigate <b>fabrics</b> of <b>gas</b> hydrate samples in a wide depth range of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). X-ray computerized tomographic imaging on whole-round samples, frozen in liquid nitrogen, revealed that layered gas hydrate structures are related to variable processes occurring at different sediment depths. Shallow gas hydrates often form layers parallel or sub-parallel to bedding and also crosscut sedimentary strata and other gas hydrate layers, destroying the original depositional fabric. The dynamic processes interacting with this complicated plumbing system in this shallow environment are responsible for such highly variable <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>fabrics.</b> Gas hydrate layers deeper in the sediments are most often dipping with various angles, and are interpreted as gas hydrate precipitates filling tectonic fractures.

50|$|Prior to the Great Depression, in the 1920s, {{the city}} of New Bedford, {{along with many other}} {{northern}} textile towns had their own depression. During this time, four of the city's factories closed down. The following decade almost two dozen closed. Wamsutta, however, increased its sales in 1925 while others were liquidating and closing. By 1935, their sheets were henceforth known as Supercale instead of percale. Additionally, they manufactured a new product called Lustercale, a blend of 60% cotton and 40% high strength Avril rayon. This blend feels like cotton but is somewhat softer. At some point Wamsutta changed the fiber content of Lustercale to 100% cotton. They also created the perfect weave for sails on sailing ships. Furthermore, because of the wars, they created tailored their products for hot air balloons, <b>gas</b> mask <b>fabric,</b> military uniforms, and supplies. Many other fabric types were created for many other purposes and to this day Wamsutta remains a household name for fabrics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper details {{results of}} an initial study into the {{feasibility}} of using the mechanical milling process {{as a means of}} embedding catalyst particles into fabric filters for improved pollution control. The specific combinations of catalysts and filters used in the study to demonstrate the method are currently being explored for use in the energy generation industry to help remove elemental mercury from flue <b>gases.</b> Circular <b>fabric</b> samples were placed in a hardened steel milling vial along with a number of PMMA milling balls. Catalyst powder and, in some cases, a solvent (water or 70 % isopropyl alcohol) were added and the vial milled for 40 minutes. The fabric samples were then dried and subjected to airflow conditions typical for fabric filters in powerplant baghouses. Weight measurements were used to determine the amount of catalyst retained in the fabric at each stage. Results show that fabric type, number of milling balls used, catalyst powder/fabric mass ratio, particle size and the presence of a solvent can all affect the degree of catalyst loading. The embedded particles adhere well through a number of forward/back pulse cycles simulating airflow conditions in a powerplant baghouse. Modifications are needed to scale such a process to production levels but the current limitations are not insurmountable...|$|R
40|$|Actual {{operating}} {{results have been}} used to empirically determine the relationship between fabric filter (baghouse) differential pressure and stack gas flow in a reverse <b>gas</b> cleaned <b>fabric</b> filter. Assumptions are made that the tubesheet pressure drop is the sum of the pressure loss across the filter media and the dust cake. The dust cake is comprised of a component that remains on the bag after cleaning and a removable component that accumulates between cleaning cycles. The component that accumulates between cleaning is proportionate to the inlet dust concentration, the filter velocity and the time between cleaning. This relationship was examined with conventional fiberglass filter bags and with filter bags that have an ePTFE membrane laminated to the woven fiberglass. On average, the results show a 41 % decrease in fabric filter drag that allowed actual stack gas flow to increase by 5 % and baghouse pressure differential to decrease by 39 %. Results suggest the lower drag is attributable to improved ash removal from the bag during cleaning and not due to lower resistance through the filter media itself. Maximum electric power generation increased by 2. 8 % during the peak summer demand period due to the higher gas flow achieved with the ePTFE membrane bags. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMagma degassing, {{characterized}} {{by changes in}} permeability and porosity distribution, has a crucial control on the style of eruption. During ascent, magma might develop large porosities and crystallise while it is subjected to shear. Shear, in turn, enhances complex fabrics that result from the reorganization of the different phases (crystals, <b>gas,</b> melt). Such <b>fabrics</b> {{have not yet been}} evaluated experimentally on a 3 -phase system. We performed torsion experiments on a synthetic crystal-rich hydrous magma at subsolidus conditions with 11 vol. % porosity to establish a link between strain partitioning and porosity redistribution. Crystals induce non-Newtonian deformation, resulting in localization of the shear strain. 3 -D microtomography and 2 -D Scanning Electron Microprobe (SEM) imaging show gas accumulation in local microstructures caused by shear-induced crystal fabric. Our data show that strain localization is a mechanism that could enable magma degassing at very low vesicularity...|$|R

40|$|Hydrate Ridge {{is part of}} the accretionary {{complex at}} the Cascadia margin and is an area of {{widespread}} carbonate precipitation induced by the expulsion of methane-rich fluids. All carbonates on Hydrate Ridge are related to the methanecarbon pool either through anaerobic methanotrophy or through methanogenesis. Several petrographically distinct lithologies occur in boulder fields or in massive autochtonous chemoherm complexes which include methane-associated diagenetic mudstones and venting-induced breccias. The mudstones result from methane diagenesis in different sediment horizons and geochemical environments related to very slow methane venting. Cemented bioturbation casts occur as fragments, complex framework or as clasts together with bivalve shells as part of intraformational breccias, which are restricted to chemoherm complexes. Here, fluids ascend from the sub-seafloor and support aragonite-dominated carbonate precipitation near or at the sediment surface. Voids within mudclast breccias are either aragonite-rich indicating a formation near the surface at vent sites or are cemented by dolomite, which indicates formation in deeper parts of the sediment column. Brecciation is caused by tectonic or slump processes. In addition, we recognized a direct relationship between gas hydrates and sediment fracturing as well as the oxygen isotope composition of carbonate lithologies. Such gas hydrate-associated carbonates either show layered megapores and veins as relics of the original <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>fabric</b> or consist of aragonite-cemented intraclast breccias formed by growing and decomposing gas hydrate near the sediment surface.

40|$|In dry and {{spray-dry}} flue <b>gas</b> desulfurization, a <b>fabric</b> filter significantly {{improves the}} removal of SO,. This report describes the reactivity of a deposited absorbent particle layer with SO 2 by three reactivity parameters in a semi-empirical model. These parameters for four different lime hydrates were obtained from fixed-bed reactor experiments by regression analysis. The SO, removal in a fabric filter was then theoretically predicted. Results obtained with this method are in good agreement with pilot scale findings reported in the recent literature. The reactivity measurement followed by simulation procedure described here {{can be used to}} predict the influence of design and operating variables on the SO, removal in a fabric filter. The particulate absorbent at the fabric filter inlet in a dry or spray-dry (SDA) flue gas desulfurization process (FGD) plant might consist of fly ash, calcium hydroxide, calcium sulphite hemi-hydrate, calcium sulphated-hydrate, calcium carbonate, and free liquid water. The amount of liquid water is dependent on the type of FGD process. In the case of an SDA process, the amount of liquid water is generally about 2. 5 percent at an approach-tosaturation at the reactor outlet of 15 Â°C.

40|$|The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAs) {{require the}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to {{determine}} whether the presence of mercury and 188 other trace substances, referred to as air toxics or hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), in the stack emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility power plants poses an unacceptable public health risk (1). The EPA's conclusions and recommendations were presented in two reports: Mercury Study Report to Congress and Study of Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions from Electric Utility Steam Generating Units-Final Report to Congress. The first congressional report addressed both human health and the environmental effects of anthropogenic mercury emissions, while the second report addressed the risk to public health posed by emissions of HAPs from steam electricity-generating units. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is also required by the CAAAs to investigate mercury and determine a safe threshold level of exposure. Recently the National Academy of Sciences has also been commissioned by Congress to complete a report, based the available scientific evidence, regarding safe threshold levels of mercury exposure. Although the EPA reports did not state that mercury controls on coal-fired electric power stations should be required given {{the current state of the}} art, they did indicate that EPA views mercury as a potential threat to human health. It is likely that major sources of mercury emissions, including fossil-fired combustion systems, will be controlled at some point. In fact, municipal waste combustion units are already regulated. In anticipation of additional control measures, much research has been done (and continues) regarding the development of control technologies for mercury emitted from stationary sources to the atmosphere. Most approaches taken to date involve sorbent injection technologies or improve upon removal of mercury using existing technologies such as flue <b>gas</b> desulfurization scrubbers, <b>fabric</b> filters, and electrostatic precipitators. Depending on the fly ash chemistry and the form of mercury present in the flue gas, some of these existing technologies can be effective at capturing vapor-phase mercury from the flue gas stream. Although much research has been done on enhancing the removal of mercury from flue gas streams, little research has focused on what happens to the mercury when it is captured and converted and/or transferred to a solid or aqueous solution. The stability (or mobility) of mercury in this final process is critical and leads to the questions, What impact will the increased concentration of mercury have on utilization, disposal, and reuse? and Is the mercury removed from the flue gas really removed from the environment or rereleased at a later point? To help answer these questions, the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) as part of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Base Cooperative Agreement did a series of experiments using thermal desorption and leaching techniques. This report presents the results from these tests...|$|R
