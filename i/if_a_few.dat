5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> people had to die. The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the American Type Culture Collection of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness typhoid fever.|$|E
2500|$|The CPI {{produced}} a pamphlet {{based on the}} Sisson Documents called The German-Bolshevik Conspiracy and distributed 137,000 copies of it. It contained translations, a number of reproductions of the documents, and an analysis made by two prominent scholars for the National Board for Historical Service, J. Franklin Jameson, and Samuel Harper, that determined {{that most of the}} documents were genuine even <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> were questionable.

2500|$|Dear Sir — Our earnest solicitude for {{the success}} of the Great Southern Rights {{movement}} to secure an immediate release from the overwhelming dangers that imperil our political and social safety, will we trust, be a sufficient apology for the results which we beg to impose on you. [...] The sentiment of the Southern heart is overwhelming in favor of the movement. Light only is wanted that men many see their way clearly and the prayer of every true patriot will eventually be realized. Tennessee will be a unit. Although the time be so very short, this object may yet be accomplished, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> men only, (the more the better, however) in each county, will devote their entire energies to it during the canvass for Delegates.
