40|$|A {{capacitive}} humidity-sensing {{device was}} created by thermal evaporation of 99. 999 % aluminum. The substrate used for the coating was etched double-sided printed circuit board. The <b>etched</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board serves as the dielectric of the capacitor while the aluminum thin films deposited on either side serve as the plates of the capacitor. The capacitance was measured before and after exposure to humidity. The device was then calibrated by comparing the readings of capacitance {{with that of the}} relative humidity sensor of the Vernier LabQuest 2. It was found that there is a linear relationship between the capacitance and relative humidity given by the equation C= 1. 418 RH+ 29. 139 where C is the capacitance and RH is the relative humidity. The surface of the aluminum films is porous and it is through these pores that water is adsorbed and capillary condensation occurs, thereby causing the capacitance to change upon exposure to humidity...|$|E

Esses imas desempenham papel fundamental quanto a qualidade do feixe obtido que, por sua vez, constitui um fator primordial para experiencias em fisica nuclear. O trabalho desenvolve a teoria do funcionamento do acelerador e os calculos analiticos que fundamentam a geometria dos imas. A ausencia da uniformidade do campo magnetico e a presenca de campos de borda inadequados comprometem o sincronismo. Utilizou-se bobinas corretoras confeccionadas na forma de circuitos impressos, que limitaram a falta de uniformidade a valores relativos de campo magnetico da ordem de 1 ́ 0 POT. - 5. ́ Os imas possuem pecas polares auxiliares (clamps) que criam campos de borda reversos ao campo principal.

50|$|Direct bonded copper (DBC) {{substrates}} {{are commonly}} used in power modules, because of their very good thermal conductivity. They are composed of a ceramic tile (commonly alumina) with a sheet of copper bonded to one or both sides by a high-temperature oxidation process (the copper and substrate are heated to a carefully controlled temperature {{in an atmosphere of}} nitrogen containing about 30 ppm of oxygen; under these conditions, a copper-oxygen eutectic forms which bonds successfully both to copper and the oxides used as substrates). The top copper layer can be preformed prior to firing or chemically <b>etched</b> using <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board technology to form an electrical circuit, while the bottom copper layer is usually kept plain.

40|$|A novel {{concept for}} a wave power plant is being {{developed}} at the Division for Electricity and Lightning Research at Uppsala University. The concept {{is based on a}} permanent magnet linear generator placed on the seabed, directly driven by a surface following buoy. Critical for the survival of the generator is that the air gap between the moving and static parts of the generator is constantly fixed at the designed width to prevent the moving and static parts from connecting during operation. The aim of this thesis was the development and evaluation of a sensor for measuring the air gap during the operation of the generator. Additionally, in order to survive during years on the sea floor inside the wave power plants, the sensor was required to be a passive component, as well as robust and compact. A coil <b>etched</b> on a <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board, i. e. a search coil, was the chosen basis for the sensor. The sensor was tested on an existing test rig of a wave power plant and the results were compared with theoretical calculations. The results show that a search coil magnetic sensor <b>etched</b> on a <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board is a good concept for measuring the air gap. Experimentally measured and theoretically calculated sensor signals showed very good agreement. The designed sensor has a sensitivity of +/- 0. 4 mm in the range of 4 – 9. 5 mm air gap.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to separate natural convection and radiation experimentally. Therefore a heat source is placed inside a closed cavity and the acceleration inside the cavity can be changed.

Convection and radiation are the main modes of heat transfer, but there’s also an amount of conduction through the wires that connect the batteries with the resistor. The rotational speed of the centrifuge determines the centrifugal force in the cylinder. When the centrifugal force increases, the temperature of the resistor decreases due to the increase of natural convection. The amount of radiation, conduction and total heat transfer can be determined from the experiment, so the amount of natural convection can also be determined. The experimental results are compared with the governing equations to validate the experiment. The reproducibility of the experiment is also checked...|$|R
