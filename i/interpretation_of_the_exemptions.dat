500|$|On 6 September 1997 The West Australian {{published}} a Dean Alston cartoon entitled Alas Poor Yagan, which {{was critical of}} the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity. The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage. The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians, and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 because it was [...] "an artistic work" [...] that was published [...] "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt. This ruling was upheld on appeal by the Federal Court of Australia, Some academic commentators have since expressed concern that the protections offered under the act have been undermined by the ruling's broad <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exemptions.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Since <b>the</b> {{companionship}} <b>exemption</b> {{was put in}} place, {{a variety}} of unsuccessful efforts have been made through legislation, court challenges, and by the DOL itself to narrow <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> so that more home care workers become eligible for minimum wage and overtime.

40|$|This {{article will}} examine <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> excuse as espoused in the Convention on Contracts for <b>the</b> International Sale <b>of</b> Goods (CISG). It {{will examine the}} {{relevant}} case law applying <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> impediment found in CISG Article 79. The question posed in this analysis is whether the word “impediment” relates only to <b>the</b> occurrences <b>of</b> force majeure, impossibility and frustration of purpose events or if it also includes changed circumstances, impracticability and hardship events. For purposes <b>of</b> simplicity, <b>the</b> first set <b>of</b> excuse or exemption doctrines will be analyzed under <b>the</b> heading <b>of</b> “impossibility” and <b>the</b> second set will be discussed under <b>the</b> heading <b>of</b> “hardship”. <b>The</b> key issue to be explored {{in this article is}} the distinction between excuse requiring impossibility or frustration of contractual purpose and hardship as it relates to Article 79 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CISG. These terms and doctrines have often been conflated. This is understandable given <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> such doctrines found in various national laws and international law instruments, such as impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose, force majeure or Act of God, hardship, change of circumstances, and so forth. The question posed is whether the impediment doctrine provides an exemption from liability only for “absolute” excuse (impossibility, force majeure) or if it also extends to the more liberal “relative” excuse doctrines (hardship, changed circumstances, impracticability). Given <b>the</b> vagueness <b>of</b> Article 79 ’s use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word impediment, its interpretation and application has had to be constructed anew. This has to, of course, be done with all CISG provisions under the autonomous interpretation mandate. However, <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> <b>of</b> impediment is an especially difficult task given <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerous excuse doctrines in the various national legal systems, as well as <b>the</b> conflation <b>of</b> different excuse doctrines within national legal systems. French law has <b>the</b> most form <b>of</b> excuse recognizing only force majeure events that make it impossible to perform; the United Kingdom’s law is slightly more liberal, adding <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> frustration <b>of</b> purpose to <b>the</b> impossibility doctrine; and German law incorporates the more common civil law bifurcation of impossibility and hardship doctrines, while also recognizing frustration of purpose, as well as recognizing both physical and economic impossibility. The United States has a tripartite excuse regime involving impossibility, frustration, and impracticability. Part II briefly examines <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> excuse in <b>the</b> German and American legal systems focusing on <b>the</b> German concept <b>of</b> changed circumstances and <b>the</b> American doctrine <b>of</b> impracticability, while Part III briefly reviews <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> excuse provided in <b>the</b> UNIDROIT’s Principles <b>of</b> International Commercial Contracts (PICC) and <b>the</b> Principles <b>of</b> European Contract Law (PECL). The reviews in Parts II and III will set the context for analyzing the case law relating to CISG Article 79 that is undertaken in Part IV...|$|R
40|$|Administrators find {{themselves}} in a policy space when they have to balance their professional knowledge of an ambiguous policy with political influence and local implementation history. <b>The</b> Iowa Agricultural <b>Exemption</b> to County Zoning provides an example of administrators making decisions in such a space. This policy exempts from county zoning regulation “land, farm houses, farm barns, farm outbuildings, or other buildings or structures which are primarily adapted by reason of nature and area, for use for agricultural purposes, while so used” (Iowa Code, Chapter 335). Limited guidance from state courts and state legislature leave county zoning administrators in a position of having to muddle through a policy space. In addition to their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exemption,</b> this policy space also provides county zoning board of supervisors, citizens and other actors the opportunity to either implicitly or explicitly influence how decisions regarding <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> are made. This study evaluated where administrators are in this policy space by sending a survey to county zoning administrators across the state to learn what factors influence their administration of this policy. Descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as qualitative analysis were used to analyze the data. Results show that administrators are generally knowledgeable about the policy and because of their role as experts, many administrators do not perceive high levels of political influence. However, administrators in urban counties were found to have a higher level of understanding of how to apply <b>the</b> <b>exemption,</b> but also are subject to higher levels of political influence. These findings are important because <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of,</b> and political influence on <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>exemption</b> can potentially act as a barrier to local food systems in Iowa...|$|R

40|$|Summary Plant variety {{protection}} (PVP) gives a {{right holder}} (breeder) {{the possibility to}} exclude others from using his or her invention (plant variety) for a particular period. African regional organizations are currently establishing PVP systems that {{are in line with}} the international standards set by the International Union for <b>the</b> Protection <b>of</b> New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). Proponents hope that a UPOV-compliant PVP system will incentivize breeding and <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> new varieties, while opponents fear that such a PVP system would favour foreign seed companies and criminalize farmers. The dichotomies between proponents and opponents have taken centre stage in national and international debates on this topic, and there is much distrust and misunderstanding between the various parties involved. The challenge for African countries is {{to strike a balance between}} protecting <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> breeders in order to maintain <b>the</b> incentive function <b>of</b> plant breeders’ rights in the commercial market, while providing leeway to smallholder farmers that depend on informal sources for their seed security and survival. The project has created space for key stakeholders to meet and discuss their viewpoints, thereby starting a process of mutual learning and understanding, both at the international and national level. From these efforts, it can be concluded that in most African countries PVP is relevant for only a small segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formal seed sector. PVP, like any intellectual property right, is intended to stimulate innovation and development by regulating rights and obligations amongst parties involved in commercial trade. A PVP system will not incentivize breeding in crops for which there is no commercial market. For that reason, public research organizations should carefully manage PVP applications and not overestimate prospective revenues. It was also concluded that a PVP system compliant with UPOV 1991 can restrict <b>the</b> accessibility <b>of</b> protected varieties for smallholder farmers as it does not allow farmers to trade seed of a protected variety. Recent research confirms that smallholder farmers access their seed mainly from informal channels, with the majority being bought from local markets. Therefore, it is recommended that UPOV member countries apply a broad <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UPOV <b>exemption</b> for acts conducted privately and for non-commercial purposes. This can be achieved by developing regulations that allow a certain category of farmers (i. e. smallholder or resource-poor farmers) to freely save, exchange and sell farm-saved seed of protected varieties of food crops. Other concerns raised during the stakeholder meetings relate to the need to improve transparency and democratic accountability in decision-making processes on PVP, and <b>the</b> compatibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UPOV system with national and international legislation on access and benefit-sharing...|$|R

40|$|This article {{contains}} an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> from paying transport charges for producers, under European Union sector specific regulation and the European Union state aid rules. In the Netherlands {{and several other}} EU Member States, the energy authorities have decided that producers of electricity will not be charged for using the electricity network for transportation. These energy authorities are responsible for setting the tariffs and the related methodologies. The charges {{are meant to be}} paid to the network operator and thereby ensure that this network operator can recover the costs that are made to provide <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> transport to users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network. Both producers and consumers are users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network. Producers inject electricity that will be transported to consumers. These consumers take the electricity off the network. This article assesses whether exempting producers from contributing to <b>the</b> payment <b>of</b> these charges, can be considered legitimate under European Union law. First, the relevant provisions from the Third Energy Package are assessed. This legislative package does not contain provisions containing strict rules with regard to <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> transport tariffs on the electricity market. It does however contain <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> non-discrimination. Whether or not this principle is infringed by the measure containing <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> is doubtful. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>exemptions</b> will be tested under the EU state aid doctrine. Whether or not the state aid rules are infringed by <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> will depend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state aid rules. Applying a broad <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state aid conditions will lead {{to the conclusion that the}} measures containing <b>the</b> <b>exemption</b> can constitute unlawful state aid as prohibited by the Treaty. Nevertheless, it is not that convincing that this conclusion would be the same if these conditions would be interpreted in a more strict way. It would thus be useful to notify the measures to the European Commission, in order for them to carry out investigations...|$|R
