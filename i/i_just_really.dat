[...] Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. [...] We did write gore lyrics, but it was more like kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level.
