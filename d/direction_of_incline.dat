25|$|The Bruce foil is a foil that {{provides}} a lateral resistance with zero heeling moment by placing the foil to either {{or both of the}} leeward and the windward sides, angled so the direction of the force passes through the center of effort of the sail. Since proas already have an outrigger to the windward side, a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of heeling forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>incline</b> remains constant during shunting.|$|E

Explicit expressions are obtained and lead to an easy formulation of spatial derivatives. The displacement field of an isolated dislocation is described asymptotically when the dislocations are distant from each other. A few numerical applications illustrate the stress fields around screw and edge dislocations. In addition, for tungsten, calculations of elastic stored energy give the equilibrium <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> dislocation {{as a function of}} the orientation of its Burgers vector...|$|R
50|$|The {{new company}} {{constructed}} an inclined plane, to transport tub boats from {{the level of}} the Wombridge canal, down to that of the Shrewsbury canal. It was 243 ft long, with a fall of 75 ft. It consisted of twin railway tracks, each with a cradle in which a single tub-boat was carried. Power was provided by an engine supplied by the Coalbrookdale Company. This was replaced in 1842 by a new engine that lasted for 79 years, until the final demise <b>of</b> the <b>incline</b> on 31 August 1921. Most of the working traffic was in the downward <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>incline,</b> and was counterbalanced by empty tub-boats returning up to the top level. The inclined plane was the last operational canal plane in the country.|$|R
40|$|Rotational {{translational}} actuator (RTAC) system, whose motions {{occur in}} horizontal planes, is a benchmark for studying of control techniques. This paper presents dynamical analysis and stabilizing control {{design for the}} RTAC system on a slope. Based on Lagrange equations, dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> RTAC system is achieved by selecting cart position and rotor angle as the general coordinates and torque acting on the rotor as general force. The analysis of equilibriums and their controllability yields that controllability of equilibriums depends on <b>inclining</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> RTAC system. To stabilize the system to its controllable equilibriums, a proper control Lyapunov function including system energy, {{which is used to}} show the passivity property of the system, is designed. Consequently, a stabilizing controller is achieved directly based on the second Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the correctness and feasibility of our dynamical analysis and control design...|$|R

40|$|A {{vibration}} isolator is described which incorporates a near-zero-spring-rate device within its operating range. The device is an assembly of a vertical spring {{in parallel with}} two inclined springs. A low spring rate is achieved by combining the equivalent stiffness in the vertical <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> springs with the stiffness of the vertical central spring. It is shown {{that there is a}} relation between the geometry and the stiffness of the individual springs that results in a low spring rate. Computer simulation studies of a single-degree-of-freedom model for harmonic base input show that the performance of the proposed scheme is superior to that of the passive schemes with linear springs and skyhook damping configuration. The response curves show that, for small to large amplitudes of base disturbance, the system goes into resonance at low frequencies of excitation. Thus, it is possible to achieve very good isolation over a wide low-frequency band. Also, the damper force requirements for the proposed scheme are much lower than for the damper force of a skyhook configuration or a conventional linear spring with a semi-active damper...|$|R

According to X-ray phi-scans, the inclined GaN NRs were tilted {{at an angle}} of ∼ 57. 5 ° to the [10 - 10]sapp direction. Specifically, the GaN NRs grew in a single inclined direction to the [11 - 20]sapp. Uni-directionally inclined NRs were formed through the one-sided (10 - 11) -faceted growth of the interfacial a-GaN plane layer. It was confirmed that {{a thin layer of}} a-GaN was formed on r-facet nanogrooves of the m-sapphire substrate by nitridation. The interfacial a-GaN nucleation affected both the inclined angle and the growth <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> GaN NRs. Using X-ray diffraction and selective area electron diffraction, the epitaxial relationship between the inclined (1 - 10 - 3) GaN NRs and interfacial a-GaN layer on m-sapphire substrates was systematically investigated.

A multiplex schema is selected for formation of actual subpixel abstracts (SPA), which does not contain redundant subpixel.

ADVANTAGE - The multiplex scheme is selected for formation of the actual subpixel samples, thus enabling the misalignment free tracking of the picture contents with lateral head movement of the viewers. The subpixels are isolated to a high degree, thus providing a good channel separation. The method facilitates a very comfortable viewing process as {{a high degree of}} lateral head movement is possible without impairing the stereo effect. The method decreases the crosstalk between the two picture channels, and improves the brightness and resolution of the picture content...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} version. It first {{appeared}} at [URL] tissues are composite materials that depend strongly on anisotropic fibre arrangement to maximise performance. One such tissue is the heart valve, with orthogonally arranged fibrosa and ventricularis layers. Their function is to maintain mechanical stress while being resilient. It is postulated that while one layer bears the applied stress, the orthogonal layer helps to regenerate the microstructure when the load is released. The present paper describes changes in the microstructure of a block copolymer with cylindrical morphology, having a bio-inspired microstructure of anisotropic orthogonally oriented layers, under uniaxial strain. To allow structural observations during fast deformation, equivalent to the real heart valve operation, we used a synchrotron X-ray source and recorded 2 D SAXS patterns in only 1 ms per frame. The deformation behaviour of the composite microstructure has been reported for two arrangements of the cylinders in skin and core layers. The behaviour is very different to that observed either for uniaxially oriented or isotropic samples. Deformation {{is far from being}} affine. Cylinders aligned in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> stretch show fragmentation, but complete recovery of the spacing between cylinders on removal of the load. Those oriented perpendicular to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> stretch <b>incline</b> at an angle of approximately 25 ° to their original direction during load.

40|$|To {{investigate}} how roots respond to directional cues, we characterized a T-DNA-tagged Arabidopsis mutant named sku 5 {{in which the}} roots skewed and looped away from the normal downward <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> growth on <b>inclined</b> agar surfaces. sku 5 roots and etiolated hypocotyls were slightly shorter than normal and exhibited a counterclockwise (left-handed) axial rotation bias. The surface-dependent skewing phenotype disappeared when the roots penetrated the agar surface, but the axial rotation defect persisted, revealing that these two directional growth processes are separable. The SKU 5 gene belongs to a 19 -member gene family designated SKS (SKU 5 Similar) that is related structurally to the multiple-copper oxidases ascorbate oxidase and laccase. However, the SKS proteins lack several of the conserved copper binding motifs characteristic of copper oxidases, and no enzymatic function could be assigned to the SKU 5 protein. Analysis of plants expressing SKU 5 reporter constructs and protein gel blot analysis showed that SKU 5 was expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. SKU 5 was glycosylated and modified by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol and localized to both the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Our observations suggest that SKU 5 affects two directional growth processes, possibly by participating in cell wall expansion...|$|R
