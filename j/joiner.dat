5|$|In 1843, {{at the age}} of 14, Stanley's father {{insisted that}} he leave school and help him in his trade. Stanley worked in his father's {{unsuccessful}} building business, becoming adept at working with metal and wood, later to obtain employment as a plumber/drainage contractor and <b>joiner</b> in London. He joined his father in 1849 at an engineering works at Whitechapel, working as a Pattern Maker's Improver where he invented the steel wheel spider-spokes.

5|$|In 1905 Janáček {{attended}} a demonstration {{in support of}} a Czech university in Brno, where the violent death of František Pavlík (a young <b>joiner)</b> {{at the hands of the}} police inspired his 1. X. 1905 piano sonata. The incident led him to further promote the anti-German and anti-Austrian ethos of the Russian Circle, which he had co-founded in 1897 and which would be officially banned by the Austrian police in 1915. In 1906 he approached the Czech poet Petr Bezruč, with whom he later collaborated, composing several choral works based on Bezruč's poetry. These included Kantor Halfar (1906), Maryčka Magdónova (1908), and Sedmdesát tisíc (1909).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{examines}} {{differences between}} <b>joiners</b> and nonjoiners of a voluntary smokers' registry. METHODS: A baseline prevalence survey {{was used to}} identify characteristics of smokers who joined or did not join a smokers' registry. RESULTS: Communities varied significantly in registry enrollment rates. Heavy-smoking <b>joiners</b> expressed more desire to quit, {{were more likely to}} live with nonsmokers, and were older than nonjoiners. Light-to-moderate <b>joiners</b> smoked more, were more addicted to cigarettes, and expressed more desire to quit than nonjoiners. CONCLUSIONS: Few baseline characteristics differentiated <b>joiners</b> from nonjoiners. Nonjoiners {{were significantly more likely to}} achieve cessation than <b>joiners...</b>|$|R
