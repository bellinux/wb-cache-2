5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
25|$|After a {{traumatic}} experience, {{a person may}} re-experience the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called triggers, can be uncomfortable and even painful. It can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, {{as well as the}} ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to psychoactive substances including alcohol to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the events is reoccurring. They can range from distracting to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing symptoms are a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.|$|E

Briefly, she <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat (Vecchia zimarra—"Old coat"). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together. Mimì tells Rodolfo that her love for him is her whole life (aria/duet, Mimì and Rodolfo: Sono andati?—"Have they gone?").|$|E

Steve Mullen praised the episode not only for the Michael/Dwight war, but also for smaller moments like the cheese puff tosses and the messages Pam and Ryan wrote on a clipboard for Michael during his phone call; Mullen said, [...] "I'm not sure any other 30 minute comedy currently on TV can even touch The Office."

However, this film and its emotional appeal clearly resonate with its viewers, as it received a standing ovation at Sundance.|$|R
500|$|However, the Wii and PlayStation 2 {{versions}} received mostly mixed {{to negative}} reviews. IGN commented the Wii version [...] "is {{not a bad}} game" [...] but {{went on to say}} [...] "The whole thing has been oversimplified and dumbed down.

[...] GameSpot added [...] "Tomb Raider Underworld can be an enjoyable adventure, but it’s marred by bugs, camera issues, and ill-conceived Wii extras." [...] While the PlayStation 2 version was called [...] "an embarrassment to the franchise" [...] by IGN.

500|$|The {{character}} {{later became}} the center of disapproval from viewers, who felt Declan was moving on too fast after Bridget's death when he developed feelings for Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Sorensen then backed the storyline, wanting his character to move on stating: [...] "It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was {{one of the lucky ones}} to have found his soul mate early in life, but at the same time, he has to move on and live his life." [...] further adding: [...] "A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But I can assure you that it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Fool in Love" [...] is a rhapsodic ballad, which {{incorporates}} acoustic {{and electric}} guitars, synthesizers and drums. Lyrically, Rihanna tells {{of how she}} has met a relatively good man who her parents do not approve of, but requests that they accept her decision {{to be with him}} due to their love for each other, despite familial concerns. Rihanna insists that she is in love, singing [...] "Papa he's quite a man, he adores me/ He's my biggest fan." [...] She then claims that he has taken a hold over her, singing [...] "We're too far down the hole/ He's got a hold on my soul." [...] Rihanna's vocal performance in the song was described as the singer's [...] "biggest ornamented" [...] song by Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail, as well as noting that the singer emotes a sense of fatality in her vocals during the bass sequences in the song. [...] "Fool in Love" [...] displays Rihanna emoting a vulnerable style of singing, due to the lyrical content and mood in the song, which can be heard in the lyrics [...] "Papa, are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?" [...] due to how the singer <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> her parents are disappointed in her choice of man. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy commented that Rihanna appeared to be channelling Madonna on the song.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{hailed the}} episode as {{successful}} in telling a complex story {{about all the}} characters in a unique way, while retaining the series' effective elements of writing and character development. Throughout the show—as {{in the rest of}} the series—the characters self-consciously address their own dialogue and actions. Anya describes her own duet [...] "I'll Never Tell" [...] as [...] "a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit". With a characteristic dry demeanor, Giles explains that he overheard the information about Sunnydale residents spontaneously combusting as he was eavesdropping upon the police taking [...] "witness arias". In her opening number, [...] "Going Through the Motions", Buffy sings that she <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she is playing a part: [...] "nothing here is real, nothing here is right". The song introduces the character's emotional state but also removes the barrier between the actor and the audience, as Gellar the actor portrays Buffy, who feels she is merely playing the part of the Slayer. This hints to the audience that the episode's musical format is strange to the actors and characters. According to Buffy essayist Richard Albright, the lack of polish among cast members' singing voices added to the authenticity of their breaking out into song for the first time in the series. Whedon included self-conscious dialogue and references about the characters being in a musical and showed their reluctance toward song and dance, so that the audience would feel more comfortable with the improbability of such a thing happening on the show.|$|E
500|$|The {{students}} at South Park Elementary {{are assigned to}} read The Catcher in the Rye, and (especially the four main boys) grow excited when Mr. Garrison tells them that the book has caused so much controversy, it has been banned from {{public schools in the}} past. However, after reading the book, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are disappointed to find the content completely inoffensive, and feel the school has [...] "tricked" [...] them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft and read it. They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he has been entering into [...] "altered states of consciousness" [...] that make him want to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead ("Dangit!"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Alasdair Wilkins gave [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] a {{grade of}} B, {{explaining}} that the plot suffered just as previous companion introductions had because the threat was secondary to establishing Clara. He also wrote that the episode [...] "struggles to make all its chosen genre elements compelling" [...] and was not positive towards the menace of the Wi-Fi and questioned how realistic the technology seen was. Despite this, {{he said that it}} was still [...] "fun" [...] with good performances. Dan Martin of The Guardian was disappointed, writing that it [...] "makes a hearty meal of its iconic London locations ... But after the tour de force that was [...] "The Snowmen", it <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> this handsome episode constantly just misses the mark". He found the monsters and plot familiar to past episodes, but noted that a [...] "generic" [...] opening episode had been common for the show when it was introducing a new companion, which was done successfully with Clara. Neela Debnath in The Independent echoed similar sentiments, feeling that it did not live up to the hype and reused several elements from previous episodes. Jon Cooper of the Daily Mirror wrote that [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] "had its moments" [...] but [...] "as a whole it didn't reach the heights of previous episodes". While he welcomed the departure in tone, he felt that the set-pieces were shoehorned in, and also expressed concern that Clara, despite Coleman's success, was too similar to previous companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan).|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{confirms}} the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans {{choose not to}} differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The García girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad [...] "immigrant" [...] category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda’s conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher’s Day Address provides {{a classic example of}} {{the manner in which the}} García girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self-expression for [...] "two brief pages of stale compliments and the polite commonplaces on teachers. A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention". Julie Barak affirms that [...] "although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does teach them the lesson of conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sofía is impregnated out of wedlock.|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|E

2500|$|Night Visions {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Brian Mansfield from USA Today gave Night Visions a favorable review, writing: [...] "For all the group's musical mastery, it's the flourishes courtesy of producer Alex da Kid that make individual tracks stand out." [...] Mansfield praised individual {{elements such as}} [...] "the mandolin hook of 'It's Time', the jaunty whistle of 'On Top of the World', [...] the burbling guitar in 'Demons.'" [...] and said that [...] "those creative touches may seem like small details, but it's that imagination that gives these Dragons teeth." [...] Gregory Heaney of AllMusic remarked that the album [...] "sometimes <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it lacks depth", but nonetheless called it [...] "an album that, {{at least for a}} few minutes at a time, will make everyday life seem just a little bit bigger".|$|E
2500|$|Sean Palmer of The Sydney Morning Herald {{felt the}} album allowed one to [...] "enjoy these musical stalwarts jamming together".

The AU Review's Justine McNamara {{was impressed by}} the [...] "quality of the recording" [...] where [...] "both singers' voices are perfect". Rachael McArthur of Renowned for Sound was disappointed by the band [...] "here is a bad kind of looseness. It <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the band has not perhaps had a huge amount of time to learn the 29 songs required"; and Finn's [...] "piano work is at times a bit off".
