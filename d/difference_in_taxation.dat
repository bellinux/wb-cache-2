This tax was introduced in 2006 through a reform that eliminated the [...] "RISK-system", which intended to avoid the double taxation of capital. The new shareholder model, introduced in 2006, aims to reduce the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> of capital and labor by taxing dividends beyond a certain level as ordinary income. This means that focus was moved from capital to individuals and their level of income. This system also introduced a deductible allowance equal to the share's acquisition value times the average rate for Treasury bills with a 3-month period adjusted for tax. Shielding interest shall secure financial neutrality in that it returns the taxpayer {{what he or she}} alternatively would have achieved in a safe, passive capital placement exempt from additional taxation. The main purpose of the allowance is to prevent adverse shifts in investment and corporate financing structure {{as a result of the}} dividend tax. According to the papers explaining the new policy, a dividend tax without such shielding could push up the pressures on the rate of return on equity investments and lead Norwegian investors from equities to bonds, property etc.|$|E

While in one country, a hybrid entity is taxed as a corporation, it is dealt as a transparent entity in which equity holders are subjected to taxation in another country. The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> of hybrid entities {{can be used to}} international tax arbitrage. In the U.

As the U. S. experience in this area can be very instructive for Japan, this article goes over the U. S. regulations considering implications for the tax treatment on various entities in Japan. In order to tackle international tax arbitrage surrounding taxation of hybrid entities, foremost importance is each country's own effort.

We argue that tax differentials distort the efficient allocation of productive factors following an M&A and thus mitigate the resulting productivity improvement. Using firm-level data on inputs and outputs of production {{as well as on}} corporate M&As, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in the absolute tax differential between the locations of two merging firms reduces the subsequent total factor productivity gain by 4. 5 %. This effect is less pronounced when firms can use international profit shifting to attenuate effective <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation.</b> <b>In</b> a complementary analysis, we use an event study design and a fixed effects model to explore the timing of the response of productivity, as well as, labor and capital input to the tax rate differential after the merger separately for the acquirer and the target.

In these transactions, tax differentials reduce the post-merger adjustment in the target firm and inhibit the full realization of productivity gains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to {{investigate}} if the Swedish legislation concerning taxation of dividends to foreign investment funds is in violation to EU law. Furthermore, the thesis will analyze if the Fondskatteutredningens suggestions {{to changes in the}} current legislation is appropriate to the purpose it tries to obtain. Today there is a difference in the taxation of dividends paid to Swedish investment funds and foreign investment funds. Dividends paid to foreign investment funds is being taxed in accordance with the Coupon Tax Act (1970 : 624), in which no deduction of the tax is possible. Swedish investment funds on the other hand have the possibility to deduct as much of the received dividends that they have given in dividends to its shareholders. The difference in the taxation between investment funds because of origin has been reviewed by both Swedish court and by the European Court of Justice. It has in these cases been up to the courts to review if a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> of dividends could constitute a violation of the free movement. Even if a national legislation would be considered to be in violation of the free movement there are however developed justifying obstacles to the free movement. These obstacles are being analyzed in the thesis to see if the difference in the Swedish taxation can be justified. Within the EU the UCITS-directive regulates investment funds. Since the directive is being changed and will come in to force during 2011 the Fondskatteutredningen was presented in 2009 which presents suggestions to changes in the Swedish legislation concerning taxation of dividends to investment funds. These new changes may constitute that the Swedish legislation no longer will be in violation of EU law...|$|E
40|$|Thin-capitalisation {{rules are}} rules applied {{by a number}} of {{countries}} in order to protect their national tax base from erosion by companies that have a relatively high level of debt compared to equity. Indeed, the tax treatment of dividend distributions and interest payments differs significantly and this in return has an effect on the amount of profit a company reports for tax purposes. Country tax rules typically allow a deduction for interest paid or payable in arriving at the tax measure of profit. The higher the level of debt in a company, and thus the amount of interest it pays, the lower its taxable profit will be. For this reason, debt is often a more tax efficient method of finance than equity. In recent years, countries {{all over the world and}} even more so the Member States of the European Union and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have been trying to combat the negative effect this <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> has on their economies. However, Member States of the European Union are bound by EU law and its provisions on the non-discrimination of companies coming from other European Member States. The focus of this article is Croatian thin-capitalisation rules and their effect. The main hypothesis is that Croatian rules on thin-capitalisation are contrary to EU law. In order to demonstrate this, the author first explains what the rules on thin-capitalisation are and what kind of thin-capitalisation rules exist. Subsequently, the author analyses the relevant provisions of EU law, as well as the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding thin-capitalisation rules. This analysis is then applied to the existing Croatian rules and finally a conclusion is made as to their potentially discriminatory effect. Finally, the author examines several ways a potentially incompatible thin-capitalisation rule can be made compatible with EU law...|$|E

However, Russia is failing behind in all indicators measuring innovative output in comparison with most developed countries. According to Martti Vallila, Finland has what Russia needs and Russia has what Finland needs. There are researchers and innovators in Russia. Finland {{has one of the}} leading innovation systems in the world to commercialize Russian sourced innovation. Therefore, research problem of the thesis is to find the strategy that Russian companies could use in order to commercialize their innovations in Finland and if this strategy depends on some factors. To acquaintance the reader to the wider theoretical context of the study, the concepts of commercialization and internationalization as a strategy by providing theoretical background to the issue. The empirical part of this thesis has been conducted with qualitative methods, a qualitative multiple case study. The research of the study consists of two parts. The first part was conducted by interviews with the representative from Tekes and representative of the project "Finnish-Russian Innovation Cooperation - Commercialization of Russian Innovations". The second part was also conducted by interviews, but with the representatives of the companies, who succeeded to commercialize their innovations in Finland. The main findings of the empirical part are next. The reason why Russian companies need to commercialize their innovations in Finland was found out, it is due to the obstacles in Russian innovation system, Finnish innovation system looks more attractive to Russian companies. Regarding to the steps of the commercialization process, there are no clear steps, but the following ones were suggested by the author: establish a joint venture, hire a local CEO or a book-keeper, prepare an investment plan, and create projects inside joint venture. Regarding the main challenges for Russian companies in Finland are: lack of human resources, lack of money (or investments), <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> systems.
