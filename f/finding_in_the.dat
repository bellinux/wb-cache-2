5|$|Written over {{a period}} of several years and {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs in its use of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several of the hallmarks of traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.|$|E
5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement factor H, which was an unexpected <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, quoting the <b>Finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Temple to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the baptismal name Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused {{to speak to him}} afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Following {{regulatory}} and administrative investigations, criminal trials and a subsequent appeal, on 15 December 2014, Thomson, a former Labor politician, {{was found guilty}} in the Victorian County Court of thirteen charges of theft and convicted and fined A$25,000. Forty-nine charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception were dismissed following an earlier <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Melbourne Magistrates Court on 18 February 2014 against Thomson of defrauding the HSU {{in order to pay}} for personal expenses. On 25 March 2014, Thomson was convicted on 65 charges of fraud and theft for using Health Services Union funds for personal benefit and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, with nine months suspended over two years. Thomson's legal team immediately lodged an appeal against the conviction and sentence and was granted bail.|$|E
25|$|However, as of 2008 this {{technology}} remains too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period {{has been estimated}} at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of â‚¬50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off, but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation {{to compensate for the}} reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.|$|E

500|$|Archaeological {{findings}} have been unearthed at two sites in the Glacier Bay, which links the region to Holocene period. On the Baranoff Island, a prehistoric finding dates occupation of the region between 3200 and 4600 BP. Another <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a house, microlithic tools and heavy wood working tools at Ground Hog Bay has been dated to about 2000 BP. This is stated to be [...] "towards {{the end of the}} Hypsithermal (thermal maximum climatic fluctuation) {{and the beginning of the}} Little Ice Age". Thus, it has been interpreted by comparison with similarly placed locations in the region, such as the southern coast of British Columbia, that the type of culture seen here is comparable to the culture that existed during historic times on the Northwest Coast.

He became involved with the development of radar, heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included John Randall and Harry Boot. They created a radical new design, the cavity magnetron, that made microwave radar possible. Oliphant also formed part of the MAUD Committee, which reported in July 1941, that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this <b>finding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, thereby starting what became the Manhattan Project.
