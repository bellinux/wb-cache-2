50|$|William Lazonick (born in Toronto, Canada, on June 8, 1945) is an {{economist}} who studies innovation and {{competition in the}} global economy. His research seeks to understand how, {{on the basis of}} <b>innovative</b> <b>enterprise,</b> a national economy can achieve stable and equitable economic growth. Lazonick is the originator of “the theory of innovative enterprise”, which, he argues, provides both an essential intellectual foundation for understanding economic performance and a fundamental critique of the neoclassical theory of the market economy. Much of his current work focuses on how the financialization of the U.S. industrial corporation, manifested in massive distributions of corporate cash to shareholders and the explosion of stock-based executive pay, results in employment instability and income inequity, while undermining the innovative capability of the U.S. economy. He also conducts cross-national comparative research on the social conditions that enable or proscribe <b>innovative</b> <b>enterprise,</b> focusing in particular on the economies of Britain, Japan, and China as well as the United States.|$|E

5000|$|This <b>innovative</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{was founded}} by musician/businessman Randy Curlee, {{instrument}} designer Randy Dritz and pattern maker Sonny Storbeck in 1975 in Matteson, IL. The name S.D Curlee came from the three original partners: Storbeck, Dritz and Curlee. Actual production began in early 1976 and ceased in 1982. There is much speculation concerning how many USA instruments were made during the initial production run. However all involved (Randy Dritz, Sonny Storbeck, and export/AR manager Vicki Maker [...] ) agree that the published production figure of 15,000 may be exaggerated. The true production numbers will probably never be known, {{but it would be}} safe to speculate that possibly 5,000 to 6,500 S.D.
