30|$|Of all the {{functional}} scores described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> five <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> (Table  1), only four patient-reported outcomes (ASES score, Constant score, UCLA score and VAS) could respectively be pooled to perform data analysis.|$|R
30|$|Another {{limitation}} of this review is the difficulties defining and diagnosing NAFLD and NASH. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>study</b> by Sayiner et al. (2016) [13], patients with NAFLD were divided into cirrhotic NAFLD and noncirrhotic NAFLD, with cirrhotic NAFLD considered in this literature review to represent NASH. However, patients with NASH {{may not necessarily be}} diagnosed with cirrhosis. According to Machado and Cortez-Pinto (2014) [27], NAFLD represents a spectrum of liver disease, ranging from simple steatosis to NASH, which can have different degrees of fibrosis and progress to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and complications (e.g. HCC).|$|R

30|$|Outcome—Patient {{satisfaction}} {{was the primary}} outcome. The secondary outcomes were the outcomes measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> apart from patient satisfaction.|$|E
30|$|Various {{types of}} patient {{satisfaction}} scores were utilized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies.</b> These are summarised in Table  4. They were categorised into an ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair, poor and failure) by most studies. Authors were not consistent {{in how they}} used and reported them. Carlioz et al. [30] used a scale omitting “excellent”. A few authors omitted “failure” in their scales [31 – 33].

30|$|Implant {{loosening}} {{or complete}} failures {{have been reported}} in some studies, whereas others observed a 100 % success rate. Discontinuation of treatment owing to inflammation was reported for implants placed in the alveolar ridge only. However, in several cases, resolution was successfully achieved through improved oral hygiene [4, 48, 49]. Whereas adverse effects including root damage, or loss of tooth sensibility {{have been reported in}} literature [15, 21], none of these complications were reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies.</b> Also, no failures due to root contact have been reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies,</b> even though root proximity {{is considered to be a}} major risk factor for implant loosening [53].|$|E
30|$|Although hypernatremia was {{associated}} with increased mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies,</b> there was marked between-study heterogeneity. DI was a potential confounder in several studies. Considering these limitations, the clinical significance of hypernatremia in TBI is difficult to establish at this stage.|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 868 {{articles}} {{were identified by}} the electronic search. After duplicate removal and subsequent study selection, a total of two <b>studies</b> were <b>included</b> in this systematic review. The methodological quality of <b>the</b> <b>included</b> articles displayed risks of bias. There {{was no difference in}} DRUJ re-instability between open and arthroscopic repair of the TFCC. There were no differences in obtained postoperative ROM, grip strength or values in functional outcome scores, between open and arthroscopic TFCC repair <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>included</b> <b>studies,</b> except for <b>the</b> Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire - in favor of arthroscopic surgery - <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> general <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> <b>included</b> {{small sample}} sizes (in average 23 patients) and rather short follow up (in average 37  months) – only 2 % {{displayed}} long-term follow up (>[*] 10  years) and 7 % mid-term follow up (6 – 8  years). 91 % of <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> displayed short-term follow up (2  years). Over 80 % of the LoE IV studies were retrospective.|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} {{weaknesses}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> of this systematic review. The review {{is based on}} case reports, {{and the number of}} included patients in each study was low and, therefore, the strength of evidence is limited by the quality of the available studies.|$|E
30|$|There {{was high}} {{compliance}} reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies.</b> For the studies who reported it, compliance was 88 %.

30|$|The {{practical}} skill assessments of course participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> diverge in amount of checkpoints and topics. Even though the studies included used various checklists {{to keep the}} assessment as objective and standardized as possible, only two studies had blinded reviewers scoring the stored images or ultrasound sequences afterwards [19, 28], and no validity evidence was provided for any checklists.|$|E

30|$|The {{mean age}} was {{comparable}} between patients who underwent open and arthroscopic surgery. Arthroscopic surgery was performed slightly more often in men, compared with open surgery. The sample size (mean n[*]=[*] 32 in open surgery and n[*]=[*] 31 in arthroscopic) was small and the follow up was short term (mean 37  months) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>included</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R
30|$|No {{human or}} animal {{participant}} were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> <b>including</b> human tissues. A publicly available database of human blood smear images in digital format has been used.|$|R
30|$|While {{scoring the}} {{extraction}} forms in consensus, some studies were excluded if the study outcome proved not to contain information on residual disease evaluation by MRI. All reported P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The large heterogeneity observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> precluded us from pooling data (see also ‘Discussion’ section), {{which is why}} we chose to use descriptive statistics in this review. Since this was a systematic review, no approval from our institutional review board was necessary.|$|E
30|$|The grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and {{evaluation}} (GRADE) instrument assessed evidence quality and grading of recommendation strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> in the quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis. This assessment {{was based on}} considerations such as study design, consistency, directness, precision, publication bias, and other aspects reported by studies included in this systematic review. The quality of the evidence was characterized as high, moderate, low, or very low and was assessed using tools from the website [URL] [24].|$|E
30|$|Meta-analysis of 10 {{original}} studies involving 295 {{cases and}} 290 normal controls showed an increased level of urinary NGF in BPS/IC patients (z =  3.08, P =  0.002). The combined WMD was 36.39 (95  % CI 13.27 – 59.51). There was {{significant difference between}} controlled group and BPS/IC patients in the term of NGF/Cr level (WMD =  0.96, 95  % CI 0.58 – 1.35; z =  4.89, P <  0.01). There was no significant publication bias <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> (P for Begg’s test =  0.73, P for egger’s test =  0.13).|$|E
30|$|The {{informed}} consent obtained in writing from all individual participants prior to inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>includes</b> consent for publication of de-identified summary data and individual sample images.|$|R
30|$|We judged all {{trials to}} be at low risk of {{reporting}} bias; no evidence for selective outcome reporting was retrieved <b>in</b> any of <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> when comparing abstract, methods, and results section [36 – 40].|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a literature {{review of the}} intensive care unit-acquired weakness syndromes (critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy and critical illness neuromyopathy) with the primary objective of determining their incidence as a combined group. Studies were identified through MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database and article reference list searches and were included if they evaluated the incidence {{of one or more}} of these conditions in an adult intensive care unit population. The incidence of an intensive care unit-acquired weakness syndrome <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> was 40...|$|E
30|$|The average {{baseline}} Pmcf analogue values found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> {{range from}} 14 to 18  mmHg (Table  2). One study compared fluid replacement based on target Pmcf analogue compared to conventional treatment in continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration [49]. Fluid replacement based on target Pmcf analogue led to significantly less fluid administration with stable cardiovascular variables (CVP, MAP, CO) and no complications. So, Pmcf analogue measurement adequately follows intravascular volume status in patients. Pmcf analogue measurements are automatic {{making it an}} attractive alternative to Pmcf hold and Pmcf arm.|$|E
30|$|We {{assessed}} {{the risk of}} bias <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies</b> using the standard Cochrane Collaboration methods for randomised trials (Higgins et al. 2011). Selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment) and reporting bias (selective reporting) were assessed at study level, whereas detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment) and attrition bias (incomplete outcome data) were assessed at outcome level. We did not assess detection bias for the outcome of survival because this in an objective outcome, and we also did not assess performance bias because blinding of either healthcare personnel or patients is not possible with the interventions under consideration in this review.|$|E

40|$|Bioelectrical {{impedance}} analysis (BIA) is {{a practical}} method to estimate percentage body fat (%BF). In this systematic review, we aimed to assess validity, responsiveness, reliability and measurement error of BIA methods in estimating %BF in children and adolescents. We searched for relevant studies in Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane through November 2012. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, extracted data and rated methodological quality of <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>studies.</b> We performed a best evidence synthesis to synthesize the results, thereby excluding studies of poor quality. We <b>included</b> 50 published <b>studies.</b> Mean differences between BIA and reference methods (gold standard [criterion validity] and convergent measures of body composition [convergent validity]) were considerable and ranged from negative to positive values, resulting in conflicting evidence for criterion validity. We found strong evidence for a good reliability, i. e. (intra-class) correlations ≥ 0. 82. However, test-retest mean differences ranged from 7. 5 % to 13. 4 % of total %BF <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>included</b> <b>study</b> samples, indicating considerable measurement error. Our systematic review suggests that BIA {{is a practical}} method to estimate %BF in children and adolescents. However, validity and measurement error are not satisfactory. © 2013 International Association for the Study of Obesity...|$|R
