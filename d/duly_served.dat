60|$|The circumstances, in brief, were these: The {{sergeant}} who {{had come}} to this lamentable end, father of the young soldier who had gone with his regiment to the East, had been singularly comfortable in his military experiences, these having ended long before the outbreak of the great war with France.

But the war in which England next involved herself had cost him many frettings that age and infirmity prevented him from being ever again an active unit of the army.
