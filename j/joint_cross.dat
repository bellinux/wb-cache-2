5000|$|Fenton George Coles (born 14 September 1937) was a Welsh rugby union player. A wing, Coles played club rugby {{initially}} for {{his home}} town club of Blaenavon before switching to Pontypool RFC. In 1960 {{he was part of}} a <b>joint</b> <b>Cross</b> Keys/Pontypool team to face a touring South Africa team and that year saw Coles selected for Wales playing three games in the 1960 Five Nations Championship. During the 1964-65 season he was made captain of the Pontypool first team.|$|E
50|$|Hurrell {{began playing}} rugby {{as a school}} boy and in 1951 he was capped for the Welsh Youth team {{travelling}} to Cork where they defeated Munster (Ireland) Youth by 15-3. As a senior he joined Cross Keys RFC playing at fly-half and was captain for three seasons between 1954/55 and 1956/57. Whilst at Cross Keys he was selected {{as part of a}} <b>joint</b> <b>Cross</b> Keys/Pontypool team that faced the 1953/54 New Zealand team. Hurrell played for around 180 games for Cross Keys amassing 41 tries over his time there. He switched to Newport for the 1957-58 season where he converted his positional play to a centre.|$|E

40|$|Joints as opening-mode {{fractures}} play {{important roles}} {{as indicators of}} tectonic stress fields and as pathways for underground fluid flow. This thesis analytically investigates the relationships among <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometry, orientations and ratios of remote principal stresses, and fluid pressure. Results show that main trends of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> are perpendicular to the least far field stresses during <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> formation, and <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> paths {{can be used to}} determine relative magnitudes of remote principal stresses. Based on the theoretical derivation, <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometries are grouped into five main categories: curving-parallel, curving-perpendicular, quasi-curving-parallel, quasi-curving-perpendicular and non-curving geometries. By introducing the concepts of effective stress and effective remote principal stress ratio, it is demonstrated that connectivity between <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> and the pre-existing joint is improved for joints that form under relatively high pore pressures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{focus of}} this study is on {{estimating}} the multivariate extreme value distributions associated with a vector of mutually correlated non-stationary Gaussian processes. This involves computing the <b>joint</b> <b>crossing</b> statistics of the vector processes by assuming the crossings to be Poisson counting processes. A mathematical artifice is adopted {{to take into account the}} dependencies that exist between the crossings of the processes. The crux in the formulation lies in the evaluation of a four-dimensional integral, which can be computationally expensive. This difficulty is bypassed by using saddlepoint approximation to reduce the dimension of the integral to be numerically computed to just two. The developments are illustrated through a numerical example and are validated using Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
