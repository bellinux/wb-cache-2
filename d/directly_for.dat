5|$|From 1921 to 1924, William Seiter {{directed}} a half-dozen FBO releases, some produced <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> the studio, others independently. Between 1922 and 1926, Emory Johnson produced and {{directed a}}t least eight films for FBO. Historian William K. Everson has pointed to Seiter and Johnson as two of the overlooked directorial talents of the silent era.|$|E
5|$|Heber {{remained}} in Bombay for four months, {{and then decided}} that, instead of sailing <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> Calcutta, he would visit Ceylon on the way. He arrived at Galle on 25 August and spent five weeks touring the main cities before departing for Calcutta where he arrived on 19 October 1825 after an absence of 16 months.|$|E

5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accession}} Cædwalla {{returned to}} Sussex {{and won the}} territory again, and also conquered the Isle of Wight, engaging in genocide, extinguishing the ruling dynasty there, and forcing {{the population of the}} island at sword point to renounce their pagan beliefs for Christianity. He gained control of Surrey and the kingdom of Kent, and in 686 he installed his brother, Mul, as king of Kent. Mul was burned in a Kentish revolt a year later, and Cædwalla returned, possibly ruling Kent <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> a period.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the {{publication}} of the fifth edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the fifth edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> Dungeons & Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM's Guild. The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation between the content creators.|$|E
5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> Netflix, which allowed {{for the use of}} an exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E

5|$|In February 1928, Disney {{hoped to}} {{negotiate}} a larger fee for producing the Oswald series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> him, including Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell and Friz Freleng. Disney also found out that Universal owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald. Mintz threatened {{to start his own}} studio and produce the series himself if Disney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.|$|E
5|$|Morgan placed marksmen at {{strategic}} positions, {{who then}} picked off virtually every {{officer in the}} advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived {{just in time to}} attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.|$|E

5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes <b>directly,</b> <b>for</b> the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E

5|$|Virginia headed <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave {{fired on}} the {{advancing}} enemy, and Beaufort replied.

5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, fungi {{have been used}} {{for a wide variety of}} {{industrial}} fermentations, whether working <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or bioremediating industrial waste, or serving as the source of enzymes for many purposes, such as fading and softening denim for fashionable blue jeans. Fungi yield a wide variety of industrial enzymes including amylases, invertases, cellulases and hemicellulases, pectinases, proteases, laccases, phytases, alpha-glucuronidases, mannanases, and lipases.|$|E
5|$|As the British force {{took control}} of Santa Brigida, a Spanish {{squadron}} of four ships sailed from Vigo {{with the appearance of}} intending to bring Pierrepont's squadron to battle. Pierrepont immediately issued orders for his ships to meet with the Spanish who promptly turned about and returned to port without coming within range. A shore breeze enabled the British ships and their prize to extricate themselves from the Commarurto rocks without further damage. They then sailed <b>directly</b> <b>for</b> the fleet base at Plymouth, arriving on 22 October to find that Thetis and Ethalion had reached the port the day before. Dispatches were sent to Lord Bridport, commander of the Channel Fleet, which were then forwarded to the Admiralty and revealed the scale of the prize.|$|E
