25|$|The {{river is}} now wider {{and starts to}} form meanders. It passes more lakes at South Acre Hall, a large {{farmhouse}} parts of which date from the sixteenth century, and then crosses Castle Acre Common, {{and there are several}} lakes in Big Wood.

At West Acre the river passes the remains of an Augustinian priory and then Narford Lake, by Narford Hall. The remains of the priory are grade II listed and a scheduled ancient monument. The Hall is grade I listed, and was built between 1690 and 1704 by Andrew Fountaine of Salle in Norfolk. It was enlarged in the 1830s. The river passes to the north of Narborough, where there are lakes and a fish farm. The A47 Narborough Bypass crosses, as does the original main road to Narborough, beside which is a former water mill, built in the eighteenth century and repaired in the late twentieth, which still contains much of the milling machinery. The Lynn and Dereham Railway line used to cross to the west of Narborough, but it is now dismantled. The Nar Valley Way, a long-distance footpath which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> the valley for most of the length of the river now runs along the river bank.
