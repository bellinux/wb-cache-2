25|$|There {{are four}} other playable {{characters}} in the game. Gibari is a laid-back but proud fisherman. He is comfortable disobeying village rules when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> him, though this is usually done to help others, and prefers living by his own rules. Lyude is an imperial ambassador to Diadem, son of a powerful family {{in the heart of}} the Alfard Empire. He bears a dreadful secret related to his transfer to Diadem. Savyna is an ex-mercenary whose past is largely unknown. Mizuti is a masked creature who is shrouded in mystery. Towards the end of the game Mizuti's mask shatters and Mizuti is revealed to be a little girl, who possesses greater power than anyone else in her tribe.|$|E
25|$|This type of cricket {{is popular}} in the South Asian sub-continent, USA and Canada. In this game a harder version of tennis ball is used. The number of overs in the game varies from 6 to 25 overs. Considering that the ball is not as hard as the {{professional}} cricket ball, the use of protective gear like gloves, pads and helmets is optional. As tennis ball cricket games are shorter {{when compared to the}} conventional version, <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> the US and Canadian lifestyle where one would see {{a large number of people}} participating. Where cricket pitches are not available, part of a baseball diamond is used as a pitch in most parts of USA and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the initial}} plot {{in the first}} few episodes {{develops}} around an agent called Alan Ford, he is later just one of the central group of characters: Group TNT is an assembly of misfit secret agents, who operate from a flower shop in New York City, United States, which they use as a front for their secret headquarters. They are incompetent and lazy, yet intelligent and cunning, especially when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> their own personal interests. Their outlandish biographies are dwarfed by that of their iron-fisted and shrewd leader, the wheelchair-ridden Number One, a Methusalem character who embezzles the millions paid to the group by American government or city fathers for secret missions, while paying a pittance to his agents.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of formation, the AAP said that the promise of {{equality}} and justice that forms {{a part of the}} Constitution of India and of its preamble has not been fulfilled and that the Independence of India has replaced enslavement to an oppressive foreign power with that to a political elite. It claimed that the common people of India remain unheard and unseen except when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> the politicians. It wants to reverse the way that the accountability of government operates and has taken an interpretation of the Gandhian concept of swaraj as a tenet. It believes that through swaraj the government will be directly accountable to the people instead of higher officials. The swaraj model lays stress on self-governance, community building and decentralisation.|$|E
500|$|Ethnic {{characters}} were portrayed against stereotype in Massacre (1934). The protagonist (Richard Barthelmess) is a Native American who performs in a Wild West Show in full Indian garb, but then slips into {{a suit and}} speaks in American slang once the show is over. He has a black butler who is atypically intelligent; his character merely plays dumb by slipping into a stereotypical slow-witted [...] "negro" [...] character when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> him, rather than being genuinely unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto V co-writer Dan Houser {{explained}} that Trevor [...] "appeared to [...] pretty {{much out of}} nowhere {{as the embodiment of}} another side of criminality [...] If Michael was meant to be the idea of some version of criminal control [...] what about the guy who didn't do that?" [...] He later described Trevor as [...] "the person who's driven purely by desire, resentment, no thought for tomorrow whatsoever, completely id rather than ego-driven." [...] He stated that Trevor [...] "kills without remorse, like a true psychopath, but very sentimental for the right reasons when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> him." ...|$|E

500|$|Richard Fox {{and others}} note that while Wooden Leg's version is corroborated by the oral {{tradition}} of other Cheyenne witnesses, notably that of Kate Big Head, {{a young woman who}} witnessed the battle, there is no corroboration in {{the oral tradition}} of the Sioux. Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, {{but it is hard to}} know what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide". Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "" [...] (1993), Tessa {{witnesses}} {{the brutal}} murder of former artist Anne Wheeler (Diana Barrington), and reacts angrily when {{she realizes that}} the police will do nothing about it, saying: [...] "I'm not hysterical, I don't see things, and I'm not looking for attention. I just want something to be done." [...] She decides to find the murderer on her own. When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if something happened to him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, [...] "You only think so because <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> you." [...] The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.|$|E
500|$|According to Emily Jupp of The Independent, despite various {{changes in}} musical direction, an [...] "unconventional fashion sense" [...] {{has been a}} {{constant}} in Diamandis's career. In the video to [...] "How to be a Heartbreaker," [...] she [...] "subverts the norm" [...] by wearing more clothes than male models in the background; she reflected that [...] "I don’t think <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> me to wear very little clothing, it just wouldn’t feel right. I’d rather people listen to what I have to say instead of staring at my bum." [...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E

500|$|Betrayal is the {{secondary}} theme of The Wild Bunch. [...] The characters suffer from {{their knowledge of}} having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> them ("$10,000 cuts {{an awful lot of}} family ties"). However, Bishop says, [...] "When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." [...] Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that [...] "like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish." ...|$|E
500|$|With Martin's form uncertain, the {{favourite}} for {{the race}} was Alejandro Valverde. As well as performing strongly in the early-season hilly classics in the 2015 season, he had been close to success in Il Lombardia in the past: he finished second in both 2013 and 2014. Max Sciandri, a directeur sportif for the , said that the increased difficulty of the 2015 edition suited Valverde: [...] "now <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> the climbers and good descenders rather the Classics riders ... can climb, can descend and is even fast in a sprint finish." [...] Cycling Weekly suggested that Valverde's ability {{to recover from the}} Vuelta in time for Il Lombardia would work in his favour. Joaquim Rodríguez (...) would also have been a strong favourite {{for the race}}: he won the 2012 and 2013 editions and had come second in the Vuelta. However, he injured his knee when he hit a sign post while training and was forced to withdraw from the race.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} in the online {{speculative}} fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that {{the present and future}} passages [...] "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is [...] "too long" [...] with [...] "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps [...] "moving the goalposts as <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its [...] "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the [...] "revelations" [...] at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that [...] "by this point, it was for me hard to care". A {{review in the}} Oakland Tribune complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on [...] "crafting memorable characters", [...] "struggles" [...] with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he [...] "takes {{a long time to get}} there, and arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E

500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{mainstream}} Christians {{and certain}} other evangelicals had broader disagreements with the series as a whole, {{pointing out that}} [...] "most biblical scholars largely reject the eschatological assumptions {{of this kind of}} pop end-times literature." [...] Others say that LaHaye portrays the Book of Revelation with a selective literalism, choosing to take some things literally (such as the violence) and others as metaphor (the Beast) as <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> his point of view. In The Rapture Exposed by Barbara Rossing, a number of criticisms are raised regarding the series, particularly its focus on violence.|$|E
2500|$|Following Kenny's departure, {{the door}} {{has been left}} open for her return. Kenny commented: [...] "All I can say is it's a very Zsa Zsa ending and <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> the character. The door is open, which is very nice - I'd {{absolutely}} consider going back. It was really emotional. It's just like leaving behind a massive family. I really miss it - but onwards and upwards". Kenny also discussed writing the second series of EastEnders: E20, saying: [...] "I really wanted it {{to start with a}} bang. As soon as you come in it's exciting, there's sex and romance and kissing. I wanted it to be really fresh".|$|E
2500|$|... "Car Creation" [...] – The presenters {{take on the}} {{challenge}} of creating a vehicle, such as a police car, or hovercraft, mainly using a car they feel will be good {{as the basis for}} their design. While they mostly work together to create something unique, occasionally they will make their own designs separately and then compete against each other to see whose design is the best. Regardless of the set-up, the presenters' creation(s) will undergo a serious of challenge designed to determine how well it has been made and how well <b>it</b> <b>suits</b> its purpose. Many of the cars created by the presenters, were later displayed at World of Top Gear at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu after their appearance.|$|E
