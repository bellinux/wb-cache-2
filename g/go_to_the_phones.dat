5000|$|A Democratic {{analysis}} of phone records introduced at the 2005 criminal trial of James Tobin, the Northeast political {{director for the}} RNC in 2002, shows that he made 115 outgoing calls - mostly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same number in the White House office of political affairs - between September 17 and November 22, 2002, when the office of political affairs was headed by Mehlman.

40|$|Access (CDMA) mobile phones, no {{one could}} ever imagine a day would arise,when {{more than a billion}} mobile phones would be {{manufactured}} and used worldwide over a short span of time. Each mobilephone is required to have a unique serial number burned into its chips in order to prevent fraud. Without a unique number, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> can't be sold. So initially in order to identify phones on a network, engineers developed a 32 -bit code called the Electronic Serial Number (ESN). This code was used for billing and <b>to</b> make sure <b>the</b> right call <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>phone.</b> But 32 bits only allowed 4 billion unique numbers; engineers probably didn't forecasted ESN to be a long-term solution. IfESNs ran out and there was no standard to replace them, manufacturers would literally have to shut down production of CDMA phones. Certainly a technology was required which could provide a long term solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current problem and bring about a change before ESNs were exhausted. Thuscamethe role of Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID). This paper aims <b>to</b> present <b>the</b> need, role, future, issues and challenges CDMA phones face due to 32 bit ESN and how 56 bit MEID is going to rectify it...|$|R
