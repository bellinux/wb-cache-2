5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

25|$|The Space Shuttle generates 180dB {{of noise}} around its base. To combat this, NASA {{developed}} a sound suppression system which can flow water at rates up to 900,000 gallons per minute (57m3/s) onto the launch pad. The water reduces {{the noise level}} from 180dB down to 142dB (the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> is 145dB). Without the sound suppression system, acoustic waves reflect off of the launch pad towards the rocket, vibrating the sensitive payload and crew. These acoustic waves can be so severe that they can destroy the rocket.|$|E
25|$|Loss of delayed {{neutrons}} - In {{order to}} be predictably controlled, nuclear reactors rely on delayed neutrons. They require additional slowly-evolving neutrons from fission product decay to continue the chain reaction. Because the delayed neutrons evolve slowly, this makes the reactor very controllable. In an LFTR, the presence of fission products in the heat exchanger and piping means a portion of these delayed neutrons are also lost. They {{do not participate in}} the core's critical chain reaction, which in turn means the reactor behaves less gently during changes of flow, power, etc. Approximately up to half of the delayed neutrons can be lost. In practice, it means that the heat exchanger must be compact so that the volume outside the core is as small as possible. The more compact (higher power density) the core is, the more important this issue becomes. Having more fuel outside the core in the heat exchangers also means more of the expensive fissile fuel is needed to start the reactor. This makes a fairly compact heat exchanger an important <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> for an LFTR.|$|E

Given a set of <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> for a part during conceptual design stage, our system produces process sequences that can meet the <b>design</b> <b>requirements.</b> Quite often during conceptual <b>design</b> stage, <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> are not precisely defined. Therefore, we allow users to describe <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> in terms of parameter ranges. Parameter ranges are used to capture uncertainties in <b>design</b> <b>requirements.</b> Our system accounts for uncertainties in <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> in generating and evaluating process/material combinations. Our system uses a two step algorithm. During the first step, we generate a material/process option tree. This tree represents various process/material options {{that can be used}} to meet the given set of <b>design</b> <b>requirements.</b> During the second step, we evaluate various alternative process/material options using a depth first branch and bound algorithm to identify and recommend the least expensive process/material combination to the designer. Our system can be accessed on the World Wide Web using a standard browser. Our system allows designs to consider a wide variety of process/material options during the conceptual design stage and allows them to find the most cost-effective combination. By selecting the process/material combination during the early design stages, designers can ensure that the detailed design is compatible with all of the process constraints for the selected process. 1...|$|R
