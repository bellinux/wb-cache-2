Alternative Press called it [...] "an undeniable hip-hop masterpiece" [...] showing [...] "DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form", while David Bennun from The Guardian said the record was [...] "not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times, but also one of the loveliest." [...] In Playboy, Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful, [...] "they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about." [...] Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "The album flips hip hop inside out all over again like a reversible glove, and again, and again, and each time it's sudden and new. I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of good records, but very few impossible ones... You need this record. You are incomplete without it." [...] Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his [...] "Real Life Rock Top Ten" [...] column for Interview, where he called it [...] "absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract" [...] and [...] "quite brilliant throughout".|$|E

LA Times gave her the only A rating of the night's performances, saying that, [...] "With just Lambert and her guitar, she was pure late-night resignation {{as she opened the}} song, turning bitterness into pure reflection." [...] Chet Flippo of CMT.com spoke positively of the performance. [...] "For me, it was watching Miranda Lambert sing an original song with her own guitar accompaniment. ...That song contained what <b>I</b> wasn't <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of on the CMA Awards show: substance. And style. And personality. And grit." [...] Country Universe stated that Miranda Lambert's performance (along with Carrie Underwood's [...] "Just a Dream") was the best performance of the night. [...] "With understated brilliance, Lambert shifted gears by offering her Texas twang on the stripped-down ballad." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{involvement}} with Coltrane {{came to an}} end in 1965. Coltrane's music was becoming much more atonal and free; he had also augmented his quartet with percussion players who threatened to drown out both Tyner and Jones: [...] "I didn't see myself making any contribution to that music... All <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of noise. I didn't have any feeling for the music, and when I don't have feelings, I don't play". By 1966, Tyner was rehearsing with a new trio and embarked on his career as a leader.|$|R

[...] "Pâte filo" [...] was also featured in a commercial for Radio Shack in the United States. Regarding the French lyrics, Augustin said in an interview: [...] "I am sure the language, even if we say 'yeah., people from the states are interested in French music We are exportable,' which is something <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> {{it would still be}} difficult to understand that. We have a chance with Malajube, because people get the music. Even if it is in French and people don't get the lyrics, the music does the work. It talks to people." [...] When asked if Malajube find it odd to play a show to an English-speaking crowd and have people singing along who have no idea what they’re singing, Cournoyer said: [...] "Yes, it’s very funny. But wherever we go, there always seems to be a couple of Quebecers in the crowd, who teach other people." ...|$|E

They had these songs about soldiers going away to war and leaving the sweetheart behind and they were all tearjerkers. <b>I</b> would also <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the old music-hall songs and Victorian melodrama songs such as She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage or [...] [...] [...] things that would tear your heart out, bring tears to your eyes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ian is {{an outspoken}} critic of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which she sees as acting against the {{interests}} of musicians and consumers. As such, she has released several of her songs for free download from her website. [...] "I've been surprised at how few people are willing to get annoyed with me over it," [...] she laughs. [...] "There was a little backlash here and there. I was scheduled to appear on a panel somewhere and somebody from a record company said if I was there they would boycott it. But that's been pretty much it. In general, the entire reaction has been favorable. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people in my industry who don't want to be quoted, but say 'yeah, we're aware of this and we'd like to see a change too.'" [...] Along with science fiction authors Eric Flint and Cory Doctorow, she has argued that their experience provides conclusive evidence that free downloads dramatically increased hard-copy sales, contrary to the claims of RIAA and NARAS.|$|R
5000|$|In {{discussing}} the 2004 American presidential elections, Wallis said [...] "Jesus didn’t speak {{at all about}} homosexuality. There are about 12 verses in the Bible that touch on that question. Most {{of them are very}} contextual. There are thousands of verses on poverty. <b>I</b> don’t <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of that conversation." [...] Some time between 2008 and 2013, Wallis changed his mind and began to support same-sex marriage. In 2008 he made the following remarks: [...] "I don't think the sacrament of marriage should be changed. Some people say that Jesus didn't talk about homosexuality, and that's technically true. But marriage is all through the Bible, and it's not gender-neutral. I have never done a blessing for a same-sex couple. I've never been asked to do one. I'm not sure that I would." [...] However, in an interview in 2013, Wallis declared his support for same-sex marriage, and said [...] "Marriage needs some strengthening. Let's start with marriage, and then I think we have to talk about, now, how to include same-sex couples in that deeper understanding of marriage." [...] In both statements, Wallis advocated respectful biblical and theological conversations between Christians who disagree on this issue, as well as focusing on other important issues such as poverty.|$|R
5000|$|Simon Maher from CDBaby {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 5 out of 5 stars and commented: [...] "The {{professional}} recording debut EP of an aspiring Portuguese music artist, Ana Free, is a pleasant surprise. Ana Free's EP is an extremely impressive debut and it leaves you eagerly awaiting the release of her forthcoming album. This 5 track EP clocks in at a little over seventeen minutes. As the old saying goes, always take quality over quantity. These 5 tracks definitely have the quality. Judging by her debut, Ana Free is definitely one <b>I</b> expect to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more from in the near future". R. Freitas from Universe gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5 stars saying: [...] "Some songs like [...] "Questions In My Mind" [...] or [...] "Chained", show a mild calm and serene sounding, with well-structured complex original lyrics, {{as well as the}} other new songs. this album is a great original".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the last}} year of my 20s, [...] "I" [...] am {{thinking}} about Derek Hartfield. Feeling writing as a terribly painful task, I start re-telling the story of the 1970 summer. I was a student of a university in Tokyo then, and returned to my seaside hometown for summer vacation. That spring a girl I dated with at the university committed suicide. During the summer vacation, I frequented J's bar with my friend [...] "Rat". We spent much time drinking beer obsessively. One day, I came across a girl lying {{on the floor in the}} washroom of the bar and carried her home. The girl had no left little finger. Later, I ran into the girl by chance in the record shop where she worked. After that, she started calling me and we hung out a few times. Meanwhile, Rat was clearly troubled about some woman but he did not disclose the details. One day, the girl without a little finger met me at a restaurant near the harbor. We took a walk in the dusk along the warehouse street. She told me [...] "When I sit there alone, <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people coming talk to me ..." [...] That night, at her apartment, she revealed she just had abortion. When I came back in the winter, the girl had left the record shop and her apartment. I am married now living in Tokyo. Rat is still writing novels and sends his novel manuscript to me every Christmas.|$|R

It s {{about one-third of the}} number of visitors to the South African Government Online service, and one-quarter of those visiting the CGIAR family pages linking almost twenty international agricultural research organisations. The site is a collection of pages which describe CTA, reports on its activities, lists a calendar of events, carries the catalogue of publications, and several full texts of publications, and, of course, every issue of Spore since the end of 1977. The statistics for a two-month period from mid-November 2000 onwards show that Spore gets hit the most, accounting for one-third of all visits. This is partly because the various questions which bring people to the site are mentioned most often in Spore. Having read Spore in part or in full (more than 300 complete sets were copied to other people s computers), it seems that many people visit other parts of the site. Who is hitting us? That s hard to tell; we can only see the location of the server computer which is linking the enquirer s computer to ours. We cannot see where the enquirer is. So when we say 63 % of hits are from North America and 32 % from Europe, 2. 5 % from Africa and 0. 5 % from Oceania, we are, for once, far from the truth. Very many users of Internet systems in ACP and other developing countries use knowingly or not computer servers located in the North. The next refresh of the site will include an interactive space for users to give their feedback directly and that will help us know exactly where our users are. Have you hit us yet?

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as <b>a</b> referee. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|R
