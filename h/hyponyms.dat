25|$|Today, {{owing to}} {{technological}} convergence, the word fluoroscopy is widely {{understood to be}} a hypernym of all the earlier names for moving pictures taken with X-rays, both live and recorded. Also owing to technological convergence, radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are now all digital imaging modes using X-rays with image analysis software and easy data storage and retrieval. Just as movies, TV, and web videos are to a substantive extent no longer separate technologies but only variations on common underlying digital themes, so too are the X-ray imaging modes. And indeed, the term X-ray imaging is the ultimate hypernym that unites all of them, even subsuming both fluoroscopy and 4DCT. However, it may be many decades before the earlier <b>hyponyms</b> fall into disuse, not least because the day when 4D CT displaces all earlier forms of moving X-ray imaging may yet be distant.|$|E
50|$|Hyponymy is a {{transitive}} relation, if X is a <b>hyponym</b> of Y, and Y is a <b>hyponym</b> of Z, then X is a <b>hyponym</b> of Z. For example, violet is a <b>hyponym</b> {{of purple}} and purple is a <b>hyponym</b> of color; therefore violet is a <b>hyponym</b> of color. In addition, {{it should be}} noted that a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym: for example purple is a <b>hyponym</b> of colour but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a weakly supervised bootstraping algorithm that reads Web texts and learns taxonomy terms. The bootstrapping algorithm starts with two seed words (a seed hypernym (Root concept) and a seed <b>hyponym)</b> that are inserted into a doubly anchored <b>hyponym</b> pattern. In alternating rounds, the algorithm learns new <b>hyponym</b> terms and new hypernym {{terms that are}} subordinate to the Root concept. We conducted an extensive evaluation with human annotators to evaluate the learned <b>hyponym</b> and hypernym terms for two categories: animals and people...|$|R
50|$|If the {{hypernym}} Z {{consists of}} <b>hyponyms</b> X and Y, X and Y {{are identified as}} co-hyponyms. Co-hyponyms are labelled as such when separate <b>hyponyms</b> share the same hypernym but are not <b>hyponyms</b> of one another, unless {{they happen to be}} synonymous. For example, screwdriver, scissors, knife, and hammer are all co-hyponyms of tool, but not <b>hyponyms</b> of one another: *‘A hammer is a type of knife’ is false.|$|E
50|$|Hyponymy {{shows the}} {{relationship}} between a generic term (hypernym) and a specific instance of it (hyponym). A hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic field is more specific than its hypernym. The semantic field of a hypernym, also known as a superordinate, is broader than that of a hyponym. An approach to {{the relationship between}} <b>hyponyms</b> and hypernyms is to view a hypernym as consisting of <b>hyponyms.</b> This, however, becomes more difficult with abstract words such as imagine, understand and knowledge. While <b>hyponyms</b> are typically used to refer to nouns, it can also be used on other parts of speech. Like nouns, <b>hyponyms</b> in verbs are words that refer to a broad category of actions. For example, verbs such as stare, gaze, view and peer can also be considered <b>hyponyms</b> of the verb look.|$|E

This paper investigates the role of hypernym, <b>hyponym,</b> holonym and meronym relations in Hindi Word Sense Disambiguation. In this work, we have considered five different cases: all relations, hypernym and <b>hyponym,</b> hypernym, <b>hyponym</b> and holonym. No semantic relations are used in the baseline. We obtained an overall improvement of 12. 09 % in precision over the baseline for the case when all relations are considered. The maximum improvement for single semantic relation was obtained using <b>hyponym</b> which resulted in an overall improvement of 9. 86 % in precision...|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} of generalization to specialization (or particularization) {{is reflected in}} the contrasting words hypernym and <b>hyponym.</b> A hypernym as a generic stands for a class or group of equally ranked items - for example, tree stands for equally ranked items such as peach and oak, and ship stands for equally ranked items such as cruiser and steamer. In contrast, a <b>hyponym</b> is one of the items included in the generic, such as peach and oak which are included in tree, and cruiser and steamer which are included in ship. A hypernym is superordinate to a <b>hyponym,</b> and a <b>hyponym</b> is subordinate to a hypernym.|$|R

Words with multiple meanings (polysemous words) are mostly untranslatable, especially if they contain many connotations.Confusion of sense relations can also result because of semantic overlap. Confusion of sense relations in the set includes the improper use of superonym for <b>hyponym,</b> <b>hyponym</b> for superonym, a whole word for a partial word, a partial word for a whole word, antonym, confusion of co-hyponyms, and misuse of near-synonyms.|$|R

40|$|The task of {{detecting}} and generating hy-ponyms {{is at the}} core of semantic under-standing of language, and has numerous practical applications. We investigate how neural network embeddings perform on this task, compared to dependency-based vector space models, and evaluate a range of similarity measures on <b>hyponym</b> gener-ation. A new asymmetric similarity mea-sure and a combination approach are de-scribed, both of which significantly im-prove precision. We release three new datasets of lexical vector representations trained on the BNC and our evaluation dataset for <b>hyponym</b> generation. ...|$|R
5000|$|In linguistics, is-a {{relations}} are called hyponymy. Words that describe categories are called hypernyms and {{words that are}} examples of categories are <b>hyponyms.</b> In the simple biology example dog is a hypernym and Fido {{is one of its}} <b>hyponyms.</b> A word can be both a hyponym and a hypernym. For example, dog is a hyponym of mammal and also a hypernym of Fido. In ATC programs {{one of the most important}} tasks is the discovery of hypernym and hyponym relations among words.|$|E
5000|$|Hypernyms and <b>hyponyms</b> {{are words}} that refer to, respectively, a general {{category}} and a specific instance of that category. For example, vehicle is a hypernym of car, and {{car is a}} hyponym of vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Hypernyms and <b>hyponyms</b> are asymmetric. Hyponymy can {{be tested}} by substituting X and Y in the {{sentence}} ‘X {{is a kind of}} Y’ and determining if it makes sense. [...] For example, ‘A screwdriver is a kind of tool’ makes sense but not ‘A tool is a kind of screwdriver’.|$|E

Although our findings corroborate previous studies on total reading times, different processing costs among constituents of the sentence could not be identified. </p...|$|R
50|$|As a {{hypernym}} can {{be understood}} as a more general word than its <b>hyponym,</b> the relation is used in semantic compression by generalization to reduce a level of specialization.|$|R

5000|$|According to Cloem, dictionaries, ontologies and {{proprietary}} claim-drafting algorithms {{are used}} to draft alternative claims based on a client's original set of claims. In particular, the original set of claims is subject to various permutations and linguistic manipulations [...] "by considering alternative definitions for terms as well as “synonyms, <b>hyponyms,</b> hyperonyms, meronyms, holonyms, and antonyms.”" ...|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, {{the meaning}} {{relation}} between <b>hyponyms</b> and hypernyms applies to lexical {{items of the}} same word class (or parts of speech), and holds between senses rather than words. For instance, the word screwdriver used in the previous example refers to the tool for turning a screw, {{and not to the}} drink made with vodka and orange juice.|$|E
50|$|Co-hyponyms {{are often}} {{but not always}} related to one another by the {{relation}} of incompatibility. For example, apple, peach and plum are co-hyponyms of fruit. However, an apple is not a peach, which is also not a plum. Thus, they are incompatible. Nevertheless, co-hyponyms are not necessarily incompatible in all senses. A queen and mother are both <b>hyponyms</b> of woman {{but there is nothing}} preventing the queen from being a mother. This shows that compatibility may be relevant.|$|E

5000|$|Androcide is a {{coordinate}} term of femicide and a <b>hyponym</b> of gendercide. The etymological root of {{the hybrid}} word is derived {{from a combination of}} the Greek prefix andro meaning [...] "man" [...] or boy, with the Latin suffix cide, meaning killing.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{extension}} of Sumida and Torisawa’s method of acquiring hyponymy relations from hierachical layouts in Wikipedia (Sumida and Torisawa, 2008). We extract hyponymy relation candidates (HRCs) from the hierachical layouts in Wikipedia by regarding all subordinate items of an item x in the hierachical layouts as x’s <b>hyponym</b> candidates, while Sumida and Torisawa (2008) extracted only direct subordinate items of an item x as x’s <b>hyponym</b> candidates. We then select plausible hyponymy relations from the acquired HRCs by running a filter based on machine learning with novel features, which even improve the precision of the resulting hyponymy relations. Experimental results show that we acquired more than 1. 34 million hyponymy relations with a precision of 90. 1 %. 1...|$|R
