The ability to provide such search and rescue coordination was considered by IMO when the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) regulations were being developed. The basic legal requirements {{are to be found}} in the proceedings of the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), held in London in 1974, and amended by the Conference on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety Systems (GMDSS), held in London 1988. In the framework of the SOLAS Convention regulations, from the 1 st August 1993, all SOLAS passenger vessels and all cargo vessels of 300 Tons gross tons and above will have to be equipped with a <b>float-free</b> Emergency Position Indication Radio Beacon (EPIRB) which communicates via satellite.
