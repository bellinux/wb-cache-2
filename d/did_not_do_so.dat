5|$|Daniels' {{decision}} {{to run for}} Governor of Indiana led {{to most of the}} rest of Republican field of candidates to drop out of the race. The only challenger who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> was conservative activist and lobbyist Eric Miller. Miller worked for the Phoenix Group, a Christian rights defense group. Daniels' campaign platform centered on cutting the state budget and privatizing public agencies. He won the primary with 67% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> but Edward was called {{as a witness}} in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.|$|E
5|$|Mass demonstrations {{took place}} in Syria condemning US President Harry Truman for {{recognizing}} Israel. Synagogues were attacked in Damascus as were the offices of General Motors. US officials were frustrated at Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations. When Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon signed armistice agreements with Israel between February and April 1949, Syria under Quwatli <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> and refused to send a delegation to attend truce negotiations in Rhodes in March.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated much controversy {{and led to}} the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}.

5|$|United States Navy {{historian}} Frank Chadwick {{believed that}} de Grasse could have thwarted the British fleet simply by staying put; his fleet's size {{would have been}} sufficient to impede any attempt by Graves to force a passage through his position. Historian Harold Larrabee points out that this would have exposed Clinton in New York to blockade by the French if Graves had successfully entered the bay; if Graves <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Barras (carrying the siege equipment) would have been outnumbered by Graves if de Grasse did not sail out in support.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{supporter of}} national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills {{to subsidize the}} Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, and for a canal at Sault Ste. Marie. The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until a decade later.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} how {{directly}} Offenbach influenced Johann Strauss. He had encouraged Strauss to turn to operetta when they met in Vienna in 1864, {{but it was not until}} seven years later that Strauss did so. However, Offenbach's operettas were well established in Vienna, and Strauss worked on the lines established by his French colleague; in 1870s Vienna, an operetta composer who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> was quickly called to order by the press. In Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model.|$|E

She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E

5|$|Two {{wild animal}} taxa {{are unique to}} St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis), which is a {{subspecies}} of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of house mouse known as the St Kilda house mouse (Mus musculus muralis), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It {{had a number of}} traits in common with a sub-species (Mus musculus mykinessiensis) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) now breeds on Hirta but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> before the 1930 evacuation.|$|E
5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, {{the court did}} not have its own {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began a fight to get the court a building, and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, {{on the south side of}} the Capitol. Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building, but it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E
5|$|While Holloway's family {{initially}} discouraged {{a travel}} boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005. Twitty urged that persons not travel to Aruba and other Dutch territories {{because of what}} she stated were tourist safety issues. In a November 8, 2005, news conference, Governor Bob Riley and the Holloways urged Alabamians and others to boycott Aruba. Riley also wrote to other United States governors seeking their support—the governors of Georgia and Arkansas eventually joined in the call for boycott. Philadelphia's city council voted to ask the Pennsylvania Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell {{to call for a}} boycott.

5|$|After Kidd's {{arrival in}} Boston on 3 July, Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written {{account of his}} travels, which Kidd, after haggling over the time, agreed to deliver {{on the morning of}} 6 July. When he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest. It was {{executed}} as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day. Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom, using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips. Although a portion of Kidd's treasure was recovered, it did not buy Kidd's freedom, and he was shipped to London in April 1700, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged. In contrast to the relative secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd, Bellomont was scrupulous in his dealings with other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business, despite being offered as much as £5,000 to overlook illicit activities.|$|E
5|$|General Dean, the divisional commander, was {{angered by}} the poor {{performance}} of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> for fear of ambush. Dean replaced {{the commander of the}} 34th Infantry, Colonel Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula, and this would continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive. Dean took the blame for the defeat himself, and historians consider him at least partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion to hold the line against a numerically superior enemy who was well-trained.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, {{was at the heart}} of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
