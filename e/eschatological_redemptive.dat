40|$|M. A. Jesus' {{world was}} hostile towards women, domestically, socially, {{economically}} and religiously. Jesus' sympathetic attitude {{was a deliberate}} act by Him, in His attempt to correct the wrong views held by men about women. Luke presents this attitude in C three different approaches. Firstly, Luke pinpoints areas where Jesus went out of His way to show acts of mercy towards women, something which was not common in His days. When men were condemning {{a woman who was}} brought to Jesus because she was found committing adultery, Jesus forgave her. Secondly, Luke used the parallelism style to clarify the attitude of Jesus towards women. On this one Luke makes sure that everytime he records something done by or towards a man, he will immediately record a similar thing done by or towards a woman. For example, at the very early stage of Luke's book Jesus is recorded to have delivered a demon possessed man at a synagogue, and immediately after that he healed Peter's mother-in-law from fever. What is good for the goose is good for the gender type of approach. Luke's final approach as he attempts to reveal Jesus' sympathetic attitude towards women is a contrast approach. It is through this'approach that women are portrayed as being better than good religious Jewish men. A good example of this will be the story of a progressive Pharisee who invited Jesus for a dinner, and a sinful woman who joined them without an invitation. A woman ends up being the hero, doing all the things which Simon has failed to do to Jesus. Simon is put in a position of having to learn from the woman. This does not mean that women are superior than men; but that they are as good as men. It is just the focus is on them. Their case is over-emphasised to bring about equality. John on the other hand had some other things in mind than the gender issue when he wrote, however he could not fully reveal the identity of Jesus without touching on the role and status of women. It is in the book of John that we are introduced to the great women Of the Bible such as Mary the mother of Jesus, the Samaritan woman, the woman caught in adultery, Martha and Mary the sisters of Lazarus, Mary Magdeline and the Mary who anointed Jesus in preparation for His burial. This paper will therefore attempt to correct the misconception which is still prevailing on the status of women. It will orientate the reader by dealing with the historical development on this issue starting from ancient Israel to the situation of women today. The creation approach, the curse approach and the <b>eschatological</b> <b>redemptive</b> approach will all be dealt with. We will note how from one approach to the other women were kept {{in and out of the}} circle and how more and more the world became a man's world. And finally the tension between the approaches which is believed to have resulted in our modern extreme feminism. Men and women are equally created in the image of God. They are equally given the task of ruling over God's creation. They are different but equal. The only reason for their difference is for complementing one another. That is what God intended when He created man and woman. And that was destroyed by sin and made worse by our cultures and traditions which are self-centred and male-dominated. Jesus came, lived and taught about the gender equality. It is only when women are free, that men will be fully free...|$|E
