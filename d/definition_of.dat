5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> atheist was the common usage <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> that word, and admitting that the broad <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> agnostic was the common usage <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> that word, promoted broadening the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> atheist and narrowing the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism {{as a third}} alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{framework}} for reasoning about information-hiding requirements in multiagent systems and for reasoning about anonymity in particular. Our framework employs the modal logic of knowledge {{within the context of the}} runs and systems framework, much in the spirit of our earlier work on secrecy [9]. We give several <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> anonymity with respect to agents, actions, and observers in multiagent systems, and we relate our <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> anonymity to other <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> information hiding, such as secrecy. We also give probabilistic <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> anonymity that are able to quantify an observer's uncertainty about the state of the system. Finally, we relate our <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> anonymity to other formalizations of anonymity and information hiding, including <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> anonymity in the process algebra CSP and <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> information hiding using function views...|$|R

5|$|Breadth of <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a good: The broader the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a good (or service), {{the lower}} the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would {{tend to have a}} {{relatively}} high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E

Using a broad <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> access, based on the WHO <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> an improved water source, access {{in rural areas}} in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E

The realisation of the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E
