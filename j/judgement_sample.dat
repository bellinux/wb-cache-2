40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore how message framing is {{commonly}} used by magazine advertisers. Design/methodology/approach: Following the classification suggested by Levin et al., the frequency and nature of message framing in magazine advertising is explored using a content analysis of 2, 864 advertisements in a sample of popular US magazines. Findings: Results suggest a lack of consistency between marketing practice and academic findings. Contrary to academic recommendations, advertisers used positive framing in almost all advertising messages. Further, the use of attribute framing and combined attribute and goal framing was more popular than pure goal framing Research limitations/implications: Although the findings are limited by a <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> of US magazines, they do suggest the need for academics to conduct more research on the effectiveness of combined attribute and goal framing techniques.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a software tool for: (1) assessing uncertainties in environmental data; and (2) generating realisations of uncertain data {{for use in}} uncertainty propagation analyses: the ¿Data Uncertainty Engine (DUE) ¿. Data may be imported into DUE from file or from a database, and are represented in DUE as objects whose positions and attribute values may be uncertain. Objects supported by DUE include spatial vectors, spatial rasters, time-series of spatial data, simple time-series and objects that are constant in space and time. Attributes supported by DUE include continuous numerical variables (e. g. rainfall), discrete numerical variables (e. g. bird counts) and categorical variables (e. g. land-cover). Once data are imported, an uncertainty model can be developed for the positional and attribute uncertainties of environmental objects. This is currently limited to probability models, but confidence intervals and scenarios will be provided in the future. Using DUE, the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainty (autocorrelation), as well as cross-correlations between related inputs, {{can be incorporated into}} an uncertainty analysis. Alongside expert <b>judgement,</b> <b>sample</b> data may be used to help estimate uncertainties, and to reduce the uncertainty of the simulated output by ensuring each realisation reproduces the sample data.

40|$|Abstract What is love {{in nursing}} care? A {{qualitative}} study Recent failures in care highlighted through documents {{such as the}} Frances report have pointed to lack of kindness, respect and dignity in patient care and lack of professionalism. As a consequence, nurse education has come under the microscope, with questions about the potential to teach nurses compassion. The demonstration of these values were once, perhaps, more tangible and overt in nurse training and nursing care. The expression ‘tender loving care’ {{was used as an}} expression of nursing intervention, which often gave comfort and confidence to patients and their loved ones. There has been some speculation that as nurse training has become more ‘technical’ and degree-based, the emphasis has moved away from compassion and love in care. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore, from the perspective of nurse educators, love in nursing care and to understand how the concept of love in nursing can be integrated into education. The study design had two phases: A meta-synthesis of the literature and review which developed an understanding of love from the viewpoint of writers in theology, culture, history and sociology. How love is expressed in nursing was explored and presented. The relevant university research ethics committee provided ethical approval for the study. Qualitative semi-structured interviews using a <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> of volunteer nurse educators was conducted. The research question was unambiguous, ‘What is love in nursing care’? The transcripts of the interviews were analysed using Framework Analysis that is appropriate for health care and policy research. The commentary that these educators chose to use revealed four themes, human values, therapeutic relationships, attitude and context, which make up love in nursing care. The nurse educators in this research gave meaning to human values through their description of the reciprocity experienced in care, the interconnectedness which can occur with the maintenance of professional boundaries and through the unconditional positive regard described as knowing another’s vulnerability and being there for that person...|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{exploratory study}} was designed to discover the impact emerging exponential technologies (EmX technologies) have and will increasingly have on the talent and business models of knowledge-intensive services (KIS) firms. This research indicated the importance of talent {{and the extent to which}} talent is likely to be augmented or replaced due to these technologies. The dichotomy between talent and technology was of particular interest as KIS firms have generally based their ability to compete purely on their recruited and trained talent. The rationale for this study is that the researcher found limited academically published research addressing the impact of how KIS firms could increasingly use EmX technologies to enhance their competitive advantage in the market, while many of these firms face intensified client expectations and increased competitor rivalry. It was the researcher’s assumption that this research would aid KIS firms to obtain a more profound understanding of how they could use EmX technologies to modify their business models as a means of gaining a competitive advantage over their competitors. A <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> of ten senior executives in KIS firms was selected and in-depth interviews were employed as the primary data-collection method. The data was coded and organised according to the research questions. The analysis and interpretations of findings was structured to answer each of the research questions. This research revealed that EmX technologies are likely to evolve KIS firms’ business models to ensure greater use of these technologies through adopting digital strategies that better enable their talent; enhance their products and services and how they are delivered and alter their methodologies, processes and structures to gain an initial competitive advantage. Resultantly, KIS firms are likely to obtain reputational benefits of being ‘idea leaders’, which aids in differentiating them in the market; they would be able to better scale their businesses and achieve cost efficiencies. However, KIS firms would need to keep innovating as their competitors rapidly imitate any successful implementations. Various talent and business model recommendations were made to KIS firms in this study to help them take advantage of EmX technologies in an effective way.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010. The {{retention}} of artisans {{is becoming an}} increasingly important challenge faced by many organisations. The decision to intensify artisan retention strategies arises {{from the fact that}} there is currently a shortage of artisans in the country. This situation is aggravated by the fact that many of our country's current supply of artisans are being lured away to Canada and Australia by the highly competitive packages offered them. For effective {{retention of}} their artisans, organisations must be aware of the factors that artisans perceive as being important in the decision to remain with an organisation. The main research objective was, therefore, to establish the factors that are important for artisan retention. It was also decided to measure the level of intention to leave among a sample of artisans, as there were no results available from previous research. The research was explorative in nature and a mixed-methods design was used to achieve the objectives. The participants were selected by means of a <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> to consist only of participants who hold a formal qualification as an artisan, as prescribed by Sector Education and Training Authority (SETA) standards. Employees were requested to take part voluntarily in the research and a total population of 14 employees responded (N = 14). A semi-structured interview was used as means of collecting the qualitative data, while the quantitative data were collected by means of questionnaires. The results indicated that remuneration had the highest rank of all the factors for the retention of artisans, closely followed by development opportunity in second place. Other factors that were also perceived as important for artisan retention by the participants included equality (ranked third), recognition (ranked fourth), management and the working environment (ranked fifth), working relationships (ranked sixth), while change management, job security, belongingness, the merit system, job satisfaction and employee wellness were all ranked jointly in seventh place. With regard to Turnover Intention, the results indicated a mean score of 2, 38 out of 5, 00; it can thus be concluded that the sample reported an average level of turnover intention. The spread of the scores was quite large, indicating that some artisans had a strong intention to continue working at the organisation, while others were likely to consider other offers. By way of conclusion, recommendations were made both for the organisation and for future research. Master...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) All valuations {{of mineral}} assets in South Africa are {{guided by the}} South African Mineral Resources Committee (SAMREC) and South African Mineral Valuation (SAMVAL) codes. They have also been adopted by the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) {{in order to protect}} shareholders. Different capital {{budgeting}} methods are used for mineral assets valuation in South Africa. These are the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, cost, market and real options methods. It is not known which capital budgeting method is most often used for mining property valuations, as South African mining companies and associations are not required to share their capital budgeting processes with the public. In addition, the SAMVAL code does not recommend the use of the real options method and no reasons are provided. The study was aimed at establishing the capital budgeting method most often used for mining property valuations in South Africa, as well as the reasons why the real options method is not recommended by the SAMVAL code. A <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> of expert valuators was utilised in the study and interviews were carried out using open ended questions. The research revealed that NPV is the capital budgeting method most often used for mining property valuations followed by the IRR method. Outside South Africa, Bhappu & Guzman (1995) found that these preferences were reversed. Since the IRR method represents a notional rather than an actual return on investment, South African valuators were found to be more rational than their overseas counterparts in the application of these discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. The findings also revealed that the cost, market and payback methods were less preferred to the NPV and IRR methods. The reasons given were all consistent with the theory. The cost method was avoided because it uses historical cost data which is not usually applicable, the market method was limited {{due to the lack of}} available information on truly comparable projects and the payback method was shunned for undervaluing mining properties by ignoring cash flows that arrive after the payback period. The respondents also indicated that the real options method is the least used. The method (which includes the value of embedded optionality) was regarded as complex and not widely understood and this was also thought to explain why it is not recommended by the SAMVAL code. This finding indicated that in South Africa the embedded optionality in mining projects may not be taken into account and as a result, opportunities for the exploitation of its mineral assets could be missed...|$|E

40|$|MCom (Marketing Management), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 The global apparel {{market is}} an {{increasingly}} desirable industry sector for many marketers. The apparel retail industry in South Africa has experienced significant growth since the year 2000. In 2009, South Africans spent approximately R 57 million on apparel items (Statistics South Africa, 2009). On average, South Africans spend R 600 {{or more per}} month on apparel, making the apparel industry a very lucrative market. Consumer socialisation is {{the process by which}} the youth gain the necessary skills and knowledge that enable them to function as consumers in the marketplace. Consumer socialisation highlights the sources of consumer influences or ‘socialisation agents’ that transfer norms, develop attitudes, motivations and behaviour to the learner. Consumer attitudes, behaviour and skills are acquired through socialisation agents such as parents (father, mother and guardian), peers (brothers, sisters and friends) and the mass media (newspaper, television, radio, magazines) The Generation Y cohort (defined as individuals born between 1986 and 2005) is described as the largest and most profitable consumer group for marketers. Generation Y is a lucrative and growing market segment, particularly for apparel retailers. Apparel includes clothing, shoes, jewellery and cosmetics. Those Generation Y members engaged in tertiary education represent an especially important segment given that tertiary education often translates into higher future earning potential and a higher social status within a community and among peers. The primary objective of this research study was to investigate Generation Y students’ attitudes towards the influence of socialisation agents’ on apparel purchasing intentions in South Africa. The target population used in this research study was defined as full-time Generation Y undergraduate students, aged between 18 - 24 years, who were enrolled at public higher education institutions (HEIs) in South Africa in 2013. The sampling frame comprised the 23 registered South African public HEIs. A non-probability <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> method was used to narrow this sampling frame down to two HEI campuses situated in the Gauteng Province. For this study, a convenience sample of 500 full-time Generation Y students who were registered at these two South African HEI campuses during 2013 was drawn. A self-administered questionnaire was used for the collection of primary data for this research study. Academic staff at each of the two HEIs were contacted and asked if they would assist with the distribution of the survey questionnaire to students during class. The attitude towards the influence of socialisation agents on apparel purchasing intentions was measured based on peers, parents and the media. The outcomes from this research study suggest that Generation Y students do not perceive the influence of socialisation agents (peers/parents/media) as being particularly positive. While there was a significant positive relationship between their perceptions concerning the influence of peers, parents and media on apparel purchasing, none of these socialisation agents were perceived as having a significant influence on the Generation Y students’ monthly apparel spending. In terms of gender differences, males perceived the peer influence to be more important while females perceived the parent influence to be more important. There {{was no significant difference between}} males and females concerning the importance of the media influence on apparel purchasing. The analysis of statistical information gathered from this study will be relevant to both marketing practitioners and academia in understanding Generation Y consumers’ attitudes towards the influence of socialisation agents (peers/parents/media) in apparel purchasing intentions.

40|$|MCom (Marketing Management), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 With the South African retail {{industry}} being a major and attractive industry, marketers and retailers are pressured to obtain {{and maintain a}} competitive advantage by developing marketing strategies that appeal to various consumers. Retailers {{need to focus on}} satisfying consumers’ needs, as well as offering a full shopping experience. Shopping entails more than the mere selection of products. Consumers’ motivation or driving force behind the act of shopping is embedded in satisfying internal needs. These motivations are grouped into two collections, namely hedonic and utilitarian shopping motivations. Consumers driven by hedonic shopping motivations are interested in the shopping experience, as well as the experiential and emotional aspects thereof. However, consumers driven by utilitarian shopping motivations are goal-oriented and concerned with the task-related value and the functional aspects of shopping. Marketers and retailers may use consumer-shopping motives to divide the market into segments and develop strategies to target specific segments. Published literature on the consumer behaviour of the South African black Generation Y cohort is limited and an absence occurs with reference to the shopping motivations of this cohort. In the South African context, individuals born between 1986 and 2005, labelled Generation Y, account for 38 percent of the total South African population, and the black Generation Y individuals represent 83 percent of the total Generation Y cohort. Individuals within the black Generation Y cohort attaining tertiary qualifications are likely to represent the future ‘Black Diamonds’, enjoying higher earnings and a higher social status, which together is likely to make them opinion leaders amongst their peers. For that reason, the black Generation Y student cohort is an exceptionally attractive market segment, and it is critical for retailers and marketers to understand their shopping behaviour and motivations in order to develop effective marketing strategies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine South African black Generation Y students’ utilitarian and hedonic shopping motivations. The target population of this study comprised full-time undergraduate black Generation Y students; aged between 18 and 24 years and enrolled at South African registered public higher education institutions (HEIs). The sampling frame comprised the 23 registered South African public HEIs. A non-probability <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> method was utilised to select one traditional university and one university of technology in the Gauteng province, from the sampling frame. For this study, a convenience sample of 600 black Generation Y students enrolled at these two South African HEIs during 2013 was drawn. The relevant primary data was obtained by means of a self-administered questionnaire, which was hand delivered to the contacted lecturers at each of these two HEIs. These lecturers distributed the self-administered questionnaire during one lecture period. This questionnaire requested the participants to indicate on a six-point Likert scale the level of their agreement or disagreement on 26 items designed to measure their utilitarian and hedonic shopping motivations, as well as to provide certain demographic data. The findings of this study indicate that within the hedonic subscale, black Generation Y students found value and adventure shopping to be the strongest motivators for shopping. Within the utilitarian subscale, black Generation Y students found achievement to be the strongest motivator for shopping. Previous research found gender to have an influence on the hedonic and utilitarian shopping motivations of consumers. This study confirms previous findings where statistically significant differences were found between the shopping motivations of male and female black Generation Y students. The study found significant differences concerning the first-, second- and third-year black Generation Y students’ hedonic and utilitarian shopping motivations. Insights gained from this study will help both marketers and retailers understand the current black Generation Y consumers’ motivations for shopping with reference to hedonic and utilitarian shopping motivations.

40|$|PhD (Marketing Management) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2015 Green {{marketing}} is now recognised amongst academics as a reputable {{area of study}} and conventional marketing has taken a step back as green marketing comes into prominence {{in the fight against}} unsustainability. A number of organisations are using green marketing as a tool to differentiate their market offerings from those of their competitors in an effort to gain a strong position in today’s markets. These organisations are seeking to exploit consumers‟ growing environmental concerns and increasing green purchase intentions in order to acquire market share in the newly developed green consumer markets. The Generation Y cohort, born between 1986 and 2005, are the most technologically astute generation to date. When segmenting the Generation Y cohort, the black Africans hold the majority share, comprising 84 percent of the Generation Y cohort and approximately 32 percent of the entire South African population. Owing to its sheer size, the black Generation Y cohort presents as an attractive and lucrative market segment, especially those who hold a tertiary education. Individuals who pursue a higher education are linked to higher future earning potential. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} propose and empirically test a model of the antecedents of black Generation Y students‟ green purchase behaviour within the South African context. The proposed model suggests that environmental knowledge, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control have a direct positive influence on environmental attitude, which, in turn, has a direct positive influence on green purchase intentions. Moreover, the model infers that green purchase intensions have a direct positive influence on environmental purchase behaviour, while accounting for the mediating effects of perceived price (price) and perceived quality (quality). The sampling frame for the study comprised the 25 public registered HEIs situated in South Africa. From this initial list of 25 registered institutions, a <b>judgement</b> <b>sample</b> of four institutions in the Gauteng province was chosen, of which two included country-based universities and two city-based universities. Of the four universities, two were traditional universities, one a university of technology and one comprehensive university. Lecturers at each of the four campuses were contacted and asked if they would act as gatekeepers to the student participants. A convenience sample of 500 students across these four campuses was taken in 2014. Of the questionnaires completed, 332 were usable. The statistical analysis of the collected data included exploratory factor analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, structural equation modelling and independent sample t-tests. The findings of this study indicate that South African black Generation Y students are knowledgeable about the environment, consider the opinions of their peers regarding the environment, perceive their actions as having a positive effect on the environment and display strong pro-environmental attitudes towards the environment. Moreover, they display positive intentions to purchase green products and aim to behave in a pro-environmental manner. The influence of green purchase intentions on green purchase behaviour is partially mediated by the perceived price and quality of green products. This may explain the noticeable gap between environmental awareness and lack of actual green product purchases. Environmental knowledge and perceived behaviour control had a significant direct effect on black Generation Y students‟ environmental attitude, which, in turn, has a significant direct influence on black Generation Y students‟ green purchase intentions. Similarly, subjective norms and environmental knowledge had a significant direct effect on green purchase intentions. This study contributes to developing the green consumer profile of the black Generation Y consumer in South Africa. Furthermore, the study will aid in identifying the green consumer behaviour patterns amongst the South African youth. This study offers a conceptual model that illustrates the antecedents of black Generation Y students‟ green purchasing behaviour. The findings of this study will be helpful to national and international marketers seeking to profile and target the lucrative green market segment in South Africa. Doctora...|$|E
