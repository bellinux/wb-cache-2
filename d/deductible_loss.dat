40|$|Purpose of the article: Purpose of {{this article}} is to analyze and {{evaluate}} the conditions of Private equity and Venture capital financing in the Czech Republic and selected other European countries. The research is conducted in the form of comparative study. This research also identifies the barriers of this type of financing and proposes solutions for improvement. Scientific aim: The scientific aim {{of this article}} is observed mainly in the thorough analysis of available information about this topic and in the formulation of measures that would help to improve the conditions of PE/VC financing in the Czech Republic. Methodology/methods: In order to acheve the scientific aim of this research the following scientific methods are used: analysis, synthesis, inductive reasoning, description and comparison. Graphical visualization is used for demonstration of results. Findings: Several limitations and problems that hinder the development of PE/VC financing were identified. For example insurance and pension funds cannot invest in this type of assets. There is also little or no support from the government and public funds of funds or so called funds of venture capital do not exist. Following measures are proposed in order to improve the situation. Full implementation of the 2003 / 41 /ES regulation formulated by the European parliament on June 3 rd 2003. Public support of PE/VC financing - for example in a form of tax <b>deductible</b> <b>loss</b> originating from the PE/VC investment. Government support of new enterprises through so called fund of funds. Conclusions: Venture capital and private equity are great possibilities for enterprises with a high grown potential. A list of limitations and their solutions is proposed by this research based on the comparative study.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the choice of}} deductible in insurance contracts that insure against a risk that, as is common, might materialize more than once during {{the life of the}} policy. As was established by Arrow (1963), from the perspective of risk-bearing costs, the optimal contract is one that uses an aggregate deductible that applies to the aggregate losses incurred {{over the life of the}} policy. Aggregate deductibles, however, are uncommon in practice. This paper identifies two disadvantages that aggregate deductibles have. Aggregate deductibles are shown to produce higher expected verification costs and moral hazard costs than contracts that apply a per-loss <b>deductible</b> to each <b>loss</b> that occurs. I further show that each of these disadvantages can make an aggregate deductible contact inferior to a contract with per <b>loss</b> <b>deductibles.</b> The results of the analysis can help explain the rare use of aggregate deductibles and, in addition, might explain why umbrella policies that cover all types of losses are rarely used. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal form of insurance contracts for multiple risks. A well-known {{result in the}} literature is that, under fairly general conditions, an insurance policy with a <b>deductible</b> for aggregate <b>losses</b> is optimal. We provide a new proof of this result based only on stochastic dominance (whereas existing proofs require dynamic optimization techniques). Considering a real-world incompleteness, whereby separate loss exposures are indemnified via separate contracts, we show that separate deductibles are second-best optima in this setting. We compare the indemnity provided in this second-best setting with first-best solutions. The effect of second-best contracts on the individual's total insurance demand is also examined. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of the determinants of price responses to inclusion in the S&P 500 by providing evidence consistent with capital gains tax planning impacting stock reactions. Tests are conducted on 426 additions from 1978 - 1999. We regress the returns on the first trading day following announcement on a capital gains tax measure and controls. The evidence is consistent with the share prices of appreciated firms being temporarily bid up to compensate individual shareholders for any unanticipated capital gains taxes triggered when they sell to index funds and the share prices of depreciated firms being temporarily diminished when individual shareholders sell because buyers and sellers share the tax savings associated with <b>deductible</b> capital <b>losses.</b> We infer from these findings that in rebalancing their portfolios after S&P 500 additions, index funds share individual shareholders' capital gains taxes (or tax savings) through sales price adjustments. Consistent with temporary price pressure, further analysis shows that much of the price reaction unwinds over the following week's trading. Finding that personal capital gains taxes affect stock returns in a setting that does not bias toward taxes mattering suggests that capital gains tax capitalization may be a pervasive feature in equity valuation. ...|$|R

We find that average payments under the shallow loss program scenarios are elastic with respect to the program’s payment coverage rate. To empirically assess where shallow loss is likely to most benefit producers, we map at the county level the ratios of expected shallow loss payments to crop insurance premiums for corn, soybeans, cotton, and winter wheat. As tail dependencies among individual crop yield densities may vary spatially, we propose a method for grouping counties in a t-copula that allows for heterogeneity in tail dependencies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Under certain {{conditions}} the optimal insurance policy will offer full coverage above a deductible, as Arrow {{and others have}} shown long time ago. Interestingly, the same design of insurance policies applies {{in case of a}} single loss and ex-ante moral hazard. However, many insurance policies provide coverage against a variety of losses and the possibilities for the insured to affect the probabilities of each possible loss might be substantially different. The optimal design of a insurance contract providing coverage against different losses therefore should generally differ from the standard form under moral hazard. The paper concentrates on the conditions under which the standard insurance contract holds under moral hazard and more than one loss. It gives some evidence that many insurance contracts should be split up. The main result is, that the relative changes of probabilities due to precautious activities are decisive. On the other hand, under moral hazard it is rarely ever optimal to combine two losses in one insurance contract prescribing only a single <b>deductible</b> for both <b>losses</b> if both losses can occur simultaneously. insurance, multiple losses,moral hazard...|$|R

5000|$|Usually {{the values}} that {{insurance}} adjusters receive are either left-truncated, right-censored, or both. For example, if policyholders are subject to a policy limit u, then any loss amounts that are actually above u are reported to the insurance company as being exactly u because u is the amount the insurance company pays. The insurer knows that the actual loss is greater than u but they don't know what it is. On the other hand, left truncation occurs when policyholders are subject to a deductible. If policyholders are subject to a <b>deductible</b> d, any <b>loss</b> amount that is less than d will not even be reported to the insurance company. If there is a claim on a policy limit of u and a deductible of d, any loss amount that is greater than u will be reported to the insurance company as a loss of [...] {{because that is the}} amount the insurance company has to pay. Therefore, insurance loss data is left-truncated because the insurance company doesn't know if there are values below the deductible d because policyholders won't make a claim. The insurance loss is also right-censored if the loss is greater than u because u is the most the insurance company will pay. Thus, it only knows that your claim is greater than u, not the exact claim amount.|$|R
40|$|Background: Section 7 of the Income Tax Act  58 of 1962 (the Act) was {{introduced}} as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent tax avoidance {{by means of}} a donation, settlement or other disposition in various types of schemes. In terms of this section, in certain circumstances, ‘income’ is deemed to be income received by or accrued to a taxpayer. Despite the fact that the term ‘income’ has been used in Section 7 from the time that it was first introduced into the Act {{and the fact that it}} is defined in section 1 of the Act, there still remains uncertainty regarding the intention of the legislature and the actual meaning of the term in terms of Section 7. Aim: The objective of the study is to understand whether the term ‘income’, as used in Sections 7 (2) to 7 (8) of the Act, is used in its defined sense or if it should be ascribed a different meaning. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment. Method: A non-empirical study of existing literature was conducted by performing a historical analysis within a South African context. A doctrinal research approach was followed. Results: Possible interpretations determined include ‘income’ as defined in section 1 of the Act, namely ‘gross income’ (also defined) less exempt income, ‘gross income’, profits and gains or ‘taxable income’ (i. e. ‘income’ less allowable expenditure, deductions and losses) and ‘gross income’ less related <b>deductible</b> expenses and <b>losses.</b> Conclusion: It was found that the meaning of ‘income’, for purposes of Sections 7 (2) to 7 (8), remains an uncertainty, and it is recommended that the wording of Section 7 be amended to reflect the intended meaning thereof...|$|R
