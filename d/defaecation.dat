40|$|AIM: In {{patients}} with {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP), removal of the colonic mucosa is essential to reduce the lifetime risk of developing cancer). For this purpose, ileo-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been the gold standard, but morbidity related to the dissection of the pelvis remains substantial. In an attempt to reduce the procedure-related complications of pelvic dissection, ileoneo-rectal anastomosis (INRA) has been developed. In this case series of FAP patients, the long-term functional results, morbidity {{and quality of life}} (QoL) of the INRA procedure were evaluated and compared with its early outcome. METHOD: Long-term follow up of a consecutive group of eight FAP {{patients with}} an INRA procedure (between 1998 and 2005) was undertaken. Data on functional results, complications, manometry and endoscopy were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Eight patients with FAP underwent the INRA procedure. The median number of <b>defaecations</b> over 24 h was five. No pelvic sepsis or bladder dysfunction occurred. One patient, in whom concomitant Crohn's disease was diagnosed in retrospect, was converted to IPAA. In the INRA patients, no sexual dysfunction occurred. Endoscopic examination showed normal mucosa without any evidence of polyp formation. CONCLUSION: Restorative surgery by means of the INRA procedure yields good functional results in FAP patients, without any pelvic dissection-related morbidity or regrowth of polyps in the neo-rectum...|$|R

However, gallstones develop in some women who are not obese, and the causes are unknown. Biochemical studies have shown that slow intestinal transit is associated with lithogenic bile. We have tested the hypothesis that intestinal transit is abnormally slow in normal-weight women with gallstones. In a population survey, 1058 women aged 25 – 69 years, registered with general practitioners in Bristol, UK, underwent cholecystosonography. Gallstones were identified in 48 women, of whom 15 were of normal weight (body mass index ≤ 25 kg/m 2). These women and age-matched controls with healthy gallbladders then underwent measurement of whole-gut transit time (WGTT); the measurement was done directly when possible, or calculated from records of three <b>defaecations.</b> The mean WGTT was significantly longer in the women with gallstones than in the controls (82 vs 63 h; mean difference 19, 95 % Cl (2 – 37 h).

40|$|Objective. Irrigation of {{the distal}} {{part of the}} large bowel is a nonsurgical {{alternative}} for patients with <b>defaecation</b> disturbance. In our institution, all patients with <b>defaecation</b> disturbances, not responding to medical treatment and biofeedback therapy, were offered retrograde colonic irrigation (RCI). This study is aimed at evaluating the long-term feasibility and outcome of RCI. Methods. Between 1989 and 2001, a consecutive series of 267 patients was offered RCI. All patients received instructions about RCI by one of our enterostomal therapists. Twenty-eight patients were lost to follow-up. A detailed questionnaire was sent by mail to 239 patients. The total response rate was 79 % (190 patients). Based on the returned questionnaires it became clear the 21 (11 %) patients never started RCI. The long-term feasibility and outcome of RCI was therefore assessed in the remaining group of 169 patients. Thirty-two patients were admitted with soiling, 71 patints with faecal incontinence, 37 patients with obstructed <b>defaecation</b> and 29 had <b>defaecation</b> disturbance after low anterior resection or pouch surgery. Results. According to the returned questionnaires, RCI was considered effective by 91 (54 %) patients. Among patients with soling and faecal incontinence, RCI {{was found to be}} effective in, respectively, 47 and 41 % of the subjects. Despite of the reported effectiveness, 10 (67 %) patients with soiling and 5 (17 %) patients with faecal incontinence decide to stop. Among patients with obstructed <b>defaecation</b> and those with <b>defaecation</b> disturbances after low anterior resection or pouch surgery the effectiveness of RCI was found to be 65 and 79 %, respectively. None of these patients ceased their therapy. The overall succes-rate of long-term RCI was therefore 45 %. Conclusions. Long-term RCI is beneficial for 45 % of patients with <b>defaecation</b> disturbance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Because {{abnormal}} <b>defaecation</b> dynamics, {{which can}} be modified by biofeedback, {{are considered to be}} the underlying problem in constipation, biofeedback training may be a useful treatment for constipation. This treatment has mainly been studied in uncontrolled trials. We evaluated <b>defaecation</b> dynamics and clinical outcome in chronically constipated children in a randomised study comparing conventional treatment and conventional treatment with biofeedback training. METHODS: Patients, 5 to 16 years old, were referred to the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam by general practitioners, school doctors, paediatricians, and psychiatrists. They had to fulfil at least two of four criteria for paediatric constipation and were included if they had been treated medically for at least one month before randomisation. Patients had a medical history, abdominal and rectal examination, and anorectal manometry at the start and end of the 6 -week intervention period. The conventional group received laxative treatment with additional dietary advice, toilet training, and maintenance of a diary of bowel habits. The biofeedback group received the same conventional treatment and additionally five biofeedback training sessions. During the first 3 weeks, patients visited the outpatient clinic weekly; two subsequent visits were twice monthly. FINDINGS: 94 patients were randomised to conventional treatment (CT) and 98 to conventional treatment with additional biofeedback training (CT+BF). Normal <b>defaecation</b> dynamics increased in the CT group from 41 % to 52 % (not significant) and in the CT+BF group from 38 % to 86 % (p = 0. 001). At 6 weeks, more patients in the CT+BF group showed normal <b>defaecation</b> dynamics, compared to the CT group (p or = 3 /week, soiling and/or encopresis < 2 /month, and no laxatives) was accomplished in 59 % of the CT and 50 % of the CT+BF group (p = 0. 24). The results were maintained after 1 1 / 2 years follow-up. No association was found between achievement of normal <b>defaecation</b> dynamics and clinical outcome. INTERPRETATION: Additional biofeedback training compared to conventional therapy did not result in higher success rates in chronically constipated children. Furthermore, achievement of normal <b>defaecation</b> dynamics was not associated with success: abnormal <b>defaecation</b> dynamics seem not to {{play a crucial role in}} the pathogenesis of childhood constipation.

40|$|If {{interventions}} promoting improved hygiene behaviour {{to prevent}} childhood diarrhoea {{are to be}} implemented and evaluated, valid methods for measuring this behaviour will be required. This paper presents findings from a study to investigate the use of structured observations to measure hygiene behaviour in Burkina Faso. Two hundred mothers with young children (2 - 36 months) were observed on several occasions, with particular attention focused on events/behaviour surrounding <b>defaecation.</b> Child <b>defaecation</b> occurred most often in a potty (67 % of occasions). Stools were most often disposed of into a latrine (79 %). Following <b>defaecation</b> the child's bottom was usually rinsed using water alone with a bare hand (76 %). Subsequent hand washing by the mother/caretaker was much rarer (29 %). None of these behaviours appeared "reactive" {{to the presence of}} the observer. Less common behaviours showed some evidence of reactivity. The frequency of child <b>defaecation</b> in the yard increased over the course of three observations (5 % to 16 %; P = 0. 01) and the proportion of occasions on which the child was observed to be cleaned after <b>defaecation</b> declined (95 % to 85 %; P = 0. 01). Mothers usually took with them to the latrine a water recipient (91 %). Hand washing after leaving the latrine was observed on 30 % of occasions. This proportion declined from 36 % to 22 % over three observations (P = 0. 05). <b>Defaecation</b> by older siblings (aged 3 - 5 years) was usually into a potty (48 %) or directly into a latrine (30 %). There was no evidence that this behaviour was reactive. The repeatability of behaviours at the individual level was generally low. The site of index child <b>defaecation</b> ([kappa] = 0. 27), how the child's bottom was cleaned ([kappa] = - 0. 01) and whether the caretaker washed her hands afterwards ([kappa] = 0. 26) all showed low repeatability. The method of stool disposal was more repeatable ([kappa] = 0. 73). Hand washing by mothers after using the latrine showed moderate repeatability ([kappa] = 0. 40). Older sibling's <b>defaecation</b> behaviour had excellent repeatability ([kappa] = 0. 90). Our findings suggest that, in studies which aim to measure behaviour at the population level, structured observations may provide a useful tool. Studies which investigate links between hygiene behaviour and diarrhoea incidence at the individual level will require repeated observations of mothers and children since measuring behaviour during a single observation will lead to misclassification of exposure status, resulting in bias which could mask any underlying association.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} the plain abdominal radiograph in the assessment of constipation we prospectively studied 30 patients (20 females, 10 males, mean age 48. 6 years, range 21 - 76 years). These patients underwent the following tests: plain abdominal radiograph in supine position, measurement of stool weight (mean of 5 days) and whole gut transit time (20 radioopaque pellets, fluoroscopy of stools). All patients completed a questionnaire regarding their <b>defaecation</b> characteristics (a. o. average <b>defaecation</b> frequency and faecal consistency). The abdominal films were coded and independently scored for the degree of faecal stasis in ascending, transverse, descending colon and rectosigmoid by four gastroenterologists. To each of these parts of the colon a score of 1 (no faeces) to 4 (loaded with faeces) was assigned. The film scores given by the four observers were significantly correlated (p less than 0. 001). Significant correlations were found between the radiograph scores and frequency of <b>defaecation,</b> faecal consistency and stool weight. The strength of these correlations were of the same order of magnitude as those between the other subjective and objective <b>defaecation</b> variables. The scores for the left colon (descending colon and rectosigmoid) showed a better correlation with the other <b>defaecation</b> parameters than the scores for the right colon. It is concluded that in the assessment of constipation a simple plain abdominal radiograph is as reliable as measurement of faecal weight or marker transit and can thus be advocated as the first procedure.

40|$|Background: Control of <b>defaecation</b> and continence {{may be lost}} in {{patients}} with spinal cord injury. Electrical stimulation of sacral nerve roots to promote <b>defaecation</b> simultaneously activates both the rectum and the external anal sphincter (EAS), and may actually obstruct <b>defaecation.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether the EAS could be blocked selectively by selective stimulation of the ventral sacral nerve roots, and whether activation of the rectum without activation of the EAS could be obtained by stimulation of the ventral sacral nerve roots. Methods: Selective electrical stimulation was performed using anodal blocking, a tripolar cuff electrode and monophasic rectangular current pulses applied to the sacral nerve roots in nine Göttingen minipigs. Results: Simultaneous responses in the rectum and the anal canal were observed in five animals, whereas only anal responses were noted in four. Variations in cross‐sectional area and an increase in rectal pressure seemed to facilitate <b>defaecation.</b> Without blocking, the increase in anal canal pressure was 16 – 45 cmH 2 O. With blocking, this increase was abolished in seven and reduced to 3 – 6 cmH 2 O in two animals. Conclusion: Selective activation of the rectum is possible using an anodal block of somatic motor fibres. This technique holds promise in further development of electro‐defaecation...|$|E

We present the results of an ambulatory approach based on the integration of simulated balloon <b>defaecation</b> with small (50 ml) as well as constant rectal sensation volume, defaecometry and anal manometry. The pathophysiology visualised by the patient's own anorectal pressure recordings on the screen of a personal computer is explained and corrected. Sixteen patients were treated and followed for at least 1 year. Manometric data were normal except for an increased minimum residual pressure and rectal compliance. Nine patients could not evacuate a 50 ml bolus initially. Simulated <b>defaecation</b> became possible in seven out of these nine patients when the bolus was increased up to the individual constant rectal sensation volume. Two patients could not evacuate this volume either, while <b>defaecation</b> was made much less laborious in the other seven patients. Paradoxical contraction was immediately corrected in 7 / 16 cases. Also, as an immediate, objective benefit of a single training session, improved <b>defaecation</b> of a 50 ml bolus was observed in 11 patients.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the long-term outcome of patients who underwent a novel, autonomic nerve-sparing, laparoscopic technique for rectal prolapse. METHODS: Between 1995 and 1999, 42 patients had laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for total rectal prolapse. The long-term results after a median follow-up of 61 (range 29 - 98) months were analysed. RESULTS: There were no major postoperative complications. Late recurrence occurred in two patients. In 28 of 31 patients with incontinence there was a significant improvement in continence. Symptoms of obstructed <b>defaecation</b> resolved in 16 of 19 patients. During follow-up, new onset of mild obstructed <b>defaecation</b> was noted in only two patients.

40|$|Constipation is characterised by {{infrequent}} bowel evacuations, hard small faeces, {{or difficult}} or painful <b>defaecation</b> 1. Encopresis {{is defined as}} involuntary bowel movements in inappropriate places {{at least once a}} month for three months or more, in children aged 4 years or more 1. Incidence / prevalence It is common in children accounting for about 3 % of consultations in an average paediatric practice and 25 % of paediatric gastroenterology clinic consultations 1. Aetiology Constipation is usually idiopathic (90 - 95 %) with a peak incidence between 2 - 4 years of age 1. Psychosocial factors are often implicated although most children with constipation are developmentally normal. Chronic constipation can lead to progressive faecal retention, distention of rectum and loss of sensory and motor function of the bowel 1. Organic causes of constipation are uncommon but should be considered, including Hirschprung disease (1 / 5000), cystic fibrosis, anorectal physiological abnormalities, anal fissures, constipating drugs, dehydrating metabolic condition, and other forms of malabsorption. Children may withhold <b>defaecation</b> and this may make them liable to constipation. Risk factors for withholding include: fear of previous treatment for constipation or coercive potty training especially children between 2 - 3 years typically refusing to obey their parents, lack of privacy, domestic stress, sexual abuse, or pain on <b>defaecation</b> due to anal fissures or a perianal skin infection 2...|$|E

All faeces were collected from five cheetahs (two female and three male) ten days before and seven days after intramuscular injection of ACTH (50 IU). Samples were analyzed for glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Faecal glucocortcoid metabolites increased 234 – 715 % above baseline within 20 hours of ACTH administration in all five cheetahs. When left at ambient temperature, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites concentrations declined over time since <b>defaecation.</b> Therefore it is advisable to freeze samples immediately after <b>defaecation</b> for reliable monitoring of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Our results show that non-invasive monitoring of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites can be a valid and useful tool for assessing adrenal activity in cheetahs...|$|E
40|$|Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) with ileal pouch-anal {{anastomosis}} (IPAA) is {{the most}} frequently performed operation for intractable ulcerative colitis (UC) and for many patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It can be complicated by a functional evacuation difficulty, which is not well understood. We aimed to evaluate the role of defaecating pouchography {{in an attempt to}} assess the mechanism of evacuation difficulty in pouch patients. All RPC patients who had had a defaecating pouchogram for evacuation difficulty at one hospital between 2006 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The findings and features were correlated with the symptoms. Demographic, clinical and radiological variables were analysed. Eighty-seven [55 (63 %) female] patients aged 47. 6  ±  12. 5  years (mean standard ± SD) were identified. Thirty-five had a mechanical outlet obstruction and 52 had no identified mechanical cause to explain the evacuation difficulty. The mean age of these 52 [33 (63 %) female] patients was 48. 2  ±  13  years. Of these 52 patients, significantly more used anti-diarrhoeal medication (P =  0. 029), complained of a high frequency of <b>defaecation</b> (P =  0. 005), experienced a longer time to the initiation of <b>defaecation</b> (P =  0. 049) and underwent pouchoscopy (P =  0. 003). Biofeedback appeared to improve the symptoms in 7 of 16 patients with a nonmechanical defaecatory difficulty. The most common findings on defaecating pouchography included residual barium of more than 33 % after an attempted evacuation (46 %, n =  24), slow evacuation (35 %, n =  18) and mucosal irregularity (33 %, n =  17). Correlation between radiological features and symptoms showed a statistically significant relationship between straining, anal pain, incontinence and urgency with patterns of anismus or pelvic floor descent or weakness seen on the defaecating pouchogram. Symptoms of incomplete evacuation, difficulty in the initiation of <b>defaecation,</b> high defaecatory frequency and abdominal pain were not correlated with the radiological features of the pouchogram. Defaecating pouchography may be useful for identifying anismus and pelvic floor disorders in pouch patients who have symptoms of straining, anal pain or incontinence. In patients with a high frequency of <b>defaecation</b> and abdominal pain it does not provide clinically meaningful information. Patients who complain of straining, incontinence, anal pain or urgency and have anismus or pelvic floor disorders may benefit from behavioural therapy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Posterior vaginal wall {{prolapse}} (rectocele and enterocele) may {{be associated}} with problems with <b>defaecation.</b> Surgical correction of the prolapse may just treat the anatomi-cal defect, but not treat the underlying bowel problems.

The results demon-strated differences in terms of egg eclosion time, nymphal mortality and development rates, and feeding and <b>defaecation</b> rates. These differences appeared to follow a geographical cline, primarily reflecting different degrees of adaptation to domestic habitats.
