Challenges posed by rural kiosks, specifically (a) the absence of specialized hardware features such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) or a modifiable BIOS in older recycled PCs, (b) the potential use of periodically disconnected links between <b>kiosks</b> and the <b>Internet,</b> (c) the absence of a production-ready implementation of HIBE and (d) the limited availability of smartphones in most developing regions make these approaches difficult, if not impossible, to implement in a rural public computing scenario.

40|$|This release {{presents}} {{results from}} the Internet Activity Survey (IAS) conducted in respect of the three months ended 30 June 2015. The ABS counts the number of subscribers that have an internet connection with an ISP {{on the last day}} of the reference period. ABS subscriber statistics measure the number of 2 ÃÜ 7 subscriber lines 2 ÃÜ 7 rather than the number of 2 ÃÜ 7 users 2 ÃÜ 7 and therefore, counts of subscribers are not the same as counts of people/organisations with internet access. This is because some subscribers may have accounts with more than one ISP or multiple accounts with a single ISP. Conversely, there are single ISP subscriber accounts that provide internet access for multiple people/organisations (e. g. universities). The June 2015 IAS covers Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who operated in Australia as at 30 June 2015 that had more than 1, 000 subscribers. ISPs are defined as businesses that supply internet connectivity and access services to individuals, households, businesses, government and other organisations.
