50|$|By 1966,the Ministry of Transport was {{planning}} a longer road and {{for it to}} be partly motorway. The first version had a mid-south section, to follow a River Lea route, starting at Angel southwest of Dalston, heading northeast then north, taking land by the river in Walthamstow, Chingford and Waltham Cross, and meeting the built road alignment of today north of Harlow. The road from South Woodford to Islington would have been designated as the M12. The route was in planning stages with several options, with differences between the plans preferred by the Greater London Council and the Ministry of Transport - a different version called for this 'Eastern Avenue' to run more east-west alongside the Regent's Canal and the north side of Victoria Park, Hackney Wick, where it would have connected to the North Cross and East Cross Routes at the northeast corner of an <b>inner</b> <b>ringway</b> identified by the London Ringways plan.|$|E
