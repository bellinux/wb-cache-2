In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually <b>forming</b> <b>tube</b> structures resembling capillaries.VEGF causes a massive signaling cascade in endothelial cells. Binding to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) starts a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade that stimulates the production of factors that variously stimulate vessel permeability (eNOS, producing NO), proliferation/survival (bFGF), migration (ICAMs/VCAMs/MMPs) and finally differentiation into mature blood vessels. Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the mRNA production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis. As part of the angiogenic signaling cascade, NO is widely considered to be a major contributor to the angiogenic response because inhibition of NO significantly reduces the effects of angiogenic growth factors. However, inhibition of NO during exercise does not inhibit angiogenesis, indicating there are other factors involved in the angiogenic response.|$|E

40|$|Two electricians and an engineer, {{experienced}} in building wood templates for light pole base construction, {{saw an opportunity}} to make the process safer, less costly and more efficient. The result is the BOLT STAR® reusable bolt template, manufactured by Construction Innovations LLC of Sacramento, California. Bolt Star holds four anchor bolts and conduits in place while supporting the rebar cage during the concrete pour of a light pole base foundation. The tool replaces an inefficient, wasteful and error-prone construction process of constructing light pole foundations involving building wood “templates” to pole manufacturer specifications for the correct anchor bolt size and position. Unlike the repetitive 14 -step process of fabricating a wood template, Bolt Star mounts directly on the construction <b>forming</b> <b>tube</b> and takes just 6 steps to accomplish the same task – without the added logistics of ordering wood and gathering the drills and saws needed for the job.

50|$|Complex tubes can be {{made from}} {{multiple}} sheet components formed and welded together, but this adds unnecessary cost and creates quality concerns at the joints. Hydroforming uses liquid under extreme pressures to <b>form</b> metal <b>tubes.</b> It was developed for the plumbing industry and by 1990 achieved production efficiencies suited for high volume autos. Typically hydroforming is done at ambient temperatures, and limits the forming elongation of metals to 8‐12% diameter increase for aluminum, and 25‐40% for steel. This limits the part shape complexity that can be produced. In addition, the workcenters and tooling can be large and expensive because of the internal fluid pressures required to <b>form</b> ambient <b>tubes.</b> HMGF is able to <b>form</b> <b>tubes</b> with larger shape complexity in only one forming step and generally at a lower internal pressure than in conventional tube hydroforming.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) {{becomes more and}} more accepted within industrial manufacturing, the methods engineer has to deal with the choice of matching equipment as to perform the task of production in the best possible way. At the present time several manufacturers offer EMF-machines with different characteristics, whereby the machines consist of a pulse power generator and an exchangeable tool coil. The storable energy, the current capability and a high short circuit frequency enable the engineer to adapt tool coils for an optimised pressure course. In the following some aspects of how to dimension direct acting tool coil properties for the EM compression process will be considered. Basically the use of multi-turn coils is advantageous for a good matching. But {{in a lot of cases}} the use of a fieldshaper is necessary. It will be shown how the design of a tool coil system including a fieldshaper influences the pressure course. A special case is the application of EM compression in closed spaceframe structures for which a separable tool coil is required.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to study the end forming {{behaviour}} of friction stir processed Al 6063 -T 6 tubes fabricated at different tool rotational speeds. Tube expansion, tube reduction and tube beading are performed on the friction stir processed and parent tubes. The load, thinning and hardness evolution during the end forming operations are evaluated. A rotational speed yielding moderate combination of initial hardness and hardening index of the friction stir processed zone governs the maximum load required during end <b>forming.</b> <b>Tube</b> reduction and tube beading need larger load because of tube thickening, as compared to tube expansion, in which tube thinning is witnessed. The friction stir processed zone of the processed tube undergoes larger thinning and thickening as compared to base material in tube expansion and reduction, respectively, while base material thickens more in tube beading. The hardness and strain hardening exponent difference govern such thickness evolution. Mechanical instabilities like failure of friction stir processed zone, wrinkling and overlapping of friction stir processed zone, and fine cracks development are seen during the end forming operations. The effect of rotational speed on the hardness and grain size distribution of friction stir processed zone is negligible. The hardness of processed zone is found to increase after end forming operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{promoter}} sequence of sperm-expressed gene, PzIPT {{isolated from the}} S(vn) (sperm associated with the vegetative nucleus) of Plumbago zeylanica, was fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter sequence and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana to better visualize the live behavior of angiosperm sperm cells. Angiosperm sperm cells are not independently motile, migrating in a unique cell-within-a-cell configuration within the pollen tube. Sperm cells occur {{in association with the}} vegetative nucleus forming a male germ unit (MGU). In Arabidopsis, GFP was expressed equally in both sperm cells and was observed using a spinning disk confocal microscope, which allowed long duration observation of cells without bleaching or visible laser radiation damage. Pollen activation is reflected by conspicuous movement of sperm and pollen cytoplasm. Upon pollen germination, sperm cells enter the <b>forming</b> <b>tube</b> and become oriented, typically with a sperm cytoplasmic projection leading the sperm cells in the MGU, which remains intact throughout normal pollen tube elongation. Maturational changes, including vacuolization, general rounding and entry into G 2, were observed during in vitro culture. When MGUs were experimentally disrupted by mild temperature elevation, sperm cells no longer tracked the growth of the tube and separated from the MGU, providing critical direct evidence that the MGU is a functional unit required for sperm transmission.

The evolution of microstructure in PM 2000 alloy tubing formed by warm flow forming techniques {{has been the subject}} of continuing investigation and more detailed study in the current work. The warm flow <b>formed</b> <b>tubes</b> investigated were produced by reverse flow forming using three, 120 0 opposed rollers described around a tube preform supported on a driven mandrel.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{implementation}} of environmental protection, sustainable development and conservation-oriented policies, components and parts of thin-walled welded tubes have gained increasing application in the aircraft and automotive industries because of their advantages: easily achieving forming and manufacturing process at low cost and in a short time. The current research on welded tube plastic forming is mainly concentrated on tube internal high-pressure <b>forming,</b> <b>tube</b> bending forming, and tube spinning forming. The focuses are on the material properties and characterization of welded tubes, finite element modeling for welded tube forming, and inhomogeneous deformation behavior and the mechanism and rules of deformation coordination in welded tube plastic forming. This paper summarizes the research progress in welded tube plastic forming from these aspects. Finally, {{with a focus on}} the urgent demand of the aviation, aerospace and automotive industries for high-strength and light-weight tubes, this paper discusses the development trends and challenges in the theory and technology of welded tube plastic forming in the future. Among them, laser tailor-welded technology will find application in the manufacture of high-strength steel tubes. Tube-end forming technology, such as tube flaring and flanging technology, will expand its application in welded tubes. Therefore, future studies will focus on the FE modeling regarding how to consider effects of welding on residual stresses, welding distortions and microstructure, the inhomogeneous deformation and coordination mechanism of the plastic forming process of tailor-welded tubes, and some end-forming processes of welded tubes, and more comprehensive research on the forming mechanism and limit of welded tubes...|$|E
40|$|Regeneration {{of the arm}} of the starfish, Asterias rubens (L.) (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) was {{examined}} using two preparations. The first involved regeneration of the entire arm tip and its associated sensory structures and the second examined regeneration of a small section of radial nerve cord in the mid-arm region. Cell cycle activity was investigated by incorporation of the thymidine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Details of neuroanatomy were obtained by immunocytochemistry (ICC) using an antiserum to the recently isolated starfish neuropeptide, GFNSALMFamide (S 1). BrdU labelling indicated that initial events occur by morphallaxis, with cell cycle activity first apparent after formation of a wound epidermis. As regeneration proceeded, BrdU immunoreactive (IR) nuclei revealed cell cycle activity in cells at the distal ends of the radial nerve cord epidermis, in the coelomic epithelium, the perihaemal and water vascular canal epithelia, and in the <b>forming</b> <b>tube</b> feet of both preparations. By varying the time between BrdU pulses and tissue fixation, the possible migration or differentiation of labelled cells was investigated. Neuropeptide ICC indicated the extension of S 1 -IR nerve fibres into the regenerating area, soon after initial wound healing processes were complete. These fibres were varicose and disorganized in appearance, when compared to the normal pattern of S 1 -IR in the radial nerve. S 1 -IR was also observed in cell bodies, which reappeared in the reforming optic cushion and radial nerve at later stages of regeneration. Double labelling studies with anti-BrdU and anti-S 1 showed no co-localization in these cell bodies, in all the stages examined. It appeared that S 1 -IR cells were not undergoing, and had not recently undergone, cell cycle activity. It cannot be confirmed whether S 1 -IR neurons were derived from proliferating cells of epithelial origin, or from transdifferentiation of epithelial cells, although the former mechanism is suggested. Differentiation of the regenerating structures to replace cells such as S 1 -containing neurons, is thought to involve cell cycle activity and differentiation of epithelial cells in the epidermal tissue, possibly in association with certain types of coelomocytes which move into the regenerating area...|$|E

Starting with an {{ultimate tensile strength}} of 650 MPa, the material has recorded a tensile strength of 1250 - 1300 MPa corresponding to a percentage thickness reduction of 88. It has been observed that material with higher impurity, levels and inclusion ratings are more vulnerable to development of micro cracks at higher percentage thickness reduction. Deformed inclusions like MnS act as stress raisers leading to initiation of micro cracks. Hard to deform inclusions like silicates create high stress concentration at inclusion-matrix interface, leading to de-cohesion and finally cracking.
