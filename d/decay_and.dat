40|$|Abstract: We derive {{the effects}} of DM <b>decays</b> <b>and</b> annihilations on {{structure}} formation. We consider moderately massive DM particles (sterile neutrinos and LDM), as {{they are expected to}} give the maximum contribution to heating and reionization. The energy injection from DM <b>decays</b> <b>and</b> annihilations produces both an enhancement in the abundance of coolants (H_ 2 and HD) and an increase of gas temperature. We find that for all the considered DM models (sterile neutrino <b>decays,</b> LDM <b>decays</b> <b>and</b> annihilations) the critical halo mass for collapse, m_crit, is higher than in the unperturbed case. However, the variation of m_crit is small. In the most extreme case, i. e. considering LDM <b>decays</b> <b>and</b> halos virializing at redshift z_vir~ 10, m_crit increases by a factor 2. The variations of m_crit are also sensitive to the assumed concentration of the DM halo. Furthermore, we note that the fraction of gas which is retained inside the halo is substantially reduced (to ~ 40 per cent of the cosmic value), especially in the smallest halos, {{as a consequence of the}} energy injection by DM <b>decays</b> <b>and</b> annihilations. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive <b>decay</b> <b>and</b> thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This external heating differs from the internal heat source for volcanism on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope <b>decay</b> <b>and</b> residual heat from accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics.|$|E
