40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} Warrai dam yield with increased streamflow data, using stochastic streamflow generation techniques. The long term mean annual inflow at the dam site was estimated from the recorded mean annual inflow at the gauging station GS 8170002, in {{the ratio of the}} long term mean annual inflow to recorded mean annual inflow, at the Dirty Lagoon gauging station GS Bi 70020. The long term mean annual inflow at Dirty Lagoon gauging station was estimated by regression analysis of recorded annual infloVu'S at Dirty Lagoon and rainfall records at Darwin. The long term mean annual inflow at the Warrai dam site was estimated to be i 85, 500 ML/annum with a coefficient of variation of 0. 61. The annual coefficients of variation, skew and serial correlation of the streamflows at the dam site were taken to be the same as those of the recorded annual inflows. Using a lag one Markov model with a three parameter log normal distribution, long term streamflow sequences were generated from the estimated statistics of the long term inflows at Warrai dam. The generated flow sequences were used in a storage behaviour monthly model to determine the yield. Dam yields were determined for Oo/o, i 0 /o, 2 °/o and 5 °/o probabilities of failure for <b>full</b> <b>supply</b> <b>levels</b> from 74. 0 m AHD to 86. 0 rn AHD, and are shown below...|$|R
40|$|The {{arch dam}} at Selsforsen and the {{buttress}} dam at Storfinnforsen are two concrete dams of which both {{have suffered from}} severe surface spalling on the upstream face, far below the <b>full</b> water <b>supply</b> <b>level.</b> A hypothesis is that macroscopic ice lens growth, similar to frost heave in soil, could have occurred within the dam walls. After initial deterioration of the concrete dams by frost damage or cracking, the formation of macroscopic ice lenses {{could have been made}} possible. In an attempt to test the hypothesis, specimens of low strength concrete were exposed in the laboratory to climatic boundary conditions {{similar to those of the}} dams. After one week of freezing, the upper part of the concrete specimens was separated from the lower part due to cracking. The gradual propagation of the crack, which appeared about 25 mm below the top surface, was caused by macroscopic ice lens growth...|$|R

The technical apparatus is based on an extension of the theory of high-low search.
