5|$|Further {{coordination}} in {{the form}} of a General Managers' Conference faltered after Selbie withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by Selbie, a press release of November 1912 noting the Met's interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main-line railways and its <b>freight</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, who together operated a river <b>freight</b> <b>business,</b> commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, 1998, Amtrak {{extended}} the Pennsylvanian through to Chicago {{along the route}} of the Capitol Limited via Toledo, finally bringing a daylight connection to Cleveland. The Three Rivers continued to run over a different schedule via Akron and Fostoria. As part of the change Amtrak truncated the eastern end to Philadelphia, enabling the train to complete the run within a single day. The change was driven by Amtrak's growing mail and express business; Pittsburgh–Philadelphia ridership suffered. Amtrak returned the Pennsylvanian to the New YorkPittsburgh route on January 27, 2003, citing low ridership and Amtrak's withdrawal from the express <b>freight</b> <b>business.</b> On November 1, 2004, Amtrak merged the Pennsylvanian and Three Rivers, keeping the latter name with a western terminus in Chicago. Amtrak had sought $2.5million in assistance from Pennsylvania to keep both trains running. On March 8, 2005, Amtrak truncated service to PittsburghNew York and restored the Pennsylvanian name to the route.|$|E
50|$|Around 1863 Jones and Michael Goldwater began a <b>freighting</b> <b>business</b> from La Paz to Prescott in Arizona.|$|R
25|$|Besides {{operating}} a <b>freighting</b> <b>business,</b> Banning operated a stage coach line between San Pedro and Wilmington, and later between Banning, California, which was named in his honor, and Yuma, Arizona.|$|R
60|$|The fact is, the <b>freighting</b> <b>business</b> {{had grown}} to such {{important}} proportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly acquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines.|$|R
5|$|The little {{railroad}} went broke a {{few years}} later. At about this time, the Arkansas, Oklahoma & Western Railroad (AO) was forming. The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a distance of approximately 30miles (43km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf (P) at Siloam Springs. The AO planned to build eastward to Eureka Springs. On December 1, 1909, the AO purchased the Monte Ne railroad. To connect the AO and the Monte Ne, a track {{would have to be}} laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO to Lowell; the Frisco line was in the way, and they would not allow a connection. The AO instead built an expensive underpass of the Frisco. The construction of the underpass enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its outbound <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> to the AO rather than competitor Frisco. So the line enjoyed a brief but substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company located at Limedale. The underpass still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, a {{railroad}} between Chicago and Pierre, South Dakota severely damaged the <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> in Sidney. As the faster northerly route became preferred, freight companies moved their business to Pierre, mostly returning Sidney to the quieter times before the Gold Rush.|$|E
25|$|The Wade {{brothers}} bought Alligator on September 9, 1889 and a {{year later}} they sold it to Joseph Edward Lucas who owned the steamboat during most of the time of its operation.

50|$|In 1995 Calberson, {{along with}} its {{overseas}} operations, {{as well as the}} company Bourgey-Montreuil, and other non-rail <b>freight</b> <b>businesses</b> of SNCF-Sceta, were combined into Compagnie Générale Calberson which was renamed as Geodis. The Geodis group was subsequently privatised in 1996.|$|R

25|$|In November 1994, Deutsche Bahn chose ABB and AEG {{for two of}} its orders: ABB was {{to deliver}} 145 express {{locomotives}} for DB's long-distance business area DB Fernverkehr, the DBAG Class 101, while AEG was to supply DB's <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> area DB Cargo with eighty locomotives for medium-weight freight trains, the DBAG Class 145.|$|E

25|$|The DAR {{maintained}} a strategic link between Halifax and the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine ports of Windsor, Digby and Yarmouth. A key component to the DAR's passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> {{was through the}} connections with various ferries that operated in these waters, mostly from Digby and Yarmouth. A smaller service also operated across the Minas Basin from the smaller ports of Kingsport and Wolfville.|$|E

They were one of the first firms to ship cargo by air, and within a year, the firm was serving both coasts.|$|E
25|$|In August 1869, Gould and Fisk {{began to}} buy gold {{in an attempt}} to corner the market, hoping that the {{increase}} in the price of gold would increase the price of wheat such that western farmers would sell, causing a great amount of shipping of bread stuffs eastward, increasing <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> for the Erie Railroad. During this time, Gould used contacts with President Ulysses S. Grant's brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, to try to influence the president and his Secretary General Horace Porter.|$|E
25|$|Competition with {{a growing}} {{population}} of automobiles riding on state paved highways plus the dire financial impact of the Depression led {{to a decline in}} C passenger business. The reasonably good <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> collapsed as the C's interchange partners went out of business. The C ceased operations in 1939. The innovative Red Devils were sold after abandonment: six to the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway (CRANDIC) and thirteen to the Lehigh Valley Transit Company They operated satisfactorily for both interurbans into the early 1950s.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparation}} for privatisation, the freight sectors were {{further split into}} smaller business units, as regional splits of Trainload Freight, or further splits along customer market, such as inter-modal traffic, each with their own branding.

25|$|The FEC {{was already}} in the <b>freight</b> <b>business</b> only when Amtrak was created and assumed {{passenger}} operations of many other U.S. railroads in 1971. Periodically, there has been speculation that {{the southern end of the}} FEC line might be used for a commuter rail service to complement the existing Tri-Rail line (which follows former CSX tracks to the west). There has also been some discussion about Amtrak or the State of Florida using FEC lines for a more direct route between Jacksonville and Miami.|$|E
25|$|Historically, on routes where {{a single}} {{railroad}} {{has had an}} undisputed monopoly, passenger service was as spartan and as expensive as the market and ICC regulation would bear, since such railroads {{had no need to}} advertise their freight services. However, on routes where two or three railroads were in direct competition with each other for <b>freight</b> <b>business,</b> such railroads would spare no expense to make their passenger trains as fast, luxurious, and affordable as possible, as it was considered to be the most effective way of advertising their profitable freight services.|$|E
25|$|Over 75% of Mantetsu's {{income was}} {{generated}} by its <b>freight</b> <b>business,</b> {{with the key}} to profitability coming from soybean exports, both to Japan proper and to Europe. Soybean production increased exponentially with increasing demand for soy oil, and for soy meal for use in fertilizer and animal feed. By 1927, half of the world's supply of soybean was from Manchuria and the efforts by Mantetsu to expand production and to ship to export ports was {{a classic example of}} an extractive colonial economy dependent on a single product.|$|E
50|$|Waddell's first {{experience}} with the <b>freighting</b> <b>business</b> came through his partnership with Russell. In 1853, they created Waddell & Russell, a wholesale trading firm.
