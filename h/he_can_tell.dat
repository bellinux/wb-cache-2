25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E

After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E

In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark.

2500|$|After {{a stop at}} the {{dwelling}} {{place of}} an esteemed sorn scientist, wherein Ransom is questioned thoroughly regarding all manner of facts about Earth, Ransom finally makes it to Meldilorn, the home of Oyarsa. In Meldilorn, Ransom meets a pfifltrigg who tells him of the beautiful houses and artwork his race make in their native forests. Ransom then is led to Oyarsa and a long-awaited conversation begins. In the course of this conversation it is explained that there are Oyéresu (the plural) for each of the planets in our solar system; in the four inner planets, which have organic life (intelligent and non-intelligent), the local Oyarsa is responsible for that life. The ruler of Earth (Thulcandra, [...] "the silent planet"), has turned evil (become [...] "bent") and has been restricted to Thulcandra, after [...] "great war," [...] by the Oyéresu and the authority of Maleldil, the ruler of the universe. Ransom is ashamed at how little <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> Oyarsa about Earth and how foolish he and other humans seem to Oyarsa. While the two are talking, Devine and Weston are brought in guarded by hrossa, because they have killed three of that race. Oyarsa then directs a pfifltrigg to [...] "scatter the movements that were" [...] the bodies of Hyoi and the two other hrossa, using a small, crystalline instrument; once touched with this instrument, the bodies vanish. Weston [...] makes a long speech justifying his proposed invasion of Malacandra on [...] "progressive" [...] and evolutionary grounds, which Ransom attempts to translate into Malacandrian, thus laying bare the brutality and crudity of Weston's ambitions.|$|E

[...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E
