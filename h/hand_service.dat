50|$|Before 1994, the Italian {{water and}} {{sanitation}} sector was highly fragmented with about 13,000 local {{water and sanitation}} service providers, often providing water and sewer services separately in the same locality. Municipalities were both service providers and regulators, creating a conflict of interest. Investments were typically financed through government susbsidies, while recurrent costs of service provision were covered by tariff revenues. Tariffs were accordingly much lower than for example in France or in Germany. Furthermore, Italian utilities often provided and still do provide water at public fountains for free. However, because of high debt levels the government was less and less able to provide the subsidies to maintain the existing infrastructure and to improve service quality. The latter was particularly poor in Southern Italy where water supply was often intermittent. Furthermore, wastewater was often being discharged without treatment or with insufficient treatment. In order {{to comply with the}} EU Wastewater Directive of 1991, new expensive investments in wastewater treatment were necessary in addition to investments needed to maintain the ageing infrastructure. These investments were to be financed by the water service providers using their own resources instead of government subsidies. In order to make this possible, on the one hand tariffs were to be increased. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>service</b> providers were to become more efficient, reducing recurrent costs and non-revenue water so that a higher share of their revenues would become available for investments to maintain and improve service quality. Investments in wastewater treatment and bulk water supply were to be planned in a more rational way within the boundaries of river basins. Furthermore, fragmented service provision by municipalities was to be consolidated in regional utilities that were expected to be more efficient. Each local government on its own would not give up the responsibility for water supply, and mayors were reluctant to increase water tariffs for fear of losing votes. Therefore, the national government prepared a law that would force municipalities to regroup themselves and form regional utilities, as well as to achieve cost recovery from tariff revenues. Under the planned law, regional governments would have an important role in setting the geographic boundaries of the new regional utilities.|$|E

On one <b>hand,</b> <b>service</b> providers require user authentication and authorization {{prior to the}} provision of a service, {{while at the same}} time users require anonymity, i. e., untraceability and unlinkability for their transactions.

Furthermore, we discuss a generic approach for achieving a desired level of privacy against malicious insiders, while balancing with competing demands for access control and accountability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Privacy and {{security}} are two important but seem-ingly contradict objectives in pervasive computing environments (PCEs). On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>service</b> providers want to authenticate service users {{and make sure}} they are accessing only authorized services in a legitimate way. On the other hand, users want to maintain necessary privacy without being tracked down for wherever they are and whatever they are doing. In this paper we propose a novel privacy enhanced authentication and access control scheme to secure the interactions between mobile users and services in PCEs. The proposed scheme seamlessly integrates two underlying cryptographic primitives, blind signature and hash chain, into a highly flexible and lightweight authentication and key establishment protocol. It provides explicit mutual authentication between a user and a service, while allowing the user to anonymously interact with the service. Differentiated service access control is also enabled in the proposed scheme by classifying mobile users into different service groups. I...|$|E
40|$|While zero defects is a noble goal, {{services}} are often manufactured and delivered in real time, leaving {{no time for}} quality inspection prior to delivery to the customer. Hence service failure is inevitable from time to time. Based on equity and social exchange theories, a service failure situation represents a disproportionate exchange of resources, where customers experience a loss of resources such as money, time, self-esteem, etc. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>service</b> recovery is viewed as the company’s attempt to provide a gain to customers {{in order to make}} up for the loss experienced in the service failure. To develop an effective service recovery strategy that returns a customer to a state of satisfaction, the company or service personnel must provide customers with a resource that is equal to or exceeds what they have lost in the service failure. For example, a customer who had their selfesteem damaged in a service failure would prefer to receive an explanation and a genuine apology from the organization...|$|E
