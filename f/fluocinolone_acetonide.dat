40|$|Tritiated {{cortisol}} {{was applied}} to the skin of the abdomen, forehead and scrotum and qualitative and quantitative measurements made of the metabolites that appeared in the urine. In the first twelve hours, 17 percent of that applied to the scrotum was excreted but less than 1 percent of that applied to the abdomen. In the latter case the greater part of the tritiated metabolites were 17 -oxosteroids and not corticosteroids as would occur, (and in fact which were found), following oral administration of cortisol. This observation provides evidence of in vivo destruction of cortisol by cells of the skin and shows that at least in the case of abdominal skin, the process may be extensive. Evidence is presented to show that the finding of relatively large quantities of non-polar metabolites of cortisol in the percutaneous studies is not due to the application of impure tritiated cortisol or to the chemical or chromatographic manipulations of the experiments. It is suggested that cortisol when topically applied loses its side chain before reaching its site of action in the cells and so becomes physiologically inactive. The greater potency of triamcinolone and <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonides</b> administered percutaneously may be in part {{due to the fact that}} their side chains cannot be cleaved...|$|R

Methods: A retrospective case series was assembled from ADNIV patients {{in which there was}} fibrotic encapsulation of a <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> implant. CAPN 5 genotypes and surgical repair techniques were reviewed. Results: Two eyes of two ADNIV patients developed a fibrotic capsule over the <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> implant. Both patients had Stage IV disease. Patient A had a c. 731 T > C mutation in the CAPN 5 gene and patient B had a c. 728 G > T mutation. The fibrotic membrane was surgically excised and the implant function was restored. Conclusion: The exuberant fibrotic response in later stages of ADNIV may be resistant to local immunosuppression with steroids. Surgical excision of fibrotic membranes over FA implants can reestablish local steroid delivery in cases of severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

40|$|Wyatt B Messenger, Robert M Beardsle, Christina J FlaxelCasey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USAAbstract: Diabetic macular edema (DME) {{remains one}} of the leading causes of {{moderate}} to severe vision loss. Although laser photocoagulation was the standard of care for several years, few patients achieved significant improvements in visual acuity. As a result, several pharmacotherapies and surgeries have been investigated. The <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> devices are one of the latest therapies considered for the treatment of DME. Despite bringing significant improvements in visual acuity, fluocinolone devices are associated with cataract formation, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and surgery to lower IOP. Due to the risk of complications, <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> devices should be considered only in cases refractive to first-line therapies.

The pathogenesis is complex, with many contributing factors involved. In addition to overexpression of vascular endothelial growth {{factor in the}} diabetic eye, there is an inflammatory pathway {{that contributes to the}} breakdown of the blood-retina barrier and nonperfusion. In addition to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, clinical and experimental investigations underline the great potential of steroids in the treatment of DME. <b>Fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> is currently the only corticosteroid approved for the treatment of DME in Europe. It is manufactured as an intravitreal insert, releasing <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> at a rate of 0. 2 &micro;g per day. Phase III clinical studies have demonstrated that the beneficial effect of the <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> insert lasts up to 3 years. Improvement in visual acuity was especially remarkable in patients with a prolonged duration of DME of at least 3 years at the initiation of therapy. Cataract formation occurs in nearly all phakic eyes treated, and needs to be considered when the indication for treatment is made. Given the efficacy versus potential complications of the insert, <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> represents a promising second-line treatment option in patients with DME.

30|$|Inflammatory cystoid macular edema is {{a result}} of the {{breakdown}} of the blood-retina barrier and one of the main reasons for loss of vision in patients with non-infectious uveitis [1]. There are a variety of different local and systemic treatments available to treat uveitis, which help to reduce levels of inflammation and to resolve macular edema [2]. Although a broad range of different corticosteroid-sparing treatments is available, used to avoid the well-known steroid side effects, corticosteroids are still an important component in the treatment of uveitis because they are particularly effective in alleviating the inflammation associated with non-infectious uveitis. The wide spectrum of uveitis requires an individualized treatment approach and often combined therapy in some cases, particularly in patients with intolerance to systemic treatments where localized treatments are administered. This is an area where new corticosteroid-based implants have gained growing interest as their sustained effect may help to stabilize the disease activity. The dexamethasone implant (OZURDEX) is a short-acting corticosteroid lasting up to 6 [*]months, and it has been used successfully in the treatment of uveitis over the last few years [3]. The surgically implanted 0.59 -mg <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> implant (RETISERT) is FDA approved but has no EU license. It has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of uveitis [4], but has been associated with higher risks, e.g., raised intraocular pressure and dislocation of the implant [5]. The 0.19 -mg <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> intravitreal implant (FAc implant; ILUVIEN; Alimera Sciences Inc., Alpharetta, USA) is designed to provide a sustained release of 0.2 [*]μg/day of <b>fluocinolone</b> <b>acetonide</b> for up to 3 [*]years.

The <b>Fluocinolone</b> <b>Acetonide</b> for Diabetic Macular Edema (FAME) studies showed the FAc implant was effective in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and is now licensed for this indication [6]. As this implant has been shown to be effective in DME, it is hypothesized to be effective in treating other inflammatory based conditions such as non-infectious uveitis. The injectable FAc implant has been successfully used in the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis in a 2 -year follow-up study [7]. Our retrospective observational study therefore aimed to evaluate results from our clinic where it has been used off-label to treat non-infectious uveitic ME since 2013.|$|E
