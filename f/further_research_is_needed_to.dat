5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at {{the close of the}} 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fully establish {{the function of the}} luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E

25|$|According to Dr. Chris Ford, former {{clinical}} {{director of}} Substance Misuse Management in General Practice, among drugs of abuse, benzodiazepines are {{often seen as}} the 'bad guys' by drug and alcohol workers. Illicit users of benzodiazepines {{have been found to}} take higher methadone doses, as well as showing more HIV/HCV risk-taking behavior, greater poly-drug use, higher levels of psychopathology and social dysfunction. However, there is only limited research into the adverse effects of benzodiazepines in drug misusers and <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate whether this is the result of cause or effect.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in size {{has been}} proposed as {{an explanation for the}} widespread nature of sexual cannibalism across distantly related arthropods. Typically, male birds and mammals are larger as they participate in male-male competition. However, in arthropods this size dimorphism ratio is reversed, with females commonly larger than males. Sexual cannibalism may have led to selection for larger, stronger, females in invertebrates. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the explanation. To date, studies have been done on wolf spiders such as Zyuzicosa (Lycosidae), where the female is much larger than the male.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance.

While <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings {{open the door to}} the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E

25|$|Bile {{pigments}} such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant {{properties and}} therefore may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin {{have been shown}} to be potent scavengers of peroxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants — all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin — as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments — may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E
25|$|PELs for {{short-term}} and career astronaut exposure to space radiation {{have been approved}} by the NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer. The PELs set requirements and standards for mission design and crew selection as recommended in NASA-STD-3001, Volume 1. NASA has used dose limits for cancer risks and the non-cancer risks to the BFOs, skin, and lens since 1970. For Exploration mission planning, preliminary dose limits for the CNS risks are based largely on experimental results with animal models. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> validate and quantify these risks, however, and to refine the values for dose limits. The CNS PELs, which correspond to the doses at the region of the brain called the hippocampus, are set for time periods of 30 days or 1 year, or for a career with values of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mGy-Eq, respectively. Although the unit mGy-Eq is used, the RBE for CNS effects is largely unknown; therefore, the use of the quality factor function for cancer risk estimates is advocated. For particles with charge Z>10, an addition PEL requirement limits the physical dose (mGy) for 1 year and the career to 100 and 250 mGy, respectively. NASA uses computerized anatomical geometry models to estimate the body self-shielding at the hippocampus.|$|E

500|$|Some {{biologists}} {{have attempted to}} disarm triactinomyxon spores by making them fire prematurely. [...] In the laboratory, only extreme acidity or basicity, moderate to high concentrations of salts, or electric current caused premature filament discharge; neurochemicals, cnidarian chemosensitizers, and trout mucus were ineffective, as were anesthetized or dead fish. [...] If spores could be disarmed, they {{would be unable to}} infect fish, but <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> find an effective treatment.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes distinctions {{are made}} due to very slight {{differences}} in pelage coloration. [...] For instance, three distinctly colored types of mouse lemur {{were discovered in}} a multi-year study in Beza Mahafaly Reserve in southern Madagascar, but rather than being separate species, DNA tests revealed that they all belonged to a single species, the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus). For this reason, <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> confirm or deny the recent species splits. [...] Only through detailed studies of morphology, ecology, behavior, and genetics can the true number of lemur species be determined.|$|E
500|$|P. c. abietinus {{occurs in}} Scandinavia and {{northern}} Russia, and winters from southeastern Europe and northeastern Africa east to Iraq and western Iran.

Due to individual variation, {{it can be difficult}} to reliably separate P. c. abietinus and P. c. collybita outside their main breeding and wintering ranges. Some common chiffchaffs in the Middle East are browner and have a more disyllabic swee-hu call than P. c. abietinus, and may belong to a poorly known taxon [...] "brevirostris"; <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> clarify the affinities of this form.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} educational approach {{informed by}} cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex {{data to be}} presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – bits of information – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. [...] In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the course content, a hypertext document that allowed the learners to access content in a self-directed manner. These [...] (CFH) provide a “three-dimensional” and “open-ended” representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains.|$|E
500|$|Joel Asaph Allen first {{described}} Oryzomys mexicanus {{as a full}} species in 1897 from specimens from Jalisco. In the same publication, he also described Oryzomys bulleri from nearby Nayarit, {{but he did not}} compare the two with each other. Merriam added a second species from Nayarit, Oryzomys rufus, in 1901, noting that it was smaller and more reddish than mexicanus. Goldman synonymized the three as O.couesi mexicanus in 1918 and in 2009 Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred, arguing that the differences between rufus and mexicanus were age-related and within the normal range of variation of the animal. Another subspecies, Oryzomys couesi lambi, was described by Burt in 1934 from central coastal Sonora, which extended the range of the species by [...] at the time. This form is dark gray-brown, much darker than mexicanus, and has a shorter tail and weaker jugals. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that it is similar to mexicanus, but that <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine whether it should be recognized as a subspecies. Large O.couesi from northern Sinaloa may also belong to this form. Goldman wrote that mexicanus was very similar to nominate couesi, but usually with paler fur; the upperparts are more buffy than in couesi and the underparts are usually white, but may be buffy, the normal color in couesi.|$|E
