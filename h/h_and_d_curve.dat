40|$|An {{intensity}} scale monochromatic sensitometer was constructed using a Bausch and Lomb single-pass diffraction-grating monochromator as the dispersing device. A ribbon-filament tungsten lamp {{was used to}} supply the radiant energy to the monochromator. The instrument was calibrated 2 radiometrically and was shown to have a maximum irradiance of 10 ergs/cm 2 2 at 425 nm, 43. 7 ergs/cm at 550 nm and 26. 1 ergs/cm at 700 nm. Exposure is accomplished by transporting the film and step tablet past a slit at a constant velocity. Several film velocities and slit widths are available to produce exposure times ranging from 0. 003 to 2. 0 seconds. Spectral sensitivity measurements were performed on KODAK Panatomic-X and KODAK High-Speed Infra Red materials. The results were compared to information supplied by the manufacturer. The differences between the Rochester Institute of Technology curves and the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s curves were within 6 percent.

40|$|Background: Accurate film {{processing}} is {{of paramount importance}} in acquiring a good diagnostic radiograph. Radiographic films show variations in densities and contrast, with changes in processing conditions, and also film type, all of which are interdependent. Therefore, this research was conducted to recognize the effect of time and temperature variations of automatic processor on the sensitometric properties of blue and green light sensitive screen films. The study also aimed to note the effect on sensitometric properties when mismatch occurred when using between the screen and film belonging to different manufacturers. Materials and Methods: Sixty green light sensitive and 60 blue light sensitive spectrally matched screen film combinations were used in the study. However, the films and the intensifying screens employed belonged to different manufacturers. These films were exposed to five different exposure times and subsequently processed in an automatic processor, using two different protocols. Initially, at constant processing time of 2. 5 min, five different processing temperatures were employed. Later, maintaining constant processing temperature of 35 °C and five different processing times were engaged. Density, contrast and speed were calculated, using <b>H</b> <b>and</b> <b>D</b> <b>curve.</b> Results: Results revealed increasing density, contrast and speed values with increasing processing times and temperatures of both green and blue sensitive films. Conclusion: This investigation clearly establishes the possibility of obtaining optimal sensitometric properties, despite using intensifying screens and films of different manufacturers, if spectral match is ensured...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to establish an orthotopic human bladder cancer mouse model using an EGFR-overexpressing cancer cell line and to compare the therapeutic efficacy of intravesically instilled Bi- 213 -anti-EGFR-MAb with Mitomycin C. Methods: Female swiss nu/nu mice were catheterized and urothelial lesions were set by electrocautery. 2 x 106 luciferase transfected EJ 28 cells were inoculated intravesically in 7 groups of 10 mice each. 1 <b>h,</b> 7 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 14 <b>d</b> after cancer cell inoculation 0. 925 MBq of Bi- 213 -MAb were instilled into the bladder. 2 groups received 40 µg Mitomycin C at 1 <b>h</b> <b>and</b> 7 <b>d,</b> 1 group received unconjugated MAb, the control only PBS. Tumor development and therapy response were imaged by bioluminescence imaging and survival observed up to 300 d. Results: Mice of the control group and those treated with the unconjugated MAb reached a median survival of 41 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 69 <b>d,</b> respectively. Mice that underwent Bi- 213 -MAb therapy 1 <b>h,</b> 7 <b>d</b> <b>and</b> 14 <b>d</b> after cell instillation survived > 300 d in 90 %, 80 % and 40 %, respectively.

40|$|Dissolved gases {{including}} methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2 <b>H</b> 6), <b>and</b> propane (C 3 H 8) {{are natural}} components of groundwater.

Core samples were collected over 240 m of continuously-cored Quaternary-aged Battleford till (80 m) and underlying Cretaceous units (160 m) from an aquitard research site 140 km southwest of Saskatoon, SK, Canada. Physical properties (moisture content, density, grain size and carbon forms), stable <b>H</b> <b>and</b> oxygen isotopes of pore water (<b>d</b> 2 <b>H</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 18 O), pore water chemistry, and gas concentrations (CH 4, C 2 <b>H</b> 6, <b>and</b> C 3 <b>H</b> 8) <b>and</b> their stable C <b>and</b> <b>H</b> isotope values (<b>d</b> 13 CCH 4, d 2 HCH 4, d 13 CC 2 <b>H</b> 6, <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 13 CC 3 H 8) were measured on these cores. Results of physical parameters <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 <b>H</b> <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 18 O measurements agreed with previously reported data. The high-resolution profiles extend existing data sets into the Ardkenneth aquifer, the upper layer of which contains high percentages of sand and abrupt increases in values of <b>d</b> 2 <b>H,</b> <b>and</b> chloride (Cl-) and CH 4 concentrations; these peaks were likely introduced laterally from an alternate source. One-dimensional numerical modeling of the d 2 H confirms that transport across the till-shale interface occurred over ~ 20 - 30 ka Before Present (BP), and {{from the base of the}} oxidized till (~ 5 m below ground surface, BGS) into the till over ~ 10 ka BP. CH 4 concentrations through the till were below detection limit (BDL; < 5 ppmv); concentrations increase from 0. 04 mg L- 1 below the till-clay interface (at ~ 85 m BGS), to 49 mg L- 1 at 240 m BGS. One-dimensional numerical modeling of the CH 4 concentration profile suggests that the timing of deposition of the till cannot be constrained using CH 4, and that a geochemical reaction impacts its transport to ~ 30 m below the till-clay interface.
