25|$|Prior to {{the first}} {{commercial}} television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939 over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors {{at the time to}} have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for Ivory Soap, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bar of the product; for Mobilgas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel; and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful. Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed {{in the early years of}} the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program.|$|E
2500|$|His sheer energy {{helped to}} revolutionise the often stuffy world of Victorian journalism, while his blend of sensationalism and indignation, now so familiar, {{set the tone}} for British tabloids for more than a century. Like many journalists, he was a curious mixture of conviction, opportunism and sheer humbug. According to his biographer W. Sydney Robinson, [...] "He twisted facts, invented stories, lied, betrayed confidences, but always with a genuine desire to reform the world - and himself." [...] According to Dominic Sandbrook, [...] "Stead's papers forced his readers to confront the seedy underbelly of their own civilisation, but the editor {{probably}} knew more about that dark world than he ever let on. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mirror to Victorian society, yet deep down, like so many tabloid crusaders, he was raging at his own reflection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hamas {{turned over}} a two-minute 40-second video to Israel. Senior IDF officers, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu viewed the footage, after which Barak spoke to Shalit's father Noam and {{grandfather}} Zvi by telephone. The video {{was sent to}} the Shalit family home in Mitzpe Hila, with the family reportedly viewing it together. Members of the Israeli negotiating team for Shalit's release viewed the footage to ensure it met with Israel's demands, primarily with regard to how recently it was filmed. The , the only contact from Shalit other than three letters written by him and an audio tape released in June 2007, was released to the public at around 4:00 in the afternoon on Israeli television. In the video, Shalit is seen sitting in a chair in a bare room, looking frail and emaciated but otherwise healthy. He addressed Netanyahu and his parents, and reminisced about times he spent with his family. At the end of the video, he stated that the [...] "Mujahideen of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades are treating me very well".

Sparks who also wears a promise ring began her introduction of T.I. and Rihanna by saying [...] "It's not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, {{wants to be a}} slut."

[...] At the 2008 American Music Awards, Sparks won the award for Favorite Artist in the Adult Contemporary Category.|$|E
