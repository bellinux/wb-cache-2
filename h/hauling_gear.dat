50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the <b>hauling</b> <b>gear</b> through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperFisheries {{exploited}} under open-access conditions create externalities, {{resulting in}} a range of problems associated with over-capitalisation and stock depletion. One answer to this is to shift the mode of production away from hunting and towards husbandry, an approach which becomes feasible where some control can be exercised over the resource and the harvesting pressure to which it is subject. Physical structures in the form of artificial reefs make such control a practical possibility, but the way these might be managed so as to support a sustainable fishery is by no means obvious. To investigate this further, the views of commercial fishermen who use the artificial reefs in the Algarve region of Portugal were canvassed and their opinions sought specifically on the prospects for co-management. In general, it was found that {{for each of the three}} different geographical areas where the ARs were deployed, there were different views on the establishment of management measures. The reasons for this may be related to the fact that each skipper had different incentives, once they were subjected to different fishing conditions (e. g. target species, fishing area and <b>hauls,</b> <b>gear,</b> vessel, crew, etc). Different fishing incentives reflect no consensual agreements in terms of possible management measures to adopt. However, a trade-off solution could be obtained for both area closure and users, and the use of scientific expertise consultancy (e. g. weight-length studies for the target species found in each reef area) could help managers in the establishment of an adequate measure to be adopted for the season closure option...|$|R

40|$|Depredation, i. e. {{the damage}} or removal, of Patagonian {{toothfish}} (Dissostichus eleginoides) from longlines by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) can cause considerable economic loss for Spanish fishing {{vessels in the}} Southwest Atlantic. The fishery also suffers high bycatch rates of seabirds. The main goal {{of the study was}} to assess the extent of depredation and seabird bycatch and to test the potential of the so-called “umbrella” system, coupled with attached stones for faster sinking, for minimizing both. Moreover, we investigated the relationships between sightings of sperm whales, depredation, catches, and environmental variables using generalized additive modelling. Data were collected during 297 hauls on a longliner in 2007 / 2008 in international waters of the Southwest Atlantic. Sperm whales were sighted during 35 % of the <b>hauls,</b> always during <b>gear</b> retrieval, and their presence was positively related to fish damage. The overall depredation rate (0. 44 % of the total catch) was low, but is assumed to be underestimated because sperm whales were suspected of also taking fish without leaving visual evidence. The “umbrella-and-stones” system was highly effective in preventing bycatch and appeared to restrict depredation, but significantly reduced the catches.

40|$|Fishing gear {{effectiveness}} is a main parameter to measure effiency rate of fishing operation. At same time, fishing gear selectivity becomes a main consideration in preserving fish resources. Nowadays, {{the sustainability of}} fish resources is threatened because all fishers are attempting to narrow their net mesh size to increase their haul. The scarcity of fish resources and the increase of operational cost are dilemmas that can obstruct the implementation of effective and selective fishing operation {{based on the principle}} of fish resources conservation. The objective of research is to understand the effectiveness and selectivity rates of fishing gear. The indicators used to measure the effectiveness of fishing gear are boat speed during fishing activity and fish <b>haul</b> rate. Fishing <b>gear</b> selectivity is measured by comparing fish length during gonad mature and fish length during firstly-caught. This fishing gear selectivity is also used as the indicator of environmentally friendliness rate of purse seine. The calculation of fishing gear selectivity is begun by determining fish size at caught (Lc) and fish size at gonad mature (Lm) and then comparing both sizes with mesh size of purse seine. Result of research indicates that effective speed of fishing operation is achieved when boat speed is 7. 1 knots with fish haul rate of 1, 000 kg and with fishing operation time of 2, 853 seconds. Fishing operation speed above 8 knots is not efficient because it produces quite significant increase of fuel consumption although fish haul rate remains similar. Purse seine used in Sampang waters is not selective because the size of mackerel fish (selaroides spp) at firstly-caught (Lc) is smaller than fish length at gonad mature (Lm), thus Lc < Lm. Fish size at gonad mature (Lm) is 19. 35 cm, while fish size at firstly-caught is 18. 6 cm. Regression analysis indicates that there is a close relationship between fish length and fish weight, which is scored at 84...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Killer whale (Orcinus orca) and {{sperm whale}} (Physeter macrocephalus) {{depredation}} occurs when whales damage or remove fish caught on longline gear. This project used a mixed methods approach incorporating Generalized Linear and Additive Modeling techniques and social research methods, such as semi-directed interviews and written questionnaires, to evaluate: 1) spatio-temporal depredation trends, 2) depredation effects on groundfish catch rates, and 3) socio-economic implications of depredation avoidance and changing fishing practices due to whale interactions. The occurrence of killer whale depredation varied by target {{species and area}} based on National Marine Fisheries Service longline survey data and observer commercial fishery data collected from 1998 to 2012 in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Western Gulf of Alaska. The percentage of commercial fishery sets affected by killer whales was highest in Bering Sea fisheries for: sablefish (Anoplopomafimbria; 21. 4 %), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides; 9. 9 %), and Pacific halibut (Hippogolossus stenolepis; 6. 9 %). Killer whale depredation was more common on the standardized longline survey (9. 2 - 34. 6 % skates impacted) than the commercial sablefish fishery (1. 0 - 21. 4 % sets impacted) in all three management areas. Catch reductions were consistent across data sets. Average commercial fleet catch reductions ranged from 35 - 69 % for sablefish, Pacific halibut and Greenland turbot (p< 0. 001); survey catch reductions ranged from 51 - 73 % (p< 0. 001). Sablefish catch per unit effort, <b>gear</b> <b>haul</b> time and location significantly impacted the proportion of sets depredated. Fishermen reported changing their fishing practices in response to depredating whales by soaking gear longer to "wait the whales out" or moving to different fishing sites. These avoidance measures resulted in increased operation costs and opportunity costs in lost time. In a follow-up analysis based on data collected by fishermen in 2011 and 2012, {{it was found that}} killer whale depredation avoidance measures resulted in an average additional cost of $ 494 per vessel-day for fuel and crew food. Opportunity costs of time lost by fishermen averaged $ 486 per additional vessel-day on the grounds. These results provide insight into the potential impacts of whale depredation on fish stock abundance indices and commercially important fisheries in Alaska and will inform future research on apex predator-fisheries interactions...|$|R
