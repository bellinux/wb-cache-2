In the southwestern {{part of the}} constellation, it is 170 ± 7 light-years from Earth, Estimated to be around 1.79 times as massive as the Sun, it has expanded to around 10 times its radius. It is {{the brightest star in}} the Coma Star Cluster. With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> from which Berenice's imaginary tresses hang.|$|E
25|$|An <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> has {{two sides}} of equal length. An <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles {{opposite}} to the {{two sides of}} the same length; this fact is the content of the <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45–45–90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.|$|E

25|$|As a result, in an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> {{with one}} or two angles of 36°, the longer of the two side lengths is φ times that of the shorter of the two, both {{in the case of the}} acute as in the case of the obtuse triangle.|$|E

25|$|A {{triangle}} {{that has}} two angles {{with the same}} measure also has two sides with the same length, and therefore it is an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle.</b> It follows that in a triangle where all angles have the same measure, all three sides have the same length, and such a triangle is therefore equilateral.|$|E

25|$|Let ABC be an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> with AB and AC {{being the}} equal sides. Consider the triangles ABC and ACB, where ACB is {{considered}} a second triangle with vertices A, C and B corresponding respectively to A, B and C in the original triangle. Angle A is equal to itself, AB=AC and AC=AB, so by side-angle-side, triangles ABC and ACB are congruent. In particular angle B = angle C.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the design}} of the East Building by {{architect}} I. M. Pei is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one isosceles and the other a smaller right triangle. The space defined by the <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> came to house the museum's public functions. The portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center. The triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.|$|E
25|$|If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α {{because of}} the bisection, and CAB = α {{because of the}} similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the {{original}} isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to rear-admiral on 1 November 1860, Symonds became Admiral Superintendent at Devonport Dockyard, {{with his}} flag in the second-rate HMS Indus, in December 1862.

25|$|In 2001 Japanese {{researcher}} Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama {{surmised that}} the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created {{to celebrate the}} author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle,</b> a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000. Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force).|$|E

25|$|The {{conjecture}} is wrong; , {{who went}} back to the original Italian text, observed that for some triangles a larger area can be achieved by a greedy algorithm that inscribes a single circle of maximal radius within the triangle, inscribes a second circle within one of the three remaining corners of the triangle, the one with the smallest angle, and inscribes a third circle within the largest of the five remaining pieces. The difference in area for an equilateral triangle is small, just over 1%, but as Howard Eves pointed out in 1946, for an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> with a very sharp apex, the optimal circles (stacked one atop each other above the base of the triangle) have nearly twice the area of the Malfatti circles.|$|E
25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and {{what is to be}} proved. For example, the <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.|$|E
25|$|Let ABC be an <b>isosceles</b> <b>triangle</b> with AB and AC {{being the}} equal sides. Pick an {{arbitrary}} point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and angle A {{is equal to}} itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and angles are equal. Therefore angle ABE = angle ACD, angle ADC = angle AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and angle DBE = angle ECD have just been shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore angle BDE = angle CED and angle BED = angle CDE. Since angle BDE = angle CED and angle CDE = angle BED, angle BDC = angle CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and angle BDC = angle CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent. In particular, angle CBD = BCE, {{which was to be}} proved.|$|E
