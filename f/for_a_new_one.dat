5|$|On January 4, 2012, {{the band}} {{announced}} via the band's official website, {{along with their}} other official sources, that Howard Jones had left the band after his nine-year membership with them. In the statement, the band did not disclose {{the reason for this}} decision out of respect for Jones, but simply thanked him for his nine years with the band and wished him well, as well as thanking the fans for their support as they began the search for a new lead singer; Jones later explained he departed the band to manage his type 2 diabetes which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. Soon after the announcement of Jones's departure, rumors began that Phil Labonte of All That Remains would officially take over lead vocals due to his previous history with the band, although Labonte quickly dispelled the rumor. Many vocalists were considered in the search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> for the band. The band's search for a new singer concluded in February with the announcement that original lead vocalist Jesse Leach would return to the band, as the band felt that Leach's energy, as well as his overall comfort and command of both the old and new material, made him the clear choice during auditions. Following Leach's return, the band continued to the process of recording their new album and touring. On April 22, 2012, the band performed Leach's first show since 2002 at the New England Metal and Hardcore Fest.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{program is}} {{designed}} to aid the farm manager in deciding between keeping his presently owned mach ine or trading <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>one.</b> The approach is simple. An allowance for repairs is estimated, using the savings in fixed costs that would be expected by keeping the machine, plus the average annual repair cost during the period of ownership. If the repair allowance appears adequate for the extended period of use being considered, then serious consideration should be given to keeping the machine. There is no provision for considering tax advantages associated with purchasing new machinery...|$|R

25|$|One common {{method of}} searching for Sudokus with a {{particular}} characteristic is called neighbor searching. Using this strategy, one or more known Sudokus which satisfy or nearly satisfy the characteristic being searched for {{is used as a}} starting point, and these Sudokus are then altered to look for other Sudokus with the property being sought. The alteration can be relocating one or more clue positions, or removing a small number of clues, and replacing them with a different number of clues. For example, from a known Sudoku, a search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> with one fewer clues can be performed by removing two clues and adding one clue in a new location. (This can be called a {-2,+1} search). Each new pattern would then be searched exhaustively for all combinations of clue values, with the hope that one or more yields a valid Sudoku (i.e. can be solved and has a single solution). Methods can also be employed to prevent essentially equivalent Sudokus from being redundantly tested.|$|E

500|$|A {{new set of}} the {{interior}} of the TARDIS was also designed, which Moffat estimated was three times bigger than the previous set. Moffat did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor, but the brief to the set designer was to create a design that would suit Smith's Doctor. Though he loved the old set, Moffat thought it was time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> to [...] "surprise people", and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything. Piers Wenger said that it took [...] "quite {{a long time to get}} the design right" [...] and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking, as [...] "futuristic" [...] meant nothing to the Doctor. The set was designed by Edward Thomas. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of [...] "The Eleventh Hour"; the Time Rotor on console had to be rebuilt due to the explosion special effects that were used in The End of Time. In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the sonic screwdriver is destroyed, and a new version, featuring a green light and metal claws, was created. Smith liked to keep the prop with him at all times [...] "twirling it around and flicking it" [...] which resulted in him breaking four of them. The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production using a synthesizer. Moffat described the changes as starting with a [...] "clean slate" [...] which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left.|$|E

[...] Officials in Waynesville rejected them, however, claiming they didn't pay enough taxes. [...] On the way home, the three drank a bottle of whiskey, and decided to burn down the schoolhouse.

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Judith Weisenfeld sees Clean Pastures as an {{explicit}} rejection of Connelly's fish fry. Instead, {{she argues that}} the short {{is a metaphor for}} the replacement of one generation of African American performers and stereotypes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>one</b> as the result of African Americans moving to urban areas. In contrast to The Green Pastures and its portrayal of rural black culture, the cartoon is set in a solidly urban framework. Clean Pastures replaces stereotypes of black watermelon eaters and chicken stealers with black dancers, drinkers, and gamblers. Old-style black stereotypes are represented by the Stepin Fetchit angel and his recruitment sign, which promises delights that only appeal to rural black stereotypes. Yet even Bill [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson and Al Jolson, who built their careers on blackface depictions of rural blacks, reject Fetchit's plea for souls and opt for the Kotton Klub nightclub. The angelic jazz performers represent new, urban black culture. Through their rendition of [...] "Swing for Sale", the souls of the Harlemites are saved, and the cartoon makes the point that the African American culture of the period was increasingly urban culture, and by extension, that the black Heaven is an urban, Northern place. Lindvall and Fraser take a similar view, seeing the cartoon as part of the Warner directors' transition from stereotyping blacks as [...] "rural bumpkins" [...] to featuring them as [...] "urban hepcat".|$|E
2500|$|Dead pixel {{policies}} are often hotly debated between manufacturers and customers. To regulate {{the acceptability of}} defects {{and to protect the}} end user, ISO released the ISO 13406-2 standard. However, not every LCD manufacturer conforms to the ISO standard and the ISO standard is quite often interpreted in different ways. LCD panels {{are more likely to have}} defects than most ICs due to their larger size. For example, a 300mm SVGA LCD has 8 defects and a 150mm wafer has only 3 defects. However, 134 of the 137 dies on the wafer will be acceptable, whereas rejection of the whole LCD panel would be a 0% yield. In recent years, quality control has been improved. An SVGA LCD panel with 4 defective pixels is usually considered defective and customers can request an exchange <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>one.</b> Some manufacturers, notably in South Korea where some of the largest LCD panel manufacturers, such as LG, are located, now have a zero-defective-pixel guarantee, which is an extra screening process which can then determine [...] "A"- and [...] "B"-grade panels. Many manufacturers would replace a product even with one defective pixel. Even where such guarantees do not exist, the location of defective pixels is important. A display with only a few defective pixels may be unacceptable if the defective pixels are near each other. LCD panels also have defects known as clouding (or less commonly mura), which describes the uneven patches of changes in luminance. It is most visible in dark or black areas of displayed scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{dispensed}} with the experiment of having Hutton bat down {{the order and}} the old Roses opening partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook went to the crease. Hutton was full of confidence, 19 runs came off the first three overs and Keith Miller asked for a new ball in the fourth. Umpire Elphinstone examined the ball and changed it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>one,</b> which he ground into the dust to take the shine off. Hutton insisted on a look and bounced on the grass a few times {{so that it would}} lose its shape. It made no difference as another 8 runs came of the next two overs and Miller was taken off, only to take a diving catch off Ian Johnson (3/94) to dismiss Washbrook. Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; [...] "He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot. I ran across before he played it, flung out my hand and held the ball. I was just as astonished as Cyril". Hutton (62) and Simpson (49) took the score to 128/1 when Miller was brought back on to bowl one of his most famous overs. He bowled a [...] "super ball" [...] to dismiss Hutton lbw and bowled Denis Compton for a duck when the ball clipped the edge of the bat and ricocheted into the stumps. Gilbert Parkhouse survived until tea, but Reg Simpson guided another ball from Miller to Sam Loxton at short-fine-leg and England were 137/4. The popular Freddie Brown strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit Bill Johnston to the fence, lofted Lindwall into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto Umpire Barlow's foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the Welshman pulled Ian Johnson to Arthur Morris at mid-on at 187/5. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who held up one end while Brown scattered the in-field and clouted the Australian bowling round the ground. When he was finally out the next day, playing over a yorker from Ray Lindwall for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for England so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. England was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall bouncer at 263/6 and was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Godfrey Evans struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but Alec Bedser was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and John Warr by Miller (4/37). Bailey returned at 281/8 and tried to bat one-handed before he was caught by Don Tallon of Ian Johnson. Doug Wright joined Evans, but was run out for a duck by his Kent team-mate, tripping over his bat and pulling a muscle as he rushed home and England were all out for 290.|$|E
