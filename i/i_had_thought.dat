5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects.

I remembered a character <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts.

500|$|In {{his book}} The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) Gardner {{states that he}} first heard the term Wica while being {{initiated}} into the New Forest coven in September 1939, stating that [...] "I realised I had stumbled on something interesting; but I was half-initiated before the word Wica which they used hit me like a thunderbolt, and I knew where I was, and that the Old Religion still existed." [...] This account was repeated in his biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch (1960), written by Idries Shah but attributed to Jack L. Bracelin, {{in which he is}} quoted as saying that [...] "it was halfway through when the word Wica was first mentioned; and I knew that that which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] If Gardner's account was accurate and the New Forest coven had really existed, then the fact that Gardner spelled the word as Wica would not necessarily indicate that the coven members had spelled it the same way. As he relates, from Gardner's account, [...] "it seems that he had heard rather than read the word {{in the midst of his}} initiatory rite" [...] and that, [...] "suffering from a poor grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, something caused by the fact that he was self-educated and possibly also influenced by dyslexia", he would have therefore spelled the word phonetically as Wica.|$|E

Wilder's ending was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine – I would have done it if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wald's {{interest}} {{in the care of}} the terminally ill was piqued in 1963 when she attended a lecture at Yale University presented by the English physician Cicely Saunders, an innovator in the field who later created St. Christopher's Hospice, the world's first purpose-built hospice. Dr. Saunders spoke that day about her methods of using palliative care for terminally ill cancer patients, with the intention of allowing those in the latest stages of their disease to focus on their personal relationships and prepare themselves for death. An [...] "indelible impression" [...] was made by Dr. Saunders, with Wald noting that [...] "until then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> nurses were the only people troubled by how a terminal illness was treated".|$|E
2500|$|According to Gardner's later account, {{one night}} in September 1939 they {{took him to a}} large house owned by [...] "Old Dorothy" [...] Clutterbuck, a wealthy local woman, where he was made to strip naked and taken through an {{initiation}} ceremony. Halfway through the ceremony, he heard the word [...] "Wica", and he recognised it as an Old English word for [...] "witch". He was already acquainted with Margaret Murray's theory of the Witch-cult, and that [...] "I then knew then that which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived." [...] This group, he claimed, were the New Forest coven, and he believed them {{to be one of the}} few surviving covens of the ancient, pre-Christian Witch-Cult religion. Subsequent research by the likes of Hutton and Heselton has shown that in fact the New Forest coven was probably only formed in the mid-1930s, based upon such sources as folk magic and the theories of Margaret Murray.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E

2500|$|Although orders {{returning}} {{cases to}} state courts usually cannot be reviewed on appeal, federal circuit courts of appeals may consider appeals involving the Class Action Fairness Act. Dart Cherokee filed a {{petition for review}} pursuant to this exception in United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, but the Tenth Circuit denied their petition. Dart Cherokee then filed a petition for en banc review, but a divided panel of Tenth Circuit judges denied Dart Cherokee's petition. Judge Harris Hartz filed an opinion dissenting from denial of review en banc, in which he argued the Tenth Circuit's requirements for notices of removal were [...] "even more onerous than the code pleading requirements that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> the federal courts abandoned long ago". Judge Hartz concluded the Tenth Circuit had an [...] "obligation" [...] to grant review en banc [...] "to provide clarity in this important area of the law". After the Tenth Circuit denied review en banc, Dart Cherokee filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States, which was granted on April 7, 2014. The Supreme Court later stated that the Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split.|$|E
