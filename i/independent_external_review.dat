50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{controversy}} surrounding the introduction of the discretionary Social Fund had been the initial plan to forego any appeal mechanism in favour of an internal management review of decision-making. During the later stages of the parliamentary passage of the legislation, the Government conceded to the increasing pressure for some kind of <b>external,</b> <b>independent</b> <b>review,</b> albeit one which differed from the tribunal appeal model that had been a hallmark of the British social security system since the 1930s. The Social Security Act 1986 created 'social fund inspectors' (SFIs) to undertake <b>external</b> <b>reviews</b> of the frontline 'decision-makers'(DMs) who made the initial determination on social fund applications.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{as part of}} the CGIAR reform program, part of which was aimed at streamlining System governance. The CGIAR Annual General Meeting 2002 agreed to commission an <b>independent,</b> <b>external</b> <b>review</b> of both the Non Governmental Organization Committee (NGOC) and the Private Sector Committee (PSC). The terms of reference for the study asks two questions: 1) how successful have the Committees been in achieving their mission? and 2) are there alternative ways in which the CGIAR could achieve the Committees' mission more efficiently? The evaluation recognized that the two committee experiment in partnerships was generally disappointing to all parties but it nevertheless wishes to underscore the importance of persevering with the experiment. The report underlines the importance for strong relationships between the CGIAR system and international Civil Society as well as the relationship between the CGIAR system and the international private sector.

40|$|The Global Slavery Index ('the Index') {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} {{the number of people in}} modern slavery, the factors that make individuals vulnerable to this crime, and an assessment of government action across 167 countries. The Global Slavery Index is based on state of the art research methodology that has been developed with the assistance of an independent Expert Working Group, comprised of world leading experts. The methodology has also been subjected to <b>independent</b> <b>external</b> <b>review.</b> This estimate is based on data from nationally representative, random sample surveys conducted in 25 countries. All surveys were conducted face-to-face in key local languages using a standardised instrument. Collectively, these surveys represent 44 percent of the global population. The results of these surveys have been extrapolated to countries with an equivalent risk profile. The 2016 estimate is an increase on the estimate provided in the previous edition of the Index. As efforts to measure this hidden crime are still relatively new, we are not asserting that modern slavery has increased in the intervening period. Indeed, results from our surveys reveal some national estimates have increased while others have decreased. We believe that the overall larger number reflects a significant increase in the quality and quantity of research on this issue. While the methodology will continually improve, even at this early stage, survey data have greatly improvedthe accuracy of our measures...|$|E

In addition, the Task Force was asked to provide recommendations that could provide maximum benefit to the U. S. taxpayers and the International Partners within the President's budget request. The Task Force has made the following principal findings: (1) The ISS Program's technical achievements to date, as represented by on-orbit capability, are extraordinary; (2) The Existing ISS Program Plan for executing the FY 02 - 06 budget is not credible; (3) The existing deficiencies in management structure, institutional culture, cost estimating, and program control must be acknowledged and corrected for the Program to move forward in a credible fashion; (4) Additional budget flexibility, from within the Office of Space Flight (OSF) must be provided for a credible core complete program; (5) The research support program is proceeding assuming the budget that was in place before the FY 02 budget runout reduction of $ 1 B; (6) There are opportunities to maximize research on the core station program with modest cost impact; (7) The U. S. Core Complete configuration (three person crew) as an end-state will not achieve the unique research potential of the ISS; (8) The cost estimates for the U. S. -funded enhancement options (e. g., permanent seven person crew) are not sufficiently developed to assess credibility. After these findings, the Task Force has formulated several primary recommendations which are published here and include: (1) Major changes must be made in how the ISS program is managed; (2) Additional cost reductions are required within the baseline program; (3) Additional funds must be identified and applied from the Human Space Flight budget; (4) A clearly defined program with a credible end-state, agreed to by all stakeholders, must be developed and implemented...|$|E

40|$|Saudi Arabia has {{a diverse}} system of {{post-secondary}} education, {{and it is}} expanding rapidly in response to demographic changes and increasing demands for participation. There is also very rapid economic and industrial development and increasing exposure to international competition {{in many areas of}} activity. Post-secondary education must continue to expand and standards of education and training that are equivalent to international best practice must be achieved and widely recognized. The standards must be achieved in all institutions and in all programs. These requirements have led the government to establish the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment as an independent agency for quality assurance and accreditation. The Commission has responsibility for establishing standards, supporting quality improvement, and accreditation and in all post-secondary institutions other than those in defense. Its focus will be on both quality of institutions as a whole, and the quality of education and training programs. Principles underlying the system the Commission is developing include encouraging continuing improvement rather than being satisfied with minimally acceptable standards, encouraging diversity, ensuring cooperation and mutual support among the different agencies involved and designing approaches tailored to Saudi Arabia’s traditions and requirements rather than adopting a system developed elsewhere. In doing this the Commission is drawing on the best ideas we can find elsewhere in the world, but the system we develop will be our own. Pilot programs have been conducted in two universities involving institutional and program self-studies and <b>independent</b> <b>external</b> <b>reviews</b> to trial and refine the procedures involved. Developmental reviews are being carried out {{in a number of other}} universities and colleges to provide experience with the new processes. Most higher education institutions conducted initial self-evaluations based on the Commission’s standards for accreditation and have prepared strategic plans for introduction of quality systems prior to the commencement of the formal accreditation procedures in 2010. This paper gives a description of what has been done and concludes with a brief summary of some significant issues and challenges that must be dealt with in the effective implementation of the new system for quality assurance and accreditation in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This multicenter phase II {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the efficacy of the alternating schedule of irinotecan (CPT- 11) with bolus 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and leucovorin (LV) in first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients and methods: Patients with histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer, and at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion, aged 18 - 70, with performance status {{less than or equal to}} 2, normal baseline biological values and no prior chemotherapy (or only adjuvant chemotherapy completed greater than or equal to 6 months before study entry) were selected. Treatment was irinotecan 350 mg/m(2), i. v., day 1, alternating with leucovorin 20 mg/m(2) i. v. and 5 -FU 425 mg/m(2), i. v, daily for five consecutive days, day 22 - 26 (Mayo Clinic regimen). One alternating cycle was to be performed every six weeks. Patients were evaluated for efficacy every alternating cycle. Treatment was administered until five alternating cycles, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Results: Thirty-three patients (28 chemotherapy-naive and five with prior adjuvant treatment completed > 1 year prior to accrual) were enrolled. The objective response rate (RR) was 30 % (95 % CI: 16 - 49; 10 patients/ 33; nine partial response and one complete response). All responses were reviewed by an <b>independent</b> <b>external</b> <b>review</b> committee. An additional 49 % of patients had stable disease. The median survival was 16 months, the one year survival amounted to 58 % and the median progression free survival was 7. 2 months. Relative dose intensity was nearly 90 % for both drugs. Grade 3 - 4 diarrhea and neutropenia were the most frequent severe toxic events, seen in 24 % and 64 % of patients, respectively. Conclusions: The alternating schedule of CPT- 11 350 mg/m(2) with five days bolus of 5 -FU and low dose LV is an active and feasible regimen as front-line therapy for metastatic CRC. It is well tolerated, without evidence of overlapping toxicity. The response rate appears promising with regard to that expected with either single agent. This regimen warrants further assessment in randomized trials...|$|E
40|$|Law schools, to {{paraphrase}} the fictional Professor Kingsfield, take students who know {{next to nothing}} about law, and teach them to “think like lawyers. ” But a rough understanding of the methods of legal analysis does not necessarily equip budding lawyers with all the skills required for success in practice. Most importantly, although the ability to interpret rules of ethical conduct is one important element {{of the law school}} curriculum, mere familiarity with the rules of professional responsibility cannot impart sensitivity to the ethical issues that can arise in practice (much less ensure that new lawyers will place a high priority on maintaining essential standards of professional behavior). The recent Carnegie Report, an <b>independent</b> <b>external</b> <b>review</b> of law school teaching practices which compared legal education with other forms of professional training, emphasized the need to impart basic skills to lawyers before they enter practice, but also expressed concerns about producing lawyers who lack a commitment to professional responsibility. These concerns, moreover, have appeared in a series of prior studies and reports. The question thus arises anew: how can law schools produce “good” lawyers? Recent scholarship and experiments at several law schools suggest an array of potential solutions (big and small), several of which are outlined here. The bigger underlying question, however, addressed at the conclusion of this Article, is: when will law school change (on a broader basis) ? When will law schools incorporate, more fully, the kinds of changes that can ensure that new lawyers approach their careers equipped with a spirit of professionalism, competence and integrity, and with a genuine drive to demonstrate ethical behavior in all of their actions as attorneys? No magic solutions appear, but at least one essential component of change must involve demand, by the profession itself, for increased focus on ethics and professionalism. As this Article concludes, the recent economic down-turn may provide a significant catalyst for such change...|$|E
40|$|This {{article has}} been {{retracted}}: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal ([URL] {{article has been}} retracted {{at the request of}} the authors. It was brought to our attention that Figure  3 B of this paper, which shows very efficient labeling of the RuvB oligomer, contains an image that was possibly fabricated. An allegation of scientific misconduct was therefore lodged through the appropriate channel at Brandeis University against the paper’s first author, Kelsey Anthony. Pursuant to the university’s Research Misconduct Policy, the relevant facts and materials were collected by the Senior Research Officer, and this material was presented to the Provost. This investigation concluded that Kelsey Anthony did carry out scientific misconduct and that none of the paper’s co-authors were privy to her actions. In addition, an <b>external</b> <b>independent</b> <b>review</b> was obtained by Brandeis University that concurred with these findings. The <b>external</b> <b>review</b> also substantiated that the EM images and data in Figures 4 C and 4 D, which show the labeling of the 50 S, were not falsified. The fabrication of RuvB labeling gave the impression of very efficient labeling, but this is not the case. While the gold labeling of 50 S was successful, the misconduct of the first author noted above leaves us no other option but to retract this publication.

40|$|Although few {{successful}} {{examples of}} large-scale adaptive management applications {{are available to}} ecosystem restoration scientists and managers, examining where and how the components of an adaptive management program have been successfully implemented yields insight into what approaches have and have not worked. We document five key lessons learned during the decade-long {{development and implementation of}} the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) Collaborative Adaptive Management Program that might be useful to other adaptive management practitioners. First, legislative and regulatory authorities that require the development of an adaptive management program are necessary to maintain funding and support to set up and implement adaptive management. Second, integration of adaptive management activities into existing institutional processes, and development of technical guidance, helps to ensure that adaptive management activities are understood and roles and responsibilities are clearly articulated so that adaptive management activities are implemented successfully. Third, a strong applied science framework is critical for establishing a prerestoration ecosystem reference condition and understanding of how the system works, as well as for providing a conduit for incorporating new scientific information into the decision-making process. Fourth, clear identification of uncertainties that pose risks to meeting restoration goals helps with the development of hypothesis-driven strategies to inform restoration planning and implementation. Tools such as management options matrices can provide a coherent way to link hypotheses to specific monitoring efforts and options to adjust implementation if performance goals are not achieved. Fifth, <b>independent</b> <b>external</b> peer <b>review</b> of an adaptive management program provides important feedback critical to maintaining and improving adaptive management implementation for ecosystem restoration. These lessons learned have helped shape the CERP Adaptive Management Program and are applicable to other natural resource management and restoration efforts; they can be used to help guide development and implementation of adaptive management programs facing similar challenges...|$|R
