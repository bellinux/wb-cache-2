5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff {{but at least one}} engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E

25|$|This {{exhibition}} {{also featured}} La Maison cubiste. Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed facade of a 10 meter by 3 meter house, {{which included a}} hall, a living room and a bedroom. This installation {{was placed in the}} Art Décoratif section of the Salon d'Automne. The major contributors were André Mare, a decorative designer, Roger de La Fresnaye, Jacques Villon and Marie Laurencin. In the house were hung cubist paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger (Woman with a Fan, 1912). Though in the Deco section of the Parisian salon, the installation would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Cubist room at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City.|$|E

25|$|The {{artist has}} broken down the picture plane into facets, {{presenting}} multiple aspects of the subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910—since considered a founding principle of Cubism—would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> {{the foundations of the}} Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction through art dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, lot no. 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen. It is now in the Royal Collection of Paintings and Sculpture at the museum.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, the {{registration}} {{of a marriage}} means that it cannot later be declared invalid, since it has been accepted by the government. In Taiwan, which follows {{a variation of the}} Napoleonic Code (received by way of Japan), the presumption is that each country maintains a central registry of its citizens, including their marital status. If a Taiwan citizen marries in another country, however, this information may not <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the records. Many thousands of ROC soldiers who came to Taiwan in 1949 left behind wives in mainland China, but married local Taiwanese women. Since the two polities did not share records, the result was a pattern of legally recognized second marriages, despite the ban on polygamy by both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Today, foreigners wishing to marry Taiwan citizens must present letters from their countries' representative offices testifying that they are not already married. (Of course a determined bigamist might marry in some third country.) In the case of countries which lack centralized family records (such as the USA), a notarized affidavit is accepted.|$|E

500|$|Today, three {{versions}} of the work survive. Initially in 1913, Sibelius conceived of the commission as a three-movement suite for orchestra in E major, of which only No.2 (Tempo moderato) and No.3 (Allegro) are extant. At some point in 1913–14, Sibelius decided to rework the thematic material of the Allegro, very much a [...] "work in progress", into a single-movement symphonic poem; the musical content of the Tempo moderato would <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the piano piece [...] (To Longing), JS202. In {{making the transition from}} suite to tone poem, Sibelius transposed the material from E to D major; in addition, he also introduced new musical ideas, such as the rocking wave-like motif in the strings and woodwinds, and expanded the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|She {{started to}} work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} developed her eighth album Music (2000). However, that collaboration did not suit Madonna's musical direction.

So, that couldn't help but <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the music. I think there's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects my feelings at the time." [...] Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais, Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh.

500|$|Poems by Holmes, {{along with}} those by the other Fireside or Schoolroom Poets, were often {{required}} to be memorized by schoolchildren. Although learning by rote recitation began fading out by the 1890s, these poets nevertheless remained fixed as ideal New England poets. Literary scholar Lawrence Buell wrote of these poets: [...] "we value [...] less than the nineteenth century did but still regard as the mainstream of nineteenth-century New England verse." [...] Many of these poets soon became recognized only as children's poets, as noted by a 20th-century scholar who asked about Holmes's contemporary Longfellow: [...] "Who, except wretched schoolchildren, now reads Longfellow?" [...] Another modern scholar notes that [...] "Holmes is a casualty of the ongoing movement to revise the literary canon.

500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What do you think of Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, {{what do you think of}} Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell was the only way to get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E

500|$|Barroso's first Commission term expired on 31 October 2009. Under the Treaty of Nice, {{the first}} Commission to be {{appointed}} after the number of member states reached 27 {{would have to be}} reduced to [...] "less than the number of Member States". The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council and membership would rotate equally between member states. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007, this clause took effect for the next Commission. The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, mandated a reduction of the number of commissioners to two-thirds of member-states from 2014 unless the Council decided otherwise. Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner. However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the Council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards. However, according to the treaties it still has to be fewer than the total number of members, thus it was proposed that the member state that does not get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative– the so-called 26+1 formula. This guarantee (which may <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the next treaty amendment, probably in an accession treaty) contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in 2009.|$|E
