5000|$|Gaining <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> {{personality}} {{is often a}} goal of international actors. By gaining personality, they gain acknowledgment in the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> community. The amount of personality that an international actor has depends entirely upon state recognition. Legal personality can determine the rights that actors have {{as well as their}} standings with courts. As {{personality is}} given by states, {{it stands to reason that}} international actors are only effective when states allow them to be. [...] Without the approval of states, other actors have no rights nor any true ability in the international arena. One question that critics of the effectiveness of legal personality ask is if “personality contains any inherent <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> to act?” Personality is a concept with many blurred areas but must be grasped to understand the effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of international actors. Entities that are capable of being granted personality and thus being subjects of international law are those with the capacity to act within the international arena. Entities that are candidates for <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> personality include corporations, companies, sovereign states, international organizations, and individuals. These entities should have legal powers, the ability to effectively exercise their powers, and associations with states on a permanent basis.|$|R

Sometime, due to protection of rights of a person, <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> might be restricted. This thesis is divided up into ten parts.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the growing role of Indian {{lawyers in the}} transformation of Indian trade policy {{through the development of}} trade-related <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> By trade-related <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> we mean, broadly, the ability of a country to use law to engage proactively in the development and defense of international and domestic policy. Such capacity is critical for the drafting and interpretation of <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> agreements, the adoption of domestic regulation within those agreements’ constraints in order to defend policy space, the monitoring of foreign commitments, and the development of legal arguments in formal international litigation and informal dispute settlement. Through developing <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> public and private actors work together to open export opportunities abroad and defend domestic policy measures at home. While others have written of the legalization of international trade through the increased role of the WTO legal secretariat and the emergence of the WTO Appellate Body in international dispute settlement, this paper addresses the growing role of lawyers in the development of trade policy at home in one of the world’s rising powers, India. The paper builds from years of field research in India and Geneva, involving semi-structured interviews with over fifty Indian officials and stakeholders. The interviewees included former Ambassadors, members of the bureaucracy, private lawyers, private trade association and industry representatives, researchers in think tanks, academics, and news reporters. We complemented these interviews with participant observation in Geneva and in New Delhi, and reviewed our findings against primary and secondary documents...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{a number}} of local and {{regional}} governments {{around the world have}} started to engage in a real international or ‘paradiplomatic’ climate agenda. While the multilevel governance approach has advanced the examination of the actors and levels involved in climate governance, there is within this body of literature a limited consideration of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of non-state actors to act across scales. This article addresses this gap and examines the potential limitations imposed on subnational diplomacy by <b>international</b> and domestic <b>legal</b> orders. The article draws upon the example of Brazil where, despite constitutional limitations on the involvement of subnational governments in international relations, paradiplomacy has been termed ‘federative diplomacy’ and institutionalized within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and within the Presidency of the Republic. The article shows that the diplomatic activity of local and regional governments is still constrained by <b>international</b> and domestic <b>legal</b> frameworks. If cities and regions are to help in addressing the inadequacies of the international climate regime, then domestic and <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> frameworks will need to further accommodate subnational diplomatic activities...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> proceedings, which are the {{procedural}} reflection of legislation of restriction on <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> included in the Civil code. The <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> is the key legal institution for the human possibility to make a juridical acts. In some cases, it is neccessary, for the reason of protection of human, to restrict on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> eventually to choose another preferable measure. Procedural regulation of these proceedings is, with effect from 1. 1. 2014, contained in the Code on Special Court Proceedings (Act No. 292 / 2013 Coll.), as it comprises certain derogations from classic contentious proceedings. The aim of the thesis is to comprehensively summarise and interpret this legislation including her relation on the substantive regulation, point out her faults and propose options, how to remove them. To this purpose, opinions of experts and present case law regarding these matters are in the thesis also confronted. The thesis consists of three main chapters, which are subdivided into some subchapters and sections. The content of this three chapters is the general delimitation of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> the excursion {{into the history of}} <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> and the procedural regulation of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> proceedings.

40|$|Within law {{and legal}} {{scholarship}} {{there are different}} models of legal personality and <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> The most well known of these emphasises individual rationality, and is distilled into the medico-legal concept of ‘mental capacity’. In connection with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{a new approach to}} legal personality is being developed, emphasising relationships of support and recognition of universal <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> Recent scholarship on both ‘mental capacity’ and CRPD approaches to <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> has drawn from feminist writings on relational autonomy. In this paper, I use this scholarship on relational autonomy to explore the differences between these approaches to <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> I argue that the approach connected with the CRPD offers a refreshing take on the importance of relationships of support in exercising <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, despite their pronounced differences, especially in relation to the legitimacy of coercion, there are remarkable similarities in the underlying challenges for each approach: the extent to which others can ‘know’ our authentic and autonomous selves, and the inextricable relationships of power that all forms of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> are embedded within...|$|R
40|$|Does <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> {{matter in}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) ? The {{conventional}} wisdom is that the “right perseveres over might ” under the WTO’s more legalistic dispute settlement system. Yet, others stress that members can only {{take advantage of the}} rule of law if they have the resources to protect their rights through litigation. Despite all the interest in this topic, there is virtually no empirical evidence about how <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> affects patterns of litigation and import protection. Using an original survey of WTO delegations, we construct a novel index of <b>legal</b> <b>capacity,</b> and include this in a study of 1321 antidumping (AD) investigations between 1995 and 2005 by 17 WTO Members against firms located in 33 countries. We hypothesize that Members with more <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> are more likely to challenge AD suits brought against them at the WTO, and less likely to be named in AD petitions in the first place. The results strongly bear out our expectations; <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> matters. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) {{is being}} used to argue for wider {{recognition}} of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of people with mental disabilities. This raises a question about the implications of the Convention for attributions of criminal responsibility. The present paper works towards an answer by analysing the relationship between <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> in relation to personal decisions and criminal acts. Its central argument is that because moral and political considerations play an essential role in setting the relevant standards, <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> in the context of personal decisions and criminal acts should not be thought of as {{two sides of the same}} coin. The implications of particular moral or political norms are likely to be different in these two legal contexts, and this may justify asymmetries in the relevant standards for <b>legal</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, the analysis highlights a fundamental question about how much weight moral or political considerations should be given in setting these standards, and this is used to frame a challenge to those calling for significantly wider recognition of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of people with mental disabilities on the basis of the Convention...|$|R
40|$|This study's main {{objective}} is to analyze certain effects produced by the changes of the Labor Code and by the entry into force of the current Romanian Civil Code. These effects refer {{to one of the}} fundamental conditions for the valid conclusion of the individual employment contract, that is, to the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of employers and employees. Thus, a complete analysis of legal regulations and of the correlations between different provisions on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of parties to the individual employment contract is required to identify the existing noncompliance and to propose solutions. The research demonstrated that the current regulatory framework governing the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of the parties to an individual employment contract does not entirely correspond to the social reality. Therefore, only the employer benefits from a relatively comprehensive statutory regulation on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> to conclude an individual employment contract. The employee, however, does not benefit from the same attention from legislature. Considering the above, the study represents a significant scientific contribution, whose value lies in the proposed changes to modify legislature, so that the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of job holders would benefit from fair regulation, in accordance with the principle of legal protection of employee rights...|$|R

40|$|This chapter, a {{contribution}} to a book on <b>International</b> <b>Legal</b> Positivism in a Post-Modern World, gauges the potential for mutually enriching interactions between <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism and legal realism. It first describes the encounter between legal positivism and legal realism in the U. S. legal academy and then proceeds to discuss {{the rise of a}} new <b>legal</b> realism in <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> theory. In a concluding section, the chapter assesses the compatibilities and tensions between the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> realism and the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism. With its forthright embrace of the inescapability of uncertainty in law, the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism adopts a sceptical position very similar to legal realism. However, this chapter contends, the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism still requires a realist supplement in order to provide a fuller understanding {{of the way in which}} legal norms interact with non-legal factors and to help us describe, predict and analyse the behaviour of actors in international affairs. At the same time, new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> realists can learn from the sceptical attitude towards sources of law that new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivists have developed. The two movements can be symbiotic if brought into closer dialogue. Nonetheless, this chapter concludes with a dose of pessimism about the capacity of any of the currently available theories of international law to fully assimilate the complexities of both postmodern theory and postmodern global society into a comprehensive theory of international law in the postmodern world...|$|R

This articles argues that the common thread in making decisions on whether to treat a non-state actor as an <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> person {{is one of the}} function that the actor is playing in relation to other international actors. Gone is the traditional notion that only states are <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> persons, and it is now well accepted that international organizations are also persons.

This article undertakes a survey of practice regarding these actors and the practice shows that they are sometimes considered <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> persons and sometimes not. While it is tempting to demand that they enjoy consistent, objective status, practice does not support this outcome.
