Several {{dedicated}} organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers.

This superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1K). Since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the <b>key</b> <b>ingredient</b> in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E

40|$|There are {{varieties}} in {{the format}} an action learning. (AL) program {{is organized and}} their learning objectives were quite murky. However, according to Reg Revans, AL {{should be able to}} help the participants to learn critical self reflection which is also an important capability for a manager to lead change in their own organization. The researcher had the opportunity of organizing two AL programs for high potential management staff of two manufacturing companies in China. In order to achieve AL’s learning objective, these two programs were designed around the 5 <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> of AL discovered from the literature review. These 5 <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> were – emerging programmed knowledge; real problem; participants implement their own proposed actions; questioning insight with each other; and take improved action. As the target participants of each AL program were high potential Chinese management staff of the same company and were acquainted with each other, it was alleged that these 4 contextual factors – (1) the program arranged in-house in a (2) Chinese cultural context for (3) high potential management staff who were (4) acquainted with each other, could {{have an impact on the}} 5 <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> of AL. Literature mentioned little on ways these 4 contextual factors could impact on AL programs. In order to understand the way the 5 <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> could create impacts on the AL process, the methodology of action research (AR) was adopted. The AL program in Cycle 1 was a failure as some of the contextual factors had hindered the effective functioning of several <b>key</b> AL <b>ingredients.</b> Armed 4 with the experience, another AL program was organized. It was found that one of the team had enabled the members to practice critical self reflections but another team still failed to do that. This research seems to point out the possibility of achieving the learning objective of AL – critical self reflection when the 5 <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> were functioning effectively. However, the 4 contextual factors could enable the personality of the participants to become a roadblock for the effective functioning of the 5 <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> and rendered the AL program to become ineffective...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{control of}} {{traditional}} Chinese medicines (TCMs) used clinically {{is becoming a}} challenge and has limited the development of TCM due to the high variability in concentration levels of active ingredients and markers {{as well as the}} lack of well-established criteria. Using Shengmai injection, which is a well-established TCM, as an example, we developed an integrated profiling approach that simultaneously captures the entire spectrum of ingredients and quantitatively determines the levels of seven <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> in the TCM product. A multivariate statistical model was constructed to establish a “seven-marker-” based quality standard that qualified the majority of samples in this study. This newly developed strategy showed that a panel of <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> or markers in the TCM product were relatively consistent within a statistically acceptable range. Therefore, this metabolomics-based approach will complement the current quality control standard using the concentration of several <b>key</b> <b>ingredients</b> or their total content and help improve the consistency and clinic efficacy of TCM products...|$|R

Strong convergence across parents and providers suggested core processes defined by family-centered, strengths-based, emotionally supportive, and comprehensive approaches; essential services including family case management, 24 -hour crisis services, access to flexible funds, liaison and advocacy, and mediators reflecting parent-provider trust and communication/cooperation, provider-provider trust, adoption of strengths-based approaches, development of appropriate treatment plans, parent engagement, and parent self-esteem/self-efficacy. A model of the intervention is presented, and results are discussed with respect to research and policy implications...|$|R
