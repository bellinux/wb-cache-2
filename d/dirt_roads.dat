5|$|By 1870, the District's {{population}} had grown 75% {{from the previous}} census to nearly 132,000 residents. Despite the city's growth, Washington still had <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> and lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider such a proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Horatio Nelson Jackson {{became the}} first {{documented}} person to drive an automobile from San Francisco to New York using only a connection of <b>dirt</b> <b>roads,</b> cow paths, and railroad beds.

5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of roads are present near it. The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by <b>dirt</b> <b>roads.</b> The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools may be used as breeding grounds for mosquitos.|$|E

50|$|County Road 276A is a suffixed {{alternate}} of CR 276, specifically Clayton Road, {{which is}} a local <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> that begins west of this route at State Road 79. CR 276A begins at SR 277 in Brock Crossroads briefly running southeast, then curves to the northeast {{for most of its}} length. After the intersection with a north-south <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> named Hard Labor Road, it curves further north only to turn straight east at the intersection of an east-west <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> named Cheverie Circle. Past a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> named Larkin Drive, County Road 276A ends at Piney Grove Road where CR 276 turns from southbound to eastbound.|$|R

5|$|There are {{no state}} roads and {{virtually}} no township {{roads in the}} watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently virtually no such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer.|$|E
5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Georgia State Route 279 {{was also}} flooded over {{with more than}} one foot (300mm) of water. The Lamar County Emergency Management Director {{reported}} that several <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> in the county were flooded and some were washed out. De Kalb County had many of its streams and creeks surpass flood stage, causing minor damage to businesses and homes. Spalding County also reported 15roads with extensive flooding damage. Fourteen mobile homes in Clayton County were damaged beyond repair by the flooding; 52residents were evacuated. In Riverdale, several homes were flooded, although damage was generally limited to the basements of the homes. In Fayette County, the historic Starrs Mill was inundated, and water rose to the bridge level on McDonough Road. There was also a dam breach on Lake Fowler, causing $300,000dollars (2005USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of <b>dirt</b> <b>roads,</b> bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Moses {{also made}} {{improvements}} to the park itself, building new walkways, paving <b>dirt</b> <b>roads,</b> creating playgrounds, and installing lights. Baseball, soccer, and cricket fields were added in 1938. The Van Cortlandt Stadium was added in 1939 {{on the site of}} a former swamp, and a pool followed in 1970. Moses also landscaped the areas near the Woodlawn and 242nd Street subway stations to attract park visitors from other neighborhoods. During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Moses took aggressive approach to preserving the park's quality. For instance, six mothers were issued court summonses in 1942 after letting their children dig in the park, and two airplane pilots were fined in 1947 for unauthorized airplane landings.|$|E
5|$|NY421 {{begins at}} a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects to a pair of <b>dirt</b> <b>roads,</b> one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E

5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} K-383 {{southwest}} of Almena {{was part of}} the Rock Island Highway, an auto trail that paralleled the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad northeast from Colby to Norton and then east along the northern tier of the state to St. Joseph, Missouri. When the U.S. Highway System was laid out in 1926, the Rock Island Highway, which had become integrated into the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway, was designated US-36. The portion of K-383 north of the US-36 split was K-22. By 1927, all of the highway along the K-383 corridor followed section lines, with a great number of right-angle turns, except for a small section south of Almena. US-36 and K-22 were graded throughout Norton County but were unimproved <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> in Decatur, Phillips, and Sheridan counties.|$|E
5|$|Pindus National Park is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} least visited and least known national parks in Europe and it is not signposted from the main roads of the region. The area offers opportunities for hiking with its <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> being in good condition except in winter. The park can be best accessed from north, from the village of Perivoli, while there is also a track from the west side, near Milia. A climbing resort lies near Mavrovouni peak, at a height of , which is an ideal base for excursions to the park's area. According to the local legislation, the collection of any kind of organism is not allowed, while camping and staying in the park's core after the setting of the sun is prohibited. Additional restrictions include the lighting of fires, while activities such as kayaking and rafting need a special clearance from the local forestry.|$|E

5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled {{through the maze}} of gravel and <b>dirt</b> <b>roads,</b> paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied the use of the port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent or fish. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or <b>dirt</b> <b>roads.</b> Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were <b>dirt</b> <b>roads.</b> Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E

5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E
